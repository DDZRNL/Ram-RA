Engineers perform tests on samples, get field reports, and include a safety factor based on criticality.  Then, when the schedule dictates, the component is inspected and a binary decision is made: Back in service?  Or retooled/scrapped?  Unfortunately, this approach throws away much of the useful information that can be gathered from non-destructive evaluation.  When a component is inspected, a detailed picture of the current health of the component is generated.  However, the engineer would have to characterize and integrate the flaw data into the CAD model of the component for this information to be useful for predictive modeling.  This is a time-consuming process, especially considering the sheer number of aircraft components inspected each year.  Cybernet Systems is uniquely positioned to solve this problem, possessing the multi-disciplinary experience necessary to do so.We propose to leverage our experience with Sikorsky's inspection process, as well as our work in the fields of motion tracking and position/orientation determination for augmented reality, to design and build a system that is able to determine component orientation, track sensor head position/orientation, quantify sensor data, and update the component CAD model to represent the results of the non-destructive evaluation","The proposed system would be directly applicable to current NASA efforts to predict the remaining life of aircraft components and analyze age-related damage.The system is also useful for analysis of non-aircraft components.  Examples include evaluation of the shuttle access tower systems and transport vehicles such as the Crawler-Transporter.  The system could also be modified for use in characterization and tracking of flaws in non-composite components (metals, ceramics, and rubbers for example).  For example, magnetic particle inspection is a common inspection for ferrous metal components.  The proposed system could be combined with a camera ""sensor"" to record and characterize the flaws present on components inspected using magnetic particle.Future work could also supplement the system to perform long-term analysis of trends in flaw data.","Military UsesThe U.S. Navy and Air Force have a combined air fleet of nearly 10,000 aircraft.  Much like NASA, the Navy and Air Force would benefit greatly from the ability to characterize, represent, and track flaw data in aircraft components.  Modifying the system and providing units enough to service all of those aircraft will see us well through a Phase III.  In addition, the military is involved with areas to which the system could be modified for use.  Examples include ship component inspection as well as any other area in which NDE is used.Commercial UsesIn the commercial sector, the initial commercialization plan is simply to sell aerospace companies and airlines on the system.  The concept will have been shown to work for NASA and military fleets, and the same system could benefit any other company which routinely performs inspection and service on field components.In addition, it would see use in quality assurance for new components.  In particular, companies such as Sikorsky have expressed a need for a system which enables them to track manufacturing flaws over time.  This would then enable them to pinpoint and correct problems in their manufacturing processes.",Airframe; Composites; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Structural Modeling and Tools

The underlying mechan-isms of Type I Hot Corrosion and Type II Hot Corrosion are increasingly well-understood.  Nickel-based superalloys have shown strong resistance to high temperature oxidation attack and, of course, excellent high temperature strength.  Modern turbine engine designs that seek to achieve better fuel efficiency in part by increasing turbine inlet temperatures are strong candidates for nickel-based superalloy turbine disk materials.  As disk temperatures approach 700C, designers must consider the likelihood and effects of Type II corrosion.  Type II corrosion is typically characterized by localized corrosion pitting caused by melting of sulfur-containing salts.  Type II hot corrosion pits have been shown to decrease the fatigue resistance of superalloys due to initiation of fatigue cracks at hot corrosion pits.  However, the rigorous analytical models and tools needed by turbine engine designers to predict Type II corrosion pit formation and fatigue life degradation due to corrosion pits are not currently available.  Barron Associates, Inc. and its research partners propose to develop corrosion pitting and fatigue life models for nickel-based superalloys subjected to Type II hot corrosion.  The models will be commercia-lized and made available to the research and development community.","NASA aeronautics defined eight challenge problems for which the Aircraft Aging and Durability (AAD) Project can deliver specific research products to address aeronautics community needs. While the re-search challenges address different aircraft components and specific aging-related issues, the research results will improve the ability to detect, predict, and manage aging hazards.  One of these eight chal-lenge problems is ""Durability of Engine Superalloy Disks"".  The research focus is the durability of new disk alloys at higher operating temperatures to enable improved engine efficiency.  To improve durability of these new superalloy disks, the issues of microstructural instability, hot corrosion, and fatigue durability must be addressed.  Goals include establishment of a long-term database and derivation of analytic models to predict the degradation of new alloys due to microstructural instability and corrosion.  The proposed research effort directly addresses these important challenges.",The initial Non-NASA commercialization strategy is straightforward and significantly bolstered by the inclusion of Southwest Research Institute on the team from the outset of the research.  The commercial product output of the proposed SBIR effort will be DARWIN-HC --- an extension of SwRI's existing FAA-sponsored software tool that predicts the probability of fracture of titanium aircraft turbine rotor disks to model and predict the effects of Type II hot corrosion.  DARWIN is rapidly gaining acceptance in the aerospace community and DARWIN-HC will further expand the applicability and reach of the DARWIN product line.,Aircraft Engines; Metallics

The results of modeling will be used to optimize instrument design, parameters such as frequency of operation, individual channels polarizations, scene sampling strategy (scanning mode), antennae beamwidths, and potential use of auxiliary data will be evaluated. Phase I objective is a preliminary three dimensional model of the instrument.","NASA aircrafts, especially turboprops and helicopters can use the proposed sensor in everyday operations. NASA research aircrafts could potentially use the instrument for in-flight icing research or for general applications where flights in or close to icing zones are required. The technology proposed here will improve aerospace system safety, efficiency, an could lead to more effective use of national airspace.","When available on market and deployed in regular operation, an instrument of the MRAS class will have applications in general aviation, military operation, search and rescue operations. It could become a part of such weather reporting systems such as ACARS (Aircraft Communication and Report System), or private TAMDAR (Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting). It is conceivable that the private weather data provider, such as WxWorkx (www.wxworx.com) currently providing mobile data service to public through the XM radio channel will be interested to include the local, more detailed information about icing condition into their data service. Corporate aircrafts and individually owned small engine aircrafts, helicopters operating for oil rigs, military and Coast Guard helicopters are potential customers for such devices too.

The vortices produced when atmospheric waves ""break"" can have diameters of 900-1200ft and tangential velocities of 70-85 ft/sec. CAT is dangerous for commercial and military aviation, most recently demonstrated by Continental flight 128 from Rio de Janeiro to Houston on August 3, 2009, which encountered severe turbulence and made an emergency landing with 37 injured passengers, nine hospitalized. Many other incidents attributed to turbulence have caused injuries or deaths to passengers and crew. Another recently-highlighted hazard is the inadequacy of current airspeed sensors on commercial aircraft. Federal investigators have reported that on at least a dozen recent flights by U.S. jetliners, malfunctioning equipment made it impossible for pilots to know how fast they were flying.  Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes the Molecular Air Data and Clear Air Turbulence (MADCAT) system which will be capable of providing not only a look-ahead capability to predict clear air turbulence but also a full air data solution (airspeed, angle of attack, angle of sideslip, pressure and temperature). The technology has already demonstrated, in-flight, the ability to measure airspeed, angle of attack and angle of sideslip. In addition, ground units based upon the same core technology have demonstrated range-resolved wind, temperature and density measurements from the ground to altitudes of 18km. This proposal will focus on combining the two capabilities into a practical solution.  MAC's direct-detection UV LIDAR technology uses molecular backscatter and so does not require aerosols, as required by many competing approaches.","MADCAT will allow NASA aircraft the benefit of having a clear-air turbulence warning system and an optical air data system in one package, suitable for general use by NASA aircraft as well as for flight research concerning clear-air turbulence and scientific studies of atmospheric processes.  Ground-based uses include measuring wind speed and direction simultaneously with air temperature and density while also detecting and characterizing shear and turbulence.  Potential uses include wind shear detection for space launches, wake vortices detection and characterization for airports, and climate change studies.","Clear-air turbulence represents a significant safety hazard as well as passenger-comfort issue for the commercial airline industry.  The proposed MADCAT system has application not only for turbulence-warning and gust alleviation, but also as an air data solution that eliminates many problems with current pitot air data and other speed-sensing technologies.  This capability also makes MADCAT extremely attractive for military aircraft, including fixed and rotary wing, high altitude and high dynamic, manned and unmanned, and even high-altitude airships.  Information on winds near aircraft, if downlinked and compiled, will also be of significant value to forecasters, especially from aircraft flying over areas (oceans, etc.) where balloon radiosonde releases and other wind measurements are sparse or non-existent.  NOAA and NASA identify the lack of more comprehensive wind-profile data as a major unmet data need for improving the accuracy of weather forecasts.  Inadequate atmospheric data (wind speed, direction, temperature and density) also has a significant negative impact along the entire wind energy value chain, including site assessment, operational farms, turbine control, and grid integration. Turbulence and shear are primary contributing factors to higher than expected turbine maintenance and repair costs.  Finally, military applications for artillery and munitions delivery, precision airdrop, and aircraft take-off/landing on ships can benefit from MADCAT technology.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Optical"

Recently, the authors have developed systems that autonomously execute recovery strategies to rapidly restore nominal flight without overcommanding the aircraft, exacerbating the upset condition, or endangering nearby structures and vehicles. The opportunity exists to extend the automated recovery system (ARS) by incorporating it in manned aircraft in a way that collaborates with the crew about corrective actions and utilizes crew expertise in real-time to provide the most effective recovery.  The proposed research will develop and demonstrate such crew-specific extensions to show the benefits of a collaborative human/automated (H/A) upset recovery system. Metrics will be defined to evaluate mixed H/A team performance both in terms of performance and crew experience, and a variety of levels of autonomy will be implemented including manned recovery, ARS advisory mode, human oversight of ARS autonomy, and fully autonomous mode.  A key goal is to demonstrate that a mixed H/A mode will provide significant advantages over what can be achieved by either the pilot or the fully autonomous system alone. Toward this end, human-in-the-loop hardware demonstrations will be used to demonstrate the benefits of joint H/A approaches and to set the stage for Phase II flight demonstrations.","One of the high-level goals of the Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) is to improve aircraft safety for current and future aircraft. The technology directly addresses this first goal.  Joint H/A upset recovery research sits as the junction of two integral components of the AvSP: Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control research and Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck research. The former seeks to ""arrive at a set of validated multidisciplinary integrated aircraft control design tools and techniques for enabling safe flight in the presence of adverse conditions (e.g. faults, damage and/or upsets)."" The latter seeks to ""establishes transformative integrated display concepts, decision support functions, on-board/off-board information management, high-integrity external hazard detection, and effective mechanisms for human-automation interaction that enable safer flight deck systems for NextGen."" The current research seeks to not only transform state-of-the-art automated methods for upset recovery into a powerful decision aid system but to extend human-automation interaction to create a system capable of exploiting H/A collaboration.","The immediate non-NASA application is algorithms, software, and tools that enable the use of joint H/A upset recovery systems, as well as generic joint cognitive systems, in the civil aviation industry.

Individual components are extensively evaluated and are often redundantly deployed, so catastrophic failures predominately arise not through component failure but as the result of a sequence of failures that cascade because of some unforeseen combination of off-nominal conditions. Such sequences may involve human operators, control algorithms, software implementations, physical structures, and other components of the system. Analyzing the potential for these failure scenarios is extremely difficult, not only because of the inherent complexity of such systems but also because of the multidisciplinary nature of the system itself. While many development tools exist to conduct deep analyses within individual disciplines, there is a lack of tools available for deep analysis of complex multidisciplinary designs. The goal of this proposed research project is thus to create a new class of development tool that allows designers to specify, design, integrate, and conduct analyses of complex systems across disciplinary boundaries. Through this new tool, the dynamic interactions between system components in the presence of off-nominal conditions can be explored to uncover systemic vulnerabilities, precursory conditions, and likely outcomes.","There are multiple potential commercial NASA applications that can stem from the proposed research and development effort. The proposed Integrated Design and Analysis Environment has direct application in the design and analysis of flight deck systems and of distributed systems that intersect with flight deck operations. Though the tool is motivated by the particular combination of challenges encountered in flight deck design (complex, safety critical, multidisciplinary, mixed human and automation systems, etc.), this same combination arises in many other contexts related to aircraft and spacecraft operations.","There are multiple potential non-NASA commercial applications of the proposed design and analysis tool. As the tool is intended to support design of commercial flight deck systems, the closest non-NASA commercial application will be in the design of military flight deck systems and related components. Other military applications include UAV, UGV, and UUV operator interfaces.

Traditionally, to suppress adverse ASE interaction, notch and/or roll off filters have been utilized in the flight control system architecture to effectively ""cancel out"" problematic frequencies that will potentially excite the ASE dynamics. This solution has pitfalls; rigid body performance is degraded due to the resulting phase penalty and the filter is not robust to unexpected or un-modeled off nominal behavior. STI proposes an adaptive approach, which is leveraged by the adaptive Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) algorithm for high frequency disturbance rejection. This adaptive approach is robust to system variations, minimizes lower frequency phase penalty, and has been utilized for similar dynamic systems with supporting experimental validation. Development of the adaptive HHC algorithm for ASE suppression will be accomplished utilizing a high fidelity model of a representative high-speed fighter aircraft that is capable of parameter variation consisting of flight condition changes, configuration changes (stores configurations) as well as damage and failures. Validation of the proposed approach will be accomplished via simulation with representative parameter variations. Validation via real-time piloted simulations is proposed for future studies.","The developed adaptive ASE suppression algorithms and subsequent real-time piloted validation simulation toolset will greatly benefit NASA flight test programs by providing a solution to reject adverse ASE dynamics that is 1) robust to off nominal system variations including flight condition changes, configuration changes as well as damage and failure scenarios and 2) minimizes the adverse impact on rigid body performance (i.e., flying qualities, handling qualities and ride quality). Potential NASA benefits other than aeronautics programs include adverse dynamic suppression in both manned and unmanned rocket booster and spacecraft systems. Safe flight in the presence of adverse conditions is further ensured by the comprehensive validation approach that includes real-time piloted simulations.","Other government flight test centers and commercial aircraft manufacturers, both manned and unmanned, will benefit from the adaptive ASE algorithms and subsequent real-time simulated flight test verification by providing a validated solution that is robust to off-nominal system variation and minimizes adverse impact on rigid body performance. Other aerospace applications include rotorcraft systems, rocket booster and spacecraft structural mode detection and control. Outside of aerospace, other areas of application include automotive (for engine and vehicle dynamic monitoring and control), industrial manufacturing (for rejection of machine noise and structural vibrations), infrastructure (for monitoring buildings, bridges, etc., for changes in stiffness and damping and subsequent active suppression of adverse dynamics), and alternative energy (aeroservoelastic suppression for wind turbine technology).","Controls-Structures Interaction (CSI); Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems; Simulation Modeling Environment; Structural Modeling and Tools"

The life monitor will process power data available on the aircraft to calculate the accumulating in-flight power loading which the engine experiences.  This power loading reduces the available life of the engine.  Under emergency in-flight conditions and/or foreign object damage, engine loads and temperatures can increase rapidly as a sign of decreased remaining engine life and reliability.  The life monitor will calculate and display in the aircraft the remaining time for safe operation under these conditions. At present, fatigue life analysis techniques are primarily used as design-analysis tools  These techniques have not been adapted for in-service use with an aircraft to date.  The reliable use of aircraft engines can be extended with more accurate knowledge of their remaining component and system fatigue lives.  Early identification of engines in need of repair due to heavy use will improve their in-service safety. By developing a life monitoring system which can be associated with a specific engine system and have as input the loads and load durations of that system, the reliability and safety of that system can be improved.","NASA GRC is currently pursuing an overall agency-wide goal to increase flight safety of commercial aircraft as part of the NASA Aviation Safety Program. This Program intends to conduct research to improve the intrinsic safety attributes of future aircraft using new and innovative airborne detection methods. In pursuit of this goal, this proposal applies analytical life prediction codes currently used to predict the service life of aircraft engines in the design stage to in-flight on-board monitoring systems that can track the fatigue life usage of specific aircraft. This fatigue-life use knowledge will help to eliminate a safety-related technology void in the maintenance needs of specific aircraft engine systems.  By adding airborne detection and monitoring of in-flight fatigue use, NASA and industry can cooperatively achieve increased flight safety goals through a better understanding of the service life of aircraft engines.  This effort will provide industry a mechanism to improve the safety, reliability and maintainability of commercial aircraft.",Vigilance for safety must continue in order to meet the projected increases in air traffic capacity and realize the new capabilities envisioned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System.  Present engine monitoring systems consist of vibration sensors that measure damage to the engine after it has occurred.  This monitoring system measures a significant cause of this damage as it progresses to provide an early warning of impending damage.  The unsafe operation and high costs associated with surprise failures and unscheduled emergency maintenance procedures can be reduced substantially with the use of an in-service life monitor.  The accurate prediction of remaining service life will diminish the need for unscheduled maintenance procedures for aircraft with heavy service loads by calling for more frequent servicing of these engine systems. One potential application for this technology is in the U. S. Army Vehicle Technology Directorate for a fleet of helicopters.  The U. S. Air Force is another potential end user.

The techniques apply a wide array of adaptations from simple gain scheduling to on-line learning algorithms. While the ready availability of low cost, reduced scale UAV systems have allowed for many successful flight test demonstrations, applications to piloted aircraft have been more limited. Flight evaluations of various adaptive control applications conducted by NASA and others have shown great promise. In some cases; however, unfavorable pilot-vehicle interactions including pilot-induced oscillations have occurred. Susceptibility to such interactions is more likely when the pilot interacts with a highly nonlinear vehicle that may no longer have predictable response characteristics. To alleviate these unfavorable interactions, Systems Technology, Inc. (STI) proposes the Smart Adaptive Flight Effective Cue or SAFE-Cue that will provide cues to the pilot via an active control inceptor with corresponding command path gain adjustments. The SAFE-Cue will alert the pilot that the adaptive control system is active and provide guidance through a force feedback cue and command attenuation via a command path gain adjustment as a means to retain pilot-vehicle system stability and performance.","The SAFE-Cue approach directly addresses a concern of the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control topic under NASA's Aviation Safety Program to provide a means to prevent pilot-vehicle system loss of control in the presence of an active adaptive control system. A successful Phase 2 program will produce a prototype SAFE-Cue system that will alert the pilot regarding flight control system adaptations due to failures and/or damage and constrain the pilot via active inceptor force feedback and command path gain attenuation as a means to mitigate loss-of-control scenarios. SAFE-Cue will detect deviations in the adaptive aircraft when compared to the nominal aircraft, and when these deviations become too large, the active cueing via control inceptor force feedback and the active command path gain attenuation will be engaged. The interest in preventing loss-of-control is based on a very real problem that has caused loss of life and property throughout the history of flight.","The SAFE-Cue will be targeted for use in modern commercial transports where it can add a significantly increased level of safety at a reasonable incremental cost. Recent FAA forecasts for the year 2011 indicate that the US commercial and regional airliner fleet will be more than 11,000 aircraft. A small market penetration of the US market alone would be enough to recover development and marketing costs. STI will leverage the ongoing interest of several airframe manufacturers in its Smart-Cue and Smart-Gain concepts as a means to introduce this new, more widely focused approach to preventing loss of control. The worldwide commercial airliner market will provide a significant follow on market. Target military programs where SAFE-Cue would have the potential to reduce accidents in the more extreme military operational environment include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and CH-53K heavy lift cargo helicopter, both of which feature active pilot control inceptors.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Highly-Reconfigurable; Pilot Support Systems; Simulation Modeling Environment"

Initially developed as a hypervelocity impact location system, the baseline technology lends itself to simple adaptation for lightning location.  It uses Time-Of-Arrival (TOA) measurements of the charge wave front imparted on a structure to triangulate the location of lightning attachment.  Additional capability can be added to the triggering circuitry that will characterize the lightning strike in order to increase situational awareness for flight crews and provide maintenance crews with information vital to determine the health of an aircraft.  This is particularly important for new airframes manufactured from composite materials that have not be fully characterized over the full lifetime of the aircraft.","The primary NASA applications for the STROM system include monitoring aircraft and spacecraft for lightning strikes.

However, inaccurate or false readings from these same sensors/instruments can lead to improper decision-making resulting in serious if not fatal consequences. This proposal offers a research and development (R&D) effort to demonstrate the feasibility of using advanced data analysis techniques to identify failures in pitot tubes resulting from blockage, icing, or moisture.  These data analysis techniques will use existing electrical signals of pitot tube sensors that result from measured processes during in-flight conditions and/or induced signals in pre-flight conditions to detect anomalies in the sensor readings.The proposed method for detecting pitot tube anomalies is referred to as the ""noise analysis"" technique.  This technique has been validated and is currently and routinely used by the proposing firm and others for detecting sensing line blockages of pressure transmitters in nuclear power generating stations; a very similar issue to the concern associated with pitot tube blockages.  Typically, the output of a sensor that is measuring a process (e.g. air flow) contains two components: a static (DC) component that represents the process parameter, and a dynamic (AC) component.  Through the use of the dynamic component of existing electrical signals, the dynamic response of the sensor can be measured in the frequency domain.  As the sensor becomes blocked or degraded, changes to the dynamic response can be observed.  Specific examples of this are given in the proposal. Another consideration in this proposal is diagnosing pitot tube sensor anomalies in pre-flight conditions.  In pre-flight checks, the pitot tubes reside in mild conditions and will not be measuring a turbulent process.  As such, a technique is proposed to induce this type of noise on the sensor input and analyze the resultant output using the same noise analysis technique.","The intended end product of a Phase I and Phase II project is the development of hardware and software that can be used for the detection of pitot tube anomalies resulting from blockages either during in-flight or pre-flight conditions.  The successful completion and commercialization of this project has tremendous potential for responding to current and long-term needs of NASA in the area of instrumentation failure detection, condition monitoring, and autonomous detection of anomalies for airplanes and aerospace vehicles.  It would directly serve NASA's research initiatives within the Aviation Safety Program.  Adapting this technology to the aviation industry, which has never been done, could prove to solve a long-standing safety concern associated with aircraft operation.","The intended end product of a Phase I and Phase II project is the development of hardware and software that can be used for the detection of pitot tube anomalies resulting from blockages either during in-flight or pre-flight conditions.  This end product, which would be commercialized by Analysis and Measurement Services in a Phase III effort, could have a large potential use in the commercial, private, and military aircraft industries.  For example, the U.S. Air Force could benefit from a commercially available product for this purpose as evidenced by the B-2 bomber crash at Andersen Air Force base in early 2008 due to water contamination in pitot tubes.  This crash resulted in an estimated $1.4 billion in property damage.

Our approach uses formalized attributes that are available as selectable and enforceable properties necessary for diagnosis based on principles of model based engineering (MBE).  Using this information, two strategies are proposed.  The first is to use the concept of perfect detectors as executable assertions to verify at run-time correct operating envelope behavior.  This information is used to check for correct behavior status or identify entry into a chain of events that could have failure impact. The proposed Phase I effort uses a combination of tool support to analyze the system, identify the properties to be checked, and the failure path information needed by the in-flight diagnosis service.

Ridgetop's concept is a self-contained, embedded prognostic reasoner with a passive connection to common avionic data busses. By monitoring actuator health in real time and providing early warning of incipient fault conditions, the proposed MAPR would enable condition based maintenance (CBM) of critical avionic flight control systems and support safer, more reliable next generation air transportation. The novel approach will effectively decouple the passive prognostic reasoner from the target flight control system, or actuator, and will support multiple avionic data bus interfaces, such as MIL-STD-1553, easing adoption, validation, integration, and support. Potentially, a single MAPR could monitor multiple flight control systems, reducing overall sensor costs. Furthermore, an embedded MAPR implementation with field upgradeable firmware would support evolving interface standards and prognostic health measurement capabilities. Finally, the proposed MAPR architecture is ideally suited for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, which dramatically accelerates technology readiness and commercial introduction.","Electromechanical Actuator (EMA) systems can reduce weight in airborne vehicles.

(AS&M) is proposing to develop and validate a process that can extend the fatigue life of and potentially self-heal existing fatigue damage of aluminum and titanium alloys.  The genesis of the proposed process is research conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center that developed a low melting point coating that flows into the crack when activated.  The fatigue crack growth was postulated to be reduced due to a combination of adherence of the healing material to the crack surfaces (crack bridging) and filling of the crack with the healing material (crack closure).  This process was demonstrated to reduce the crack growth rate (i.e., extend fatigue life) by a factor of 2 to 4x in inert environments.  The proposed Phase I program will deliver experimental evidence of a self-healing material system and a preliminary design for an integrated healing activation system.  The original research will be extended to operational environments and loading conditions with the goal of developing a system by the end of Phase II that will be viable for operational testing.","The proposed concept directly addresses several of NASA's Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) Project milestones including: (1) reducing fatigue crack growth rates by a factor of at least two in aluminum and titanium alloys used in aerospace structures, (2) an integrated self-healing system for in-situ mitigation of structural damage, and (3) mitigation of damage in areas where access is limited.  In addition, the concept also has direct applications of fatigue damage in critical metallic structures in space vehicles.  By implementing this technology during manufacturing, it is thought that the total fatigue life of structure can be significantly extended.  The process could also be used in combination with embedded sensors and activated when damage is detected or without sensors at a predefined lifetime to extend operational life.  The activation can be performed remotely or automatically for vehicles in long duration space flights.",The proposed concept has direct military and commercial aerospace applications as well as applications for any fatigue critical aluminum or titanium structure.  An example of a military aerospace application would be the center wing box of the USAF C-130 transport aircraft.  This structure has experienced fatigue cracking problems and repair requires extensive rework and down time.  The proposed concept could be deployed as a spray and activated on pre-existing fatigue cracks without having to perform a complete teardown.   This technology could also be incorporated into the manufacturing process of commercial aircraft as a life extension tool.  The self-healing coating would be applied to fatigue critical components and the proposed miniature heating system activated either when damage is detected or at a specified usage lifetime to increase the operational lifetime.,Airframe; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Metallics

As modern systems become more reliant on software intensive solutions to perform mission and safety critical functions, the effort that is required for system certification experiences a corresponding increase.  These systems are expected to perform correctly and safely while being flexible and portable enough to go though system refresh cycles and evolvable enough to take on new system functionality throughout the system lifecycle.  .We propose a method of addressing this challenge with advanced modular safety cases to specify system safety properties and support the V&V of those properties with argument and evidence chains.

These fundamental changes have significant implications for safety and security, which, in turn, require new, more flexible techniques for the verification and validation of complex, software-intensive systems and systems of systems. To address this need, Barron Associates will develop a demonstration sense-and- avoid application, representative of the kinds of new systems that are possible in NextGen, and a safety case arguing that it is safe to operate in the NAS. The safety case will rely on run-time assurance and formal methods as evidence to support its claims. Run-time assurance continuously monitors system-level safety properties for impending violations to diagnose software faults and allows a simpler, high-criticality reversionary function to provide assurance for a more complex software function; formal methods provide strong design-time assurance of correctness for software that must operate at the highest levels of criticality. A safety-case-based approach citing these two strategies as evidence offers significant cost savings for similar or higher levels of assurance as compared to traditional, process-based approaches.","Barron Associates anticipates a number of opportunities to apply this SBIR-developed technology to NASA programs.  With NASA's ongoing efforts for the development of the NextGen airspace, and their continued progress in both manned and unmanned space exploration, there is renewed emphasis on increased levels of safety, reliability, and affordability for these new and emerging systems and concepts.  To address hardware component failures and faults, control and flight operational systems for advanced platforms will need to be intelligent, adaptable, reconfigurable, and often nondeterministic in their behavior in order to provide the required levels of safety and reliability.  Current V&V methods cannot address such complex software systems and recent studies have indicated the cost of certifying such applications would clearly be prohibitive. Therefore, along with advanced flight control systems must come advanced V&V methods.  Our proposed approach of combining design-time formal methods with run-time assurance directly addresses this need.  Finally, the proposed safety assurance technologies will enable cost-effective certification of the assuredly complex software that will be required of the air traffic control system for NextGen.","Barron Associates envisions significant near- and far-term uses for the proposed assurance technologies. For medical applications, formal methods and run-time assurance will allow more powerful, complex software to be safely and cost-effectively deployed on monitoring, imaging, and robotic devices. For unmanned systems, potential applications go beyond air vehicles to all classes of unmanned systems, including ground and underwater vehicles. The autonomy required by these poses a significant challenge to traditional verification and validation techniques; a challenge that is mitigated by the proposed approaches. Finally, the nuclear industry depends upon software for the control of its power plants and propulsion systems. Techniques that can affordably increase the level of assurance of safety-critical software will not only allow more complex software to be deployed in nuclear applications, but also go further to ensure the safety of these systems.","Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Simulation Modeling Environment"

In order to sustain high thermal loading while preheating the fuel, regeneratively cooled hot flow path components fabricated from ceramic matrix composites are being considered.

These materials exhibit a unique combination of low density, high thermal conductivity and outstanding strength to near 3000oF. In order to exploit the benefits of SiC/SiC composites, methods are needed for fabricating high density/high conductivity components incorporating impermeable metal tube liners. Additionally, practical methods are needed for uniformly distributing coolant to the array of tubes via manifolding on the backside of the hot flow path surface. The objective of this Phase I program is to demonstrate a promising method for producing a high thermal efficiency SiC/SiC composite heat exchanger with low residual porosity and high interlaminar strength without having to resort to exotic and costly 3D fiber preforms. A functional actively cooled composite panel test article incorporating refractory metal tubes will be designed, fabricated and delivered to NASA for burner rig and/or thermal evaluation.","Hot structures fabricated from ceramic composite materials are an attractive design option for specialized components of future aerospace vehicles and propulsion systems to increase performance, reduce weight and increase durability. Current fabric-laminated ceramic composite materials and components suffer from insufficient interlaminar strength and are thus vulnerable to delamination when subjected to high velocity impact damage and exacerbated by severe thru-thickness thermal gradients. The ability to improve the interlaminar properties over current materials without having to resort to the use of costly, exotic multidirectional fiber preforms will better enable the utilization of these materials for certain thermal-structural applications critical to the US military and aerospace industrial complex.

Accurate predictions of CMC life require accurate predictions of oxidation behavior, which require accurate values of the material properties that control the oxidation process.  One of these key properties is permeability.  In this effort, MR&D proposes to gather test data, then appropriately modify, correlate, and integrate a Multidirectional Composite Cylinders Assemblage (CCAMD) model with its current ABAQUS oxidation model.

This would contribute to NASA's goals in hypersonic vehicles and other advanced aircraft, for both structural and propulsion components.  Currently, CMCs are primarily niche materials not only because of cost, but also because their long-term behavior in aggressive environments is not thoroughly understood or characterized.  As such, it is quite difficult to make lifetime predictions without use of relatively large safety factors.  The proposed program would provide significant enhancement to current modeling capability, which could readily be expanded to model tortuosity (another material property which controls oxidation).","Efforts such as the one proposed here contribute to the development of more physically-realistic lifetime models, which are ultimately needed to extend the use CMCs.

However, with more accurate modeling, CMCs could be used more aggressively, for both stationary and rotating turbine components, and in more severe environmental conditions (steam, salt fog, etc.).  These materials can allow higher operating temperatures than are possible with superalloys, which can significantly decrease system weight and increase system efficiency.

Nanoparticle fillers such as CNTs have shown that they can simultaneously improve both the physical and flammability properties of the polymer nanocomposite. Our multi-scale simulations will explain the physical mechanisms behind the formation of a continuous, stable, protective char layer on the burning surface that acts as a heat shield for the virgin polymer below the layer.

In an early-stage concept, two superconducting turbine generators, mounted on each of the wing tips, are used to supply electrical power to 16 superconducting motors.  Conventional electric motors are too large and heavy to be practical for this application, and so superconducting motors are required.  These would operate at a temperature near that of liquid hydrogen, between 20 and 65 K.  In order to improve maneuverability of the aircraft, variable speed power converters would be required to throttle power to the turbofans.  The low operating temperature and the need for lightweight components that place a minimum of additional heat load on the refrigeration system opens the possibility of incorporating extremely efficient cryogenic power conversion technology.  A complete study of cryogenic power conversion equipment for use in this application is the focus of this proposal.

The temperature in orbit of Saturn and Titan is around 90 K, and those reached on Uranus, Neptune, Triton, or Pluto are all between 38 and 60 K.  The black-body equilibrium temperature in interstellar space is less than 40 K.  Currently, space missions often require heaters to bring the temperature of electronics to about 300 K.  Many of MTECH's systems and components not only perform their best in such environments, but are also capable of withstanding much wider temperature ranges.","Cryogenic power systems based on the R&D in this SBIR would find use in at least three other major markets.  The most immediate and obvious customers will be the military and defense industries.  The Navy's all-electric ship program would benefit most from this work, especially if superconducting motors and generators, which provide a cryogenic platform, are deployed.  The next-largest package to be reduced in a ship is the power control electronics.  Combining these technologies can provide a significant reduction in size and weight at greatly improved efficiency.  A second market is the industrial power/utility market.  Projects involving superconducting power transmission and distribution, including superconducting wind turbine generators, are perfect candidates for helping to commercialize this technology.  The third market is the medical industry, in particular Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI.  The technology developed in this SBIR will enhance current MRI power supplies for gradients, pulsed fields, and RF transmission.",Aircraft Engines; Cooling; Power Management and Distribution; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Superconductors and Magnetic

The concept will have the following innovative features:1. Independent, mini burning zones created by containing the flame in a cylinder downstream of each fuel injector/swirler element in a multiple fuel injector array, see figure 1.  The independent burning zones will enable fuel staging the fuel injectors (turning off fuel to selected fuel injectors) to cover the operating cycle, such that at each point of the operating cycle the combustor will have high combustion efficiency (>99%) and low NOx emissions. At high power conditions the combustion efficiency should be greater than 99.9%.2. A plain-jet hypodermic fuel injector fuel injector will be incorporated into ME-LDI that is low cost and simple to manufacture but a highly effective atomizer.  Modified plain-jet fuel injectors will be studied including an injector with a tip that has a diverging nozzle and one that has a spin chamber at the exit.  These alternative plain-jet fuel injectors will increase the surface area at the exit of the injector resulting in a thinner film for better atomization and fuel-air mixing.3. A restrictor plate upstream of each fuel injector to provide a steady flow to each fuel injector and prevent any feedback from an unsteady flame to the fuel supply","In the course of the development of the concept it is planned to use laser diagnostics to measure droplet sizes from the fuel injector, fuel distribution, air and fuel droplet velocities and turbulence levels.  This data would be made available to NASA for computer model development.  Alternatively the hardware could be supplied for measurements to be taken at NASA in a collaborative effort.",We propose that the initial application would be for small business and personal jets and regional jet aircraft gas turbine engines.

Gallimore,scott.gallimore@acentlabs.com,"11917 Ricketts Battery Drive, Bristow, VA 20136 - 2815",(571) 248-0134,,,,,2,3,"This proposal addresses the cold-start requirements of scramjet engines by developing a safe, energy-dense, and low volume hydrocarbon fuel conditioning system based on the hydrolysis reaction of water with triethylaluminum (TEA).  TEA is an organometallic liquid that reacts exothermically with water and burns readily in air when not diluted in hydrocarbon mixtures.  We propose to use the hydrolysis of nonpyrophoric dilute TEA/JP fuel mixtures in an integrated mixing/injection apparatus to heat and vaporize liquid hydrocarbon fuel to enable cold-start capability in regeneratively cooled scramjets.  In addition, the hydrolysis reaction also produces ethane gas, which serves the dual purpose of atomizing any remaining liquid by effervescence as well as producing an ethane-rich injectant that is more readily ignitable than the vaporized JP fuel.  Furthermore, since TEA is pyrophoric, any remaining TEA in the mixture could serve as an ignition aid once it comes in contact with air.  Hence, through a straightforward hydrolysis mechanism, the proposed system would preheat and vaporize the fuel, atomize any remaining liquid through effervescence, add readily ignitable ethane to the mixture, and provide a potential ignition source with any TEA leftover from the hydrolysis reaction. The proposed Phase 1 and 2 research will result in the Compact Safe Cold-Start (CS2) system which will be a key enabling technology for future operational hypersonic vehicles.","A dilute TEA-based scramjet cold start system is expected to have significant mass and volume savings compared to equivalent and more traditional scramjet cold start techniques such as silane and ethylene when compared on an equivalence ratio basis.  These mass and volume savings translate directly into additional capability and can alleviate some of the system packaging requirements of future hypersonic vehicle systems.  Safety is also enhanced over the more traditional high pressure gaseous systems by using low pressure, non-pyrophoric, liquid reactants. It is only upon mixing the dilute TEA/JP with water that heat , ethane, and pyrophoric TEA are released. In addition, the potential low Mach capability of a TEA based system helps extend the utility of scramjet engines proposed for turbine-based combined cycle hypersonic vehicles to lower Mach numbers, providing flexibility in selecting high-speed turbines capable of generating the required Mach number for scramjet takeover.  NASA is interested in these types of vehicles as potential solutions for cheaper, reusable, more effective access to space.","The key advantage of a TEA based system over currently used single-function engine start techniques is that it provides multi-faceted benefits over other cold start systems such as intense energy release, readily ignitable ethane gas, atomization of the fuel through effervescence, and pyrophoricity for ignition.  As such, it likely has utility to assist in not only the cold-start of scramjets but the re-light of turbojets with minimal modifications.  If developed for such an approach, the TEA based system would be capable of providing engine start functionality for both the turbojet and scramjet in a turbine-based combined-cycle vehicle, significantly reducing overall system complexity.  Companies such as Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne that develop both turbojets and scramjets would find such a capable and simplifying system to be of great benefit in meeting the system requirements of a combined-cycle hypersonic vehicle.  The DoD is interested in developing these types of vehicles as well as scramjet powered missile systems to gain a hypersonic strike capability to stay ahead of competing foreign entities.

The singular aspect of the CAPS approach is that extinction is measured by determining shifts in the phase angle of a modulated light beam instead of changes in the intensity of the ransmitted light caused by the presence of particulates. This aspect makes the sensor immune to either abrupt or gradual changes in the intensity of the light caused by temperature or pressure fluctuations or light source deterioration. Furthermore, the sensor rarely needs to be calibrated  i.e., its span value, a function of the optical properties of the particles themselves, remains virtually constant. This sensor does not rely on the deposition of particles on a filter and requires little maintenance. The monitor will be able to measure the size dependent particle mass concentration in the sub-micrograms per cubic meter with a sampling period of only 1 second.","The primary NASA need for this technology is in its programs to monitor particulate emissions from rocket and aircraft engines. The impact of particulate emissions from aircraft engines, which have a direct effect on radiative forcing, is magnified by the fact they are typically emitted in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere where their influence is greatest. In addition, ground-based emissions of small particulates (i.e., PM10 and PM2.5) are regulated by the EPA. As aircraft engine soot emissions continue to decrease in response to regulations concerning the emission of species related to global warming and climate change as well as ground-based PM particulate emissions, the performance of commercially available instruments will become a hindrance to the accurate determination of such emissions.",The extinction monitor developed under this program will significantly benefit the scientific community interested in characterizing the radiative propertes of ambient aerosols. The ability of one instrument to simultaneously measure particle extinction at one or more wavelengths with good time resolution and high precision will enable continuous measurements of the particle extinction that can be directly used by regional and global climate forcing models. The development of a CAPS-based extinction monitor would have the largest impact on the ambient air quality monitoring community. PM2.5 and PM10 levels must be routinely monitored as part of ambient air pollution monitoring programs and current technology is labor intensive and expensive.,Optical

In addition to high temperatures and pressures, these conditions include oxidation, corrosion, thermal shock, fatigue, fouling, and abrasive wear.  High temperature (300-1350oC) capacitive pressure sensors are of particular interest due to their inherent suitability for wireless readout schemes.

The proposed Phase I work will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of a tool which will enable the NASA customer to gain deeper insight into aerodynamic noise sources and develop improved methods for experimentally detecting them. Ultimately, this will enable improved source identification techniques and greater understanding of the physics associated with the data obtained from experimental phased array microphone arrays.  The approach taken by the proposed work to accomplish these goals is to use an unsteady simulation of nearfield unsteady flow to feed a Ffowcs Williams-Hawking solver.

A hybrid LES/RANS computational framework is proposed for prediction of noise from the engine and airframe, and interactions between airframe and propulsion systems. The basis of LES (large eddy simulation) is that the energy-bearing turbulent eddies in the dominant noise-generating region are directly captured in the simulation. Since LES must resolve the turbulent eddies it requires a grid which captures these motions; the number of grid points needed for LES is much larger than those for RANS and thus a brute-force LES of the entire noise producing region in a propulsion-airframe interaction problem is not feasible. However, the noise generation physics of these flows allows a logical assembly of a hybrid simulation tool where low-fidelity models (RANS) in one region of the flow are combined with turbulence-resolving models (LES) in other regions of the flow. Acoustic effects are another segment of propulsion-airframe interaction problem. Sound generated by various components of engine is altered by the presence of wing, fuselage, deployed flap etc. In the present proposal, alteration of sound due to the presence of airframe is added through application of Boundary Element Method (BEM) and an acoustic projection technique (FW-H surface method). To demonstrate the feasibility of using this framework, we focus on simulating flow configuration corresponding to a separate-flow nozzle of by pass ratio  5 with round fan and nozzle operating at the takeoff cycle point of with freestream Mach number of 0.28. Simulation results will be validated against experiments carried out in the Low Speed Aeroacoustics Wind Tunnel (LSAWT) at NASA Langley's Jet Noise Laboratory (JNL). The high-fidelity model developed and validated in Phase I will be extended to explore more complex engine/airframe configurations in Phase II.","The proposed hybrid LES/RANS framework is aimed to be a high fidelity simulation toolbox for physics-based aircraft noise prediction. Application of this tool will improve the understanding of noise generation and propagation mechanism in both component and system level. Such understanding is a vital step for discovering novel noise reduction concepts. Accordingly, the function of the final product aligns well with the objective of NASA's Quiet Aircraft Technology (QAT) program through both Airframe System Noise Reduction (ASNR) and Engine System Noise Reduction (ESNR). In addition, the absence of problem dependent tuning parameters and generality of this framework allows for application of this toolbox to ""conventional"" as well as ""revolutionary"" aircraft configurations.","The proposed SBIR project and its successful completion would result in a strong predictive aeroacoustics toolbox for licensing to clients in electronic cooling (such as Valeo and Siemens), automotive, and transportation industry (such as Alstom Transportation) in addition to the aviation industry as a whole. It would also enable us to pursue consulting projects on a much larger scale. We envision that as part of this project, a complete tool box will be developed which includes but is not limited to: high fidelity compressible, and incompressible LES simulations for direct calculations of noise and boundary element methodology for far field noise calculations.

In this way, the flight dynamics model is kept with minimum changes so that this integrated flight dynamics simulation remains in the frame work of a 6 degrees-of-freedom simulation environment.  The nonlinear structural ROM employs a so-called ELSTEP/FAT procedure that operates on a nonlinear finite element method, such as MSC.Nastrans solution 106 to construct a set of modal-based nonlinear stiffness matrices.  The NN-based aerodynamic ROM is generated using a system identification technique operating on a CFD code to evaluate the weights and biases in a two-layer feed-forward neural network system.

In practice, the interactions between technical disciplines are often not fully explored analytically, and the analysis in one discipline often uses a simplified representation of other disciplines as an input or boundary condition.  For example, the fluid forces in an engine generate static and dynamic rotor deflection, but the forces themselves are dependent on the rotor position and its orbit.  A typical design practice might involve predicting the fluid and thermal loads for various conditions and passing those estimates along for inclusion with the structural model.  This practice ignores the interaction between the physical phenomena where the outcome of each analysis can be heavily dependent on the inputs (i.e., changes in flow due to deflection, changes in deflection due to fluid forces).  Such a rigid design process also lacks the flexibility to employ multiple levels of fidelity in the analysis of each of the components.  In this project, Mechanical Solutions, Inc.

This work directly addresses NASA design environment goals as engineering teams will have the capability to employ multi-fidelity physics-based tools to reduce the failure rate and development cost of propulsion systems.In this proposed work, the extension of CoMAT to work with NPSS will enhance the capabilities of both tools, and will facilitate a broader range of multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary analyses and simulations of complete vehicle systems.   The numeric zoom functions in NPSS will be enhanced with the fluid-structure interaction capability of CoMAT.

A lot of attention has been paid during the past fifteen years in the Multi-disciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) nature of the aircraft design process.  However, a consistent void in aircraft design is the ability to integrate high-fidelity computational capabilities from multiple disciplines within an organized MDO environment.  Integrating high fidelity simulation technology (that has been developed over the years though significant investments) within a MDO environment will constitute a disruptive technological development in aircraft design.  The ability to replace time consuming solvers with metamodels within the highly iterative environment of an integrated network of optimizations is critical for engaging high fidelity simulation tools in the MDO analysis of complex aircraft systems.

The M3 DOE will allow NASA to more rapidly modify existing and/or design new aircraft by obtaining a higher level of fidelity in the optimized solutions.","The M3 DOE is a necessary tool to design aircraft in conceptual and/or preliminary design phases that establishes multi-fidelity unsteady aerodynamic loads and rapid aeroelastic shape design of complex flight vehicles.  It can be directly employed for sizing and/or shape optimization of aircraft considering multi-disciplines like flutter, static aerodynamic loads, stress, strain, and buckling in conceptual and/or preliminary design phases.  It is expected that this tool will readily be adopted by the aerospace industry and the U.S. DoD to develop a wide class of aerospace vehicles: UAVs/UCAVs, supersonic business jets and transports, advanced transonic transports, and fighter aircraft, hypervelocity missiles, and winged projectiles (with optimized fin/canard/wing).  The M3 DOE has great potential to be adopted by the flutter and loads, conceptual design and configuration development departments of airplane manufacturers' both nationally and world-wide.",Airframe; Simulation Modeling Environment; Structural Modeling and Tools

The proposed work addresses this deficiency through the development of an on-blade full-span camber control system that reaps many of the known benefits of advanced rotor control, in a retrofit design approach that has the potential to achieve production status due to its lower risks and costs compared to previous system concepts.

On the other hand, accurate noise prediction requires first principle, high fidelity simulations to capture small scales, highly unsteady aerodynamic sources of noise. This forces us to resort to component-wise acoustics computations, ignoring the fact that different components in the system affect each other in generating noise.The objective of this proposal is to develop high fidelity rotor noise simulation capabilities that allow multi-components noise prediction and exploration of a large parameter space  inherent to design processes. The distinctive aspect of the present proposal is the use of a novel discretization method based on Adaptive Vorticity Confinement technique to counteract the numerical dissipation of the underlying spatial discretization scheme in a dynamic fashion. The concept has been proven successful in controlled flow setting, allowing direct comparison with analytical solution and laboratory experiment. The primary task in this project is to extend this concept to general flow and computational environment, focusing on Blade-Vortex Interaction noise prediction as initially targeted milestone.","The increase efficiency in rotor noise source computations due to the proposed adaptive algorithm to discretely conserve circulation will support NASA objectives regarding system noise prediction.

Advanced mixed-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) models that are capable of fully describing the tribology of the mating gear teeth will be utilized to determine the influence of surface roughness and asperity interaction on the stresses driving the degradation of the surface. These factors are not rigorously addressed by currently available solutions.  The lubrication analysis will be coupled with a damage accumulation algorithm that takes into account fatigue initiation at the level of the material microstructure.  This integrated software will be the world's first physics-based gear tooth life estimation model with rigorous consideration of lubrication and pitting/scuffing damage progression in nominally loaded and misaligned gears. When complete, an end-user of the software will input the design parameters of a gearbox along with a mission load spectrum, and the software will output the estimated service lives of its gears.  If the historical or anticipated load spectrum happens to change, the altered spectrum can be input and the life recomputed.  This flexibility provides the most accurate and up-to-date estimations of both the current gearbox health and of the remaining life.","There are a number of potential points of application for this technology within NASA. The proposed algorithms and techniques are general to all gear teeth, and as such would find application in the design of new gearbox geometries such as the face gears being utilized in next generation rotorcraft. Gears are a ubiquitous component in power transmission systems, the enhanced lifing capability provided by the this technology would be beneficial across the board.","There is enormous commercial potential for design software that fills the gaps in current understanding of gearbox life.  Traditionally, due to a lack of fundamental understanding and methods to incorporate gear teeth interaction, gearboxes are simply ""overdesigned"" by incorporating large safety factors. However, this approach becomes problematic in applications where constrained weight and space are desirable (e.g. aerospace, wind turbines, etc.). The proposed software provides a more rigorous analysis of gear tooth life based on a fundamental understanding of the tribological phenomena at the gear mesh. This software will provide a means of optimizing gearbox designs for weight and size, as well as improved estimations of gearbox life under variable loading.

For this baseline, there are eight fans per wing, and the turboshaft engines use kerosene fuel as the energy source.  One major issue faced by this type of configuration is the propulsion integration of not only the structure with motors in a split wing, but also the aerodynamics of such a configuration.  In the previous study, high pressure recovery inlets, exhaust nozzle area control, thrust vectoring and variable pitch fans were considered, along with the initial layout of the entire structural integration.  The work proposed here aims to further address these concerns and outline a potential fan, inlet and nozzle design methodology for split-wing distributed propulsion.  This methodology can be turned into a design tool, for which the framework will be created as part of this study to be fully completed in a possible Phase II.  In addition, and most important to this topic, several aerodynamic aircraft concepts have also been looked at under currently supported work with California Polytechnic State University on their N+2 NRA contract to study future CESTOL aircraft and during internal study efforts at ESAero.  The work proposed here will complement much of that work by taking a better look at some novel integration arrangements in the configurations.  This will specifically address overall vehicle efficiency by looking at the aerodynamic concepts inherently designed into the aircraft.  This will be an important part of the study, as a properly integrated distributed propulsion system will offer the means to reduce ""specific"" fuel consumption, thereby increasing aircraft operating efficiencies to reduce overall mission fuel burn.","The benefits to civil aviation literally apply to all of the important goals established by NASA for the N+3 time frame.  These goals include reduced fuel burn with the attendant reduction in emissions, reduced community noise due to the very low jet velocities of the distributed fans, improved safety with the use of a common electrical bus connecting the engine power to the fans and a prospect for STOL aircraft design due to the versatility of engine and fan cycles between takeoff and cruise.  Funding this research could provide the NASA with a better look at the cryogenically cooled superconducting electric distributed propulsion system, which was shown in a previous SBIR proposal to carry substantial benefits over SOTA and even future competing propulsion systems.  The Tasks proposed here are directly applicable to NASA's current SSFW directives and a complement to its current activities in not only the SBIR arena, but also the NRA arena specific to these types of aircraft.  NASA is looking for improved subsonic transport aerodynamics and noise improvements, of which need to be incorporated early in the aircraft design process.","Currently, three major military tactical airlift vehicles are being considered.  The C-130 replacement, the EAGL C-5 replacement out of AFRL, and the Joint Future Theater Lift also out of AFRL.  The design methodology applied here to regional airliners can be modified for various sizes of cargo aircraft in a straightforward manner, and can be provided as early as the end of Phase I to these organizations to these on-going military mission studies.  The propulsion system additionally can be applied to all of the programs.  With the anticipated volume of the wings, fuselage and empennage of the anticipated transport aircraft, there is plenty of adequate room to integrate a cryogenically-cooled electric distributed propulsion system with minimal effect on the outer moldlines of the chosen configuration, as the design and integration and potential Phase II analysis would demonstrate.  The resulting UAVs from the methodology would be smaller and more efficient than current fuel powered aircraft.  With the considerations currently being discussed within NASA and FAA, the noise of the proposed propulsion system and aerodynamic concepts would be less than that of UAVs flying today.  A large UAS, like the Global Hawk, or the maritime version, Broad Area Maritime Surveillance can benefit greatly from the proposed propulsion system as an increase of efficiency will lead to longer loiter times for the BAMS mission and longer range flights for Air Force Reconnaissance missions.",Aircraft Engines; Airframe; Composites; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Structural Modeling and Tools

The conflict between efficiency and emissions will require a careful balancing of material selection, turbine inlet temperature, and cooling air. Parametric aero-thermal and structural analyses of selected ceramic blade concepts will be performed to identify blade design and cooling concepts, and to quantify vane and rotor cooling flow rates.  Tailoring of the cooling flows allows for optimization of efficiency and emission reductions.   Both internal only and film cooling flows will be determined for a range of material properties, loads, and mainstream air and coolant temperatures. Probabilistic thermal/structural analysis will identify the sensitivity of heat transfer and structural parameters to uncertainties in blade thermal conductivity and other material properties, as well as loads and geometry. The proposed effort goes beyond previous laboratory demonstrations of cooling concepts by determining more precisely ceramic blade cooling required to achieve specified performance metrics.  The methodology will be developed to a level that will permit validation in an environment relevant to commercial jet engines.  This will take the TRL from a current level of 4 to 5.","The Fundamental Aeronautics program aims to reduce aircraft emissions and fuel burn. Improved understanding of high pressure turbine cooling air requirements when using ceramic blades contributes to these goals. The higher temperature capabilities of ceramic vanes reduces the required amount of cooling air. For a fixed rotor inlet temperature reduced coolant lowers the combustor outlet temperature, and this significantly reduces NOX formation. Reducing rotor coolant improves specific fuel consumption, which also reduces CO2 emissions. In the long run improved specific fuel consumption has a multiplier effect on total fuel consumption, since either the aircraft empty weight is reduced or the payload fraction is increased. This work is also applicable to applications where cooled ceramics are used. For example, efficiently cooled ceramic combustor liners reduce NOX production.","Ceramic vanes and rotors can enable higher turbine inlet temperatures for land based gas turbines. Efficient cooling of these components leads to reduced heat rates (Kg-fuel/Mw-hr) in these applications. Because combined cycle gas turbines operate as base load plants, even a small improvement in heat rate significantly reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Siemens Corporation has publicly expressed their desire to used ceramic  blades in the ground power applications. Simple cycle gas turbines, with their lower cycle efficiencies, also benefit from efficiently cooled ceramic blades. A small absolute increase in cycle efficiency from cooled ceramics results in a large relative improvement in heat rates. Solar Turbines published results of their ceramic turbine investigations.

A low cost test system is needed that would allow for comprehensive technology screening of open rotor concepts permitting more testing to be conducted at a lower overall cost.  The approach to developing such a system will be to maximize the use of current technology in the selection and development of components.

Aspiration has been proven to increase the stage loading of gas turbine compressors and fans, potentially allowing weight reduction through the reduction of compression stages or through the reduction of stresses through decreased spool speeds.  Additionally, aspiration has the potential to increase the low Reynolds number capability of an engine through improved control of the viscous boundary layer.  Low Re capability is important for the performance of high altitude engines operating in low density air, as well as of lower power, micro-scale engines. Although the component level benefits of aspiration have been experimentally verified and the design techniques established, the issues surrounding the integration of the technology in an engine system have yet to be adequately addressed.  The performance benefit of aspiration to an engine system will depend on the details of how bleed air from the compressor is utilized elsewhere in the engine cycle.  The maximum benefit of the technology will also depend on the net weight reduction achievable once all supporting subsystems are taken into account. Aurora proposes to investigate the interdependences between aspiration flow requirements, weight reduction, and overall cycle efficiency as part of an optimization effort to maximize the capability of a HALE engine.  The effort will define the benefits of compressor aspiration in a low Reynolds number environment and provide the rational for using the HALE mission as a launch application for this promising technology.","NASA has operated many high altitude science platforms that could benefit from the application of compressor aspiration.  Vehicles such as the General Atomics Altair, Lockheed Martin ER-2, the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk, and WB-57 are powered by turboprop or turbofan engines, and all provide NASA with time on station at high altitude to perform scientific missions.  Several of the aircraft built for NASA's ERAST program used internal combustion engines with multiple stages of turbocharging.  The proposed work specifically aims to improve the utility of these kinds of aircraft by increasing the altitude and endurance that can be achieved despite the low density, low Reynolds number conditions.  Compressor aspiration has the potential to control the effects of increased viscosity with increasing altitude through the removal of low energy flow from the compressor before it can cause separation and ultimately reduce compressor efficiency.  It can also increase stage loading, reducing the number of axial compressor or turbocharger stages required. These performance and weight enhancements could allow for a leap in the ability of high altitude science vehicles to stay on station, as well as allow for increases in the maximum service ceiling.","Aspiration has been experimentally proven to roughly double the allowable stage loading of a fan or compressor in a gas turbine engine.   The potential exists to cut the number of stages required for a given pressure ratio in half, essentially halving the weight and length of the component.   This will directly affect the power to weight ratio the engine and reduce the overall engine volume.  This technology is applicable to air vehicles requiring high thrust to weight or compact engines.  In particular, the combination of high thrust to weight and compact form factor makes the technology attractive for military fighter aircraft engines.   Additionally, this technology may be applied in vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft, where thrust to weight is of paramount concern.  Finally, the low Reynolds number aspect of the proposed research could have implications for small engines.  Whereas high altitude engines experience low Reynolds numbers due to low density, the short length scale in small engines increases the importance of viscosity and reduces performance.  This technology could be utilized to increase the performance of smaller gas turbines that power many unmanned vehicles.",Aircraft Engines; Fundamental Propulsion Physics; Thermodynamic Conversion

Numerica's technology would be a plug-in for AFTS which would include both trajectory estimation and prediction modules as described in this proposal, as well as plug-ins for Ultra's TacView user interface that automatically alert operators to potential LOS or other airspace conﬂicts.Furthermore, the US Navy uses a number of UAV platforms, and has two major programs developing new platforms, both of which could benefit from the proposed technology.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

The research focus area Airspace Super-Density Operations (ASDO) pertains to highly efficient operations at the busiest airports and terminal airspace. Deterministic analysis of the proposed NextGen concepts may not be sufficient, as inability of aircraft to adhere to flight schedules exactly and operational uncertainties may significantly alter the effectiveness of the proposed concepts.  The primary objective of this research proposal is to create a High-Fidelity Queuing Model of the Terminal Area and a Framework for Performing Time-Varying Stochastic Analysis of Terminal Area Operations with regards to Input Schedule and Operational Uncertainties. This Queuing Model can be used to evaluate the interaction and combined performance of multiple NextGen concepts in the ASDO research focus area. The Phase I effort will develop a sample Queuing Network Model for a moderately complex terminal area, e.g. JFK. The utility of the developed Queuing Model and Analysis Techniques will be illustrated using two case-studies in the JFK terminal area. Phase II research effort proposes to develop integrated surface/terminal area queuing model of a Metroplex. Stochastic analysis of the Metroplex will be accelerated in Phase II using Graphics Processing Units.",The primary application of the Queuing Model developed in the course of this research is to serve as a Stochastic Analysis Tool to evaluate proposed NextGen concepts in the terminal area.,"Apart from serving the primary function of supporting NASA research, the developed queuing model can be used:1. As a Planning Tool by the FAA to forecast future state of the terminal area for TFM decision-making algorithms.2. By Airline Operations Center to make decisions on canceling or re-scheduling flights in response to off-nominal events such as adverse weather conditions.3.

The advent of AFPs in 2006 has generated many more potentially exchangeable resources that would be valued sufficiently differently by their owners to make a trade desirable. We believe that NAS users and the FAA would embrace such a marketplace and that it would enable users to collectively reduce their operating costs resulting from NAS congestion.Both FAA and NASA research has highlighted the need for efficient and equitable allocation of NAS resources and increased operational flexibility. In the past market-based mechanisms have been suggested for transferring system-imposed delay from more critical to less critical flights. No such capability is available to NAS users today. In this SBIR, we will show how the advent of AFPs changes the forces at work in a slot-trading marketplace, making its functions much more valuable to flight operators. We will also design a system that will provide the aviation community with a means of reducing operating costs and increasing effective throughput by trading scarce NAS resources.","The proposed SBIR directly benefits NASA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Air Traffic Management Airspace Project, whose primary goal is to develop integrated solutions for a safe, efficient and high-capacity airspace system. Efficient airspace allocation requires early research in market-based mechanisms for design of the next-generation air transportation system.","The proposed arrival slot marketplace has application in commercial air traffic management (ATM) both in the United States and abroad. In the U.S. ATM market, any resource broker attempting to establish a slot market will require the tools and procedures output by Phases 2 and 3 of this SBIR to act as a central processor and tracker of ATM-induced flight controls. At the same time, U.S. air carriers will require tools with which to monitor and manage their flight schedules and make informed, effective decisions for exchanging resources. Estimates of ATM costs due to delays range from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions of dollars per year. The opportunity to save even a fraction of these costs creates a significant amount of motivation for airline participation in a delay management system. It is reasonable to assume that the number of carriers willing to participate in this system will be comparable to the number of carriers now signed up as active members of the collaborative decision making (CDM) program  there are about 25 CDM members which together operate 90% of all flights controlled by FAA-imposed ground delays.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

Viable applications include military missions, law enforcement, border patrol, weather data collection, telecommunications, land use imaging, and cargo transport. NASA and other organizations have invested heavily in this unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research. UAVs can be flown in the National Airspace System (NAS) today, but only with special permission from the FAA  a process that often takes 60 to 90 days. Moreover, permission is often contingent on heavy restrictions, such as accompanying the UAV with a manned chase plane, thereby nullifying the cost savings of a UAV. Full fruition of UAV technology will require incorporation of UAVs into mainstream air traffic management (ATM) practices, including traffic flow management flow control programs and possible creation of special use airspace (SUA). In this SBIR, we propose a UAV-to-traffic flow management (UAV-TFM) interface. This allows traffic managers to anticipate and track UAVs. In turn, this allows UAV operators to understand the their impact on commercial air traffic and their involvement in traffic management activities.","This SBIR benefits NASA in three ways. (1) It furthers one of the main goals of NASA's Strategic Airspace Usage project, the increase of capacity and the enhancement of throughput in the national airspace system via development of long-term operational concepts for collaborative traffic management. (2) This SBIR preserves the integrity and applicability of NASA research and development of UAV technology by helping to overcome a primary obstacle to integration of UAVs into today's national airspace system. In particular, this research will encourage policy makers to accept the viability of UAVs. (3)  NASA decision support tools developed for ATM, such as CTAS, TMA, FAST, and SMS will benefit from recommendations for how to account for UAV traffic into their logic.","The FAA will benefit from this innovative research in several ways. (1) They will have a greater understanding of how they can grapple with changing traffic demand patterns and NAS user needs stemming from remote operation of vehicles. (2) The FAA will have access to a tool and operational paradigm for data exchange between UAV operators and FAA traffic managers. (3)  The FAA will partially achieve one of the NextGen programmatic goals of equitable access to NAS resources for all NAS users. (4) This research will assist the future FAA task of setting UAV operation policies by providing insight into and feasibility of UAV integration into the national airspace system. (5) There possibly being a strong relation between UAVs and special use airspace, our proposed tool could be integrated with, thereby furthering, the FAA's special use airspace system (SAMS).

Intelligent agents represent two types of entities / players: FAA Traffic Management Unit (TMU) representatives, and Airline Operations Center (AOC) coordinators. The software modules resulting from this work are intended to be part of the NASA ARC multi-agent simulation toolkit for CTFM. The goal is to utilize game theory to understand the behavior of AOCs so that the CTFM system may be designed to yield improved performance of the NextGen AirSpace without compromising safety. We consider a spectrum of information sharing cases, from complete information sharing to incomplete information sharing where AOCs limit the transparency of their strategies to the FAA TMU. This agent-based simulation software will enhance the ability of the FAA (and other parties including NASA) to design proper collaboration protocols and incentives by studying the effects of different strategies by both types of players. We call this a ""co-opetition"" simulation tool since it allows analysis of competitive strategies between AOCs, while providing insights into how the TMU can promote greater cooperation by the AOCs for the common good. We should emphasize that the intent of the proposed software is NOT to design effective AOC strategies since that will be determined by the individual airlines, and not the CTFM system designers.","We build on the ongoing research performed by NASA ARC researcher Shawn Wolfe and his colleagues, on the CTFM simulation system built using the Brahms multi-agent simulation environment. Our game theory module will be a ""plug-in"" to this toolkit and will enable the CTFM system designers to better appreciate the dynamics of cooperation and competition between the AOCs and the TMU. The obvious technology transition is to the NextGen Airspace project in the area of traffic flow management. The tool can be used both for simulation and for operational automation of CTFM concepts. There are many other potential NASA applications involving multi-agent negotiation and co-opetition, for example in scheduling rocket launches using global coordination.","Other members of the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), such as the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Transportation (DoT), have similar CTFM needs. In particular, the proposed game-theoretic CTFM approach is very relevant to the integration of UAVs into the NAS. The DoD is interested in increasing the number of UAVs that can be controlled by one operator. Agent-based automation of coordination between UAVs, and between UAVs and other aircraft, will become an increasing need; the proposed game-theoretic approach is one solution to this problem. The agent-based game-theoretic negotiation strategies can also be integrated into a wide variety of modeling and simulation tools currently employed by the DoD, to help improve the fidelity of such simulations.",Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Human-Computer Interfaces; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs), including reroutes and ground delays, are used by Air Traffic Management (ATM) operators to mitigate impact of en-route convective weather. The efficiency of today's TMIs leaves a great deal to be desired, due in part to insufficient accuracy of today's weather forecast products. As new, higher-accuracy probabilistic forecast products are beginning to emerge, there is a major functionality gap between their visual aspect (enhancing comprehension and decision making by operators) and their application in automated NextGen ATM decision support tools. Our proposal seeks to address this gap. We will develop a prototype tool for automatic generation of ""Least-Impact TMIs"" using probabilistic convective forecast information. This tool will generate a combination of least-deviation-from-shortest-path reroute and/or minimum ground delay for each flight predicted to be impacted by convective weather.Innovation in this proposal: New, original ""step-out-and-scan"" rerouting algorithm. Probabilistic forecast information converted to ATM constraints (""permeability"") and used to find viable reroute paths. Combination of economical reroutes plus minimum delays resulting in least-impact traffic management solutions.We already have a suitable platform for this research: the WITI (Weather Impacted Traffic Index) toolset developed by Principal Investigator, Dr. Klein, funded by the FAA and the National Weather Service. It can ingest actual and forecast weather, traffic demand, airport and airspace capacities; as well as compute weather permeability by a flight (using the so-called scanning algorithm) and airspace capacity degradation due to weather. NASA sponsored research (""Translating Weather Information into TFM Constraints"" NRA) is also using WITI technology.","The technology developed under this proposal can be applied in NASA and Joint Program Development Office (JPDO) NextGen airspace toolsets that facilitate automated traffic flow management and utilize the planned 4D weather cube technology (integrated weather diagnostics, forecast and decision support environment)."," Assessing the effectiveness of today's TMIs (""actual"" vs. ""best-possible"").

Current practices are largely devised under the context of locally optimal planning, i.e. the plans are designed to yield as large a number of safe operations to a single airport during peak loads as possible. COBRA provides a semi-global look at the problem, considering that, periodically, what is best for a single airport may be not be the best plan for the system as a whole. During Phase I we will focus our efforts on 1) Formulating the Problem for a subset of Los Angeles metroplex, for which flight-data is available, 2) Algorithm development using a fast-time Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to determine which routes provide the fewest conflicts and most efficient use of the terminal airspace, 3) Testing algorithms against Los Angeles metroplex scenarios, and 4) Providing thorough documentation of results. COBRA solutions will map flights to routes within a particular runway configuration and runway assignment. Another layer of the solver will review the nominal runway selection to determine if further balancing might be advantageous for surface operations. Designs will be flexible to incorporate a wide base of airportal constraints and objectives such as wind conditions, approved routes plans, airport surface geometry, and flight restrictions (e.g. noise abatements, separation requirements, etc.), and will be extensible to other metroplexes. Phase II work will seek to extend COBRA to a full metroplex, include uncertainty in the optimization, and test the algorithms against time-varying constraints.","The proposed effort directly supports the NASA Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen NGATS) and provides advanced algorithms and software tools to perform metroplex area NextGen Airportal traffic and resource management. Results generated using the COBRA tool can be evaluated using NASA tools and software such as FACET and ACES. Immediate NASA applications are for civil and commercial aviation as part of the NextGen program, and the development of an effective Runway Configuration Management system is also consistent with the goals and objectives of the NASA Aviation Safety Program.","FAA and other government agencies will benefit from an automated Airportal resource and traffic management tool through improved throughput of the airports with minimal delays.

The Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA) tool, which is being used by NASA to conduct airport ATC operations analysis, is a prime example of one such analysis tool. What is missing from ATC operations analysis, however, is accessible and reliable data regarding the clearances issued by the controller and other communication that is conducted with the pilot that influences the behavior that is seen in the surveillance data. The current command and control paradigm for managing air traffic in the National Airspace System (NAS) is highly dependent on voice communication. This approach has benefited the development of ATC over the last century in a number of ways, including a low level of required aircraft equipage and the ability to handle contingency situations and adapt to new requirements easily due to the flexibility and adaptability of the human air traffic controllers and pilots. However, the reliance on voice communication in ATC operations presents challenges to the researcher who is trying to obtain data and conduct detailed analyses of ATC operations. In this proposal, we draw on existing Mosaic ATM expertise and tools to perform automatic speech recognition of ATC clearances. The recognized ATC clearances will be associated with the flight that is the subject of the clearance, time-stamped and encoded into an analysis database. The SODAA tool will be used as the platform for storage and analysis of this verbal clearance data.","The capabilities of the proposed ATC automatic speech recognition capability as have been presented in this proposal would provide significant usefulness to NASA and the FAA in the research and analysis of future NGATS airportal and airspace concepts. Because ATC clearances are issued by verbal command via a radio channel, there is currently no easy way to obtain large amounts of reliable data regarding the clearances that are issued to aircraft. For research efforts that have required ATC clearance data, it has been necessary to obtain the data through manual observation and recording of clearances issues, or by laborious and time-consuming manual review and transcription of recorded ATC audio tapes. However, access to such clearance information would provide additional insights and understanding regarding the strategies and limitations of the air traffic controller for NASA research efforts.","The FAA and NASA are currently collaborating on the continued research and development of SMS/SDSS. Mosaic ATM currently supports NASA in the development of a data mining and analysis tool for airport surface research, as well as in the expansion of the SMS concept and system.

We will develop a self-contained, fast-time SMS simulation environment by incorporating an aircraft taxi model.  The proposed stand-alone platform would complement NASA's current SMS-ATG environment by providing a fast-time simulation capability that uses the desired SMS plug-in architecture.  We will also develop and integrate within the SMS simulation departure scheduling and taxi planning algorithms.  These algorithms will supplement NASA's existing work and be independent of external optimization solvers.

Airports and aeronautical systems manufacturers are facing ever-increasing demands to reduce noise levels.  Aeronautical applications require the use of large arrays of high quality microphones with a large dynamic range.  These arrays are expensive.  The advent of lower cost microphones that meet the users' specifications would dramatically improve the ability of engineers seeking to quantify the acoustic impact of either their designs or their facilities (e.g., airports) to make data driven decisions to improve any adverse conditions. We seek to develop commercially viable, piezeoelectric micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones capable of withstanding the high amplitude sound pressure levels and adverse environmental conditions found in ground testing of the acoustics of aeronautical systems.  The acoustical specifications of these microphones (measured by noise floor, linearity, sensitivity) will met or exceed those of existing microphones.  Our microphone is a shift from the capacitive sensing scheme that is used in nearly every microphone in use today.  Piezoelectric MEMS microphones have significant advantages, over an above their small size (<4 mm x mm). Piezoelectric MEMS microphones require no polarization (unlike capacitive sensors), a significant price advantage when considering implementation in large arrays.  In addition, the piezoelectric MEMS microphones can withstand the higher temperatures needed for lead-free re-flow soldering  a significant advantage over electrets (that cannot withstand these high temperatures).  This microphone, therefore, holds the promise of superior acoustical performance, lower cost than current technology, ease of implementation into large arrays, and seamless integration into modern microelectronics manufacturing procedures.","There are a great number of NASA test facilities where lower cost microphones are needed that can withstand harsh environmental conditions and acoustic loading.  A partial listing includes:1. Glenn Research Center: Acoustic Test Lab: phased array systems (e.g., 16 element linear array, 80 element microphone cage array, 63 element microphone spiral array); Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig; AeroAcoustic Propulsion Lab; Advanced Noise Control Fan Rig.2. Langley Research Center: Structural Acoustics Loads and Transmission facility; Jet Noise Lab; Mobile Acoustics Research Capability; Anechoic Noise Facility.3. Noise mapping at airports using large arrays.The applications of noise control are to aircraft noise mitigation (jet engine noise, flow noise and structural acoustic radiation) as well as for understanding the acoustics surrounding airports.","More than 2 billion microphones are sold each year.  A piezoelectric MEMS microphone can address the needs of the vast majority of this market but will need to be designed appropriately for each sector of the market.  This market can be broken up into roughly three categories.  About half of the market, 1 billion units per year, is for extremely inexpensive microphones for toys and other applications where size and performance are not crucial.  Roughly 1 billion units per year are also sold for consumer electronics, mostly for mobile phone applications.  There is also a small market of high-end microphones for instrumentation, recording studios and live events.  Examples of large arrays of instrument quality microphones used in the aerospace industry include the wind tunnel measurements (where over 1000 microphone could be used) and in the ground test arrays (like the Boeing QTD2 array with over 600 microphones).  The overall instrumentation microphone market is estimated at 100,000 units per year with prices around $1500 to $3000 per microphone.  This instrumentation market will be the initial target of the microphones fabricated by Baker-Calling.

This proposal describes a novel type of schlieren system that would increase efficiency, capability, and productivity for ground test facilities. The concept and the availability of state of the art components make the system more portable, easier to align, and more versatile than existing systems. A major drawback of current schlieren systems and one that has restricted their widespread commercial use is that they require exact alignment between a pair of widely separated mirrors or grids, which takes time and limits portability, and costs are prohibitive for most such applications. This problem is partially relaxed by focusing schlieren methods. The proposed concept incorporates features of existing schlieren systems while removing the primary limitations. All of the elements that require precise alignment are contained within a camera body and can be relatively inexpensive. Also, very large fields of view are made possible.  This is advantageous in wind tunnel facilities, since experiments are frequently installed only to be torn down shortly afterwards.","Applications exist in all forms of research and development associated with flow fields where schlieren viewing could be useful, including aero-optics, flow control, drag, boundary layer transition, and flow separation. The proposed developments could be extremely important in enhancing ground test facility capability.","Potential commercial applications include aero-optics, flow diagnostics, flow control, free-space laser communication, active laser imaging, high bandwidth video transmission, spectroscopy, and high-resolution imaging.",Optical; Testing Facilities

In particular, the instrumentation would provide the unique capability for measurements of multiple parameters at data collection rates as high as ~1 MHz with flexible wavelength and interpulse spacing for quantitative velocimetry and thermometry.  During the Phase I, the proposal team will study the feasibility of developing burst-mode Nd:YAG technology with programmable temporal output while pumping a wavelength-agile UV OPO for multi-line fluorescence imaging. This requires innovation of the burst-mode pump laser to allow dual-pulse seeding, an appropriate chain of laser amplifiers, and a narrowband OPO designed for pulse-pair operation and rapid wavelength switching.  Proof-of-concept demonstrations of NO molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) and two-line NO PLIF will be accomplished in a laboratory scale high-speed flow facility (up to Mach 5).  Finally, the feasibility of performing high frame rate (~50 kHz) imaging in high enthalpy impulse facilities using Rayleigh scattering will also be evaluated.  This program will enable prototype development of a next generation ultra-high frame rate imaging system for high-speed flows, demonstration tests in NASA facilities, and the potential delivery of a prototype system to NASA during the Phase II.","Potential NASA applications include measurements in ATP facilities under the auspices of the Aerothermodynamics Laboratory, such as the 31"" Mach 10 facility, the 20"" Mach 6 facility, the 15"" Mach 6 facility, and the 20"" Mach 6 CF4 facility.  These facilities can utilize measurements of planar velocimetry molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) and dual-line NO PLIF for temperature measurements.  In addition, dual-line NO PLIF can be used for vibrational temperature measurements in non-equilibrium flows.  The ability to track flow features at MHz rates allows detailed visualization of flow behavior, such as boundary layer separation, to aid with understanding re-entry phenomena, and for studying scramjet ignition and combustion, Finally, the Phase I will also evaluate the requirements for high frame rate (~50 kHz) imaging in high enthalpy impulse facilities, enabling ~20-30 UV or filtered Rayleigh scattering images to be obtained during single-millisecond duration ""shots.""

Nash Street, El Segundo, CA 90245 - 2822",(310) 640-8781  Extension :23,,,,,0,3,"An important mission for NASA is the development of revolutionary flight concepts and technology.  The development of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), the resurgence of general aviation, and growing interest in environmentally conscious, all-electric, emissionless aircraft have brought about a renewed interest in propeller design.  Overall, since the propeller's golden age during the WWII era, very little has changed in propeller design.  Computers have automated the design processes, but the basic design methodology, from an aerodynamic point of view has changed very little.  Strides have been made in acoustics and multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), but the basic aerodynamic design and performance of the subsonic propeller has basically remained unchanged.  The explosion of UAVs and a need for more efficient designs allowing greater payload, range, and loiter times have taken UAVs from simple cut-and-try designs to sophisticated, aerodynamically efficient systems.  An area as of yet not fully exploited by this class of aircraft, is that of propeller efficiency.  Most smaller UAVs and micro-UAVs simply use off-the-shelf radio control propellers, while moderate size UAVs rely on propellers designed using classical blade element theory or those derived for general aviation aircraft.  While these propellers provide industry acceptable levels of thrust for a given torque, the majority of propellers suffer some form of flow separation.  The extent of flow separation can range from small areas in cruise regions of the flight envelope, to large areas during climb and wind milling.  Significant propeller performance gains in the form of increased thrust and reduced torque can be obtained by eliminating these separated regions across the flight envelope.  A simple, efficient, and robust flow control technique is proposed to eliminate these separated regions and provide a marked increase in propeller performance and vehicle propulsive performance.","Propeller flow control technology will provide NASA with a means to develop new vehicles, or retrofit existing aircraft that can take advantage of an improvement in propeller propulsion efficiency.  In the case of electric powered vehicles, the increased efficiency can be used to extend battery life and range, or to allow a larger payload to be carried to altitude.  Exploratory aircraft, whether used for terrestrial missions or on other planets, will benefit from the ability to eliminate separated flow on the propeller, which will improve flight efficiency in off-design flight conditions or particularly challenging flight envelopes, such as those found in very low Reynolds number flight.  High-altitude long-endurance (HALE) aircraft, used for such tasks as atmospheric sampling, ground mapping, or communications relaying operate in a very low Reynolds number environment, where laminar separation bubbles can dominate the flow field, and could benefit from improvements in propeller efficiency.","The propeller flow control technology will provide enhanced performance for propeller-based aircraft across a wide range of flight regimes and missions.  Considering the recent proliferation of small and moderate size UAV designs, the commercialization potential for the technology is excellent.  This fact, coupled with the recent rise in the price of petroleum based fuels and the push for greener, more efficient vehicles, will make the improved performance and efficiency of the propeller flow control system very attractive to both the military and commercial sectors.  Additionally, the applicability of the technology to the retrofit market is extremely high.  Finally, the propeller flow control technology can also be easily licensed to existing airframers and propeller design and manufacturing companies.",Fundamental Propulsion Physics; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Simulation Modeling Environment

They are inherently self identifiable; the interrogation system knows what data belongs to what sensor.The proposed sensor array technology is applicable to different types of optical sensors (accelerometers, strain, temperature, etc). Each sensor in the array is designed to work at preset optical wavelengths; they are read by the interrogation system using Wave Division and/or Time Division Multiplexing.Testing of aircrafts requires a large numbers of sensors. Each sensor needs four to six wires to interconnect to signal conditioners. For large measuring systems, this means very large numbers of wires that add weight and occupy space.The proposed FO sensor  array system not only has the potential to significantly improve pressure measurements for Flight Load Testing, but its novel  technology of micro-miniature networking  sensors will benefit many other aircraft ground and flight testing applications.","NASA main potential applications are in flight and ground/wind tunnel testing of aircrafts where surface pressure measurements are needed.

GMSK provides a constant envelope signal that passes unaltered through system nonlinearities, allowing efficient power amplifier operation without extensive filtering and predistortion.  Unfortunately, current off-the-shelf GMSK and related continuous phase modulation (CPM) receivers (e.g., multi-h CPM) operate far from predicted theoretical performance and suffer from frequent link dropouts.  CPM performance issues are mostly attributable to a failure to adequately model and mitigate against transmitter, channel, and receiver impairments, including fixed-point processing effects, and to generate reliable soft-decision information for decoding.  To maximize performance given CCSDS turbo or LDPC coding and eliminate communications dropouts, a soft-decision generating GMSK demodulator with carefully designed impairment estimation and compensation is proposed.","Future space missions at near Earth, lunar, and deep space distances that require spectral efficient communications will benefit greatly from the robustness and size, weight, and power reduction offered by the proposed GMSK technology.

Maxentric has been developing manycore-based software defined radio (SDR) technologies in an effort to innovate in this market. In this proposal, we describe a radiation-hardened software defined radio system called Resilient. In contrast to current software defined radio systems, Resilient employs a multi-core processor, Maestro. Using Maestro for SDR will enable sophisticated software-based fault tolerance approaches. Moreover, Maestro is based on a general purpose processing architecture that is significantly cheaper and easier to program, debug, and verify than FPGAs.","Resilient is Maxentric's fault tolerant manycore-based software defined radio.

To surmount the present obstacles to higher photon counting rate -- as well as the complexity of back-end circuitry required -- in using conventional single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), we will leverage initial success in monolithically integrating ""negative feedback"" elements with state-of-the-art SPADs to beneficially modify the device avalanche dynamics.  This approach can achieve extremely consistent passive quenching, and appropriate implementations can lead to rather small avalanches (e.g., ~10^4  10^5 carriers), for which reduced carrier trapping provides lower afterpulsing that will no longer limit the photon counting rate.  When correctly implemented, this ""negative feedback"" avalanche diode (NFAD) design is also extremely simple to operate:  with just a fixed dc bias voltage, the NFAD will autonomously execute the entire arm, avalanche, quench, and re-arm cycle and generate an output pulse every time an avalanche event is induced.  Phase I of this program will be focused on specific pixel-level design advancements related to the reduction of afterpulsing and timing jitter.  Along with pixel-level goals, we will also fabricate and characterize test structures to define design and process innovations that guarantee high pixel yield and uniformity on large-scale NFAD arrays.  The proof-of-feasibility tasks defined in Phase I will position us to demonstrate space-qualifiable large pixel-count (e.g., 80 x 80) NFAD arrays during a Phase II effort.  Design and performance goals have been defined to meet anticipated lasercomm requirements for future space missions.","There are two primary NASA applications for the negative feedback avalanche diode (NFADs) arrays to be developed during this proposed SBIR program.  First, free space optical (laser) communications over interplanetary distances epitomizes photon-starved applications, and viable spacecraft receiver technologies should have high-performance single photon detection to enable coding schemes such as pulse position modulation while imposing minimal size, weight, and power requirements.  The need for simultaneous pointing and tracking is a driver for array-based detector solutions.  Second, active remote sensing optical instruments require higher performance photon detectors to improve the performance of existing direct detection lidar systems used to perform atmospheric measurements (e.g., aerosol backscattering) and surface mapping (e.g., ice sheets and forest canopy density).","There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications that will benefit from the development of NFAD arrays.  Range-finding and ladar applications present many commercial opportunities (e.g., terrain/vegetation mapping, flood/landslide risk mapping, civil engineering projects, etc.) in which the availability of single photon sensitivity could be a disruptive improvement over existing optical remote sensing technologies.  Just as NASA is pursuing free space optical links, commercial FSO systems will be able to leverage capabilities realized from the development of NFAD arrays for photon-starved free space links, particularly in cases for which pointing and tracking are required, such as in satellite communications.  As with NASA remote sensing applications, there are commercial applications for NFADs in various types of lidar systems for measuring atmospheric properties such as wind and weather patterns, air pollution, and general trace gas analysis.

Feasible schedules that address mission requirements over the short, medium and long term are inherently faced with the need to resolve conflicts when multiple missions contend for the same time windows of opportunity. This proposal is for an oversubscribed mission scheduler conflict resolution system that will rapidly provide feasible schedules using innovative boolean satisfiability methods and then leverage software agent personas to minimize or eliminate conflicts in scheduling. Agents will free up valuable human resources in the de-conflict loop, using an ask-offer process to negotiate future timeslots based on a deferred value function. Phase 1 will demonstrate the feasibility of applying mature SAT solver process to the rapid generation of feasible schedules and also demonstrate the potential for the application of semi-autonomous belief-desire-intent (BDI) agents to conflict resolution and user interface support. Phase 2 will evolve proof-of-concept prototypes into fully functional systems.","Demonstrate the practical value of modeling complex scheduling problems using SAT.

Semi-autonomous agents can facilitate this process.Scheduling of medical procedures and processes (for instance surgical oncology) that depend on the same small set of limited resources can result in conflicts that can be addressed through agent negotiation.Oversubscribed resources at conferences or similar events can be allocated according to negotiations between agents that represent participants.Agents such as the ones proposed for this project could be applied to first responder or other emergency scenarios in a way that takes the pressure off scarce human resources.,Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

Specifically in KSC's launch vehicles operations, break-through in LIDAR technology could provide ability to economically measure incremental ballistic wind velocities along the predicted trajectory of launch vehicles at remote.  The most critical component in a LIDRA is its laser scanner, which delivers laser pulse to target with desirable field of view (FOV).  Most of existing LIDARs uses rotating or oscillating mirror for scanning, resulting in several drawbacks: Large size of moving parts (mirrors and motors), limiting scanning speed to hundreds HZ;  Difficult to meet stringent requirements on size, weight, and power for space uses; Difficult to control FOV of scanning motion; Un-evenness of data point distribution due to inherent acceleration of scanning mirror; Waste points at the swath borders of scanning mirror.In this SBIR, we propose a revolutionary LIDAR scanning technology  that could eliminate these drawbacks and achieve very high scanning speed, with an ultra-miniature size, much lighter weight and much compact size. This novel technology promises at least a 10x performance improvement in these areas over existing LIDAR scanners.Innovations of the proposed ultra-miniature LIDAR scanner include: Ultra miniature size of scanner: it is possible to make the entire scanner in <2 mm in diameter; Very high scanning speed (e.g. 5~20 kHz, contrast to several hundred Hz in existing scanners); Ideal structure to meet stringent requirements on size, weight, power, and compactness for various space applications; The scanning speed and field of view (FOV) can be dynamically adjusted: suited for obtaining high image resolutions of targeted areas and for diversified uses."," The ultra-miniature LIDAR scanner technology is ideal tool for fixed and mobile LIDAR to measure economically the incremental ballistic wind velocities along the predicted trajectory of launch vehicles at remote and evolving launch ranges at altitudes up to 100 kft. More importantly, this innovation offers a 10X performance improvement in scanning speed, scanner size, weight, and power. The unique dynamical FOV adjustment capability also provide NASA with a unprecedented tool to achieve high accuracy on target areas.  Compact LIDAR devices for NASA Robots for Lunar Surface Operations to provide real-time 3D data of terrain elevations to help remote navigation and control.  KSC Range surveillance, target detection and situational awarenessWe are currently working with KSC on a novel smart video surveillance platform for situational awareness and detection, recognition, and identification of persons/objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared for safe launch operations. The proposed LIDAR scanner is synergistic to our current effort for providing real-time 3D model of sensitive sites and add one more dimension (literally and figuratively) to video surveillance and target detection capability.   Airborne LIDAR for DEM and geo-surveys: collect accurate 3D digital elevation models (DEM) which enable diversified applications ranging from monitoring shoreline erosion to flood hazard mapping."," Compact LIDAR scanners for automobile obstacle detection, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and urban navigationPractical and reliable 3D sensor technology is one of key components in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Low-cost, compact and high performance LIDAR technology could bring a lead frog of automobile adoption of LIDAR as primary 3D sensor of obstacle detection, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and urban navigation.  This is a multi-billion dollars market.   Miniature sub-millimeter endoscopes are highly desirable for both medical imaging and industrial inspection.  Current ultrathin endoscopes use coherent bundle with 2,000 to 6,000 fibers, leading to poor image quality. The proposed novel ultrathin scanning endoscope enables high resolution imaging with sub-millimeter endoscope.   Compact and low-cost LIDAR technology could provide real-time 3D terrain model of sensitive sites thus adding one more dimension (literally and figuratively) to the video surveillance and target detection capability.

Given the extreme nature of acoustic environments near the plume, data sufficient to characterize the noise source region have been difficult to acquire.  Without these data, structures may be designed to handle an insufficient or excessive vibroacoustic loads, resulting in either an overbuilt structure (and extra weight), or an under-designed vibration isolation system that could result in damaged cargos.Current energy base acoustic probe designs have limited frequency bandwidth due to physical limitations.  A new set of probe designs is proposed that incorporate both a new physical probe design but also a more advanced signal processing methodology that will significantly increase the usable frequency bandwidth of the probes while reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs of the probes.The probe system will also include the design of a complete data acquisition system capable of recording data under the harsh conditions present in typical rocket motor test firings.","Blue Ridge Research and Consulting has a history of providing quality service for a wide range of difficult measurement and modeling projects.  We envision the results from this SBIR to add significantly to our ability to provide an advanced acoustic energy measurement capability.

XNAV provides fully autonomous interplanetary navigation capability, potentially reducing the demands on DSN from increasing tracking requirements for future missions. XNAV can supplement DSN service and enhance DSN navigation performance. XNAV can also provide a backup navigation capability for manned and unmanned near-Earth, lunar, and Mars missions. Further, it can provide higher redundancy for manned missions.  It can provide a highly accurate, independent time reference as well, for both Earth-orbiting and interplanetary missions.","The primary non-NASA XNAV applications would be to provide primary or secondary navigation services for DoD missions. For MEO, GEO, HEO, and even cis-lunar missions, where GPS has limited availability, XNAV can provide primary autonomous navigation capability. In addition, XNAV could provide an essential backup navigation capability for missions that normally rely on GPS, but have a need for continuity of operations in the event of loss or denial of GPS.

Day, night, near side and far side lunar operations will all be handled. Exploration of the Moon (or Mars) without navigation aids comparable to those now common on Earth is a daunting, and generally unacceptable concept.  Since neither body has a significant magnetic field, even a compass is useless.  Creating and sustaining a GPS type satellite constellation will not occur soon.  But the self contained, automated system Micro-Space proposes is an excellent substitute. It can be installed on top of an astronaut's helmet, or atop a vehicle, in extended EVA. With exploration extended into terrain where a vehicle is likely to become immobilized,  but access by a walking human is practical, vast areas of currently unknown territory can be examined at very close range.   But an hour's trek into convoluted terrain can leave the trekker seriously disoriented, and subject to human course decisions which could prove fatal. The helmet mount system  will provide continuous EVA crew localization for emergency walk back to a safe haven, even if that path crosses unexplored territory.  Fixed asset or notable planetary feature localization will also be straightforward at any point in the EVA.  The proposed optical navigation system uses production, solid state camera modules for Solar, Earth Shine, and Celestial sight readings, all with an accurate artificial horizon. But the accuracy required is produced by Micro-Space proprietary ""Sub Pixel"" processing techniques. Lunar localization accuracy will exceed ¼ mile.

Low mass will make individual astronaut units possible, for redundancy and safety, and these systems will depend on no external hardware for reliable and accurate operation. Robotic use is possible, on the Moon or Mars, and highly desirable as greater rover mobility and speed is achieved, particularly with flying or hopping craft.Celestial and solar  attitude determination in small spacecraft is possible due to the low mass and power requirements.","Since the proposed system does not approach the accuracy or convenience of terrestrial GPS, use on this planet would be limited to extraordinary situations (GPS destruction or denial). Use by other efforts on the Moon and Mars is a possibility. Celestial and solar  attitude determination in small spacecraft is likely due to the low mass and power requirements.

The software developed in this project will leverage current computing technology to implement advanced Visual Odometry (VO) methods that will accurately track much faster rover movements. Our fully Bayesian approach to VO will utilize more information from the images than previous methods are capable of using. Our Bayesian VO does not explicitly select features to track. Instead it implicitly determines what can be learned from each image pixel and weights the information accordingly. This means that our approach can work with images that have no distinct corners, which can be a significant advantage with low contrast images from permanently shadowed areas. We expect that the error characteristics of the visual processing with be complementary to the error characteristics of a low-cost IMU. Therefore, the combination of the two should provide highly accurate navigation.","Visual Odometry (VO) has played a key role in Mars exploration with the Spirit and Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs). However, limitations in onboard computing power severely limit the speed of movement that can be tracked by MERS VO, requiring an order of magnitude reduction in forward progress in area where VO was required. The software developed in this project will leverage current computing technology to implement advanced VO methods that will accurately track much faster rover movements. This will greatly increase exploration productivity. This improvement will become even more significant when exploring the more distant planetary bodies. This project will also investigate whether combining vision with a low-cost, lightweight, low-power Micro-ElectroMechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) can produce acceptable accuracy for lunar and planetary exploration. If so, this will facilitate the design of lower-cost, light-weight rovers, which will make it feasible to launch a team of rovers for wide area exploration.","There will be many potential terrestrial applications for a Bayesian VO system. Although GPS-IMU systems can work well in open outdoor settings, GPS is degraded or unavailable in indoor settings or in outdoor areas with significant tree cover. A navigation system combining a GPS and an IMU with Bayesian VO could provide continuous operation in all environments. The success of this project should lay the groundwork for low-cost, low-power, light-weight integrated navigation systems for robots and autonomous vehicles operating in a wide range of environments.One potential market for this technology is the Department of Defense (DoD). Congress has given DoD a mandate that by 2020 30% of ground vehicles should be robotic. An accurate, low-cost VO system should allow many of these vehicles to be semi-autonomous, enabling only supervisory control for many missions.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Perception/Sensing"

The radiometry based pose localization alone will exhaustively study the combination of satellite networks and terrestrial networks to extract the maximal information for the purpose of localization. The vision system will use terrain matching allowing for a global pose estimation capability independent of external infrastructure like satellites or beacons. The overall system will allow low level information exchange between radiometry and vision and provide fault tolerance to remove the influence of faulty sensor data. The proposal aims to create a component based end-to-end plug-and-play architecture which looks at the minutiae of a localization module to create a rugged technology upon which other systems like navigation can be built.","NASA is poised towards missions increasing in frequency and complexity to Moon, Mars and to farther reaches of the solar system. The requirement for a localization system which allows for close to plug-and-play functionality for the sensors is important. The different types of mobile units on the lunar surface might each have unique sets of sensors. A modular system with proven capability will allow for widespread adapting of the technology allowing for a sustained funding and technology maturation. The multi-component localization system will allow the position estimates to be robust.","A technology that augments a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) would find widespread commercial value. GNSS systems give intermittent, inaccurate or no service in places such as urban canyons, indoors, tunnels or remote regions. There already exist products that utilize terrestrial radiometry signals along with GNSS to provide a better service. However, further augmentation of vision based terrain matching or local radiometric readings would improve the accuracy of the GNSS system and allow it to work in remote areas as well. Also, the sub-modules of sensor fusion, terrain matching and fault context learning have commercial value of their own. Terrain matching based localization from vision on ground robots has tremendous applications in the robotics industry allowing for robots to better localize indoors enabling products in huge markets like civilian service robots with applications such as assistive robots in hospitals.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Perception/Sensing"

Some missions require more accurate estimates than others, but nearly all missions need some type of orbit determination.   IST-Rolla seeks to provide highly accurate algorithms that do not overpower the spacecraft's computer.Many new, powerful algorithms exist such as the particle filter and the unscented Kalman filter, but most of them involve integrating several state vectors, and those integrations devour the computing power available.  IST-Rolla will implement the è-D technique, the cost based filter (CBF), and the neural network estimator for orbit determination(developed by IST-Rolla Engineers) and analyze the results.  These filters are nonlinear and might provide better accuracy than the extended Kalman filter (EKF) which is widely used, without being computationally cumbersome as the particle filter and unscented Kalman filter.The theta-D technique approximates the solution to the filter-related Ricatti Equation.  The CBF is an attempt to formulation of the filter under an 'optimal' framework. The neural network estimator works to estimate the modeling errors online so that the estimates become more accurate.","The algorithms provided by IST-Rolla, the theta-D, CBF and neural network estimator, will be set up so that the end user can provide the current estimate and the measurements, then the filter will adjust to those measurements and provide an estimate.  This will be packaged into a C code, and an attempt will be made to create a filtering toolbox for MATLAB as well.  These steps will allow the end user to apply and adapt these filters and with the analysis provided by IST-Rolla in Phase I and Phase II, the user will know exactly what to expect from the algorithms.  The accuracy and efficiency will be a valuable asset to NASA's repertoire of orbit determination technologies.","Most of the applications for NASA apply here as well.  Once packaged, these algorithms will provide a powerful tool to spacecraft designers and will be easy to implement and test.  IST-Rolla strives to make all commercial products as user friendly,  and applicable in as many cases as possible. Furthermore, these set of algorithms along with the EKF, the unscented Kalman filter will be made into a tool box that can be sold to educational organizations for teaching courses on estimation and orbit determination.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

First, wepropose to use numerical parameter continuation methods to assist incomputation of trajectories in complicated dynamical situations.Numerical parameter continuation methods have been used extensively tocompute a menagerie of structures in dynamical systems including fixedpoints, periodic orbits, simple bifurcations (where the structure ofthe dynamics changes), Hopf bifurcations (where periodic orbits arecreated), invariant manifolds, hetero/homoclinic connections betweeninvariant manifolds, etc.  Perhaps more importantly for the currentwork, such methods have already proven their worth in flight dynamicsproblems, especially those having to do with the complicated dynamicsnear libration points.  Second, we propose to use advanced filteringtechniques and representations of probability density functions toappropriately compute and manage the uncertainty in the trajectories.While advanced methods for understanding and leveraging the underlyingdynamics are clearly necessary for effective mission design, planning,and analysis, we contend that they do not suffice.  In particular,they do not, in and of themselves, address the issue of uncertainty.Herein we discuss methods that balance the accuracy of the uncertaintyrepresentation against computational tractability, including adiscussion of the notorious ``curse of dimensionality'' for problemswith large state vectors.  We propose approachs that revolve aroundmodifications of algorithms such as ``log homotopy'' particle filtersand especially Gaussian sum filters.  Finally, we propose to integrateall of the above algorithms into standard NASA software packagesGEONS, GIPSY, and GMAT.","There are several current state-of-the-art software packages thatare clear and direct transition paths for the proposed work.In particular, there are the GPS-Enhanced Onboard Navigation Software(GEONS), the GPS-Inferred Positioning System and Orbit AnalysisSoftware (GIPSY), and the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT).  Of the various packages, GMAT is the most directly applicable and willbe the focus of the Phase I effort.Accordingly, these algorithms will find applicability in anypre-flight mission design, planning, and analysis activities thatutilize these software.  One domain of particular note is space craftmissions in the neighborhood of libration points, where the underlyingdynamics are rather complicated and the effect of the dynamics on thetrajectory uncertainty is important.  Another domain that we see ofprime importance is that of spacecraft formation flying (such as theTerrestrial Planet Finder mission) where, again, the dynamics and theuncertainty play a key role.","The satellite market is large and growing.  For example, analysis firmForecast International is projecting worldwide deliveries of about 262geostationary   or   medium-Earth   orbit  commercial   communicationssatellites by 2019.

These requirements include minimizing weight and volume, increasing of power and brightness, high tolerance to mechanical and acoustic vibrations and ionizing radiation. Solid state lasers provide the best parameters which are necessary for free space optical communications, remote sensing, etc. However, all such lasers require fine alignment and, therefore, are very sensitive to vibrations, thermal gradients, etc. The ideal situation would be if all elements of a laser would be incorporated in the volume of a gain medium. We propose a completely new approach to the problem. Researchers at CREOL have demonstrated that it is possible to produce co-doping of a photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass with Nd. It was found that absorption and luminescence properties of Nd in PTR glass are the same as for all silicate glasses. It is important that this type of silicate glass can be successfully doped with all rare earth ions, e.g. with Nd, Yb, Er, Tm, etc. At the same time, it was shown that PTR glass keeps it photosensitivity. This means that it is possible to record volume holograms in this material. A combination of good lasing properties and phase photosensitivity enables a new approach to all-solid-state laser. It became possible to record volume Bragg gratings in the volume of laser glass. In this case, all alignment will be done in the process of recording and no misalignment is possible in any conditions of exploitation. Thus, the proposed approach enables creation of a monolithic solid state laser. We expect to study luminescence properties and develop a technology of recording Bragg mirrors in the volume of gain medium and demonstrate diode pumped lasing in Phase I project. In the case of success, we expect to study semiconductor crystals precipitation in PTR glass and demonstrate a monolithic pulsed laser in Phase II project.","Practical implementation of our innovation should decrease size of solid state lasers dramatically improve tolerance of these lasers to vibrations, shocks and other mechanical effects. At the same time monolithic lasers with internal volume Bragg resonators will be distinguished by unprecedented opportunity for fine mode selection in both spectral and angular domains.

EO scanners can also be used for very high bandwidth free-space-optical communications between vehicles, satellites, planes, and/or remote platforms.

The highest utility of the proposed pulse shaper is its programability allowing it to deliver different pulse widths and different pulse shapes.  Although this approach to pulse shaping inherently truncates the power of the input pulse, the shaper will find its greatest value in investigating the optimal pulse shape and parameters in a given optical system.  As an added benefit, this technology can be directly morphed into a new type of Q-switch for solid state lasers requiring fewer optics, lower drive voltage and high damage threshold.

In this Phase I project, Nuvotronics is proposing to develop high density low-loss millimeter backplane circuits to package and interconnect components of  future NASA millimeter wave (MMW) radars.  The significance of the innovation primarily lies in three areas: reduction of system size, weight and loss in MMW radars.  The PolyStrata technology is a batch manufacturing process, providing economies of scale and cost reduction for higher volumes, in addition to flexibility in design for various frequencies of interest.  Nuvotronics will design and test select Polystrata interconnects at MMW frequencies of interest, with particular attention to performance over temperature and survivability to launch conditions.  The result of the Phase I research will prove the feasibilty of utlizing the Polystrata MMW backplane technology in future NASA missions, and provide the foundation for full scale development, testing, and prototype delivery during the Phase II project.","Our primary goal in this project is to provide NASA with robust space-capable MMW interconnection technology that is lower cost, lower weight, and has improved performance over current technology.  The initial application is MMW radars for advanced cloud and precipitation measurements and for Mars landing sensors.  Candidate NASA missions are future landers for the Mars Exploration Program and the Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) Mission.  Reducing size and weight of radar instruments will allow more mission capability on each platform, increasing NASA return on investment in these missions.

Each receiver requires I and Q ADCs (analog-to-digital converters) for signal digitizing at >200MHz before further digital processing in the cross-correlators. Power dissipation as well as instrument volume and weight are the most important parameters in space born instruments. Pacific Microchip proposes designing a monolithic array consisting of 20x1-bit ADCs. A serializer will be integrated to reduce the number of outputs from 20 to 1. This will reduce the power per ADC and resolve the problem of wiring congestion where the cross-correlators interface. For further power reduction, Pacific Microchip proposes integrating a novel metastability programming feature into the ADC latches. The clock distribution will also be dramatically simplified. The 2-wire serial I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface will allow all 1800 ADCs to be calibrated and optimized. Phase I work will provide a complete definition, in silico validation of the product, and a hardware proof of concept. The Phase II program will produce a fieldable product. In order to facilitate the commercialization efforts in Phase III, a low cost commercial radiation-tolerant SiGe HTB technology will be used to fabricate the product.","The extra low power ADC arrays with serial outputs featuring power optimization capability depending on the required BER, high quantization frequencies, and convenient control through a two wire interface can be used in many radiometer and interferometer instruments applying passive and active microwave technologies that are under development by NASA in its mission to provide inexpensive data for science, agriculture, geology, weather forecast, climatology, and civil aviation. The potential application of the ADC arrays in space based wireless communication systems promise to lower the cost of exploration data delivery to the users.","The unique characteristics of the proposed ADC array makes it ideal for parallel digitizing applications that require extra low power at a relatively high quantization rate. Oversampling can be used in those cases when a higher resolution of more than one effective number of bits is required. Such ADCs are critical components in multichannel wireless communication systems. Advanced medical electronics require low power ADC arrays for their neural implants. ADC arrays are also required in image sensors and sensor networks still in their design phase. That the ADC array can be implemented using commercial SiGe technology makes it a particularly cost efficient solution. Since we plan to offer the block as an IP, it will fit for integration together with other blocks (both analog and digital) in the system, making the ADC array a cost efficient choice for SoCs.","Data Input/Output Devices; Highly-Reconfigurable; RF; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Ultra-High Density/Low Power"

The local oscillator is based on the recently discovered terahertz emission of a high-power infra-red vertical external-cavity optically-pumped surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) when operated under dual-wavelength emission. The dual IR wavelength separation can be easily controlled by placing a thin etalon in the VECSEL cavity and the THz signal (corresponding to the beat frequency) is generated via a nonlinear periodically-poled lithium niobate crystal placed in the cavity. The VECSEL semiconductor gain element is designed and optimized to generate on the order of kilowatt internal circulating infra-red fields in the VECSEL cavity thereby generating tunable THz power in the milliwatt ranage. It is anticipated that this source will have wide applications within NASA and the broader commercial community.","The VECSEL THz device can be used both as a narrow band frquency stable source for driving heterodyne receivers at key frequencies between 1 and 5 THz (1.4, 1.9, 2.7, 4.7, etc.) or for laboratory sources to characterize THz components, including MMIC's or possibly for active spectrometers in an in-situ environment. Additionally, the proposed source would enable the development of THz array receivers for use in space and suborbital missions, or for atmospheric sounders and planetary landers. For example, the VECSEL THz source could potentially find immediate use on the Stratosphere THz Observstory, SOFIA, and several SMEX/MIDEX mission concepts (eg. STIM, GTO).","The VECSEL THz source has the promise to deliver mW to Watt-level power at frequencies within and beyond the THz gap. While electronic THz sources tend to drop off in power as one enters this gap on the low frequency side, the current VECSEL THz power scales up between linearly and quadratically with increasing frequency. A room temperature mW power laboratory demonstration at 0.765 THz far exceeds the widely published nW-level power demonstrated with room temperature quantum cascade lasers. The VECSEL THz source would have a shoebox size footprint and is both cost and performance competitive with all existing commercial THz technologies.

This innovation will circumvent the need for the user to incorporate separate optics outside the monolith, making the unit even more end-user-ready.","The SHS is far more robust than conventional interferometers, making it the ideal interferometer for space-based applications, where it is better able to survive the vibrations and stresses of launch.

Commercial MCP devices have many desirable properties, such as sensitivity to small amounts of light and excellent position and timing resolution.  MCP production is a mature technology, based largely on techniques and materials developed in the 1970's, and is limited to small area devices. Limitations due to the bulk glass manufacturing technology adversely impact many applications and impair manufacturability.  For example, heavy metal impurities contained within the bulk glass of the MCP limit the achievable dark noise in low signal detection.   In MCP manufacturing, the requisite batch processing restricts flexibility to tailor individual device or small batch performance to specific applications and can often result in poor MCP yield due to variations in composition and poor process control.   In this proposal, we will utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nanometer thin films which has been proven to replicate and improve the component functions of secondary electron emission (SEE) and conductivity on non-traditional glass substrates, to investigate the high gain and low ion feedback capabilities of this technology.  We estimate that the technology stands at TRL 2 at the and expect to be at 4 at end of the Phase 1 contract.","The potential impacts for MCP technology include: substrate independence, ability to manufacture large area detectors, single event detection in a single MCP (no chevron required), greatly improved resolution and direct deposition of opaque photocathodes onto high temperature substrates.  The ability of this technology to directly impact NASA missions is enormous.  These innovations will contribute significantly to an improvement in resolution, a simplification of the optics required and provide the potential to expand the size of the detector.  By significantly improving the functionality and capability of MCPs, it will be possible to deploy a single plate configuration capable of low noise, high resolution counting and imaging that could surpass existing detector performance benchmarks.  With Arradiance's functional nano-film MCP technology, it will be possible to significantly reduce the size, mass, power and cost of detection so that instruments can be flown on smaller, more affordable spacecraft with potential benefits for science measurement capabilities so that NASA development programs can meet multiple mission needs and make the best use of limited resources.","Major market opportunities for thin-film functionalized, alternative substrate MCPs include Special Nuclear Material detection at ports and shipboard, large area photon and particle detection, enhancements over traditional MCPs, Channel Electron Multipliers, and Photomultiplier tubes in analytical applications and military and commercial Night Vision.

The compact thermometer consists of a miniature DC SQUID susceptometer with a dilute paramagnetic alloy deposited in one of the two series-configured gradiometric SQUID pickup loops that form the SQUID inductance. Directly sensing the magnetic signal with the SQUID eliminates losses that would otherwise occur by transformer-coupling the signal to a remotely located SQUID, usually operating at a higher temperature and consequently with a higher noise floor. In addition, a novel superconducting flux concentrator deposited on top of the paramagnetic alloy homogenizes and concentrates the magnetic flux density in the paramagnet and reduces the inductance of the pickup coil, both of which improve the sensitivity and signal to noise ratio as compared with previous miniature susceptometer designs. The innovative magnetic thermometer design is expected to achive a temperature resolution well below 1 µK/Hz½.","Several potential NASA missions stand to benefit from the proposed magnetic thermometer development effort, in particular missions that include instrumentation with arrays of cryogenic detectors requiring precision temperature control for a variety of spectroscopy applications.

All of these detector applications require precision temperature control for proper operation of the detector arrays. Monitoring the temperature at the end of a cold finger or snout where the detector arrays typically are located is very difficult using a conventional resistive thermometer, which also can produce erroneously high readings due to self-heating effects. Noise thermometers are superior in this regard, but their slow response time (~10 s) and limited resolution (~1%) make these thermometers less attractive for precision temperature measurements.

Nitrous oxide is an important species in Earth science research. It is one of the four principal greenhouse gases that result from human activities. It is the primary source gas for nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere, a useful dynamical tracer and a powerful greenhouse gas. It is the only long-lived atmospheric tracer of human perturbations of the global nitrogen cycle. Atmospheric mixing ratios for nitrous oxide are around 320 parts-per-billion (ppb). Though it's atmospheric concentration is much smaller than that of the most cited green house gas carbon dioxide, it is an effective greenhouse gas having a Global Warming Potential of 296 over a 100-year time span. Vista Photonics proposes to develop a compact, low weight, highly sensitive, in situ monitor for nitrous oxide.","The targeted sensor platform is a compact, ultra-sensitive device for Earth science research. It will allow in situ monitoring of atmospheric nitrous oxide in a variety of surface and airborne applications. This sensor generation will be applicable to NASA's Airborne Science program. Because a substantial part of nitrous oxide emission stems from the oceans, the proposed sensor will impact NASA's Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry, and Applied Sciences programs, including the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). The sensor versatility will allow detailed studies of emissions from selected sources. The compact and highly sensitive instrumentation will substantially increase the possibilities of atmospheric nitrous oxide research. It will also be valuable for calibration and validation of satellite measurements that are routinely performed.","The nitrous oxide sensor will be the basis to develop general devices for highly reliable, sensitive monitoring and/or detection of different gas species.  The small and ultra-sensitive sensor generation will be broadly deployable.

This proposal focuses on the development of a detection system specifically for the collection, speciation and identification of gas phase and aerosolized organics. The proposed portable system will be approximately 1/10 the size and 1/5 the cost of traditional bench top analytical units and will be capable of sample collection and battery operation without the need for compressed bottled gas.  The Seacoast system will integrate its proprietary chemicapacitive sensor array technology and commercial sensors with a preconcentration/chromatography system, combining selectivity from a diverse sensor array with a miniature sampling system for amplified sensitivity. The specific components will be: 1) vapor collection pump, 2) sample preconcentrator capable of being heated quickly and in stages, 3) capillary column to separate the chemicals released from the preconcentrator and provide selectivity, 4) the chemical sensor array containing Seacoast's chemoselective microcapacitors or ""chemicapacitors"" and metal-oxide-based detectors, 5) integrated user interface. The system will be designed to be modular so as to allow further expansion with other sensor technologies.

This device will be designed to be deployed on oceanographic platforms, such as moored buoys, or autonomous vehicles of the type presently used by our collaborator Dr. Needoba at the NSF Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction.  Our microflow cytomer will be optimized for low power consumption and autonomous long-endurance operations. Previous flow cytometers designed for at-sea applications are physically large and have considerable consumable needs.  While the core of these instruments may be small, they require ancillary systems that drastically increase their size, weight, and power consumption.  In order to reduce size and power consumption, our mFCM will operate without any pump.  We will rely on sea motion (either waves or motion of the vehicle) to drive the fluid (sample and sheath) through our cytometer.  The flow velocity will be unsteady and at times may be severely pulsed.  This mode of operation would normally be considered unacceptable, as it would drastically affect the flow characteristics such as sheathing, as well as phytoplankton size and density measurements.  However, our device will include an integrated optical flow velocity measurement capability that will remediate these shortcomings.  The complexity associated with this velocity measurement capability, and the related power consumption, is only a small fraction of that of a pump-operated system.  Thus the practical challenges of oceanic deployments will be significantly reduced.Expenditure of sheathing fluid will be minimized using advanced three-dimensional microfluidic design features; or potentially completely eliminated using a sheath-less design.Extreme robustness will be insured by creating all elements (microfluidic optics, structural frame) in a single fused silica monolith providing permanent and exact alignment of all elements.","We will develop a submersible micro flow cytometer for quantitative detection of phytoplankton in response to NASA call for sensors for monitoring phytoplankton and harmful algal blooms.  Marine phytoplankton account for 50% of global photosynthesis.  For some time scientists have employed satellites to measure the amount and distribution of chlorophyll a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean. More recently NASA's Aqua satellite has been monitoring red-light fluorescence emitted by phytoplankton.  This fluorescence reveals insights about the physiology of marine plants and the efficiency of their photosynthesis. The amount of fluorescence increases when phytoplankton are under stress, for example from a lack of iron.  When phytoplankton cells are iron-starved, additional solar energy is emitted as fluorescence rather than being transferred through the photosynthetic pathway.  Thus, chlorophyll measurements indicate phytoplankton biomass, and fluorescence provides insight into how well they are functioning in the ecosystem.  The space-based instruments must be calibrated, and the algorithms applied to the collected raw data need to be validated.Our sea-based micro flow cytometer will provide sea-truth date to give an independent verification and confirm the validity of the data collected using spaced-based platforms.  Its low fabrication cost will allow for the global deployment of numerous units, thus enhancing NASA's Earth science research capabilities.","The goal of this program is to fabricate a submersible micro flow cytometer (mFCM) for quantitative detection of phytoplankton.  In situ detection of phytoplankton is a presently a niche market mainly directed at climate research.  This market will grow dramatically if the mFCM price was significantly reduced and its deployment simplified.  For example, NOAA has deployed ARGO, a global array of 3,000 free-drifting profiling floats that measures the temperature and salinity of the upper 2000 m of the ocean. These buoys could be equipped with our inexpensive mFCM.In addition, there are numerous potential customers (US government and commercial) that could use small inexpensive and robust microflow cytometers. The Navy has interest in better methods of detecting phytoplankton blooms, as they can interfere with submarine navigation. They are also interested in water quality issues associated with coastal assets.There are major developments to pursue the use algae as a biofuel source. This emerging industry will need a means to monitor algae growth, which could be served by a variant of our microflow cytometers. There are also new proposed water standards that call for algae monitoring (for example Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament). These regulations affect many aquatic environments, such as lakes, river, beaches, and estuaries.   Altogether, we believe that tens of thousand of microflow cytometers could be employed to monitor algae and phytoplankton.",Biochemical; Biomass Production and Storage; Biomolecular Sensors; Optical; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors

The thermal instrument is based on thermopile detectors that are intrinsically radiation hard to at least 10 Mrad; however, the thermopile readout ASIC needs to be hardened to tolerate the radiation sources of the JEO mission. Black Forest Engineering proposes on Phase I to modify existing thermopile readout circuitry using radiation hardened by design techniques (RHBD) to tolerate the JEO mission radiation sources. The readout application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) when developed on Phase II and combined with JPL thermopiles will meet the thermal instrument requirements of the JEO.","The technology developed on this SBIR will create an improved thermopile readout to meet broadband infrared data collection in space. Thermal detectors (such as thermopiles), while typically less sensitive than quantum detectors, are useful when the combination of long wavelength signals and relatively high temperature operation makes quantum detectors unsuitable. Thermal detectors are also appropriate in applications requiring flat spectral response over a broad wavelength range. Specifically, a major NASA application is the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) that will provide a better understanding as to how gas giant planets and their satellites form and evolve. The Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) is the NASA element of the EJSM. The readout ASIC, when developed on Phase II and combined with JPL thermopiles, will meet the thermal instrument requirements of the JEO and future planetary science missions.","Thermopile detectors have some desirable characteristics that make them better suited for certain applications than bolometers and pyroelectric/ferroelectric detectors. They are passive devices, require no electrical bias, and generate a voltage output that is proportional to the input radiation signal. They are also typically uncooled and are insensitive to substrate temperature variations, making temperature stabilization unnecessary. They are highly linear, which combined with their insensitivity to substrate temperature, make them ideal for accurate radiometry. Finally, they require no optical chopper and they have negligible 1/f noise, provided the readout amplifier has high input impedance. These properties make them well suited for broadband spectral detection applications.

Current instruments for such in-situ analysis, however, require that geological samples be brought to the surface by a sample acquisition tool and subsequently processed and presented to the analyzer. This model has significant limitations with regard to science yield: evaporation of volatile molecules before reaching the instrument, loss of stratigraphic information, sample bias, and cross-contamination. Furthermore, sophisticated sample acquisition, processing and handling mechanisms required to operate in uncontrolled, dusty environments are expensive and failure-prone.We therefore propose an alternative: bring the instrument to the sample. Specifically, we propose development of a fiber-coupled laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) system, integrated into a 3m-class drill. LIBS uses a high-energy laser pulse to create a plasma on the surface of the material under test; the atomic emissions are collected by a spectrometer and yield elemental composition and basic molecular information. DIHeDRAL will allow profiling of an entire borehole wall, centimeter by centimeter, 360 degrees, from the top to the bottom. The proposed Phase I work focuses on the downhole sensor head, including modeling, analysis, and breadboarding of the sensor head optics. The resulting validated sensor head design will be fed forward into Phase II, which will culminate in the integration and test of a simplified DIHeDRAL brassboard prototype to a depth of 1m in Honeybee's dedicated drill testing thermal-vacuum chamber.","The primary application of DIHeDRAL is in-situ analysis for landed robotic missions to the lunar poles. As outlined in the National Research Council's report on Scientific Context for Exploration of the Moon, the principal goals of such missions would require detection of water and other volatiles present in the regolith, elemental analysis of the regolith, and establishment of geochronology and bombardment history. LIBS would provide information on elemental composition and water content, and other fiber-coupled instruments could ultimately be incorporated into the same platform, depending on the requirements of the mission. Possibilities include Raman spectroscopy, which would provide more sophisticated analysis of organics and other molecules; and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF), which could provide radioisotopic information for geochronology. In this scenario, the high-powered LIBS laser doubles as a sort of sample preparation tool; firing a burst of ""cleaning shots"" exposes fresh sample (including volatiles that may have been lost from the outer surface layer). The DIHeDRAL instrument architecture could also be applied to robotic Mars missions. The focus in this case would likely be on astrobiology as opposed to resource characterization, involving Raman detection and analysis of organics trapped in Mars polar ice.","The successful integration of a LIBS instrument into a drill string or downhole probe would have several significant commercial applications. In the pit mining and quarrying industry, a downhole LIBS probe could be used for rapid rock and ore characterization using existing blast holes. This would allow more streamlined planning of operations and would result in less misclassified material. In defense and homeland security, a version of DIHeDRAL could be used for detection of buried explosives, such as land mines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and unexploded ordnance (UXO).",Optical

Implementation of precision spacecraft formations requires distribution of sensing, communication, and actuation capabilities between the spacecraft composing  formation. Distributed architecture demands that each spacecraft maintains an estimate of states of other members of the formation for mission coordination, reconfiguration, and collision avoidance. We propose to design distributed estimation architectures that are able to provide a formation control system with reliable formation state estimates and monitor the formation components for faults and failures. LaunchPoint will extend the existing state-of-the-art techniques and tailor them to the specific NASA needs. The proposed design methods will provide the distributed estimators with a well-defined level of accuracy and guarantee stability of the complete distributed closed-loop system. Communication constraints and uncertainties for inter-spacecraft communication links will be explicitly considered and the developed design methods will allow trade-off between communication complexity and the formation performance. The developed methods will be applied for design of the distributed system for one of the NASA missions. The designed estimator will be tested in simulations for the practical mission scenarios and with the presence of realistic disturbances, communication, and sensor noises.","A variety of future NASA science missions require utilization of space deployable instruments with baselines and apertures much higher than achievable physical structures. The only practical approach for implementation of these missions is with precision spacecraft flying formations. Precision spacecraft formation implements a virtual structure where the sensing capabilities of the mission instrumentation are distributed between the spacecraft of the formation. Such missions as Terrestrial Planet Finder, X-ray interferometer, and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna can be implemented only with the precision spacecraft formation control technologies. Resolution capabilities of several Earth science missions designed for collection of terrestrial data from the Earth's orbit would also significantly increase with the implementation of synthetic aperture radars.

LaunchPoint proposes to develop the distributed architecture for formation control systems.","Design methods for distributed formation control architectures can find their applications in many commercial and military technologies. Precision flying formation spacecraft can be used in synthetic aperture radars for high-resolution surveillance of ground targets. They can also implement synthetic communication satellites for high-quality service of specified geographical regions. Synthetic formation implemented with several satellites will offer a unique flexibility in implementation of various data collection tasks. The distributed sensing nature of the spacecraft formation will increase system robustness, allow replacement, reconfiguration, and upgrades of new functional units to the synthetic data collection instrument.

Busek's fluid microvalve, developed for colloid thruster operation on NASA's ST7 project, has demonstrated resolving fluid flow to 2.5 picoliters/s over the 0-60 microliter/s regime for 1 atm source pressure (delta p); preliminary microvalve gas tests indicate the ability to resolve gas flows to 10^-2 sccm over the 0-.25 sccm regime for similar delta p.  The valve architecture, when used with smaller available orifice diameters, provides 1-2 orders of magnitude lower flowrates.The focus of the effort shall be improvement of several design aspects in Busek's existing valve design, upgrading the design for high pressure gas service, and novel repackaging into a volume of approximately 4cm^3.","Potential NASA applications for the proposed technology include the following:Enhanced precision control and decreased valve power consumption for cold gas thrusters.

The proposed driver architecture will drastically reduce power consumption and size. Based on parameters measured using an existing 993-actuator DM that BMC developed for NASA in support of the Terrestrial Planet Finding Coronagraph program, and using projections from preliminary experiments conducted for this proposal, we predict at minimum a hundred-fold reduction in power consumption in the prototype driver to be produced in Phase I, and a tenfold reduction in size, while maintaining high precision, reducing electronics driver cost, and reducing interconnection complexity. Additional reductions in power consumption and another tenfold reduction in size will follow in Phase II work when the core design is transferred to implementation in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) format.Phase I work involves collaboration between BMC and Boston University (BU). A leading electrostatics research group at BU will develop a novel multiplexed high-voltage driver architecture that comprises a significant departure from previous MEMS DM drivers. A single D/A converter and high-voltage amplifier module will drive the entire array through a row-column addressing scheme. This approach will reduce operational power consumption by two orders of magnitude from ~80W to ~0.8W. We will also integrate the DM and the mirror into a compact package. The MEMS DM and the electronics will be co-mounted on the same PC board. This will reduce driver volume by an order of magnitude, from ~20,000cc to 2000cc. It will also eliminate the need for high density cabling and buffer amplifiers used to drive them, simplifying system operation and further reducing power consumption and size.","MEMS DMs can be used for correction of quasi-static aberrations in primary optics due to manufacturing and thermal variations in space based telescopes.

A universal benefit is reduced connections, which leads to more compact and less costly electronics. In addition, the following are specific targeted applications and how they are best suited for this development. Other targeted applications include:Astronomy/surveillance: BMC has had success developing electronics for arrays up to 4096 elements for the Gemini Planet Imager. In that and other astronomical applications, especially multi-object-adaptive optics, the availability of compact drivers will simplify wavefront control system integration substantially. Optical communication:  In long-range secure communication, BMC MEMS DMs  have found substantial commercial demand that has resulted in numerous system sales. Through the use of multiplexing, the electrical connections can be reduced, making the systems more compact and less costly.Biological imaging /vision science:  For the imaging field, a large impediment to adding adaptive optics to optical instruments is the cost of the mirror technology and associated electronics.

As the scale of batch fabricated, polysilicon surface micromachined MEMS DMs increases to thousands of actuators the associated increase in devices size limits the achievable yield due to micro-scale defects introduced during the manufacturing processes and large unpowered surface figure errors. In Phase I research, major obstacles preventing scalability of microfabrication processes to large arrays will be overcome by developing a polysilicon deposition process to reduce and control defect density to maximize the yield of a 1027 segment Tip-Tilt Piston DM with 3081 actuators and to determine the practical limits of the tool set and compatibility of this process for the manufacture of MEMS DMs with >104 actuators. Manufacturing processes to minimize unpowered surface figure errors will be developed to (1) reduce substrate curvature induced DM surface figure errors through control of deposition and polishing processes to balance the front and backside film thickness, and (2) reduce polishing induced DM surface figure errors by modifying the device wire routing layout design to maintain uniform pattern density across the device area to achieve uniform material removal rates in the polishing process. Successful completion of the Phase 1 work will enable the design and manufacture of a 1027 Tip-Tilt-Piston deformable mirror required for NASA's visible nulling coronagraph instrument in a Phase 2 effort.","The primary application for small stroke, high precision deformable mirrors is that of space-based imaging and in specific, exo-planet research.  As telescopes and coronagraphs are constructed, they will require control of light using adaptive optics over a larger aperture.   By expanding the size of DM devices, instruments such as PECO, ACCESS, EPIC, DaVinci, and FKSI will be able to shape more light using less hardware and less stages.  Given the current constraints on fabrication technology, it is necessary to develop new methods of manufacture to accommodate for larger arrays which also require more channels for control.  The desire for this type of enhanced technology within the astronomy community has been detailed in a report issued from the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, an influential consortium which is a voice in the United States of the industry at-large.","There are a range of Government agencies and commercial markets that can take advantage of small stroke, high precision deformable mirrors.  One application is for large, ground-based telescopes.  By expanding the size of DM devices, these observatories will be able to shape more light using less hardware and less stages.  Another application is long-range optical communications (lasercomm) systems for use in satellites, airborne vehicles and ground-based nodes requiring a secure, dependable connection.  By creating larger, higher-precision arrays, not only is it possible to send more data at faster rates, but the distance between communication points can be extended due to enhanced error correction capabilities.  A third application is for correction of quasi-static aberrations in primary optics in surveillance satellites  due to manufacturing and thermal variations.  Adding to its advantages of high-resolution capability, the light weight nature of BMC MEMS DM technology allows the payload to be reduced, a high priority of military satellite projects.  A final application is that of laser pulse-shaping for material characterization and laser marking and machining.  By creating larger arrays, control of the pulsed beams can be enhanced.

This is because no air bearing  spindle is available with load capacity for the weight of the optical component and the required heavy part holding fixture.Large diamond turning machines today have oil hydrostatic spindles which are not useful for very large diamond turning because of excessive heat generation when this type bearing is large enough to have load capacity for very large optics.The viscosity of air is more than three orders of magnitude less than oil, therefore the heating of large diameter air bearings is very small.The extreme precision required for air bearings is in the realm of optical tolerances.Air bearings utilizing two metal surfaces in close contact fail in large sizes because metals weld together in the event of the slightest touch.Porous graphite air bearings do not friction weld in the event of the spindle bearing surface contacting the bearing journal surface.  The porous graphite flow structure provides uniform flow to damp the instability that is a problem with air hydrostatic bearings.This proposal combines porous graphite air bearing technology with optical fabrication methods to build a new type of vertical axis air bearing for diamond turning machine use.  The goal of this Phase I SBIR effort will be to demonstrate the technology with a sub-scale air bearing spindle.  The Phase I and II efforts will be coordinated with internal R&D efforts of DOS and Moore Tool Co.

Measurement of large telescope structures and optics requires both high accuracy and non-contact technology. Due to the non-contact, stand-off nature of this technology, this system can measure optics and provide nearly real-time feedback to figuring/polishing instruments without removing the part from the spindle or other optical grinding or polishing setup. For advanced levels of integration and test, the proposed large-volume metrology technology would allow fast, non-contact measurement of mirror rigid body alignment and prescription (i.e., radius, conic, aperture), with no special targets or references on the optic.  This would allow these mirror parameters to be measured with respect to other optics, instruments, or mechanical- and spacecraft-related structures.","Potential post-Phase III NASA applications for this innovation include improved performance and lower cost optical telescope assembly and instrument development.

For JDEM, telescope mirror fabrication and integration capabilities would be greatly enhanced.  The scanner would measure the prescription and coarse figure of the large (~2m) mirror during fabrication and, after fabrication, characterize its final prescription and alignment to the telescope metering structure, with little or no custom fiducialization.  The mechanical alignment of the JDEM instrument/camera would meet tighter specifications.

The core of the instrument is a very large (3.2 meter diameter) Wolter I optic, to be assembled from approximately 13,000 individual elements.  Each element will, in turn, be created by 'slumping' glass over a precision mandrel, of which there must be in excess of 700.  Inaddition to the very large size of the mandrels (up to 1.6 meter radius), figure and size tolerances are exceedingly tight, ranging from 2 nanometers (axial figure) to 200 nanometers (radius variation).  The combination of size, accuracies, production rate requirements and the number of individual component designs defy standard optical metrology techniques.While polishing equipment that can meet these tolerances exists, the polishers must be controlled by continuous or near continuous (process intermittent) feedback.  In this effort we propose to develop a unique ""point-defined"" metrology instrument that can be incorporated into the polishing machine itself, to control the manufacturing process to the required levels of accuracy.  In Phase 1 we will develop conceptual designs for both stand-alone and on-machine instrumentation.  In Phase 2 we will develop a stand-alone metrology instrument, and in Phase 3 we will fully incorporate the technology onto a commercial polishing instrument.","The advancements and enhancements to mandrel polishing capability resulting from the proposed research will improve the cost, delivery, and quality of surfaces for missions currently using or planning to use glass slumping to form mirrors on precision mandrels.

Specifically those applications that are susceptible to small angle scatter sometimes referred to as flare.  The International X-Ray Observatory (IXO), consisting of 361 grazing incidence nested, azimuthally segmented shell mirrors, is susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors.  These thin (0.4mm) mirrors are produced through a thermal slumping technique where a thin glass substrate replicates the shape of a mandrel (fused quartz or stainless steel).  The current budgeted error for the IXO mandrels is 1.4nm rms over the 2  20mm spatial frequency range.

An example is the specification for the Jovian planet finder optical system was less than 1nm rms in the 4  50cycles/aperture range.","Non-NASA commercial applications include high energy laser systems, EUV optics (lithography), imaging systems and X-ray synchrotrons.  High energy laser applications, such as Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors.  The MSF errors are a source of damaging intensity, specifically in the region of 120μm  33mm.  In EUV lithography, flare is a significant problem.  Flare is directly associated with mid-spatial frequency error.  The mid-spatial frequency errors cause light to scatter into small angles and reduce image contrast.  The specific mid-spatial frequency region of interest to the EUV lithography community is between 1μm  2mm.  The mid-spatial frequency error scales as 1/(lambda)^2, which causes an increasingly significant problem as the lithography industry heads toward shorter and shorter wavelength systems.",Ceramics; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials

During lunar day, the LHP transfers the heat to the radiator for rejection. During the fourteen-day-long lunar night, the sink temperature drops, lowering LHP and WEB/battery temperatures. Without a variable thermal link, the LHP will continue to remove heat during the night, cooling the electronics/batteries to unacceptably low temperatures. For spacecraft applications, a small heater is typically attached to the LHP reservoir to shutoff the LHP, preventing excessive cooling of the WEB/battery temperatures. The battery mass penalty to shutoff the LHP through the 14-day-long lunar night is large and must be avoided. This project will develop a LHP incorporating a passive thermal control valve, eliminating the shut-off power requirements. The valve will be installed in the vapor line to selectively route vapor to the radiator during daytime and directly to the compensation chamber (bypassing the radiator) during night, thereby maintaining electronics/battery temperatures.  Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the thermal control valve as a varying thermal link.  Phase II will fabricate and test a LHP with a thermal control valve, bringing the technology to TRL 6.","A typical application is for the thermal management of the electronics and batteries for the NASA Anchor Node Mission for the International Lunar Network (ILN).  The ILN could be powered by either solar or a radioisotope power system.  In either case, electronics and batteries will face the same thermal challenges to establish a variable thermal link between lunar day and night environments.   Rovers will be used for exploration of Mars and the lunar surface.  Their mission success will depend upon the electronics and batteries being maintained with a narrow temperature band.  The Loop Heat Pipe with Thermal Control Valve will eliminate the shut-down power required for conventional LHPs, which has an extreme mass penalty.","LHPs with TCV's can also be used in commercial and military satellites in cases where the radiator sink conditions change and there is a need to maintain the electronics within a precise temperature control band.  The valve could be designed to throttle back and reduce the heat rejected to the space sink conditions, reducing the electrical power required for current LHP thermal control schemes.  A second application is cooling of commercial and military aircraft components, specifically for UAVs.  While operating at high altitudes during day operations, the LHP can reject the thermal load to the aircraft skin or forced convection sink.  At night and colder ambient temperatures, the TCV could throttle back to limit heat rejection and maintain electronics temperatures.",Cooling

NASA engineers are challenged with developing innovative reduction algorithms and models that enable rapid analysis while retaining adequate accuracy. To address this need, we propose to develop and demonstrate innovative Model Order Reduction (MOR) software to automatically generate nonlinear reduced thermal models for spacecraft analysis. The underlying principle is to project the original large models onto a characteristic, low-dimensional subspace (SVD or Krylov subspace), yielding reduced models with markedly low computational orders. In Phase I, a MOR engine encapsulating carefully selected algorithms, a reduced model solver, and a verification module, along with facile data export interfaces will be developed in an integrated software environment. Proof-of-concept will be established by broad case studies, in which reduced models will be analyzed and compared against large model analysis using CFDRC-developed multi-physics simulation tool CFD-ACE+ in terms of accuracy, speed, and resource use. Phase II will focus on enhancing the MOR engine, optimizing the software structure, and expanding interfaces to other NASA-relevant tools.","The proposed Model Order Reduction software will deliver NASA engineers a valuable tool to (1) perform rapid and computationally affordable thermal analysis for better understanding of design spaces, (2) develop advanced, reliable thermal control strategies for spacecrafts and instruments, and (3) properly arrange test procedures for rational use of instruments and facilities. The success in the proposed research will markedly shrink the development cycles of spacecrafts at reduced cost.","Among the non-NASA applications, the proposed software will find use in various engineering sections, including semiconductor industry, combustion, power and aerodynamics industry, chemical plants, biomedical companies, micro-electronical-mechanical systems (MEMS) and microfluidics manufacturers among many others.

Heat from the roughly 64 General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules must be delivered to the convertor with minimal ÄT. The cooling system must be shutoff during the transit to Venus without overheating the GPHS modules. This program will develop an alkali metal Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP) integrated with a two-phase heat collection/transport package (HTP) between the GPHS stack and the convertor.  The VCHP allows the Stirling converter to be shutoff during transit to Venus. The two-phase HTP minimizes the temperature drop between the multi-GPHS stack and the heater head.  The HTP is required due to the large number of modules that must be interfaced, and the low allowable ÄT between the heater head temperature of 1200oC and the maximum allowable iridium cladding temperature in the GPHS (1266oC). The HTP also improves the convertor efficiency by decreasing the temperature non-uniformities at the high heat flux interface of the hot end of the heater head.  It is superior to pumped liquid systems for transferring heat, because it eliminates the low efficiency liquid metal pump that they require.  Other advantages of the system include low mass and volume, and a high degree of redundancy.","The immediate application is for a long-lived Venus lander that contains a Stirling system integrated with a large number of GPHS modules.  The thermal management system will efficiently collect the heat from the GPHS modules and deliver it to the Stirling engine. The thermal management system will allow the Stirling convertors to be shutoff during the transit to Venus. More generally, the systems developed on this program are applicable to all NASA missions with high powered radioisotope systems that require a large number of GPHS modules. Beside the Venus mission applications, the technology is applicable to lunar missions for both long (habitation modules) and short duration (International Lunar Network).","One commercial application is VCHP heat exchangers in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  The current scheme uses a bypass valve, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control, requires power, and has a large pressure drop.

Metamaterials have shown great promise as efficient narrow-band selective emitters that can provide the improved spectral match between emitter and converter. To address the opportunity afforded by a novel metamaterials-based TPV emitter film, Nanohmics Inc. and Dr. Gennady Shvets at The University of Texas at Austin propose to develop the TAloNTM Emitter, a high-temperature,  ultra-thin thermal emitter of infrared radiation for TPVs. Despite its simplicity and amenability to straightforward fabrication, our design encompasses all the advantages mentioned above: extremely highly selective emission, tunability of emission frequency, sub-wavelength size, and large field enhancement inside the metamaterial. Films will be constructed using the highly scalable process of ""roll-to-roll"" deposition and nanoimprint lithography using highly thermally stable materials such as tungsten and aluminum nitride.",thermophotovoltaicsthermal emittersselective band thermal emittersnarrow band thermal emitters,thermophotovoltaicsthermal emittersselective band thermal emittersnarrow band thermal emitters,Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Nuclear Conversion; Photovoltaic Conversion; Thermoelectric Conversion

Additionally, a solar electric EMPT system would dramatically increase the capability and reduce the travel time of an asteroid or Martian moon sample and return mission due to the variable-power, low-mass propulsion system. The EMPT employs a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF) to produce large plasma currents inside a conical thruster creating a plasmoid that is magnetically isolated from the thruster walls. The intensified gradient magnetic field from the plasmoid together with the large plasma currents result in an enormous body force that expels the plasmoid at high velocity.

The objective of this proposed research is to develop a ultra-compact, hybrid power module packaging technology based on the use of double leadframes and direct leadframe-to-chip transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding that allows device operation up to 450oC. The Phase I research plan will include: 1) material selection; 2) electrical, mechanical, and thermal design of a half-bridge prototype module; 3) packaging process development using volume manufacturing processes; 4) stress and thermal modeling and analysis; 5) material characterization under high temperature and high temperature cycling; and 6) cost estimation and comparative analysis with competing technologies. The unique advantages of this innovative solution include very high current carrying capability, low package parasitic impedance, low thermo-mechanical stress at high temperatures, double-side cooling, and modularity for easy system-level integration. The new power module will have a very small form factor with 3-5X reduction in size and weight from the prior art.","Wide operating temperature power semiconductors for space power systems and science missions such as Earth Orbiting, Venus, Europa, Titan and Lunar Quest.","The proposed concept will have a profound impact on power electronics and energy conversion technologies and help to conserve energy and environment, as well as to reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuels. Widespread use of efficient and cost-effective power electronics technology can potentially result in a 35% reduction in energy consumption. Power electronics, along with computer and microprocessor technology, impacts nearly every sector of the U.S. economy including automobiles, electric utility, pollution control, communications, computer systems, consumer electronics, and factory automation. For commercial applications, the proposed new packaging technology can be used in its current form or scaled down to medium or conventional temperature range with a significantly reduced cost, making it a viable and economical option for large commercial markets such as hybrid electric vehicles, renewable energy conversion, and power supplies.",Power Management and Distribution; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Ultra-High Density/Low Power

(RSI) proposes the Gyroscopic Inertial Micro-Balance Azimuth Locator (GIMBAL) program to use an innovative encapsulated spinning wheel micro-gyroscope as a Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) actuator for small spacecraft use.  While macro-size gyroscopes, including fiber ring gyros, have achieved navigation-grade performance, Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) gyros have been limited to rate-grade performance, particularly in long-term bias drift.  This is often attributable to quadrature error, which is a result of cross-coupling between drive and sense axes (Yazdi 1998).  GIMBAL is particularly suited to addressing this, since it does not rely on the vibratory structure common in MEMS gyros.  Instead, it uses a true spinning wheel for the proof mass, which will not have any mechanical linkages between axes. This will result in a bias drift much smaller than encountered in current MEMS-sized gyros.  The Phase I GIMBAL program will involve design, fabrication, and test of the key encapsulated micro-gyro technology as well as system design of the GN&C component. In Phase II, the complete gyro sensor will be designed and built, and detailed tests and demonstrations will resolve design issues for the final design. The result will be a GN&C component that will address a critical need in future NASA science missions.","GIMBAL will serve as the gyro sensor in a GN&C system. The emerging use of small satellites for a variety of science missions has created a need for very small attitude control systems. Navigation-grade MEMS gyros will be a key component to address this critical small satellite requirement. GIMBAL gyros will operate with much lower bias drift than non-spinning-wheel MEMS gyros, and at much lower impedence, providing intrinsic EMI resistance. GIMBAL is expected to displace the technologies currently in use on small satellites due to these advantages.","Other than the small satellite market, general navigation will be the first larger-scale market, where the high performance will be required and a higher initial unit cost will be acceptable. Once unit costs reduce due to large production quantities, the automotive market will become a viable target. The GIMBAL gyros will be applicable to Government sensing applications ranging from personnel tracking to munitions guidance. In addition to NASA, target U.S. Government customers will be the US Air Force, Army, and Navy (for use in head tracking and navigation), as well as DOD components (SOCOM, for example) that need more specialized tracking capabilities.","Attitude Determination and Control; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Human-Computer Interfaces; Human-Robotic Interfaces; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Micro Thrusters; Perception/Sensing; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors"

VPX supports module to module datarates of 10 Gbps.  VPX supports multiple switch architecture, so redundancy is supported.  With newer large capacity memory components, a high capacity modular architecture is achievable which opens the door for adoption of a commercial standard for space payload and memory systems.","Nearly every NASA mission will require some sort of a memory and processing subsystem.   Earth science data storage units Communication outage recorders for manned space Advanced payload processors for IR, RADAR, LIDAR applications Assisted or autonomous rendezvous and docking processing Reprogrammable software defined radios and MODEMs IP routing and advanced communication systems Image compressionPayload and memory systems are an integral part of any space mission.  The adoption of a commercial standard that can meet the demands of current and future missions will reduce costs, schedule, and risk of these subsystems while increasing the software and hardware reuse from mission to mission.","There are as many non-NASA applications as there are NASA applications for advanced processing and memory systems.  Some of the short term applications include next generation imaging systems, advanced IR starring arrays for missile defense, affordable RADAR sensors, more flexible communications subsystems that support reprogrammable MODEMs, and on-board processing of advanced RF collectors.

In the Navigation-Grade Integrated Micro-Gyroscope (NG-IMG) project, Archangel Systems, Inc. has developed a MEMS IMU called NG-MARS - a spinning mass IMU with navigation-grade performance.  In DARPA's Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) program, Symmetricom, Inc has developed a clock that is 50-100X smaller and lower power than any previous atomic clock technology, while exhibiting short-term stability of y(τ) < 1x10-10/1/2 and long-term drift of < 3 x 10-10/month.NASA-Goddard has constructed a rad-hard GPS called Navigator for the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) program.  Designed for high elliptical orbits (HEO), Navigator uses NASA's Geon algorithms.  Currently Navigator weight and power exceeds R-LAM requirements.  NASA-Goddard colleagues will advise the R-LAM team as they transition Navigator hardware.  Intrinsix Corp. is an ASIC design house skilled in rad-hard mixed-signal design.

One example is the Magnetospheric Multiscale program  HEO mission where GPS signals are weak and intermittent.  The stand-alone IMU and clock will become COTS components in Archangel and Symmetricom product lines and available to NASA and its contractors.  The GEON navigation algorithms will be ported to a low-power rad-hard processor. At the system level, both the enhanced Navigator GPS and R-LAM integrated GPS/IMU/Clock unit will be developed.

Since CPT technology has been demonstrated as a viable solution to providing low-power, high-performance atomic clocks, it makes sense to explore the potential for deploying these units for space operations.  Size, Weight and Power (SWAP) rank among the highest of the critical parameters in the design and fabrication process of a satellite system.  However, the single most critical parameter is perhaps the radiation tolerance of any electronic system.

The IMU Sensor Chip will derive stability from the inertia of the wheel resulting in greater precision and accuracy. During Phase I we propose to integrate the two entities and test the operation of the MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers of the IMU Sensor Chip to demonstrate the benefits of the union.

Creare's miniature reaction wheel has the potential to revolutionize the design and operation of small satellites (i.e., mass from less than 1 kg up to 500 kg).  Currently available reaction wheels are too large and heavy, and miniature reaction wheels do not provide sufficient control authority for use on small satellites.  This primarily results from the need to greatly increase the speed of rotation of the flywheel in order to reduce the flywheel size and mass.  We will achieve this goal by making use of our unique, proprietary, space-qualified, high-speed motor technology to spin the flywheel at a speed much faster than the other known miniature reaction wheels either under development or currently available.  This will enable the fabrication of a miniature reaction wheel with greatly improved performance and smaller size.  Creare is particularly well qualified to lead this effort given our considerable and unique past experience in miniaturizing devices for use in important space missions, our firm's longevity, and the space-qualified fabrication facilities that we maintain.","NASA is interested in reducing the mass and cost while maximizing the scientific return for future NASA missions.   Small satellites are an excellent alternative for achieving these goals.  However, many technologies that have been developed for larger spacecraft are not applicable to small and nano satellites.  To bridge this gap, NASA plans to support innovations in propulsion, power, and guidance, and navigation systems for low-cost small spacecraft.  One of the key enabling technologies is attitude control mechanisms.  Our miniature, high torque, low-vibration reaction wheel promises to meet the needs of small and nano satellites for a high torque, continuous, low mass, low-cost, satellite attitude control.","Past technical advances in small satellites have opened up new markets for small satellites beyond their initial technology demonstration platforms.  These markets include military science and technology; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; remote site communications; polling of unattended sensors; high-resolution Earth observations; and Landsat-class environmental monitoring, and are estimated to potentially result in a $500 million annual market.

A potentially disruptive technology, small satellites are being eyed as platforms for the rapid demonstration of new technologies and important science missions.  Currently, small satellite platforms struggle to balance the three critical tasks of (1) collecting enough power, (2) acquiring data and (3) downlinking that data to ground stations in a way that maximizes mission return.  For these small platforms, which usually do not benefit from steer-able solar arrays or gimbaled antennas and instruments, optimally balancing these three tasks strongly depends on the satellite's attitude control agility.  Spacecraft agility has to do with rapid retargeting, fast transient settling and low jitter pointing control.  Dr. Bong Wie, renowned spacecraft attitude control expert and Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the Iowa State University, has stated that ultimately the ""measure of an agile satellite attitude control system is its ability to collect the maximum data from an area on the Earth that is rich in data-collection opportunities"".  A logical corollary following from this statement would be that to maximize satellite data-collection, system designers should look to increase the satellite's agility.  Furthermore, in addition to data-collection, the other two critical tasks of power collection and data downlink are also maximized as agility is increased.  Honeybee Robotics proposes to develop a low cost, high torque and low jitter satellite attitude control actuator derived from its Tiny Operationally Responsive CMG (TORC) design.  This derivative product would combine two TORC units into a single scissored-pair configuration with SPA compatible interface.  The result, TORC-SP, would be an actuator with the simple control interface of a reaction wheel that offers 1-2 orders of magnitude more torque per unit mass at drastically less power than a reaction wheel.","Small satellites which are low cost and can be delivered in months (as opposed to years), are being eyed as platforms for rapid demonstration of new technologies (e.g., new propulsion, communications, power collection and MEMS technologies) and even important science missions (e.g., earth and space climate observation, biological sciences).  From NASA's recently launched PharmaSat sub-10 kg free-flying nanosatellite, which has just successfully completed an experiment that could help scientists better understand how effectively drugs work in space, to potential future missions like the Reef Ecosystem Spectro-Photometric Observatory (CRESPO), a ~100 kg microsatellite that will use a hyperspectral imager (HSI) to monitor the condition of more than 50% of the Earth's coral reefs over a 2-year period, NASA is counting on these small satellites to deliver.","At MILSPACE 2009 Karyn Hayes-Ryan, Associate Chief Operating Officer of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) offered that CubeSats might be the next transforming innovation in space development primarily because they offer a means for rapidly maturing new technologies to ultimately be used by larger NRO intelligence gathering satellites.  The vision of CubeSats as technology demonstration platforms will only be realized when their data downlink capability matches their data acquisition capability.  At the moment, CubeSat communications are extremely limited.  To boost communications, they need more power and they need to focus and aim that power in the form of directed transmissions.   Beyond the ""CubeSat as a test and demonstration platform"" model, the information developed under the proposed study would inform Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission planners considering the use of small agile satellites in the 3 to 50 kg range.  The TORC-SP system is a scalable and rapidly reconfigurable ACS for CubeSats; allowing fast, low-cost, on-demand agile ACS development.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Manipulation; Mobility; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister also incorporates features that for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples  seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful Apollo seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent oxidation, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process.

The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions.","A large number of potential NASA missions have been identified that would utilize the SPRC including sample return missions to Mars, the Moon, Titan, comets, asteroids, and Trojan/Centaurs. Each of these missions would require the canister described in this proposal or an adaptation thereof. The SPRC could also find use for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) prospecting. Samples would have to be acquired and analyzed for their volatile content in order to make detailed decisions on mining locations.Additional science applications (through NASA or other government organizations such as the NSF) include terrestrial investigations requiring the securing of pristine samples, particularly those containing volatiles of interest - Arctic and Antarctic ice, untouched water reservoirs, volcanic samples etc. While containers are available commercially that can be filled and sealed by a human operator, these environments are not accessible to humans and require a robotic-compatible container.",Non-NASA applications potentially include gathering samples in hostile environments such as nuclear or hazardous waste sites.

The novel device has been designed to work solely by mechanical means using spring preloaded electrical contacts to create 6, 9, 12 or 18 discrete load sensing levels, depending on design parameters.  When any of the load thresholds has been reached, the corresponding electrical contact changes state from normally open or normally closed.  The load cell is completely sealed and has similar size, shape and strain displacements as traditional strain gage load cells.

The high gear reductions possible within a single stage, coupled with the already compact size make this innovation ideal for spaceflight hardware where size and weight are at a premium, specifically to the extreme conditions of Venus. During Phase I, a first-generation prototype gear head will be designed, built, and tested in Venus-like conditions (486oC temperature and mostly CO2 gas environment). Phase I testing will verify the feasibility of the design and confirm that the gear head can operate at 486oC for an extended period of time.  In a potential Phase II effort, an extreme environment compatible gear head will be developed to TRL 6.  Fully developed and optimized versions of this gear head, when integrated with the offeror's high temperature motors, could be used to actuate drills, robotic arms, and other devices outside of an environment-controlled landed platform on the surface of Venus.","High temperature gear heads/actuators are needed for future Venus surface exploration missions, and these missions provide the most immediate need for such devices. According to NASA's latest mission roadmap document, three different in situ Venus exploration missions are planned, with the first to be developed under the New Frontiers program with a potential launch date of 2013. The successful completion of the proposed effort would be essential to a New Frontiers Venus mission proposal as it would offer significant new opportunities for improved science, data gathering and operational life. According to the New Frontiers program schedule, the next Announcement of Opportunity is scheduled for release in about one to two years, which would be timed well with the proposed gear head development. Following a New Frontiers Venus In-Situ Explorer mission, two missions are planned in order to prepare for sample return, the first is a planned surface mission to demonstrate critical technologies and the second would be a fully equipped sample return mission. In addition to being a key component in actuating a drill and sampling devices, high temperature compatible gear heads are needed to actuate robotic arms, additional sample manipulation and communication devices, and any other devices that require actuation exterior to the temperature- and pressure-controlled landed vessel.","Electrical submersible pumps are down-hole pumps used in oil and geothermal applications such as steam floods (used in many fields to improve mobility of heavy oil and bitumen), geothermal wells, and other high temperature/ poor cooling applications. The trend in the application of ESPs has been toward installation in higher temperature reservoirs. Extreme temperature actuators featuring the proposed gear head could potentially allow oil and water pump operation at greater depths than those attainable using these existing ESPs.

In response to the need for a compact, low mass, low power, and low weight-on-bit coring device, Honeybee Robotics proposes to develop an arm-deployed and arm-stabilized rotary-percussive coring tool. By using a robotic arm to deploy the coring tool into rock or soil targets and stabilize the tool while operating, the coring tool's internal deployment (or ""z"") axis and external stabilization devices can be removed, resulting in a more compact, lower mass device. Also, adding percussion to the coring tool will reduce average weight-on-bit and energy consumption over the duration of the coring operation. The flexibility afforded from a rover or lander arm to target outcroppings, and the relatively higher TRL of surface coring tools (vs. deeper subsurface drills), make surface coring, especially with an arm-deployed coring tool, a particularly attractive option for near term planetary exploration. The proposed Phase I activities will focus on 1) validating the ability to drill and produce cores in hard rock from a compliant robotic arm mock-up via laboratory testing, and 2) identifying and performing a trade study on vacuum-compatible, low mass percussive mechanism options for the coring tool.","Future robotic astrobiology and geology missions such as Mars Sample Return, Astrobiology Field Laboratory and other Mid-Range Rover missions will benefit greatly from the ability to produce and capture rock and regolith cores using an arm-deployed, arm-stabilized, compact, low mass, low power device. Such a coring drill could also be deployed during lunar sortie missions by astronauts (operating as a hand-held coring drill) since it is desirable to bring small cores back to Earth as opposed to large rocks. From a science standpoint, core samples have a distinct advantage over collected drill cuttings in that the stratigraphy and morphology of the sample is preserved. This facilitates detection of localized organics and fossil biosignatures, as well as analysis of geochemistry and mineralogy. The need for a flight-ready surface coring tool has been evident in various NASA program reviews, mission concepts, and mission baselines.","Rotary-percussive core drilling has many terrestrial applications in industry and in the research and development fields.

Fundamentally, all electric motors basically work on the same electromagnetic principle: a tangential electromagnetic force attracts the rotor to the stator.  Just when the rotor field is closest to the stator field and the electromagnetic attraction is greatest, the power is interrupted and another set of magnetic poles repeats the cycle.  Furthermore, the two magnetically attracted elements never make contact, which would otherwise offer the highest force of attraction.  The proposed novel motor design operates and behaves entirely differently from all other known electric motor designs and it will produce incredibly high, direct drive torques at low rotational speeds.  Its operational performance is similar to that of a stepper motor with a 1000:1 gearhead attached, but the similarity ends there.  The motor is configured such that its length to diameter aspect ratio is opposite that of traditional motors as it has a relatively large diameter and short axial length; this offers all new packaging opportunities.  The proposed design also allows for a single, large diameter bearing pair to be used for the motor's output shaft which renders it stiff enough to directly mount the driven elements.  The need for additional bearing supports and bearing mounting structure is thus eliminated.  At the end of the proposed Phase 1 effort, the motor design will be at TRL 4 and by the end of a potential Phase 2, the system will be at TRL 6.","For NASA, the proposed innovation is an enabling technology for planetary exploratory missions and a number of possible applications are envisioned for the motor, some examples are: Robotic arm joints, Rover wheel steering and drive actuators, Core drill sample Break-off actuators, Antenna Mast and Solar array deployment and Launch locks.","The proposed motor is expected to have a number of commercial applications in areas where slow speed and high output torques or forces are needed.  For example, the motor could be used in applications where pneumatic or hydraulic actuators are required for high output forces.  More specifically, commercial applications for the motor are anticipated in: winches, lifts, positioning equipment, structural deployment, presses and door openers/ lifts.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Kinematic-Deployable; Manipulation; Mobility"

Rendezvous of a vehicle with a sample canister in order to return the canister to Earth requires a variety of complex mathematical processing on a changing data set, coupled with the need to safely and effectively handle a large range of off-nominal conditions and spacecraft faults. Light speed delay isolates the spacecraft from real-time operator intervention, while inertial and situational uncertainties demand reactivity not required of typical spacecraft sequencing systems. These mission features call for a new class of sequence capability: Reactive Rendezvous and Docking Sequencer (RRDS).RRDS  melds the rule-based reactivity needed for rendezvous and docking with sequence characteristics common to more traditional missions. Rules watch for conditions in order to react to the current situation, allowing a wide range of complex activities and safety-related responses to be concisely represented without complex procedural programming.Built atop JPL's VML 2.1, RRDS uses state machines to react to a variety potential conditions simultaneously. Conditions include out-of-envelope inertial behavior, hardware malfunctions, flight software errors, and ground wave-off, among others. Responsibility for commanding elements aboard the spacecraft is divided among state machines called managers, coordinated together by a flight director which the ground commands.Underlying flight software for navigation, thruster allocation, inertial checking, attitude estimation and control, contact detection, docking mechanisms, and the like receive direction from the managers. This mediated control causes the system to reactively operate in modes with proper ordering of activities. Reactive operations are represented explicitly by states and transitions defining the managers, and do not require use of explicitly timed activities.","RRDS may be applied to a variety of commercial missions reactively operating spacecraft in complex scenarios, like deep space missions retrieving samples from a variety of planetary bodies, comets, asteroids, or moons. RRDS could also be used on uncrewed cargo flights to a space station or assembly site.Executable state machines provided by the enhanced VML 2.1 allow many kinds of autonomy to be created, outside of the  RRDS realm. These include: reactive fault protection which is cheaper to develop and more transparent in operation than a flight software implementation  autonomy for self-directed orbital missions requiring limited operational interaction with controllers, reducing personnel costs  autonomy for self-directed comet / asteroid sampling missions requiring limited operational interaction with controllers, reducing DSN time and personnel costs  on-board replanning to compensate for degraded and failed systems in a high radiation, remote environment like Europa orbit  autonomy for landed vehicles and rovers, reducing the risk to the mission and simplifying mission operations  target-of-opportunity science collection in earth-orbiting or deep space environments, allowing detected events to result in further detailed observations (e.g. detected volcanic activity leading to taking a raster of images)  expert systems for guiding remote experiments in real-time based on observed environmental conditions","Enhanced VML 2.1 allows autonomy to be created for commercial low earth orbiting observation missions that would permit targets of opportunity for observations to be identified and acted upon. Autonomy in this regime could also simplify spacecraft operations by allowing onboard systems to make more decisions, and reduce the need for off-shift operations personnel. Many of the NASA commercial applications listed above also have potential terrestrial applications. VML 2.1 autonomy capabilities could be applied to autonomous vehicle control, manufacturing process controllers, airborne systems, and remote science stations with limited contact time. The state-machine approach has an advantage over autocoded systems in that the embedded software is not unique for every flight software load, reducing risk and enhancing system insight.","Attitude Determination and Control; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Expert Systems; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Intelligence; On-Board Computing and Data Management"

One of the highest-risk operations is the guidance of the Orbiting Sample (OS) into the capture mechanism on the MSR Orbiter/Earth Return Vehicle (ERV).  Aurora Flight Sciences, and its research partner the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Space Systems Laboratory (SSL), propose to adapt and augment the Synchronized Position Hold Engage Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Mars Orbiting Sample Retrieval MOSR testbed to incorporate optically-guided rendezvous and docking with the OS (RDOS).  This additional functionality will extend the MOSR testbed's existing capabilities to further support MSR rendezvous and capture algorithm development. With these new capabilities, the MOSR RDOS system would extend the utility of the MOSR testbed from the ""last meter"" problemfocusing largely on the contact dynamics between the OS and the capture mechanism , but not addressing GN&Cto the ""last several meters"", which involve significant time-critical maneuvers by the chaser in order to ensure that the OS is captured and, most importantly, that the contact dynamics between OS and capture mechanism neither cause the OS to become dislodged from the capture mechanism nor cause any structural damage to the OS itself.","The primary application for the MOSR RDOS testbed is in support of the NASA Mars Sample Return mission development.  In the context of this mission, we see applications of the testbed in both ground and flight implementations, and in several technical contexts.  A successful Phase 2 project would result in a system implementation that would be ready to operate on the ground or launch on the Space Shuttle.  This product would have immediate relevance to other NASA orbital rendezvous and docking applications.  NASA is planning a number of missions that may involve autonomous on-orbit rendezvous/docking, including sample return missions from planetary bodies other than Mars and construction/servicing of large and distributed space optical systems.  While these missions are still in the initial planning phases, the testbed could be used to support advanced technology development and mission architecture studies.","We anticipate that there are also applications beyond NASA, in military and commercial sectors.  The DoD is seriously investigating autonomous rendezvous and docking for the purpose of resupply, maintenance, and upgrading of valuable orbital assets.  DARPA's Orbital Express program (which provided the majority of the funding for the development of the baseline SPHERES system) was the first major on-orbit investigation.  We anticipate that DARPA, AFRL, USAF Space Command, and other DoD organizations will invest in autonomous rendezvous and docking technologies.  We would position the MOSR RDOS testbed in a similar role as for the NASA missions  as a low-cost, uniquely-capable system for rapid, iterative evaluation of algorithms and hardware for the last-few-meters problem.",Simulation Modeling Environment; Structural Modeling and Tools; Testing Facilities

Current NASA mission architectures baseline Montgolfiere balloon systems, which use waste heat from a radioisotope power system to heat balloon interior gases to provide buoyancy.  A disadvantage of this approach is that the balloon is unable to make rapid changes in altitude which limits system utility.  The feasibility of adding a rapid buoyancy modulation subsystem which uses chemical reactions to provide high heat input to balloon interior gases will be assessed in the proposed effort.  Several concepts, including the baseline, will be traded on the basis of heat release capability and mass/volume efficiency in the context of proposed mission requirements, a concept will be selected and refined, and a lab scale demonstration of the reaction mechanism will be conducted in a relevant environment.  Aurora's baseline Titan Montgolfiere Buoyancy Modulation System (BMS) concept uses a catalytically piloted burner, which combusts onboard stored oxygen with atmospheric gas, to provide rapid heat input an order of magnitude higher than the balloon's primary heat source.  This system is scalable, lightweight, consumes minimal electrical energy, and is capable of providing altitude changes of approximately 200 m in under 60 s.","At its core, the proposed baseline Titan Montgolfiere BMS concept is a highly stable combustion system for use in adverse environments.

For instance, the system could be used on other aerial systems, such as winged aircraft or aerobots, and ground based architectures, such as rovers or lake landers, for primary propulsion or power generation.

This will allow the utilization of the SWE services using semantic queries and concepts as opposed to purely syntactic ones. An integrated sensor ontology would also help fuse data from heterogeneous sensors and associated SWE services.

Major benefits to refactoring include creating robust codes that are more easily ported to different hardware and software platforms and promoting extensibility and collaboration. For example, refactoring code to remove common blocks allows porting to multi-core architectures with increased thread safety while promoting best software engineering practices.By leveraging the existing capabilities of pFUnit (an xUnit variant that supports Fortran) and Photran (a Fortran Integrated Development Environment and Eclipse plugin) we will be able to quickly contribute to the Fortrandeveloper community, whos feedback we hope to use to guide our product development.","Potential NASA applications include those supported by NASA high-end computing (HEC) and the Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (MAP) programs.

Being a resource constrained environment, health management, troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair of the Lunar outpost poses formidable challenge. To address this challenge Qualtech Systems, Inc. proposes to automate a major part of the HM and recovery decision support systems through a TEAMS-based approach. The approach will provide the facility to develop on-the-fly reconfigurable diagnostic models that can be used to automatically update a TEAMS model upon configuration changes. Residual functional capability estimation techniques and automatic updating of diagnostic models based on current condition of components will be developed through this effort. Dynamic multiple fault diagnosis techniques will be used for enhancing the diagnostic accuracy obtained from TEAMS-based diagnosis. Such accuracy enhancement will greatly reduce the amount of human intervention required in troubleshooting of spurious faults, and faults that are isolated with a large ambiguity group. On the overall, the proposed effort will provide a solution for automating the HM related activities in highly reconfigurable systems with resource constraints.","The resultant solution from this effort will be valuable in automating the health management, maintenance, and repair of all NASA systems that can operate in multiple configurations and/or are designed for long term missions.

These models have been typically developed manually by subject matters experts in the different spacecraft systems and subsystems. This is a significant hindrance to the widespread use of models for any targeted application. The envisioned suite of tools would allow non experts to derive the appropriate SysML models for their intended use. In addition to providing a generic library of space systems models, methods to customize these models to the specific target system, our proposal will also design tools that enable the automatic or semi automatic extraction of appropriate information from different source, thus significantly accelerating the development and the usage of such models.","A toolset for accelerated development of executable models of spacecraft systems has multiple applications in the NASA community, the DoD environment, as well as in the commercial arena. The envisioned toolset can be applied to any complex system that needs to use model-based techniques for design or validation. Desktop based tool support for such system is currently missing. In the short term, the tool can be used for NASA projects such as the Orion, the Small Pressurized Rover, and Lunar Habitat test bed . The tool should allow these projects to significantly reduce the need for prototyping activities and associated costly simulation. In the longer term, the tool can be directly applicable to all components of the Constellation program and any software intensive system supporting the new exploration vision.","The toolset for executable models development that can be customized to different systems will be useful within DoD organizations in which software intensive product lines are common. For example, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Domain is enjoying a period of significant expansion. UAVs have progressed from target drones to reusable weapon systems. Their software systems have become complex and extremely diversified. Domain specific executable SysML models could reduce development risks by enabling many alternative operational concepts and designs to be evaluated before significant effort is expended developing poor designs. In the commercial arena, adopting the same type of approach for software intensive system can be used in a broad range of areas, such as airplane, power plant SCADA systems, and vertical business applications such as Human Resources applications.

An integrated development environment is essential for enabling programmers and non-programmers to create high-quality, large-scale ANML models more easily.  Without such a tool, ANML modeling will remain a tedious and difficult task that can be carried out only by the small number of people who have the necessary specialized programming skills and patience.

Based on this understanding of the task, we will then identify and design useful PM/IDE capabilities and user-system interactions that help people develop ANML models. The system design will specify user-system interactions, software functions and operations, and databases, knowledge bases, and algorithms that implement these functions.

Lynguent's efficiency gains in compact model composition have enabled radiation domain experts to transfer observed radiation effects from TCAD simulators into the commercial circuit simulators. These compact models are augmented with radiation effects such as the ISDE 90 nm Bulk CMOS Bias Dependent Charge Sharing SET Effect. These rad-aware models are used within the LynRad Fault Analyzer, taking into account circuit schematics, layout and cosmic ray scenarios.  Extending this design automation to a BiCMOS AMS designs is the logical next step in establishing radiation awareness over wide temperature.

Consequently, scaling the LynRad Radiation Fault Analyzer to larger, more complex AMS circuits is a key aspect of this investigation.","The radiation induced fault analysis for BiCMOS circuits has direct application for grading finer lined BiCMOS processes.

The new tools and RHBD circuits will be immediately applicable to the NASA Radiation Hardened Electronics for Space Exploration (RHESE) Program. The wide-temperature physics-based mixed-mode tools will help NASA to design rad-hard analog and mixed-signal electronics with better understanding and control of design margins; better evaluate the wide-temperature performance and radiation response at an early design stage; set requirements for hardening and testing;  and reduce the amount of testing cost and time.","Various critical analog and mixed-signal circuits are used in space electronics, such as, DoD space systems (communication, surveillance, ballistic missiles, missile defense), and commercial satellites. Since modern electronic technologies and parts are getting smaller all the time, the radiation and extreme temperature effects become more severe, the life time and reliability become critical, and the capability to predict them increases confidence and reduces risk. The new RHBD designs and circuit/cell libraries, as well as the physics-based computer aided design (CAD) tools, can also be applied to cryogenic electronics for high-sensitivity, low-noise analog and mixed-signal applications, such as metrology, infrared (IR) imagers, sensors (radiation, optical, X-ray), radiometrology, precision instruments, radio and optical astronomy, infrared and photon detectors, and other high-end equipment.  For all such devices and systems, predictive and accurate modeling and design tools reduce the amount of required radiation/temperature testing, thus decreasing their cost, and time to market or field application.",Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Simulation Modeling Environment

The regulator is stable under all load conditions without the need for an external compensation capacitor thereby reducing the mass/volume of the power management system and increasing reliability. The existing LDO component has very competitive figures of merit (dropout voltage, transient response, power supply rejection) compared to existing components targeting commercial consumer electronics. The work we are proposing for this Phase 1 activity will confirm the expected wide temperature range operation (-180C to +150C) and radiation tolerance (200krads(Si) to 1 Mrad(Si)) of the existing component. Based on these measurements we shall design, simulate and layout LDO regulators for nominal load currents of 100 mA and 1A for fabrication at two rad-hard CMOS foundries during a follow-on Phase 2 activity. The LDO regulators will be designed as drop-in replacements for many existing components. They can also be integrated directly on chip as part of an application specific integrated circuit thereby reducing the chip count still further.","Radiation tolerant low dropout regulators capable of operating in extreme environments with fewer external components will be of widespread use to NASA missions that target the moon, Mars and Europa. The LDO regulator is a key component in most power management systems including point-of-load supplies. By developing power management components for wide temperature range operation (-180C to +150C) we are enabling missions that will benefit from components mounted directly in the Lunar and Martian environments i.e. outside of any thermally controlled warm box. These components will also be of use in missions to Venus that employ environmental chambers with temperatures controlled to < 150C. The transistor technology we have developed shows very promising high frequency performance and therefore has potential NASA applications beyond power management. These include power amplifiers for X-band (5-10GHz) as well as for ultra-low power data telemetry from medical implants that target the Medical Implant Communications Service (MICS) at 403-405 MHz for monitoring astronaut health. Our metal-semiconductor-field-effect-transistor (MESFET) technology is capable of high voltage operation >>10V. NASA faces challenges with component obsolescence due to the reduction in supply voltage of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) with each new CMOS generation. Our MESFET component has the potential for extending the life of an ASIC product without the expense of a complete re-design.","Low dropout regulators are ubiquitous in commercial consumer electronics and automotive systems. A non-hardened version of the regulator we are proposing to develop will be inexpensive to manufacture using high volume commercial CMOS foundries. Our business models suggest that such a component can be manufactured at a cost per die that is competitive with existing products but without the need for an external compensation capacitor thereby reducing the overall costs and part count of the power management system. If this is confirmed our regulator component has the potential for widespread commercial adoption. Other non-NASA commercial applications of our patented transistor technology include low power transceivers for medical implants that use the FCC approved MICS band as well as for data telemetry within the Industrial, Scientific & Medical (ISM) bands. Our MESFET technology is capable of higher voltage operation than the CMOS transistors making it very suitable as the input/output device in commercial ASICs such as those offered by Honeywell and our other Phase 3 commercialization partners.",Power Management and Distribution; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics

Electrical power systems constitute a critical division of the exploration systems in enabling reliable ground and settlement operations. Even with the added hardware redundancy in the design, early diagnostics at the component level and application of fault tolerant techniques at the system level are imperative in providing an integrated reliability solution. Moreover, the proposed technology is highly adaptable across many systems of the Constellation program, including the Orion crew exploration vehicle, Altair Lunar Lander, and the lunar surface vehicles. This effort proposes an ambitious plan to improve the state-of-the-art in power system and converter (silicon and wide band gap based) in built-in-test (BIT) capabilities, enhance reliability assessment, and minimize fault propagation. Impact is proposing to develop the power system BIT capabilities based on: 1) high frequency ringing characterization in power devices, 2) an L1 norm based algorithm to monitor power quality, primarily in the converter, and 3) a dynamic differential current sensor to predict component aging and failure. These BIT techniques will continuously provide system and component level health assessment, which will be fed into the ""Health Manager Reasoner"" module to analyze the severity of fault and invoke the appropriate response to avoid system-wide failure propagation and enable reconfiguration techniques to promote mission completion. These techniques are mindful of the strict power, cost, size, and weight requirements for space exploration systems. They are designed to be embedded into the current configuration with minimal hardware and utilize unused processing resources.","The development of the proposed prognostics and fault tolerant reconfiguration strategies will directly contribute to NASA's IVHM efforts, particularly for the Constellation program. The proposed technologies are generic in nature and are applicable to future generation aviation platforms, leading to benefits in the form of improved reliability, maintainability, and survivability of safety-critical electrical power and electro-mechanical systems. The long term implications of a successful completion of this program will be the development of reliability tools for state-of-the-art technologies in power generation, management, and intelligent control. A lot of NASA's NextGen and current activities can take immediate advantage of these technologies. In the short term, the device level modeling and reconfigurable strategies to be developed in this program can be directly transitioned to ongoing research at the NASA research centers. The adaptable nature of the modules presented in this program will allow them to act as health management, design, and development tools for a wide variety of NASA applications.","The potential benefits from the successful completion of this program are enormous and will significantly impact the way critical aerospace, power devices, controllers, and other systems are designed, particularly in the alternative energy generation and management domain.

This comprehensive solution provides both advanced hardware sensors to monitor the systems and prognostic health management algorithms to interpret the signals available in them.  RingDown will significantly improve the reliability of and confidence in these critical NASA systems by alerting NASA personnel to impending failures well before they occur, averting disaster and improving confidence in the health of the systems.Electromechanical actuators (EMAs) are comprised of a complex system-of-systems: a high-power switch mode power supply to power the EMA's servo drive, a lower-voltage switch mode power supply to power the EMA's logic controller, power inverters, and the EMA itself.  The sensors and algorithms provided by Ridgetop will allow NASA to monitor the health ofand anticipate failures inall of these systems.  In addition, these algorithms will be applicable to other switch mode power supplies (SMPSs), which are a very common component in NASA's electrical systems.Ridgetop's goal in this SBIR program is to transition these EMA prognostic health management technologies into fielded systems.  In Phase I, Ridgetop will extend the RingDown sensors developed under previous NASA SBIRs to monitor additional components in the EMA system-of-systems.  Ridgetop will also prototype the algorithms to interpret the data from those sensors in this Phase. In Phase II, Ridgetop will implement additional functionality for these algorithms and then field-test the combined algorithm and sensor solution.  In a future Phase III or other commercialization program, a final version of this comprehensive solution will be demonstrated in-flight and then transitioned into actual system usage.","The RingDown technologies developed under this SBIR are applicable to electromechanical actuators and power systems across all of NASA's programs. The benefits of this prognostic health management solution will be reduced maintenance costs, reduced downtime, and improved reliability for critical EMA systems.Under this SBIR program, Ridgetop intends to continue its close collaboration with the Ames Research Center to prepare and position this technology for insertion into NASA's Constellation program. Ridgetop is also partnering with Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) to integrate these technologies into their TEAMS diagnostics software suite.  This will ensure that these technologies are available in the baseline diagnostic tool for the Ares and Orion programs.","The proposed innovation has strong potential in the commercial aerospace market. Today's commercial operators are plagued by ever increasing operating and maintenance costs while facing tighter safety restrictions by the FAA. The EMA PHM innovation can be used as a dynamic utility to monitor an array of critical systems accurately, remotely, and non-invasively, thus eliminating the need for tedious line and system inspections which are performed routinely.  The savings realized on the part of aircraft operators will be in the form of countless labor hours and parts while the value will be realized in operators having full system health visibility and resulting improved safety of passengers and crew.The proposed EMA PHM unit will also directly benefit the emerging hybrid vehicle market which comprises roughly 3% of the total automotive market . This market is particularly in need of this solution as its electronic actuator and power systems are critical. As such, the proposed technology will enable auto manufacturers and service centers to more accurately monitor critical component health data in real time, thus minimizing the risk of in-field failure.

The material system will be based on Ultramet's proven oxide-iridium/rhenium architecture, which has been successfully hot-fire tested with stoichiometric oxygen/hydrogen for hours. Instead of rhenium, however, the structural material will be a niobium alloy that has excellent high temperature yield strength. With a yield strength-to-weight ratio over 33% greater than that of rhenium at elevated temperature, this niobium alloy will significantly reduce chamber weight. The starting materials are two orders of magnitude less expensive than rhenium and are less expensive than the C103 alloy commonly used in low-performance engines.

The proposed innovation uses a novel method to excite a piezo-ceramic crystal using the initiation of propellant flow to the engine.  When the propellant valves are opened, the precise timing of the spark relative to propellant flow, as well as the flow start transient, are governed by the geometry of the device.  Hence, precise, repeatable start conditions should be achieved with no additional control logic or complexity.  Furthermore, the piezo-ceramic crystal is integral to (and embedded in) the igniter body, thereby completely eliminating external wiring and associated complexity.

This extra care translates into increased expense for the mission.  Replacing the MMH in the propulsion systems with an equally energetic, sasfer fuel would considerably reduce risk and cost on exploration missions.  Ionic liquids offer promising candidates for dense, energetic, and safe rocket fuels.

Once it is demonstrated that the new propellants are superior in both performance and safety to existing propellant systems, both the government and its prime contractors will find the propellant technology very attractive.  Near-term military applications include high-performance tactical missiles, divert and attitude control systems for strategic, target drones, cruise missiles, and missile defense missions.  Other applications are foreseen that include the kill vehicles for such programs as Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), NMD, Navy Upper Tier Theater Missile Defense (TMD) System, and the MEADS Air Defense System.",Chemical

Dynamic seals are used throughout the turbopump in high-performance, pump-fed, liquid rocket engines for a variety of purposes.  The most common applications are in the lift-off seal (LOS), inter-propellant seal (IPS), and balance piston seals  high-pressure orifice (HPO), low-pressure orifice (LPO), and inner diameter impeller shroud seal (eye seal).  The system solution for conventional seals represents a compromise between the turbopump mechanical design, primarily flowpath, and secondary flowpath design that results in increased leakage, increased seal wear, and reduced balance piston load capacity that reduces performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  The magnetically actuated seal eliminates this compromise and provides significant improvement in performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  Phase 1 will advance the technology from TRL 2 to 3.  Phase 2 will advance the technology from TRL 3 to 6.  The technology is applicable to booster engines, in-space engines, and lunar engines.","The anticipated benefits from this technology include reduced seal leakage (for improved efficiency, and reduced turbine inlet temperature, which improves reliability), reduced seal wear (which increases life and reliability), reduced or eliminated purge (which improves operability and reduces weight), eliminates primary and secondary seal drains and associated plumbing and valves (which improves reliability and reduces weight), and improves design point and off-design balance piston performance (which increases the throttle range).  This technology is directly applicable to booster engines, in-space engines, and lunar engines planned for NASA applications.","The resulting technology is directly applicable to dynamic seals in FTT's family of small UAV turbofan engines as well as for active clearance control systems in industrial gas turbine engines.  These product lines have the potential demand for more than 10,000 units annually.",Feed System Components

In addition to predicting whether a combustion chamber will oscillate and how large the amplitude of the oscillation will be, UCDS provides insight into WHY a device oscillates.  With this type understanding, it is possible to design for stability in any chemical rocket, turbojet or scramjet.GTL proposes to apply the UCDSTM Process to create a clean-sheet design for a new stable liquid rocket engine that is suitable to use as an Ascent Engine for Altair.  Rather than starting with preconceived notions or heritage constraints, GTL shall exercise the UCDS tools to establish detailed injector design guidelines that will ensure stable operation.This will include definition of functions that define mass injection distribution, vaporization/atomization profile, heat release characteristics, feed system response and many other parameters.  By following these requirements in an injector design, the mechanisms that drive oscillations will be minimized, while the damping mechanisms are maximized, thereby maximizing stability margin.","The UCDS process can be used to aid in the development of NASA rockets (solid, liquid or hybrid), turbojets or scramjets.  The specific design guidelines for stability that are being developed in the proposed effort can be applied to support the development of the lunar ascent engine for Altair.  The results may also explain why the CECE engine behaves the way it does and why the selected oscillation mitigation technique is effective.","The UCDS process can be used to reduce development cost of practically any chemical propulsion system.  This capability could be used to support a wide variety of DoD propulsion development efforts, including rockets, turbojet augmentors or scramjets.

Our space suit simulator will provide a lightweight, low form-factor solution to microgravity and partial gravity EVA experimentation and training.  We will utilize magnetorheological (MR) fluids as our damping device in order to minimize weight and space, and will careful select supplementary stiffness devices to best emulate the mechanical properties of the EMU.We propose to develop this simulator by first characterizing the joint torque requirements using MIT's unique database of joint torques obtained from 1990 to present with the Robotic Space Suit Tester (RSST).  After conducting this literature survey, we will obtain test samples of MR fluids and stiffness components, in order to recognize the best method of simulating the mechanical characteristics of a pressurized EMU.  These stiffness and damping components will be tested on MIT's RSST in a simplified configuration (single-axis joint) to verify consistent emulation of the EMU joint.  Identification of the stiffness and damping technologies will allow us to provide a top-level conceptual design of a full space suit simulator, including all joints as well as the garment in its entirety.","This EVA space suit simulator will provide an accessible, inexpensive method for experimentation and training activities that require the subject to wear a space suit.  For example, development of surface operations activities on the moon or Mars will benefit from the support of human testing; e.g. what is the metabolic cost of performing specific tasks in partial gravity while wearing a space suit?  Note that this activity would also require the space suit simulator to be conducive to partial gravity simulations.  Additionally, development of the future moon/Mars EVA space suit will require human testing; our adjustable space suit simulator joint torques will allow for characterization of various suit configurations in order to optimize the future suit design.","In addition to NASA, potential customers of the technologies used in this space suit research include companies involved in medical technologies, and the Department of Defense.  Joint torque devices are useful in medical technologies as orthopedic devices: either restricting motion in order to prevent injury, or providing resistance to motion in order to improve muscle function or promote bone growth.  Military applications are generally limited to the potential use of MR fluids.  Further development of MR fluid use will help to establish MR fluid as a possible technology for use in impact or bullet-proof garments.",Suits

An integrated measurement and modeling approach will support NASA scientists in determining the optimal levels of crew autonomy under various mission conditions and constraints. Research results will produce a measurement application that provides multiple standard and custom tools for direct assessment of team autonomy and related constructs like team processes, social and performance outcomes, workload and situation awareness. The computer-based measurement application will support data collection, review, and high-level analysis of results. The models of crew autonomy will be theoretical and computer-based. Prescriptive, theoretical models support understanding the interrelationships among the key factors associated with performance and crew autonomy. Computer models will include important mission parameters and operationally-defined levels of crew autonomy to enhance capability for predicting outcomes associated with various crew autonomy levels. Phase I research will focus on defining factors associated with mission outcomes and crew autonomy levels, along with development concepts for the measurement application and modeling tool.  Phase II will involve development of a functional prototype of the Crew Autonomy Measures and Models (CAMM).","Concepts and products that result from this research have application within several NASA programs and directorates, including: NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations, NASA Constellation Program, and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. These NASA research and development programs are engaged in the study of operational conditions that impact crew cognitive and behavioral performance and crew well being. They study teams and mission concepts that involve variable levels of crew autonomy. The tasks and operations within these contexts will have similar characteristics and indications for autonomy. The Crew Autonomy Measures and Models (CAMM) research program will result in valuable research toward understanding levels of autonomy and autonomy behaviors of crews; and it will result in both measures and models which extend NASA's capabilities for developing effective strategies to support remote and autonomous teams.","Non-NASA applications involve ongoing research and training in extreme environments, including work conducted at the Amundsen-Scott Antarctic Research Facility and Naval Undersea Warfare. These contexts too have need for effective and comprehensive assessments of human performance under different levels of team autonomy.

The ABCAT system was designed in part to assess crew performance, which we will need for this project as well, and our approach will be to add autonomy modeling and assessment to the design. One of the key results of this Phase I project will be the identification of the most significant aspects of the environment and the behavior of the astronaut's engaged in space flight operations that can be used to identify their actual autonomy and performance level as they perform their tasks. The second will be the design of the data acquisition and processing components and framework that work together to observe and interpret those aspects and provide an assessment of the crew's exhibited level of autonomy and performance characteristics.","This technology could be applied to all current and future NASA missions. While it is being developed for application to intermediate to long duration space flight operations, the techniques are amenable to application in shorter duration flight operations as well, such as related to the International Space Station and Space Shuttle, where autonomy level can be varied to achieve improvement in productivity.

Examples include submarine and aircraft carrier crews, most particularly those working in the command center and the engine room. We expect this same technology to transfer to these military situations, where the performance of individual crew could be assessed relative to varying autonomy levels to identify an optimal setting for each crew or combination of crew.A variety of commercial activities also have similar characteristics such as operators of nuclear power plants, oil refineries, and other such large industries.

The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool that unobtrusively integrates all available behavioral measures collected during a mission to provide a dashboard of behavioral health indicators. These indicators will be placed within the context of quantitatively-tracked mission stressors to provide meaningful feedback to astronauts, and possibly the Operational Psychology Group and Flight Surgeons responsible for behavioral health support. The result of this project through Phase II will be a system prototype that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS and lunar missions. The critical need for an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2009) gap BMED3. During Phase I, we will perform an assessment of behavioral health monitoring technologies and develop an engineering requirements document and detailed technical plans to implement during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 3).","The Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool will meet the specific requirements of long duration exploration missions and provide feedback to astronauts, Op Psy Personnel and Flight Surgeons about behavioral health status as well as aid in the selection of countermeasures. It will be designed to be unobtrusive and require minimal crew time or effort to train and utilize. The resulting product will be primarily relevant to NASA's Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) research gaps (as of July 2009): BMED 3 (What are the optimal methods to detect and assess decrements in behavioral health during exploration missions?) but will also be relevant to gaps BMED1, BMED2, BMED6, BMED7, and BMED8. When validated, the Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool will be deployed in the constellation program and lunar missions to support crew behavioral health efforts during training, mission and return to Earth.","The Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool can be adapted to meet an articulated need to track behavioral health in occupations associated with high stress, high workload and high danger factor such as military applications and law enforcement. A tool that enables the systematic and efficient tracking of individual behavioral health status in these occupational settings can provide a means to detect and address behavioral disorders and mental conditions at an early stage. Taking military operations as an example, there is evidence that behavioral disorders and mental conditions such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury have a high prevalence among soldiers. There is a present market opportunity to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool to track changes in behavioral health status in soldiers during training, deployment, and post-deployment.

HFE evaluations designed and conducted by engineers without the necessary HF expertise run the risk of producing useless or misleading results.  Alternatively, the HFE is simply not conducted.  To ameliorate these problems, MTI proposes to develop the Human Factors Evaluation Mentor (HFEM) to guide non-HF experts in the design and conduct of HFE.  The HFEM will use an innovative combination of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based Systems (RBS) to develop  prescriptive designs for a set of routine HF evaluation methods.  This powerful combination has not been used previously in advisory systems.  The cases and rules used to develop the evaluation prescription will be drawn from a team of highly experienced HFE professionals.  A characteristic of CBR is that successful applications add to the case data base and thereby continuously improve the HFEM.  In Phase I MTI will develop and demonstrate a limited number of evaluation methods.  Phase 2 work will expand the scope of evaluation types included in the HFEM incorporating HFE methods that best meet NASA's needs.","Human Factors Evaluation (HFE) is a recognized,important element in the systems design and development process.  The new edition of NASA's Systems Engineering Handbook explicitly addresses the requirement for HFE for the first time.  The Human Factors Evaluation Mentor (HFEM) will both expand the use of HFE in NASA's engineering design process and improve, if not completely assure, the quality of the results.  Moreover, the use of the HFEM should add to the overall efficiency of the system design and development process by integrating HFE in the design stream with other engineering evaluations.  The HFEM will benefit NASA's programs in information sciences, as its space and aviation programs.","The Human Factors Evaluation Mentor (HFEM) will have broad utility in other government and commercial applications where formal, systems engineering design procedures are used and where human - systems integration (HSI) is a salient requirement.  Additionally, the HFEM will benefit smaller enterprises that do not have Human Factors Engineers on staff.  Exemplar applications for the HFEM of some criticality are easily stated.  Within government, these include DoD warfighter's equipment and vehicles, the FAA's evolving systems for air traffic management in the NEXGEN environment and its certification of cockpit avionics developed by third-parties.

It will identify requirements for coordination across engineering teams to help ensure that potential human factors integration issues are identified and resolved early in the design process.  HFE-AT also will indicate when more detailed human factors analyses are needed, and provide step-by-step guidance to walk users through the process of performing certain human factors analyses.  It will provide a repository for the results and allow users to produce reports that help them interpret and summarize the results.  In Phase I, we propose to identify the requirements for such a tool, create a plan for developing the tool, and develop a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate the potential for such a tool.  In Phase II, we will continue the development of this tool, adding functionality and expanding the scope.  We also will perform validation studies, to ensure that the tool is providing meaningful results.

Technologies are needed to help humans understand how multi-agent operations are proceeding and to detect inter-agent conflicts before they impact operations significantly.  TRACLabs will develop assistive software agents that monitor human-robot interaction and communication during multi-agent operations (1) to construct an integrated view of agent operations in the presence of significant time delay and (2) to detect inter-agent conflicts that may affect the ability to complete operations. To assess the effectiveness of these assistive agents, Omnisen will develop evaluator software agents that model work practice during multi-agent operations.  These evaluator agents will stand in for humans using the assistive agents in representative scenarios to assess the effectiveness of the assistive agents and identify best work practice when using them.  The extensive experience of this team in software agents, remote supervision of robots, and human-computer interaction enables the successful development of the proposed technology.","NASA conducts analog robotic field tests to evaluate new robotic technology and to simulate remote robotic operations.  The Exploration Program typically conducts annual field tests, such as the recent tests at Black Point Lava Flow, AZ, in 2009.  The proposed assistive agent technology would have direct application to such field tests, including the algorithms for situation awareness in the presence of communication delay.  The results of investigating the detection of plan and safety threats are needed for remote ground control.  The integration of assistive agents with evaluator agents will support assessing planned work practice for these field tests (in the form of operations protocols) as well as evaluating observed work practice during the field test.

FPS is based on collecting and sealing fluids in a sterile, hermetically sealed volume, with automatic separation of supernatant fluid where necessary. The unique microfluidic and medical expertise of CL scientists will result in an innovative and lightweight fluid storage system that utilizes compact and rugged sterile microfluidic chips. FPS chips will be able to collect and effectively store blood and urine for time spans of years if necessary. In Phase I CL will demonstrate the feasibility of the FPS technology by building prototype chips and demonstrating the proof of concept of pumping, separation, storage and preservation. In Phase II CL will develop a fully functional system including compact processing devices and miniaturization of the chips","As part of its ongoing effort to understand the impact of space flight on humans, especially in preparation for future manned missions to Mars, NASA needs to collect and store body fluid samples of its astronauts during missions in order to quantify, among other things, the impact of radiation and microgravity on humans. Commercially available methods include either freezing the collected body fluids or using chemical preservation kits. While launching freezers results in significant payload costs, they alos restrict the amount of samples that can be stored. Chemical kits are known to produce contaminants that could foul the biomarkers that NASA is interested in. The proposed FPS can preserve body fluids without the need for any refrigeration or chemical kits  enabling a lower cost and more accurate solution to sample preservation.","Significant non-NASA commercial applications of the FPS are expected. Its ability to preserve any organic fluid at room temperature would enable forensic criminal investigators, relief personnel working in remote locations of epidemic/pandemic diseases, military personnel and environmental researches to safely collect and preserve samples in their native form without the need for bulky and power hungry freezers or potentially sample damaging chemical kits.",Biomedical and Life Support; Sterilization/Pathogen and Microbial Control

One of the disadvantages of the CAMRAS for long duration missions is that it removes moisture in addition to CO2. One way to minimize the water loss from the atmosphere, yet still be able to implement the highly desirable CO2 removal function of the CAMRAS, is to implement a membrane water exchanger, or recuperator, at the inlet of the CAMRAS system. The water exchanger passes humidified, CO2 laden air on one side of a membrane. The water vapor passes through the membrane leaving the CO2 laden air to be treated by the amine system. The air returning from the amine system is dry and CO2 free, as its remaining moisture and CO2 have been absorbed by the amine beads. This dry air passes on the second side of the membrane. Its low dew point provides the driving force for the moisture that passes through from the inlet stream. The CO2 free air becomes re-humidified, thus conserving water in the overall system mass balance. The membrane is highly selective for water, and not for CO2. The amount of carbon dioxide passing through the membrane and returning to the cabin is negligible; therefore the functionality of the CAMRAS as a CO2 removal system will not be impeded. The improvement over the current state-of-the-art is a reduction in power and the elimination of moving parts.","This proposed membrane water recuperator has immediate application in the current NASA vision for space exploration. As an add-on component to the CAMRAS, the recuperator provides water recovery capability for long duration missions (lunar habitat and Mars exploration) that require high degrees of loop closure. Other Air Revitalization components that exhaust a humid gas stream (such as Sabatier) could also benefit from water recovery using a membrane recuperator.Other NASA applications include integration of the membrane recuperator into other technology systems that vent humidified gaseous products, such as the Sabatier system. A 6 crew size Sabatier loses up to 80 kg/year by venting a humidified methane product. Also, the membrane recuperator can be integrated into systems designed for cryogenic storage of reactants (vis-à-vis ISRU methane/oxygen storage) to reduce/remove the moisture before the gas is liquefied.","After heating and cooling, humidity control is the next major element of indoor air quality control. Removing humidity is a major driver of the energy requirement for conditioning the air. Humidity can be removed in several ways including condensation on a cold surface or chemical absorption. Both of these methods require large amounts of energy. Another means of humidity removal is to exchange the water vapor from a wet stream to a dry stream using a membrane barrier. A highly selective membrane barrier will allow water to pass without losing the content of the main air stream. This membrane water recuperator could be easily developed to transfer water from fresh air makeup to exhaust air as a means to lessen the load on a condenser prior to cooling the air. By reducing the cooling load, it allows the use of more fresh air makeup, which in turn improves the quality of indoor air in modern air tight buildings. A successful Phase I development program would aid in the development of a working relationship with major corporations in the heating/air conditioning industry.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning

Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters have impractical logistics penalties, and regenerable metal oxide canisters weigh too much.  Cycling bed systems and permeable membranes that are regenerable in space vacuum cannot vent on Mars due to the high partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere. Although sweep gas regeneration is under investigation, the feasibility, logistics penalties, and failure modes associated with this technique have not been fully determined. TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop a durable, high-capacity regenerable sorbent that can remove CO2 from the breathing loop.  The system design allows sorbent regeneration at or above 6 torr, eliminating the potential for Martian atmosphere to leak into the regeneration bed and into the breathing loop. In the proposed work, we will synthesize sorbent formulations to remove CO2 from the breathing loop of the PLSS and evaluate the performance of these sorbents under representative conditions (adsorption and regeneration under sub-atmospheric pressures across the desired temperature differential).  We will explore the methods to prepare these sorbents on engineered structures to increase durability and promote better heat transfer during the thermal regeneration process.  We will perform a minimum of 1,000 adsorption/regeneration cycles to demonstrate the life of these sorbents.  Finally, we will carry out a detailed engineering analysis and design to assess the technical viability of the concept.","The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact, and efficient CO2 removal system capable of regenerable operation during the EVAs.  The regeneration during the EVAs eliminates the consumable requirement related to the use of LiOH canisters and the mission duration limitations imposed by MetOx system.  If proven successful, the the concept will minimize the amount of consumable to be brought from Earth and make the mission more affordable, while providing great operational flexibilities during the EVAs.",The sorbent developed in this project could potentially find use in a large commercial market in the removal of CO2 emissions from the coal-fired power plants.  If regulations are put in place to curb carbon emissions from power plants the potential market for a successful sorbent is in the order of billions of dollars.,Portable Life Support; Suits

(PCI) proposes to develop a novel, efficient, and lightweight catalytic Sabatier CO2 methanation unit, capable of converting a mixture of CO2 and H2 to methane and water with targeted CO2 conversions of ≥90% at high throughputs and at low operating temperatures (≤350oC). In the spacecraft cabin air revitalization system (ARS), the utilization of CO2 to produce life support consumables, such as O2 and H2O, via Sabatier process as part of the CO2 Reduction Assembly (CRA) is an important aspect for long-term manned space explorations. The maturation of this technology will significantly reduce the need of re-supply from Earth. Sabatier reaction is highly exothermic and is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium; therefore, the ability to control and maintain axial reactor temperature and catalyst surface temperature is crucial for obtaining good reactor performance and preventing catalyst deactivation. The proposed program will build on the short contact time kinetic benefits of MicrolithREG technology (patented and trademarked by PCI) and PCI's proven catalyst coating development process from prior NASA programs, to demonstrate a proof-of-concept toward delivering a modular, compact, and durable Sabatier CO2 reduction prototype to NASA.","The proposed technology will provide an ultra-compact, high efficiency catalytic CO2 methanation reactor for converting CO2 and H2 to methane and water vapor for use with an electrolyzer to generate O2 for spacecraft and space station cabin ARS. Because of the extremely small size and weight, this catalytic MicrolithREG reactor will be highly competitive in NASA spacecraft applications. Additionally, due to its modular and flexible design, the proposed reactor can be easily integrated with existing ECLSS and ARS concepts. Targeted NASA spin-off applications include in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) concept for future lunar base and Mars missions, both for generating life support consumables, such as O2 and H2O, and for producing methane as propellant fuel. The use of Microlith CO2 methanation reactors as part of the ARS and ISRU concepts has potential to address the main concerns of this application, namely mass and size reduction, energy efficiency, and long-term durability.",Targeted non-NASA applications include as a methanation reactor for high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells and molten carbonate fuel cells. PCI has a leading fuel reforming technology (that is supplanting microchannel reformers for this application) which has been tested with solid oxide fuel cells. The ability to convert the reformate gas from the fuel pre-reformer into methane (which could then be converted to syngas through endothermic steam reforming in the fuel cell stack) could add thousands of hours of life to the stack through temperature moderation. There is also the potential to use the technology in methanation reactors for other processes such as the Haber process for producing ammonia (which is used to make fertilizer and ammunition) and as part of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) for cleaner coal-based power production,Air Revitalization and Conditioning

Currently, oxygen is recovered as water using the Sabatier reduction process. One of the by-products of this reaction is waste methane, which is vented into space. Lynntech proposes to reclaim the hydrogen from the methane by utilizing a low power, high efficiency, non-thermal plasma (NTP) process based on high frequency dielectric barrier discharge (HFDBD). The HFDBD is characterized by electrons and heavy particles being in thermodynamic non-equilibrium. The electron temperatures are near 10,000K, while the ions and neutrals species remain at ambient temperature. The high energy electrons have the potential to recover up to 75% of the hydrogen from methane. Since the majority of the electrical energy in the discharge is used to accelerate electrons rather than heat the plasma gas, Lynntech's process produces minimal soot. Hence, a complex filtration system to remove soot from the exhaust stream is not required.Recovery of hydrogen from methane minimizes the hydrogen resupply requirements and improves the efficiency of the Sabatier process by closing the mass loop of the reduction reaction.",Potential NASA applications include reducing hydrogen resupply requirements and improvement of the Sabatier process efficiency for oxygen recovery using the Carbon Dioxide Reduction Assembly (CRA). The plasma process can also be tweaked to produce other low molecular weight fuels such as methanol and ethanol which can be used for power co-generation.,"Potential non-NASA applications include reformation of natural gas to produce hydrogen to be utilized directly as a fuel, or to power PEM fuel cells for commercial and military applications. In addition, the non-thermal plasma process is capable of reforming any liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock such as JP-8 and heavy oils to produce low molecular weight fuels and fuel additives such as gasoline, diesel, aviation fuels, methanol and ethanol.

In preparation for this Phase I effort, we propose to collaborate with Hamilton-Sundstrand Human Space Systems (H-S) to share unique state-of-the-art technologies that provide the best path to meeting program objectives.  GES will share their data and expertise with high balanced pressure electrolyzers and H-S will contribute their data and expertise in high differential pressure electrolyzers. Based on this exchange, GES would modify its electrolyzer performance model.  In a third task, GES will build two single cell electrolyzers with GES and H-S components.  One stack will be dedicated to balanced pressure operation, while a second unit would be dedicated to high differential pressure (oxygen over hydrogen) operation.  A full experimental matrix will be conducted on these units in a cathode liquid feed configuration.  Balanced pressure operation would be conducted at GES facilities (from atmospheric to 2,000 psi).  Differential pressure testing would be conducted in H-S facilities (at pressures between 2,000 and 3,600 psi).  Data would then be integrated into the GES analysis code, and be available as a design analysis tool for future phases of the program.","NASA is charged with returning humans to the moon in a permanently occupied lunar station. This mission will require astronauts to conduct extravehicular activities while en route to the moon, and while on the lunar surface. To operate in these environments, the astronauts need an on-site source of pressurized oxygen to refill empty tanks. A very-high-pressure PEM water electrolyzer is proposed that can produce a minimum of 3,600 psi oxygen and hydrogen without the need for high-pressure pumps and/or compressors. A very-high-pressure water electrolyzer will permit smaller launch volumes, saving space aboard the Orion crew exploration vehicle. The electrolyzer might also be useful for the production of hydrogen and oxygen for space vehicle propulsion, enabling missions to Mars. Other electrolyzers of similar designs may be used to produce oxygen and hydrogen for energy storage purposes in regenerative fuel cells on the lunar and Martian surfaces. Other electrolyzers may be used for generation of oxygen on the lunar surface without a net consumption of water through in situ resource utilization (ISRU). By making all of these electrolyzers compatible with one another, if not identical, it may be possible for NASA to save significant development resources while improving astronaut life support safety margins by increasing redundancy. Given a successful development it may be possible to replace troublesome oxygen compressor currently aboard the International Space Station.",Quiet and compact oxygen generators may be useful for Navy SEAL missions.  Such electrolyzers as closed-loop regenerative fuel cells are potential battery substitutes for applications that require high energy density.  Several agencies of the U.S. Government and several private businesses are engaged in development of long-endurance aircraft and airships.  The high-pressure electrolyzer developed under this proposed program may be applicable to these vehicles.

Even apart from a water recovery system, foul odors sap crew morale, and must be eliminated.NanoScaleREG Corporation has developed a formulation of its proprietary sorbents, termed OdorKlenzTM, that has been shown to effectively remove odorous compounds from air by destructive adsorption.  NanoScale proposes development of a similar formulation, built around nanocrystalline metal oxides manufactured by NanoScale's proprietary procedures, such as NanoActive TiO2, NanoActive MgO, and NanoActive ZnO, to remove foul odors in a system that can recover water from wastes.  The odor control system will function during waste storage, and also during water recovery .In Phase I, NanoScale will demonstrate feasibility by developing a formulation of metal oxides capable of removing odorous compounds from food and sanitary wastes, and compatible with a water recovery system.

Gas streams containing these compounds will be passed through beds of the metal oxide formulation, with concentrations measured by GC, before and after passing through the bed.  In Phase II, the odor control system will be integrated into the specific details of spacecraft and envisioned lunar stations.  Then, brassboard hardware will be developed and evaluated.NanoScale, having pioneered the synthesis and manufacture of nanocrystalline metal oxides for destructive adsorption of hazardous compounds, is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work.","The primary NASA application envisioned for the proposed technology is for odor control in a waste management and water recovery system for spacecraft and lunar/Mars bases.

In the proposed work we will redesign the GCs so that they can use air as a carrier gas.  Key to the device is a very low pressure drop adsorbent bed that can capture the contaminants for analysis and produce a very pure air stream as a carrier gas.  Phase I tests will be performed to optimize the performance of the adsorption bed and to verify that the GC columns work with air.

The existing methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the devices used are bulky, consumable-hungry, and ill-suited for spacecraft deployment. We propose to develop and demonstrate a novel, fully automated, microfluidics-based sensor for detection and identification of microbes in water. The final product will be compact, accurate, fully integrated and automated, power-effective, and fieldable in research and space environments. The program objectives will be accomplished via several innovations: (a) a milli-fluidic microbe preconcentrator to improve detection sensitivity; (b) CFDRC's proprietary dielectrophoresis technology will be adapted to develop a dielectrophoretic focuser for differentiation and separation of target microbes from complex sample matrices; and (c) microfluidic impedance spectroscopy-based cytometry to enable label-free detection and near reagent-free operation. In Phase I, we will demonstrate all critical components to establish proof-of-concept of the proposed technology. Phase II efforts will focus along two lines. First, component design optimization will be carried out with fabrication enhancements and extended testing and characterization for technology validation. Second, an integrated microfluidic cartridge and instrumentation capable of automated operation (sample processing and detection) will be developed. The prototype instrument will be demonstrated in both terrestrial and hypogravity environments (in collaboration with NASA researchers/facilities).","The end product of the proposed SBIR effort will be a first-of-its-kind, compact, low-cost, label-free, fully automated and integrated microbial sensor device for water monitoring.

Toxic gas buildup can endanger the crew particularly during long missions.  Some gases are generated by people and emitted through the skin or by exhalation.  In addition to carbon dioxide, these anthropogenic gases include carbon monoxide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, acetaldehyde, and methanol.  Plastics used in the spacecraft cabin can outgas formaldehyde, and heat exchangers can leak ammonia into breathing air.  Overheating electronics can release carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride.  Thus, continuous air monitoring is required.Mesa Photonics proposes development of a highly miniaturized, highly efficient Fourier Transform (FT) spectrometer for continuous monitoring of contaminant air. The spectrometer will be able to detect a wide range of compounds with response times of about 30 seconds.  Our approach combines several innovations that will lead to a rugged and reliable spectrometer capable of space-based operation and having a long shelf life.  Spectrometers will be about the size of a lap-top computer, weigh about 4 kg, and consume about 10 W.  Most target contaminants will be detectable at part-per-million or lower concentrations.","NASA commercial applications for trace gas detection include crew habitat air monitoring, crew physiology monitoring by breath analysis, early warning fire sensing, launch pad and test bed safety monitoring, and leak detection.","Gas monitoring and detection encompass a wide range of medical, industrial, and environmental commercial markets.

Recent advances in sensor technology have led to the development of miniature analytical instruments.  However, many of these systems require a means of producing a vacuum with pressures under 1 Torr to either supply a rough vacuum or to back a high vacuum pump such as a molecular drag pump or turbo pump.  Unfortunately, currently available rough vacuum pumps remain large, heavy, power hungry and unreliable.

Prototype assays will be lyophilized in plastic cuvettes and capped under vacuum or otherwise sealed to prevent opening in negative pressure environments.  Lyophilization with trehalose or other excipients will extend shelf-life to greater than 2 years for these rapid (15 minute) one step (homogeneous) FRET assays that will be quantified with an ultrasensitive commercial handheld fluorometer. Data can be displayed on the handheld reader and downloaded to a laptop computer.","In addition, to its present intended use for monitoring bone loss in astronauts under OpTech's Phase 2 SBIR funding from NASA, this same platform technology could be used as a portable means to monitor water quality by ultrasensitive detection of bacteria, fungi and specific parasites.

The target application was to provide heat rejection for the ascent module of the Altair lunar lander vehicle during the lunar ascent mission phase.  However, in order to provide heat rejection for the ascent module during the rest of the mission, it is desirable to keep the ascent module integrated with the fluid loop in the rest of the Altair vehicle.  Therefore, we propose an Integrated Sublimator Driven Coldplate (ISDC) that can function as both a standard flow-through cold plate and a Sublimator Driven Coldplate.  The ISDC builds on the original SDC concept by adding coolant layers so that it can be integrated with the pumped fluid loop on the rest of the vehicle.  This approach provides mass savings by (1) combining multiple pieces of hardware into a single piece of hardware and (2) providing additional fault tolerance without the need for redundant hardware.","The main application this SBIR could directly impact is the Altair lunar lander, in particular operation of the ascent module once it separates from the descent module.  However, other NASA applications could benefit from this research program as well.  For example, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle may see similar benefits.  Instead of an ascent module and descent module on Altair, Orion has a crew module and a service module.  Just like the Altair ascent module separates from the descent module before lifting off of the lunar surface, the Orion crew module separates from the service module before re-entering Earth's atmosphere.  Because of the analogous arrangement of these modules, Orion may see similar mass and reliability benefits from an ISDC due to combining multiple functions into one piece of hardware and/or strategic location of various components between the two modules and the associated ""gear ratios"" for launch propellant.","In addition to NASA space vehicles, commercial space vehicles may benefit from this technology as well.  Paragon has been working with a number of commercial space companies to design their thermal control systems.  Due to the nature of the vehicles and their concept of operations, cold plates and sublimators almost always end up being included in these systems along with a pumped fluid loop.

NASA is pursuing several ways to generate oxygen from lunar regolith and reduce reliance on Earth for consumable re-supply. The most mature method is via hydrogen reduction.  Paragon SDC proposes an innovative method for removing the problematic acidic contaminates from the water vapor compound released during the first stage of the hydrogen reduction process. This innovation also includes a subsequent high temperature water electrolysis technology that is insensitive to dissolved ions, should they persist beyond the acid scrubber. The final product of this system could essentially produce a source of oxygen using almost only in situ resources including lunar regolith (assumed to contain trace amounts of hydrogen) and sunlight. The process could be built to require very little crew interaction and is planned to be highly resistive to harsh chemical interactions.  Further, the high temperature electrolysis proposed produces pure, dry oxygen making it a very appealing solution to the challenges facing ISRU programs in generating oxygen from lunar regolith.","The acid scrubber will remove acid contaminants from a moist stream directly received from a lunar regolith hydrogen reduction reactor.  This acid-free water stream can then be delivered directly to a high temperature solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) unit to produce pure, dry oxygen.The acid scrubbing technology can also be applied to several NASA processes where water needs to be separated from methane. Specific NASA examples include down stream of Sabatier reactors used in air revitalization systems, lunar regolith carbothermal reduction systems, and propellant production systems on Mars.  In all, the water is separated and sent to an electrolyzer to recycle hydrogen and produce oxygen as a consumable.SOE is currently being developed as a technology for air revitalization systems, enabling 100% oxygen regeneration from human metabolic byproducts alone. As SOE can electrolyze carbon dioxide as well as water, SOE can also potentially be used in other lunar regolith reduction systems that use carbon monoxide or methane as the reducing agent.",The non-NASA applications are significant as terrestrial based applications of SOE (and its other function as a solid oxide fuel cell) also are threatened by contaminants such as sulfuric acid.

The proposed centrifuging step-screw conveyor concept will provide a well controlled robust, reliable, dust-free method of transporting loose regolith over short distances (up to 10's of meters) at any inclination angle, ranging from vertical-up to vertical-down.  The method offers immediate variable flow-rate control, including complete reversal of the direction of the solids flow without changing the rotation rate of the conveyor drive.  This novel approach for transporting loose granular solids can provide a reliable means of moving regolith from a lower to an upper hopper  a stated NASA need for oxygen production from regolith.  This SBIR project will demonstrate the feasibility of the basic variable-flow-rate centrifuging step-screw.  Planned follow-on Phase-2 development will optimize the shape of the step-screw blades to minimize wear and power requirements and couple the basic step-screw with a reliable pre-screening method to reject material greater than 5mm in size. The unit could be sized for Oxygen production scale operations (50kg/hr) or for construction-scale operations (300kg/hr).  This conveying technology has very low frictional losses compared to conventional screw conveyors.  The basic modular design allows any number of individual modules to be Daisy-chained together, with arbitrary, abrupt, changes in angle from zero to 180o at each module transition.  Each succeeding leg can go at any arbitrary direction or inclination, even vertically up or down, always maintaining precise, adjustable solids flow control.  Centrifuging step-screw conveyors could be used in any solids-transport situation where conventional screw augers, bucket elevators, or short conveyor belts are the current transport means being considered.  The potential advantages include robust operation, and precise control of solids flow rates with minimal set of moving parts.","Almost all plans for extended lunar operations include the production of oxygen from lunar regolith, but even shorter missions will involve collection, moving, handling, and often processing of fine cohesive regolith powder. The excavation rate needed for O2 production is on the order of 50kg/hr and for Site preparation tasks up to 300 kg/hr would need to be excavated and moved. Total amounts of regolith required are 100 tons for O2 production and over 2,000 tons for a full outpost deployment.  NASA needs hardware that is able to operate over broad temperature ranges (40 K to 400 K) and in the presence of abrasive lunar regolith and partial-gravity environments. Generally NASA needs lunar regolith handling hardware that is robust, lightweight, abrasion resistant, made from vacuum and large temperature variation compatible materials, and with low power, low maintenance, and has a minimum of dust generation during operation.  The centrifuging step-screw conveyor developed under this project meets all of those requirements.  The method can be scaled to any required capacity, moving loose granular material over distances up to 20m in any direction, at any inclination, independent of gravity, with precise flow control, easily meeting the stated Oxygen production requirement of a 2m elevation change for 50kg/hr.","Most short-distance bulk material transport operations are potential applications for this new technology.  Relatively rapid, yet gentle transport of solids is possible with appropriately designed screw-steps so that no abrupt velocity changes occur.  In many situations this technology could replace conventional screw augers or dense-phase pneumatic transport lines. The centrifuging step-screw is particularly well suited for any situation where rapid, precise control of solids flow rate is desired.  The range of industries utilizing granular solids is very broad, including the mining, agriculture, chemical and pharmaceutical fields.  All of these industries have operations where the centrifuging step-screw could be utilized.",In-situ Resource Utilization

However, the Water Recovery System and Urine Processor Assembly currently used in the International Space Station can only recover as much as 90% of the water (Carter, 2009). Complete dewatering is not possible for these technologies since they are not designed for handling solids and processing is stopped before precipitates form. The only water recovery process that can handle solids is the Air Evaporation System (AES) which uses porous rayon wicks but its performance is severely limited by its low thermal conductivity and susceptibility to microbial growth. We propose to improve on the AES by designing an evaporation system using thermally conductive porous media. The high surface area and porosity of these porous media coupled with the use of vapor-compression distillation results in a novel system that can recover almost 100% of the water at the desired purity with high energy efficiency and minimal consumables.Makel Engineering and Cornell University are proposing the use of two processes, (1) freeze-concentration and (2) porous media evaporation, to produce water that meets electrolysis purity requirements needed for oxygen production from lunar regolith. While freeze-concentration systems have been shown to be effective in purifying water for terrestrial applications, we believe that our proposed process is the first to power the freezing-melting cycle by a thermoelectric heat pump. Our innovative system will exploit the property of thermoelectrics to reverse their heating and cooling sides, leading to the reuse of the enthalpy of fusion and simple equipment design.  In principle, our process will operate at high energy efficiency, recover more than 99% of the water from the feed at the desired purity, and use no consumables.","Clean water is a common requirement for many mission scenarios.  Therefore, a process to purify water with a high level of recovery and to a high degree of purity will enable reclamation from various sources.","Small scale water purification can find military uses, where water resources may be limited, as well as in remote locations.",Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; In-situ Resource Utilization

Unlike state-of-the-art carbothermal reactors that use concentrated solar energy or laser energy to heat the regolith, the ACE reactor uses new innovative electric resistant elements to heat the regolith. The ACE reactor eliminates the problems encountered with traditional carbothermal hot-wall reactors and offers significant advantages over current carbothermal reactor approaches. By eliminating the need for a solar energy collection and delivery system, the ACE reactor offers a significantly lowers system mass and eliminates the need to keep optical surfaces clean. The ACE reactor approach can also produce the processed regolith in a form that can be directly used as a structural material. This proposal directly meets the needs of Subtopic X3.01, specifically ""Advanced reactor concepts for carbothermal reduction or molten oxide electrolysis."" The proposed Phase 1 Effort will define requirements, develop the heating elements, perform performance tests in a sub-scale ACE reactor, and create a preliminary design for a prototype ACE reactor that would be built and tested in Phase 2. The Phase 2 Effort will include fabrication and performance testing of the prototype ACE reactor before it is delivered to NASA.","The purpose of ISRU is to harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration to create products and services which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term andlong-term space exploration. In particular, the ability to make propellants, life support consumables, fuel cell reagents, and radiation shielding can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. The ACE reactor will support this need by efficiently producing oxygen from the lunar regolith. The ACE reactor would be capable of satisfying oxygen requirements for EVA and life support in Exploration Surface Systems, and can be used to provide LOX for propulsion requirements in both Lunar and potential Mars missions.  The ACE reactor could also produce the oxygen used in future architectures involving Earth-Lunar shuttles and orbital propellant depots.","The development of ACE reactor is clearly focused on supporting the needs of the NASA lunar exploration program. However, there are several commercial companies making significant progress towards spaceflight, including Bigelow Aerospace, Scaled Composites, and Space-X. There are significant cost/propulsive savings associated with obtaining oxygen from the Moon versus bringing it from Earth, and systems have been proposed to use lunar oxygen to resupply vehicles anywhere from LEO down to the lunar surface. As commercial flight systems mature, the ACE reactor could provide an economical source of oxygen. In addition, the innovative electric resistance heaters developed for the ACE reactor could have a significant commercial market as the first high-temperature heating elements that can operate in oxidizing, reducing, or vacuum environments.",In-situ Resource Utilization

In the LOWR, solar thermal concentrators are used to heat steam directly to 900 C, after which the steam is injected into a reactor which is being fed with waste materials via a lock hopper. At the high temperatures, the steam will react with all organic materials to produce a gas mixture largely composed of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with small fractions of methane and CO. After removing the remaining steam from the product stream via condensation, the gases are dusulfurized and then fed through a polysulfone membrane which separates CO and CH4 in the retentate from CO2 and H2 in the permeate. The retentate CO/CH4 gas stream can be used to reduce regolith, while the CO2/H2 permeate stream is sent to a Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) reactor which transforms the CO2/H2 gas into CO and H2O. The CO can then be used for regolith reduction, while the H2O can be used as is, or electrolyzed to make oxygen and hydrogen. With effective recycling of the steam, no consumables are lost in the process. All products are liquids or gases, making the system highly reliable and subject to automation. In the proposed Phase 1 program, Pioneer Astronautics will build on its extensive heritage with development of RWGS and regolith reduction systems developed for Lunar and Mars in-situ propellant production to build and demonstrate a LOWR unit.","The LOWR would provide NASA with a technology capable of completely recycling the metabolic and plastic wastes of the crew of a lunar base to produce pure breathing oxygen, water, as well as useful reductants or fuels including CO, hydrogen, methane, and/or methanol, thereby significantly reducing lunar base logistic support costs. Mass savings for a 4 person base could be as much as 6 tons per year in lunar payload delivery, which translates into a reduction of 30 tons per year launched to orbit. Using electrical heat in place of solar thermal concentrators to superheat steam, the LOWR could also be used to recycle wastes on the International Space Station, the Orion spacecraft, or at a Mars base. In addition, LOWR technology can also be used to turn Martian atmospheric CO2 into useful methane and oxygen bipropellant. The ability to make such propellant on Mars is potentially a huge cost saver for both robotic Mars sample return (MSR) missions and well as human Mars exploration. Indeed, currently a major show stopper for the Mars sample return mission is the inadequacy of existing aerobrake technology to deliver a payload as massive as a fully-fueled Mars ascent vehicle to the Martian surface. By sharply reducing the mass that needs to be delivered to the surface, LOWR technology could not only reduce the cost of the MSR mission, but potentially enable it.","On Earth, the LOWR could be used as a means of recycling plastics and other wastes to produce such useful clean burning fuels as methane, which is a prime product for generating electricity, and hydrogen and methanol, both of which are of great interest for use in fuel cells. Manufacture of such fuels from wastes could help achieve a reduction in total emission of greenhouse gases, since if disposed of otherwise or left to decay on their own, the carbon in the waste products would eventually turn into CO2 without displacing other fuel use.  Currently, there is much public discussion over the possibility of converting cars to run on natural gas or methanol. If such programs move forward, LOWR technology could also be used to produce fuel for the automotive transportation market as well, thereby contributing significantly to liberating the nation from its dependence on foreign oil.",Biochemical Conversion; Biomass Production and Storage; Biomedical and Life Support; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; In-situ Resource Utilization; Renewable Energy; Solar; Waste Processing and Reclamation

New calibration data for numerical flow simulation models will also be obtained.  The new low-g simulants will provide readily accessible, inexpensive means to verify that equipment intended to function under reduced gravity conditions, will actually function as intended when deployed in the 'real' application environment.  Drop towers or parabolic flights are the only current viable methods available to create reduced gravity environments for testing equipment, without involving actual flights in space; but they have severe restrictions on test duration, volume and expense.  Recent simulations, drop tower tests, and centrifuge tests have demonstrated that granular materials tend to act more 'cohesive' at reduced gravity.  This change in behavior at reduced gravity, is not due to a change in cohesive strength of the material, rather it is due to a reduction in the gravity driving force inducing material to flow.  Under reduced gravity, reduced flow rates and/or flow stoppages are observed in hoppers; and, in rotating drum flows large clumps and large avalanches develop, which are not seen for the same material at one-g.  The large fine-fraction, and potentially increased surface energies, of in-situ regolith material already increase the likelihood of flow stoppages, or no-flow conditions, occurring within in-situ resource utilization processing equipment.  The additional risk of flow stoppages because of reduced gravity is difficult to test terrestrially.  The low-gravity-emulating surrogate regolith simulants developed and verified under this research, and the calibrated numerical simulation models, will offer new, inexpensive, methods to test whether solids will flow or not under reduced gravity.","Almost all plans for extended lunar operations include the production of oxygen from lunar regolith, but even shorter missions will involve collection, moving, handling, and often processing of fine cohesive regolith powder.  Reduced gravity will increase the sensitivity of handling and processing equipment to the high-cohesion properties of the fine regolith powder, and dramatically increase the likelihood of plugging or no-flow conditions (as occurred with the Phoenix regolith delivery for testing on Mars, for example). This project includes the design of a series of parabolic-flight regolith simulant flow calibration tests, using existing lunar and Martian regolith simulants. Utilization of these flow-calibration tests, to verify that the new low-g simulants do indeed mimic the effects of reduced gravity, will provide NASA designers the confidence needed to utilize these low-g simulants early in the design/testing process, thereby minimizing the number of no-flow surprises later, when real reduced-gravity environments are encountered.","If commercialization of space, other than LEO, occurs in the next few decades, it will be with lunar operations.  Whether those are robotic recovery of scarce minerals, or manned operations, equipment will still need to be designed that will handle, move and process regolith under reduced gravity.  Because of the great expense of moving mass to the moon (~$2M per kg in 2009), most testing of equipment will be done terrestrially.  The low-g simulants developed under this research will provide an economical means of doing preliminary flow/no-flow condition testing of regolith handling hardware, intended for use on the moon or other low-g environments.",In-situ Resource Utilization

The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons. International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, proposes the development of lightweight, multi-layered, polymeric shielding against GCR. Phase I Technical Objectives include selection, design and fabrication of materials tailored to shield against hazardous radiation, and measurement and test of individual and layered materials using available radiation sources.  The anticipated result of the Phase I and Phase II programs is the development of multi-layered shields with an outer layer of hydrogenous polymeric material for significant dose reduction of incident GCR ions and inner layers of polymeric composites containing additives chosen to moderate and absorb neutrons resulting from fragmentation of incoming heavy ions and to absorb short wavelength electromagnetic radiation resulting from the slowing of the GCR particles and capture of neutrons.  The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the beginning of Phase I is 3. At the end of Phase I, the TRL will be 4 or higher.","The proposed multi-layered radiation shielding will find application in meeting the needs of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA in protecting astronauts and settlers from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) hazards resulting from long-duration operations on the lunar surface.  It is expected that the multi-layered shields will provide an approach to GCR shielding of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (Orion), pressurized lunar rovers, the mobile human habitat and human habitats not amenable to regolith radiation protection, and the long duration surface suit as well as other extravehicular activity ensembles.  The reductions in weight and volume afforded by the multi-layered shielding would be welcomed for space transport and mobile shielding systems.  Other missions supported by NASA, such as the Exploration Technology Development Program, could also make use of the multi-layered materials in low earth orbit or in other orbital paths traversing high radiation regions of space.","Lightweight multilayered shielding will find application in the commercial sector in reducing collateral damage from heavy charged particles currently emerging as a therapeutic approach in nuclear medicine.  The shielding will lead to decreased fatigue among medical personnel required to wear heavy protective garments during radiological procedures.  Workers in industrial facilities using radiation for materials-processing and in nuclear power facilities will also benefit from more comfortable garments having reduced weight and thermal stress. Department of Defense and Homeland Security applications include protection of soldiers, first responders and emergency medical personnel against high energy gamma radiation and neutrons resulting from so-called dirty bombs as well as from hazards brought about through accidental release of radiological materials.  It is also expected that the shielding can be fabricated into temporary shelters used by defense personnel and considered for use in the protection of individuals in case of a nuclear or radiological event.

An inflatable fabric enclosure can provide better radiation protection than an aluminum structure (which generates harmful secondary radiation). The proposed inflatable structure represents a hybrid restraint system in which a gas-impervious cloth barrier is structurally reinforced using an external grid of cordage. This hybrid design is based upon the premise that materials providing the surface coverage and impermeability necessary for fluid containment are ill-suited to withstand global pressure and mass loadsand vice versa. Segregating material roles enables significant weight reduction while satisfying stringent requirements for strength, dimensional stability, abrasion and impact resistance, and thermal control of the interior volume.","Habitation Structures:  Lunar habitation structures require significant amounts of thermal insulation and radiation shielding.  Early habitation modules will not likely be buried in lunar regolith, and therefore, will be fully exposed to the harmful radiation environment of the lunar surface.  This technology will allow surface habitation structures to provide both thermal protection and radiation shielding. Crew Exploration Vehicles:  The development of a crew exploration vehicle will need radiation protection for journeys to the moon and/or Mars.  Thermal insulation that can provide a portion of this protection will reduce mass and volume requirements, resulting in substantial cost savings and more efficient use of habitable space.  Robotic RoversThis innovation can be utilized as thermal protection and radiation shielding techniques for robotic rovers and satellites. Although no human presence will occur for these systems, electronics will benefit from reduced radiation levels and the integration opportunities offered by the innovation to combine radiation shielding with thermal insulation.","Military ApplicationsMembers of the United States' armed forces are called upon to serve in remote areas of the world, and often under harsh climatic conditions.  Hence, the need for transportable shelters is universal, whether to house troops, establish command posts, or protect costly equipment employed by the war fighter.  Said shelters must be robust, packable and easily deployed under adverse conditions. Moreover, the ability to affect some level of thermal control over the interior space has become much more important as US troops face adversaries in harsh desert regions. The materials, processes, and products derived from the proposed investigation could redefine the notion of a field ""tent"" and alleviate the need for makeshift plywood shelters.

NextGen's novel approach is to join multiple beams, forming a continuous cellular arched structures or a series of connected rings to form cylinders. Key advantages of this approach include: ability of structure to maintain strength and stiffness independent of pressure in habitable volume, double wall construction preventing puncture of internal/external wall, ability to isolate leaks in affected elements without compromising habitat pressure or structural integrity, possible use of water or other radiation absorbing material to fill beams, and relative ease of creating a rigid structure by filling the beams with foam.

The proposed approach holds the promise of a much simpler structure design that is both lightweight and compactable (low delivery volume) and yet capable of expanding into an expansive surface volume.  FSC research indicates the possibility of a new class of deployable, space-based structures that utilize an advanced folding methodology as the primary engineering and assembly method combined with the use of multi-laminate sheet materials.  The proprietary patterning algorithms design tessellations for planar sheets that articulate dynamically on the edges of the tessellation allowing for uniform deployment across the entire sheet.  Previous to the development of these algorithms, there was no general system for generating doubly periodic folded structures.  Based on results from a previous NASA SBIR project, FSC will apply its proprietary folding techniques to the broad topic of expandable habitat structures.  The proposed project will essentially become the demonstration stage for the previous research effort, and thus, extend and provide continuity to the ongoing NASA interest in this area.","Applying, adapting and/or additional development of the proposed folding theory will provide a technical break-through in folding architectures for expandable structures (such as floors, airlocks, and connecting tunnels) for lunar habitat applications.  Other space-based applications include arrays, parabolic reflectors, sun and radiation shielding and extendable masts and booms.  In addition to inflatable architectures, other strategies (including solar heating/radiation, elastic memory, and mechanical force) can be employed for self-activating and sustaining the unfolding process.","Material folding lends itself to a number of applications from very sophisticated (aerospace) to the ordinary such as packaging materials.  Kraft paper cores based on the folding techniques could yield a superior product to corrugated cardboard.  The chevron pattern could be used in a single layer to absorb shock similar to bubble-wrap.  Multi-layer blocks could replace Styrofoam for use in space-filling and shock absorbing.  For aerospace using aluminum or composite materials, the folded structures could improve upon the existing honeycomb cores, which are used throughout the airplane in the floors, luggage compartments, and wings.  For the transportation industry, aluminum or steel folded tessellations in flat laminated panels could be used for high strength but lightweight truck beds.  Folded materials could be specifically designed for automobile floors to give a resilient strength to the frame while also serving to dampen the overall vibrations of the automobile.

Conventional designs suffer from indeterminacy of load sharing between meridional and circumferential members as well as the internally rigid metal support structure. The designs must functionally index the meridional and circumferential members to one another to minimize sensitivity to manufacturing, handling and operational trauma, all the while maintaining their independent load carrying roles. This design process results in oversized members to account for load uncertainties.The unique Ultra High Performance Vessel (UHPV) technology provides the solution to the design and manufacture of robust inflatable structures with exceptional accuracy and dimensional stability. UHPV technology provides high shell load containment architecture with fully determinate load pathways that can be modeled mathematically. The lightweight, low cost inflatable fabric structure, consisting of barrier film layers, carrier cloth containment layers, and pressure restraint tendons can be designed and fabricated to provide an accurate geometry without the need for an internal skeletal frame. Eliminating the need for a rigid internal load-bearing frame allows the collapsed inflatable to be packaged in the smallest possible volume.To bring this innovative inflatable design to use for lunar habitats, airlocks and myriad other space environment and containment applications, a verification and validation plan using both testing and predictive analytical models is proposed to conclusively demonstrate that the fully load-determinate UHPV can meet all structural design requirements for habitable space structures and be accurately and repeatedly manufactured.","The potential post NASA applications are lunar surface system habitats, airlocks and other crewed vessels, deployable antenna reflectors, solar collectors, solar sails, payload fairings, water storage tanks, cryogenic propellant tanks, greenhouse enclosures, debris shields, radiation shields, re-entry vehicles, large telescopes, propellant depots, rover vehicles, orbital debris removal systems, emergency escape vehicle (ISS), and Martian air ships","The potential Non-NASA commercial applications are air bags, high altitude air ships, aerostats, compressed air energy storage. underwater habitat, underwater emergency escape system (submarine), portable storage tanks for oil transport, remote fuel depot stations, remote water storage tanks for forest fire control, cargo lift balloons, large, deep space antenna reflector for ground stations, antenna radome, emergency shelters, and troop shelters with integrated ballistic protection.",Composites; Inflatable; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Portable Life Support; Radiation Shielding Materials; Simulation Modeling Environment; Structural Modeling and Tools; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures

The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate QM Power's high performance motor and actuator technology called Parallel Magnetic Circuit (PMCTM) that excels at all of those key performance parameters in low temperature lunar environments. PMC motors and actuators have higher power density (over 20% lower weight and volume than alternative high perofrmance electric motors and actuators), higher torque density, run cooler, and operate more efficiently (over 90-94%) over a wider power output range than any known conventional AC or DC motors or actuators.","Due to the improved efficiency and other specific performance characteristics, PMC would greatly increase the range, payload capability, and functionality of the targeted mobility or robotic manipulator arm systems found in exploration vehicle or lunar surface systems.

ASR&D has developed a novel SAW device structure that is more sensitive to temperature variations than previous SAW temperature sensor devices, that will function with the high S/N interrogation electronics being develop by ASR&D for longer range SAW sensor measurement.  These demonstrated high sensitivity temperature sensors can be individually coded for identification, to operate in a multi-sensor system consisting of multiple passive solid-state SAW sensors that can be interrogated remotely using RF signals, and that respond with a signal that encodes both the sensor's identity as well as measurements of temperature.  The proposed Phase I effort will modify the current temperature sensor devices to incorporate coding, build and test these sensors (wired), verify compatibility of the sensors with the wireless interrogation system electronics, and demonstrate wireless temperature sensing of multiple uniquely identifiable sensors.","The primary NASA application for the proposed sensor system would be the distributed wireless measurement of temperature, within cryogenic (and other) storage tanks, and as DFI for large area composite validation testing in facilities such as the thermal vacuum chamber (Plumbrook Facility).  Numerous small, passive, lightweight sensors could be mounted in locations throughout the area to be monitored, and a central RF interrogation system could quickly scan through the sensors, providing rapid temperature distribution information.  Due to wireless operation of the sensors, applications in tanks would require only one tank feed-through for the antenna, minimizing heat-loss pathways.","In addition to these identified NASA applications, the proposed sensor system could be used in a wide range of commercial applications.  The ability of the proposed system to uniquely identify large numbers of individual sensors, combined with a hand-held interrogation system, could make this type of approach useful for inventory purposes where knowing the temperature history of a set of products is significant.  The temperature sensing capability could be applied to the monitoring of containers used for shipping products internationally.  For such an application, a small, battery powered interrogation system could be included inside the packaging.  This system could contain memory capable of logging the history of the container, so that upon delivery the recipient could download the data and see if the shipment was maintained at appropriate temperatures during transit.  The ability to identify unique shipping containers has also been discussed recently in light of homeland security issues.  If such a system could be made to tell the interrogator if the packaging had been tampered with, it would provide U.S. inspectors with a powerful tool to scan incoming shipments for potentially hazardous containers.",Composites; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Testing Facilities

New systems are needed to detect incipient flaws in composites before damage becomes critical.

Preliminary research results indicated that the proposed idea is very promising. The results of the proposed research will contribute to NASA's goal of performance enhancement, and reduction of launching and maintenance costs.","Potential applications of the proposed nanocomposite carbon fibers include reinforcing element for advanced polymeric composites.  Carbon fiber reinforced resin composites have many structural applications in space structures, load-carrying structures for air, ground, and surface vehicles that require lightweight and high performance.  Carbon fibers can also be used as reinforcement and repair of building and bridges.  Polymeric composite cylinders/structures have numerous NASA applications including composite shroud, components for Ares rockets, International Space Station, Orion crew capsules, beams and struts for many other space structures.","The proposed nanocomposite carbon fibers can potentially replace the conventional carbon fibers. They have a number of potential applications including reinforcing elements for structural components, fuel cell electrodes, filter, and many others.  It is particularly useful for aircraft, space structures, ground, and surface vehicles that require lightweight yet high performance to save fuel consumption. Nanostructure carbon fibers can also be used as reinforcement and repair of building and bridges.",Airframe; Composites; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; Erectable; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Modular Interconnects; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Organics/Bio-Materials; Reuseable

Unfortunately, the quality of composites manufactured with current out-of-autoclave prepreg systems is limited by their short shelf-life at ambient conditions.  The resin advancement, due to long lay-up times, commonly causes variations in fiber volume and higher void content in the cured structures.  Also, current out-of-autoclave prepreg systems do not provide the same level of performance, especially damage tolerance, as many current autoclave cured prepreg systems.  It is the objective of this work to develop a matrix and prepreg system for out-of-autoclave processing that has a year out-time at ambient conditions while also providing an excellent balance of mechanical properties and damage tolerance.  As an additional functionality, the out-of-autoclave prepreg system will be developed to have inherent skin-core self-adhesive properties so that film adhesives are not required for designs with honeycomb cores.  It is expected that the TRL will be 4 at the end of this Phase I program.","The successful completion of this research program will enable the development of high quality large composite structures that are manufactured out-of-autoclave and require long lay-up times.  The utilization of this out-of-autoclave prepreg material is initially targeted for NASA Ares launch vehicle structures but other NASA applications could benefit from this technology as related to the topic ""Low Cost and Reliable Access to Space"" LCRAS.  There are many cost advantages that will result from this specific technology for producing high performance composites including no autoclave capital equipment or consumables, no freezer storage due to the year out-time at ambient temperature, no film adhesives required for honeycomb core composites, and more damage tolerant structures that require less repair.  This material may also find use in out-of-autoclave composite cryotank development.","Opportunities for this material may be found in commercial, military, and civilian aircraft and helicopter applications that are trying to reduce material and processing costs of composite parts.  Specific applications may be found in primary and secondary structures including fuselage, wing structures, fairings, engine core-cowls, and rotor blades.  In comparison to current out-of-autoclave prepreg materials, the new technology will provide the avenue for development of much larger composite structures that require longer lay-up times.  The material system will provide better damage tolerance and enable the development of lower cost honeycomb composite structures due to the advantage of inherent skin-core self-adhesive properties.  Applications may follow for lower temperature cure systems in the manufacturing of composite marine vessels and ships due to the large structures and long lay-up times.",Aircraft Engines; Airframe; Composites; Erectable; Fluid Storage and Handling; Large Antennas and Telescopes; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Organics/Bio-Materials; Propellant Storage; Tankage

The Phase II project will focus on implementation of the proposed technology for newest materials developed up to date and scaling of the proposed technology to large area and complex shape FRP composite structural joints. The proposed technology developed at Integrated Micro Sensors Inc is based on laser-assisted fabrication of Micro Column Arrays (MCA) on the surface of the two materials prior to bonding. There are several advantages of the MCA technology in the drastic improvement of bonds between any similar and dissimilar materials. First, mechanical strength increases due to interlocking of the adhesive or brazing material between micro columns. Second, the bond strength increases due to the increase of the specific surface area by more than an order of magnitude. Third, stability increases due to the inherent elasticity of the micro cones during a deformation that can occur due to stresses induced by difference in thermal expansion between the material and adhesive or braze or under shear stress). Fourth, increase in the bond durability because of the repeated bend contours of the surface preventing hydrothermal failure. Fifth, wettability of the material surface significantly improves due to (i) a highly developed surface morphology at the micro and submicron level resulting from rapid solidification of the material surface during laser processing, and (ii) changes in local chemistry due to surface oxidation that could be beneficial to promoting a stronger bond.","Aerospace applications require novel and reliable material systems and structures to meet the increasing requirements of innovative designs. Lightweight composite materials have a high potential for applications in the areas of increased payload, reduced costs, and better survivability. Subsonic, supersonic, and especially hypersonic thrusts pose an extraordinary challenge for structures and materials. The airframe and engine require lightweight, materials and structural configurations that can withstand the extreme environment of the flight. One of the very important issues in the aerospace industry is bonding of dissimilar materials, since high bond resistance to high and rapid thermal and mechanical loads is required. Composite materials have very different coefficients of thermal expansion. In addition, structural properties and thermal conductivities are different too, which actually adds to the problem.  Aerothermic heating, and high mechanical loads caused by ultra-high speeds, is one area of intensive research targeted by the current project.","The MCA technology is efficient, highly reproducible, environmentally safe, and can be applied virtually to any solid state material. In addition, the MCA technology is highly scalable to large areas and minimum processing times, as the MCA fabrication efficiency is proportional only to the average laser power. Lasers with average powers up to 5 kW are currently commercially available. In addition, precise CNC systems are currently available for providing the MCA fabrication process on curved and complex shape parts. As a result the MCA application range will expand to any area where reliable bonding between to materials is required. Such areas can include medical applications (dentistry and bone surgery), sport gear (golf and hockey clubs, boats), automobile (lighter and stronger parts), etc.",Airframe; Ceramics; Composites; Kinematic-Deployable; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Metallics; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Structural Modeling and Tools; Thermal Insulating Materials

Pastprototypes, while providing valuable insights, have either been too large,too slow, or had too little pound-for pound regolith moving capacity(payload ratio) to be real options for a lunar outpost.  Novel designsincorporating dump beds, high-speed driving, and composite materials aregame changers, making lightweight excavation robots advantageous for lunarsite and surface work.Performance of elemental actions such as digging or driving has beenstudied, but it is performance in achieving a site-level task like bermbuilding that matters.

This will provide engineers with the ability to quickly examine ""What if?"" scenarios within a trade space by specifying an excavation architecture and receiving data and graphs evaluating that architecture's performance in terms relevant metrics, such as total energy used or total duration.Excavation tasks supporting outpost development and lunar ISRU will require moving hundreds to thousands of tons of regolith per year.  Moving this much regolith will require substantial machinery, but transportation costs on the order of $50K to $100K per kilogram to the surface of the Moon make it an economic necessity to make optimal use of lunar excavation equipment.  An architecture that saves a few thousand kilograms in equipment will save hundreds of millions in program dollars  a substantial return on investment.This software aims to be (a) user friendly, (b) relevant to LSS's priorities, and (c) accurate for lunar excavation.  Phase 1 will address user-friendliness, relevance, and the theoretical side of accuracy.  Phase 2 will expand the tool's relevance to a larger trade space, and attack selected gaps on the empirical side of accuracy.  This tool will be based on the very best models and data available, and will benefit from the knowledge and experience of both Dr. Kris Zacny, the Principal Investigator, and Dr. David Carrier, a subcontractor in this effort.  Phase 1 will result produce the basic framework for the software, which will be capable of performing analyses for a selected set of excavation scenarios.  Phase 2 will then add depth to that framework to address a wide range of excavation tasks and tools, and will involve experimentation to validate and fine tune the software.","The software developed under this SBIR effort is specifically intended to facilitate system and architecture trades related to excavation activities on the lunar surface.  The next steps in lunar excavation will require moving large quantities  literally tons  of lunar regolith.   At transportation costs of $50K-$100K per kilogram to the surface of the Moon, it is economically imperative that lunar excavation and ISRU tasks be accomplished as efficiently as possible.Doing so requires not just minimizing the mass of individual systems, such as an ISRU reactor or a rover, but maximizing the efficiency of the overall architecture.  This is no mean feat, and will require many trade studies as different architectures are devised to make use of the landed resources available.  This software will speed the process, enabling quicker turnaround on trade studies and providing the best information available for decision making.","Honeybee has witnessed the interest of major international mining concerns in introducing robotics to industrial surface mines.  The issues of maintaining trained and trusted personnel in increasingly remote and sometimes conflict-prone locations makes autonomous, semi-autonomous, and teleoperated mining equipment very attractive.  In some cases, applying robotics to the mine is as simple as automating a formerly manual procedure.  In other cases, the issues are more complex and require careful consideration of multiple alternative architectures.  It is actually rather similar to the challenge of selecting appropriate excavation architecture for the Moon, with the added wrinkle of interfacing with legacy logistics and processing architecture.With appropriate modifications, this software could provide a means to facilitate trade studies for commercial mining concerns increasing the use of robotics in the mine.

The two-fold innovation in the proposed effort is the simultaneous intrinsic (i.e. defect chemistry) and extrinsic (electrically conductive surface coating) modification to the active material, which itself is a composite of two layered materials. The proposed intrinsic and extrinsic modifications are projected to beneficially impact both ionic and electronic conductivities of the cathode material, and thereby enhance the Li-ion cell performance at low operating temperatures. The target specific capacity of the proposed cathode is more than 300 mAh/g with a nominal working voltage of 3V, and delivering more than 900 Wh/kg specific energy at T=0 C. The objective of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of a new high capacity and high voltage cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries. In Phase II, the composition and morphology of the powders will be optimized, and integrated into large format prototype Li-ion batteries by working in partnership with a battery manufacturer(s).","Currently, Li-ion batteries are utilized only for low-cycle life space applications, but reliable and high energy density storage devices with low temperature performance are essential for Altair-lunar lander, extravehiclular activities (EVA) and surface operation on the Moon or Mars.

The current benchmark system has a mission life of at least 8 years during which time there is no opportunity for repair, sensor calibrations, or any maintenance of any kind.  By contrast, terrestrial-based nuclear power plants undergo periodic outages during which time sensor calibrations can be performed.

In the present proposal, Lynntech proposes an advancement of its proprietary OER catalyst technology through optimization in microstructure and composition of mixed oxides of iridium and ruthenium. Lynntech's optimized catalyst will exhibit lesser overpotentials due to enhanced uniform nanophase properties of electrical conductivity, hydrophilicity and high surface area. In addition, surface modification of the catalyst is proposed to improve the kinetics of the OER reaction at lower current densities and also to improve the stability of the catalyst towards high potential operation during anodic OER. With its present OER catalyst already achieving less than 1.44 V at 200 mA/cm2 at 90 ºC and stable operation even at 2.05 V electrolyzer potentials, Lynntech plans to achieve even lower potentials at 200 mA/cm2 with the proposed advancement of technology.","Lynntech's advanced OER catalyst can be used for electrolyzer energy storage for NASA's future robotic and human exploration missions, particularly for stationary power for lunar surface bases.

This improved membrane can increase the performance and especially the durability of static vapor feed electrolyzers.  Static vapor feed electrolyzers greatly simplify electrolyzer systems as they eliminate the need for water/gas phase separation, which is particularly challenging in a zero gravity environment.  Maintaining water in the vapor phase greatly reduces membrane swelling which should increase durability.  Finally, by keeping water in the vapor phase the MEA is not exposed to ion and other contaminants that are carried by a liquid water stream, further increasing durability and simplifying the system by reducing the need for ultra-pure water.  The primary goal of this Phase I program then is to demonstrate the enhanced performance and durability of a static vapor feed electrolyzer utilizing an improved water management membrane.","Lunar and space stations, satellites, high altitude aircraft.Terrestrial water electrolyzers typically utilize an abundance of recirculated water to the electrolyzer, usually on the anode (oxygen) side, where it serves reactant, coolant, and as the ""carrier"" phase wherein the product oxygen is carried from the anode by the pumped water.  Subsequent to leaving the electrolyzer the phases are separated by gravity in a receiving tank.  In near-zero or low-gravity environments, this separation is difficult to achieve.  Doing so results in additional system complexity and compromised process efficiency.  As part of a regenerative fuel cell system, NASA has a need for highly-efficiency, but robust technologies capable of storing energy in the form of stored hydrogen and oxygen.  The Static Water Vapor Feed (SWVF) Electrolyzer is an elegant solution to overcome and simplify the above problems.  Thus NASA will be the first to utilize electrolyzers with this technology, possibly in the Constellation mission in the lunar-based and Martian energy storage systems.","Utilizing a water vapor feed is highly attractive for laboratory and small industrial scale electrolyzers.  Giner Electrochemical Systems, LLC. is the world's largest supplier of laboratory electrolyzer stack and stack parts.  These electrolyzers have excellent proven durability, greatly exceeding five years.  However, they require an extremely pure deionized water feed.  The ability of a vapor-fed electrolyzer to operate on tap water would make this technology even more attractive for these applications.In a similar fashion to water permeation through an ionomeric membrane, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol can permeate membranes.  Thus the static vapor feed technology may be useful in alcohol-air batteries such as those used for portable power.  In all these applications, the management of the gases and liquids involved generates significant complexity that inevitably increases the cost and reduces reliability of such devices.

It is known that MLI insulation for cryogenic propellant feed lines is much less effective than MLI for tank insulation. A Ball Defense Program study indicates the heat leak through spiral-wrapped MLI into lines is up to 10 times worse per area than tank MLI. Better insulation for cryo-feed lines is an important enabling technology for NASA Exploration vehicles.In this Phase I project we would model, conduct a trade study on thermal requirements for NASA spacecraft cryogenic feed lines, design W-IMLI, fabricate a prototype and measure thermal performance.","Improved passive thermal insulation for cryogenic propellant lines is a critical need for the NASA Exploration vehicles, where the heat leak into cryo-feed lines is estimated to be 10 to 20% of the overall system heat leak.

Lower heat leak, easier assembly, and ability to install, remove for inspection, and reinstall are all desirable features for cryogenic feed line insulation.IMLI and Wrapped-IMLI may offer excellent properties required for spacecraft use with low thermal conductance, inherent control of layer dimensions and heat leak.","Extremely efficient thermal insulation, easily assembled and applied to cover various surfaces, including pipes and tubing, have utility in commercial cryogenic applications such as cryogenic vessels and lines in scientific and industrial applications. Insulated cryogenic tubing is used for transfers of cryogenic liquid into and from cryogenic dewars for liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, liquid oxygen, etc., which are widely used in research, medical and industrial applications.There are several major industrial uses for cryogenic lines and handling equipment. Cryogenic pipes, lines and tubing uses include liquid nitrogen (LN2), liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas (LNG) handling products such as piping, automatic filling equipment, dewar manifolds and gas panels. LN2 equipment is used for industrial or food applications including semiconductor, electronics and aerospace environmental temperature testing, special effects (fogging), biological freezing applications, inerting of food and beverage containers, container pressurization and food freezing.Liquid Nitrogen finds numerous uses for food and beverage preservations (""inerting"") such as full container inerting, headspace inerting, and pressurization of food products, cans and PET bottles.  High performance insulated cryogenic transfer piping is critical to the LNG industry, where heat gain into pipes causes LNG losses from vaporization during liquid transfer.",Feed System Components; Fluid Storage and Handling; Propellant Storage; Thermal Insulating Materials

Any DC cryogenic flow system such as turbo Brayton, Joule-Thomson (JT), or remote cooling applications require very high effectiveness heat exchangers to reduce input power. The parasitic loads from heat exchangers are a significant fraction of the overall load, and high effectiveness heat exchangers lead directly to improved system efficiencies across a broad range of cryogenic applications.Microplate heat exchangers have a demonstrated effectiveness over 98% (Marquardt, Cryocoolers 15). While performance is high, they will be difficult to use for larger cryogenic flow systems due to parasitic conduction losses inherent in the materials available for the manufacturing process. A material change will allow more compact heat exchangers with lower parasitic losses. Other limitations of the manufacturing process make yields low, and while it may be possible to push the effectiveness higher, it may be difficult to consistently produce high performing exchangers using the current approach.We propose a new bi-metal microplate heat exchanger which is unique in that it uses the manufacturing process to control critical heat exchanger dimensions that are inherently similar across all parts, allowing high effectiveness without the need for close inspection of every part and the low yield which results from hand inspection. We further include additional features within the flow channels that automatically balance the mass flows within the heat exchanger to push the effectiveness even higher. This is accomplished in the most compact cryogenic heat exchangers theoretically possible to build using parallel plate flow channels.","If the Microplate Heat Exchanger program is successful, not only will a revolutionary advancement be made to low temperature space cooling technology, but the path to further commercialization will be straight forward. The most obvious commercialization of the proposed technology development will be through incorporation into BATC's space cryocooler product line. BATC has been and is a leader is long life space cryocoolers, especially at low temperatures. BATC's current and previous low temperature space cooler programs include the NASA Advanced Cryocooler Technology Development Program (ACTDP) Study and Demonstration Phases, the AFRL 10 K Engineering Model Cooler Program, and the NASA Explorer 4 K Cooler Program. BATC is also a leader in cryogenic systems (that use coolers) and cryogenic instruments (that use cryogenic systems). These include the HIRDLS cryogenic subsystem which includes a Stirling cryocooler operating in space for over 2 years on the EOS Aura spacecraft. In an attached Support Letter, BATC has already expressed an interest in incorporating the technology developments on the Compact 4 K Hybrid Cryocooler program into their commercial space cryocooler product line for NASA and DoD applications.","A successful Phase 2 effort could lead to a large number of applications. Micro Cooling Concepts is currently a small business supplier to Ball Aerospace for components in their cryocooler product line. The microplate heat exchangers would become part of Ball Aerospace's primary cooler product line for any application utilizing a JT, JT/Stirling hybrid, or remote cooling application. MC2 will also market the microplate heat exchangers for commercial ground based applications.Closed cycle refrigerators (CCR) for wireless network products  the Pentagon's Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) contract for wireless radios could require cryocoolers if superconducting devices are used or for improved performance of the A/D converters. The JTRS program is an eight-year effort to initially build 180,000 common radios for use by the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines Corps. A critical component to the success of JTRS is the CCR, needed to cool the low temperature superconductor (LTS) analog-to-digital (A/D) converters and digital signal processors to 4.5 K. There is also a huge commercial market for wireless base stations, which could occur concurrently with the military deliveries if the technology can be demonstrated.",Cooling; Fluid Storage and Handling

The behavior of active and passive cryogenic management is paramount to the thermal status of a spaceship and cryotanks storage.  Efficient and reliable insulation materials are key to the success of long missions into space.  Aspen Aerogels proposes to develop a durable and cost effective hybrid aerogel/MLI insulation system for cryogenic storage in space applications.  The proposed hybrid insulation system will withstand micrometeoroids impacts and will outperform the MLI in cases of vacuum loss.  During the Phase II Program, extensive work will be dedicated to the developing a system level solution for installation of the flexible hybrid insulation system onto cryotank surfaces to minimize seams, and thermal leaks.  Development of the proposed novel cost effective insulation package will provide NASA with a long-term cryogenic propellant storage thermal control solution for applications in low earth orbit (LEO), and on the lunar surface.","The development and optimization of Aspen's low cost and durable hybrid aerogel/MLI insulation system will be immediately useful for wide variety of cryogenic applications such as In-space cryogenic tanks, transportation (pipelines) of cryogens and propellant, Mars exploration, near earth orbit spacecraft.

A need clearly exists for lightweight thermal insulation that is isotropic, structurally capable, and exhibits improved thermal performance relative to current materials and structures. Aerogels have been investigated as an insulation material for cryogenic tanks due to their ultralow thermal conductivity and density, but they suffer from poor structural integrity and require expensive processing. Open-cell foam structures have also been researched, but suffer from the requirement for high vacuum in order to perform adequately. In previous work for NASA and DoD involving lightweight structural insulation for high temperature engine and airframe applications, Ultramet developed and demonstrated lightweight open-cell foam insulators composed of a carbon or ceramic structural foam skeleton filled with a low-cost, nanoscale aerogel insulator. The potential exists to adapt and optimize aerogel-filled structural foam for the cryogenic insulation application, thereby taking advantage of the thermal and mechanical benefits of each component while also offering low cost and manufacturability in complex shapes. In this project, Ultramet will team with Alliant Techsystems (ATK), a leading aerospace firm, to demonstrate the initial feasibility of the innovative cryogenic insulation to meet NASA requirements.","The potential application of this technology as a lightweight, ambient pressure structural insulator for cryogenic propellant tanks and lines may prove an enabling technology for future NASA lunar and planetary missions. Passive thermal control is required for zero-boiloff storage of cryogens for both long term (>200 days for liquid oxygen and hydrogen) on the lunar surface and short term (14 days) on orbit. The technology will also support current and future development of cryogenic oxygen/methane rocket engines at ATK. The proposed aerogel-filled structural foam cryogenic insulation will offer improved thermal performance over current materials, with the added benefits of reduced weight and fabrication and installation costs.","Advanced cryogenic insulation will find extensive commercial application as cryogenic liquids (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and liquefied natural gas) must be stored, handled, and transferred in support of the food, transportation, energy, and medical industries.

In addition to their very high resolution (a benefit to nanopositioning applications for many years), they offer potential advantages for miniaturization and reduction of heat load as compared to electromagnetic actuators.  While some notable successes have been achieved in adapting piezoelectric actuators to cryogenic applications, the technology needs further innovation, development, and validation in order to reach a readiness level that can realistically be considered for use in future missions.Variation in strain rate with temperature, CTE mismatch relative to structural materials, and problems with protective coatings make use of PZT in cryogenic environment difficult.  Thorough characterization of existing PZT material and proposed improvements to coatings and structural materials used with PZT transducers offer the potential for higher performance and reliability.  With these improvements, it will be practical to use piezoelectric actuators in applications such as high force cryo-valves that can not presently be considered.","DSM has received interest from NASA regarding piezoelectric actuators for cryogenic applications and for others that do not require low temperature capability.  Many non-cryogenic uses require a wider temperature range than laboratory environment, so some of the proposed work related to CTE characterization and improved protective coating would be useful for these purposes, as well.  Many inquiries are related to the regulation of fluid flow or pressure.  Thruster valves used in highly miniaturized satellites have received significant attention.  Flow and pressure control of cryogenic propellants such as LOX for propulsion is also an area of interest.  A scientist at GRC has begun investigating whether this technology will be suitable for regulation of flow for a fuel cell application.  As the technology is more fully developed, it will be practical to pursue applications requiring more force.  Interest has been expressed in an actuator for a 2 inch cryo-isolation valve that will require over 150 pounds of output force.  There are many cryo and non-cryo valve applications that can potentially be addressed by this technology.","The most direct applications outside NASA are other aerospace projects that require actuators to operate valves for cryogenic fluid handling.  ESA and major US defense contractors have previously tested systems that used piezoelectric actuators from DSM.  It is reasonable to assume that once the technology reaches a readiness level that is acceptable for NASA, other aerospace entities will have similar interest in using it for their programs.  The US Air Force has expressed interest in very low temperature, high force piezoelectric actuators for use in their low Earth orbit simulation chambers at Arnold Engineering Development Center.

The passive thermal control will serve to limit the heat leak into the cryogenic storage system.  The proposed technology is expected to increase reliability, increase cryogenic system performance, and is capable of being made flight qualified for the flight systems and to meet Exploration Systems mission requirements.   We propose to develop advanced closed cell organic/inorganic hybrid microfoams offering affordable cost, lightweight, high strength, low thermal conductivity, high thermal stability, and easy processability which will result in improved efficiency and reliability of the cryogenic systems.  The proposed approach will be environmentally friendly and will not emit any volatile organic compound (VOC).   The closed cell structure of these novel foams will prevent the occurrence of cryopumping.   Once the feasibility of fabrication of strong, lightweight cryogenic insulating materials by the proposed technology is demonstrated in Phase I, we shall scale-up this technology in a Phase II program to meet the NASA's requirements.","The ability of the proposed hybrid microfoams to remain flexible and resilient at cryogenic temperatures makes them an ideal choice for lightweight insulation in space applications.  Some examples of NASA applications include cryogenic insulation of storage tanks, vessels, pumps, and transfer lines on major rocket propulsion systems.

In addition, these novel microfoams can be used as laminates for circuit boards or in other electronics.  In automobiles, the foam can be used for the firewall behind the engine or in brake pads, trim, molded plastic parts, and other care elements.  They also can be used in a variety of construction applications or in recreational equipment.

As an example cryocoolers, including redundant coolers are incorporated on select missions. The redundant coolers operate when deteriorating or defunct coolers are deactivated. However, integration of redundant coolers may cause substantial parasitic heat loads unless the cold regions are thermally connected to the active cryocooler only. The overall system efficiency will depend in part on the efficacy of the intervening heat switches. We propose to develop a highly effective, innovative prototype heat switch that combines two recently developed technologies. First, it employs a highly conductive thermal contact at a low applied force. Secondly, the heat switch employs an innovative bi-stable actuator. The actuator requires little energy to switch between states and can achieve motion on the order of millimeters. This available motion exceeds the tens to hundreds of microns needed to engage the contact, enabling complete separation, and thus, excellent thermal isolation in the off state. Combining the inherently high on- and low off-conductance of the contacts with the bi-stable actuator positioning provides for a highly effective, innovative heat switch, potentially enabling significant performance enhancement of NASA missions.","The proposed heat switch is directed in particular at enabling cryocooler redundancy in space. NASA exploration missions that use cryocoolers for propulsion preservation or ISRU, and lunar missions that need active thermal control can all benefit from the application of the heat switch. NASA missions that require cryocoolers such as astronomical missions that need cooling of detectors and optics to cryogenic temperatures will benefit from this technology as well.","The heat switch, as well as the underlying novel contact technology, is believed to be applicable to many uses in cryogenics and beyond as well. Heat switches are routinely used in magnetic refrigerators, an application area where the proposed switch would be highly suitable. For each use in which components serve only a temporary function the switch could be used to disconnect unnecessary heat loads once the need for their operation has vanished. For instance, the thermal efficiency of many applications that use thermal bus bars could be greatly improved by thermally disconnecting these items once they no longer serve a purpose, thereby, ending the otherwise persisting heat leak. Being thermally conductive the novel therrmal interface material may be used to attach thermometry, heaters etc. Being electrically conductive, it could also be used to form electrical connections. Thus, the switch could very well be reconfigured as a thermally conductive electrical switch. Further, the thermal interface material could be used to quickly attach items without the use of adhesives and to attach items in locations that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to achieve. Avoiding adhesives also eliminates the outgassing of various vapors over time.",Control Instrumentation; Fluid Storage and Handling; Instrumentation; Production

Under NASA SBIR NNX09CE49P ASR&D demonstrated wireless interrogation of SAW RFID sensor-tags.  In this project, we propose to combine the results of these two technology development programs to produce wireless, uniquely identifiable SAW-based hydrogen sensors, and to evaluate the sensor response time to low levels of hydrogen exposure (down to 1 ppm).  ASR&D will also implement a SAW-based in-situ Pd deposition monitor for enhanced film reproducibility.  ASR&D's previous hydrogen work was based on Argonne National Labs work with similar films that demonstrated hydrogen sensing from 25 ppm to over 2% hydrogen, with response times of milliseconds, complete reversibility, and no baseline drift at room temperature.  ASR&D demonstrated the ability to measure changes in such films using a SAW sensor, however our ability to test at low hydrogen concentrations and at rates exceeding 1 sample/sec were limited by our experimental test equipment.  In the proposed effort, we will utilize an Environics gas dilution system to generate calibrated gas concentrations (for hydrogen and methane) down to 1 ppm, and we will utilize the electronic interrogation system being developed for our RFID work to measure the sensors.  This system is capable of measuring sensor responses with a good S/N in 1 msec (or less), overcoming the prior limitations of our testbench equipment.  In addition to the hydrogen sensor work, working with Temple University, we propose to evaluate the technical feasibility of producing SAW-based methane sensors using a similar SAW sensor device, but incorporating methane selective supramolecular cryptophane films.  Hydrogen sensors will be TRL4 at completion of the proposed effort, and methane sensors will be TRL 3.","The primary NASA application for the proposed sensors would be in a wireless multisensor system for real-time leak detection in areas surrounding hydrogen and methane storage.  The potential ability of these sensors to respond in msec with quantitative measurements of hydrogen and methane at ppm concentration levels, combined with the demonstrated ability to uniquely identify each sensor and read the sensors wirelessly, should enable implementation of a wireless distributed real-time leak monitoring system.  The ability of the sensors to operate without batteries will allow deployment on long-term missions and minimize maintenance requirements.","There are two potential commercial applications for the proposed rapid, high sensitivity hydrogen sensors.  The first is quantitative determination of hydrogen concentration in human breath, used as a diagnostic tool for health conditions such as lactose intolerance.  Bacteria in the human digestive system produce low levels of hydrogen in exhaled breath (typically 7±5ppm), and analysis of the hydrogen concentration is part of the diagnostic process for several conditions.  Tests involve having the patient eat or drink something that will cause the bacteria to produce increased levels of hydrogen, and then monitoring breath for the resulting gas concentration.  The second application relates to hydrogen generation, delivery, and storage leak detection and  monitoring.  The high sensitivity, fast response times, reversibility, wide range of hydrogen concentration sensed, low cost, and small size would make the proposed sensors applicable to these emerging market segments.",Instrumentation; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors

The framework for this tool will be developed such that all relevant models can be coupled to the LeMANS code for nonequilibrium hypersonic flows and the MOPAR code for ablation material response, both developed by the University of Michigan.  In the proposed effort, the existing LeMANS-MOPAR framework will be enhanced by including innovative models for: (1) Non-equilibrium surface thermochemistry; (2) Non-equilibrium pyrolysis chemistry; (3) Radiation transfer in media with orders of magnitude variation in optical thickness; and (4) Spallation. The proposed tool is comprehensive and unique because all important phenomena will be modeled, with the software framework enabling coupling between the various components.  The Phase I focus will be to: (1) Develop a module for the Modified Differential Approximation (MDA) to solve the radiative transfer equation; (2) Develop a framework for coupling the MDA module to LeMANS-MOPAR; and (3) Demonstrate the coupled framework for cases such as the Stardust re-entry.  In Phase II, the tool will be made comprehensive by implementing important models identified above, including advanced non-equilibrium, non-gray radiation model.  The tool will be validated and applied to re-entry ablation flows relevant to NASA.  We will team with an ablative material OEM and a CFD software vendor to transition the technology to industry.","Future NASA missions will be more demanding and will require better performing ablative TPS than currently available. The proposed SBIR project will result in a computational tool with unique and accurate predictive capabilities for non-equilibrium re-entry flows with ablation cooling. The tool will find direct application in numerous NASA technology development programs under the Project Constellation, the New Millennium Program, and the In-Space Propulsion Technology Program.  The tool can also be used as a design tool for the development of new generation re-entry vehicles (such as the Crew Exploration Vehicle, Mars Aerocapture and Mars Sample Return spacecraft) and components of future hypersonic vehicles.  The various models comprising the tool will be implemented in an extensible and modular framework that can be ported to other NASA codes with relative ease.","Technology applications beyond NASA include Theater and National Missile Defense vehicles performing exo-atmospheric missile intercepts, and missile warhead re-entry applications. The computational tool will also be relevant to the joint DOD/NASA effort called the National Aerospace Initiative (NAI) that involves, among other things, the development of air-breathing hypersonic vehicles.  The module will have wide appeal to rocket engine manufacturers (e.g., ATK, Pratt & Whitney, and Aerojet) and to universities developing rocket engine technology (e.g. Purdue, Penn State, and University of Alabama in Huntsville).  OEMs will also find the tool useful in exploring and designing newer and more robust ablative TPS materials and heat shield systems.  The models developed in this SBIR project can also be ported to commercial CFD software such as CFD-ACE+ and CFD-FASTRAN (owned by ESI Inc. Huntsville).",Ablatives; Control Instrumentation; Cooling; Reuseable; Thermal Insulating Materials

The primary objective of CU Aerospace's Phase I work will be to fabricate and test aromatic thermosetting copolyesters (ATSP) composites for use as ablatives in next generation spacecraft missions. The synthetic development of novel aromatic thermosetting copolyesters was a major innovation in the field of polymer science. Previous testing of their capabilities showed excellent performance as adhesives, rigid foams, matrices for composites, and dielectrics for microelectronics.  Only recently has this material been considered as a viable ablative due to its high temperature stability and excellent composite mechanical properties especially due to the liquid crystalline nature of the polymer, which allows a matching of CTE between fiber and matrix. Our team partner the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will assist CU Aerospace to perform basic research and provide technical support to accelerate the transition of ATSP polymers into ablative composites. If successful CU Aerospace envisions the ATSP to be utilized in a wide variety of applications in both civilian and military spacecraft, either as a retrofit or as a next-generation design.","Application as ablative materials for reentry vehicles, missile nose cones, rocket nozzles, etc.  In addition, the commercialization of the ATSP could lead to additional markets such as high temperature adhesives and rigid structural foams.","The impact of this new polymer could extend into areas such as structural composites in commercial aircraft and automobiles, low dielectric constant circuit boards for microelectronics, and even coatings.  An attractive feature of this technology is the potential for recycling, which is very unique for a thermosetting polymer matrix.",Ablatives; Composites; Launch and Flight Vehicle

Potential missions for these new and/or improved TPS materials include Mars Entry, Descent & Landing, and Mars Sample Return, but the general desire is that these new technologies be capable of cross-cutting mission applications.  In addition to improved TPS performance, NASA also has a need for TPS integrated with the sub-structure that will improve thermal efficiency, insulation performance, system thermal-structural performance, and system integrity with the goal of achieving increased system reliability, reduced areal mass, and/or decreased costs over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA).This program will address NASA's need to: 1) Develop higher performing TPS materials to meet the demands of severe mission trajectories such as Mars Sample Return; and 2) Integrate TPS materials with the sub-structure to improve overall robustness and decrease mass.  This program's goal is to extend Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA, TRL=9) and Integrated Composite Structure (ICS, TRL=5) TPS materials to a broader range of flight heat fluxes and performance to address future missions and heatshield designs.  The current TRL for the multi-layered TPS system is 3, with an envisioned TRL of 6 at the completion of a successful Phase II program.","The Stardust Sample Return Capsule completed its objective with earth reentry in January 2006.  Mars Science Laboratory Aeroshell heat shield has been completed and delivery of the Curiosity rover to Mars is scheduled for 2015.  With the successful fabrication of these PICA TPS heat shields in support of NASA flight missions, FMI has quoted and is prepared to continue supporting PICA heatshield missions.

The proposed inflatable structure is a hybrid isotensoid pressure restraint employing an impervious cloth-reinforced barrier structure enveloped by an integrated array of high-tenacity tendons. The segregation of material functions provides greater design flexibility to meet stiffness and thermal protection requirements, while the external grid of cordage tendons provides mass- and load pathway-optimized containment of the structure's global pressure loads.   The focus of the Phase I effort is to develop and demonstrate the isotensoid inflatable structure, complete with thermal protection hardware and load bearing attachment fittings for guidance and control hardware. The tendon materials will be evaluated for their strength at high temperatures while cloth structural materials will be evaluated for their stiffness and thermal insulation properties to produce a truly multifunctional structural enclosure. Integrated fluid-structure-thermal simulations will be conducted with CFDRC's validated tools to provide insight into the aerodynamic, material stress and localized heating effects on the model and to verify/optimize the proposed design. Phase II activities will focus on fabricating and testing a prototype of the proposed inflatable structure to validate the design robustness and capability for larger payload masses. Pre and post testing multidisciplinary simulations will be conducted to verify and optimize the design. Additional simulations will be conducted for verification under exact flight conditions.","The proposed integrated hypersonic inflatable entry system will have an immediate application in delivering large payload masses to the surface of Mars. This will reduce the number of launches required for the mission completion and total mission costs. The proposed technology will find direct applications with present and future NASA and industry inflatable structures programs, such as those seeking to provide deceleration and precision landing capability for large scale mass return from Earth orbit to Earth surface, or for missions to many of the potential atmosphere-endowed solar system destinations.","Additional application areas include analysis of space-based inflatable structures such as telescopes and mirrors, satellite solar panels and military reentry vehicles (inflatable decoys, etc) exposed to the atmosphere. The aeroelastic analysis of parachutes and parafoils and the analysis of high-altitude endurance airplanes with flexible wings will be improved.

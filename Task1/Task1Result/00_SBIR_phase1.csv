Today, there are limited ice detection systems available that warn pilots of icing, used primarily by the military and airlines due to their high acquisition and certification costs.  Innovative Dynamics Inc. will address these issues by developing a low cost windshield infrared (IR) ice detector for the GA fleet.  Existing windshield ice detectors consist of a dash mounted red light that is only visible to the flight crew at night when light is reflected from ice accretion on the pilots windshield. The proposed ice detector will operate day and night providing icing conditions information, Outside Air Temperature as well as direct measurement of accumulated ice on the windshield. During Phase I, we will develop a prototype IR ice detector and demonstrate performance in an icing tunnel.  During Phase II, we will team with a leading GA manufacturer to develop a flight worthy ice detector for application to windshields of popular commercial Business Jet.",,"Applications for the windshield IR ice detector include OEM business jets, small general aviation aircraft, as well as large commercial aircraft.  A battery operated retrofit version of this technology would be ideal for the existing GA fleet owners who operate in IMC, and currently use visual cues and analog temperature gages to determine icing conditions.  Commercial opportunities also exist for a variant of this technology adapted to look out airline windows and determine dangerous accumulation of snow and ice on the main wings prior to take off."

Existing radars that have been used for these studies are expensive one-of-a-kind research instruments with designs that are unsuitable for general aviation, where cost will be a primary consideration.  By working cooperatively with manufacturers of microwave and millimeter-wave subsystems, we plan to develop a suite of radars for airborne and icing detection that will reduce the cost by a factor of five or more for prototype systems, and by a factor of up to 100 for production units. Practical airborne icing potential detection cannot be achieved without a major cost reduction of millimeter-wave radar systems. By using solid-state transmitters, integrated or monolithic low-noise receivers and IF circuits, and novel antenna concepts, and advanced signal processing techniques, we are confident that low cost systems can be developed for both airborne and ground-based applications.",,Potential commercial applications include aircraft icing avoidance systems for general aviation and military aviation use.

At a time of record growth in the airline industry more and more aircraft are added to airline fleets each year. Older aircraft are also being overhauled with additional safety features. As a result, increased amounts of flame retardant materials are being used in aircraft passenger cabins, cargo compartments and inaccessible areas in the pressure hull. The addition of flame-suppressing substances to the material provides a way to fireproof polymers, which constitute almost 3 and 8 tons of flammable polymeric materials in the aircraft.  Halogen containing molecules, used as fire suppressants have fallen out of favor because they release toxic dioxins when they burn.   Metal oxide hydrates, which release water at high temperatures, polymers which fend off flames by getting scorched on the surface, and even nylon-montmorillonite composites have been evaluated, but with limited success.  Therefore, a normal polymer when challenged by fire needs to become fire resistant.  A potential solution to this problem is in the form of a nanostructured additive that will be investigated in this Phase I program by Materials Modification, Inc.  In Phase II, the polymer-additive flame suppressant/retardant will be evaluated with varying concentrations of the nanostructured additive and the most promising combinations will be tested for fire retardancy with our commercial partner.",,"The niche area for flame retardants is in the aircraft industry.

It is anticipated that forthcoming rules from the DOT/FAA will require that fuel tank ullage be inerted on commercial aircraft during a significant portion of the operational envelope.  This will create an immediate, large and ongoing market for this technology.  TALON technology potentially offers a more attractive alternative to other approaches such as molecular sieves and semi-permeable membranes, because the bleed air requirements for TALON are of the order of 80% less, and existing aircraft cannot meet the bleed air requirements for these other approaches."

Often the stresses on a particular element are not the expected values.  If for instance from increased traffic on a bridge or poor installation of machine parts the stresses are higher than expected, the material may fatigue beyond safe limits before the scheduled replacement.

The sound waves in the resonator recombine with the duct acoustic waves at the tube exit. The fact that the waves in the HQ resonator travel a distance different than those in the duct results in a phase shift between the resonator and duct waves. Noise attenuation occurs at frequencies for which the recombining HQ resonator and duct waves are out of phase. Classical HQ resonators are passive devices with no moving parts whose noise attenuation characteristics are functions of the resonators length and cross-sectional area.

This Phase I design study would serve as the basis for the construction and testing of the electron collimator during Phase II. It is estimated that such an experiment could be done with a small fraction of the money required to build the full-scale proton collimator. Yet it would firmly establish the physics and engineering necessary to build an integrated IEC-proton collimator in Phase III.",,"The primary commercial application for this invention would be advanced spacecraft propulsion. Both operation modes considered are useful: the evaporating target thruster can give significant thrust to a spaceship, while the direct energy converter version can be used for generation of electricity for other type of thruster or other systems within the spacecraft. Direct exhaust of protons can also be considered as a possible thrust alternative for high-impulse low-thrust spacecraft.  The high-energy proton collimator can also find commercial market in all the applications that currently require particle accelerators. Among this numerous applications, the following can be mentioned: · Manufacture of medical isotopes · Proton-based radiotherapies · Material characterization techniques (RBS, PIXE) · Industrial applications · Spallation sources · Radioactive  waste transmutation and elimination"

Specific impulses for these propellant combinations range from 200 to 320 s.  Because the majority of the propellant mass is CO2, which can be replenished from Martian air with a simple pump, the effective specific impulse of the fuel transported from Earth can exceed 1600 s.  The COR could be used to power a Mars hopper vehicle, which replenishes itself with CO2 oxidizer each times it lands, allowing one Mars mission to explore a large number of widely dispersed sites.  COR rockets could also be used to support NASA's planned Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission by eliminating the need to transport to Mars most of the propellant needed by the Mars ascent vehicle.

However, other commercial applications potential of the COR are important and manifest. CO2 is a safe, non-cryogenic, non-toxic oxidizer.  If rocket engines can be developed employing it, they will find broad application for use in space storable upper stages, sounding rockets, and easy to integrate satellite RCS systems. Current spacecraft RCS systems employ hydrazine, which is dangerous, toxic, explosive, expensive to integrate into a spacecraft, and low-performing (220 s Isp).  COR rockets would be a cheap, safe, easy-to-integrate space storable alternative with superior performance.

The proposed research will develop a probabilistic analysis framework incorporating composite sandwich design methodologies to predict the reliability of the bonds between the face sheet and the core.

This seal could be used to replace current troublesome shaft seals on Liquid Oxygen Pumps as well as other cryogenic pumps.  The type of seal proposed has unique properties for rotating applications in that it provides a leak-free rotating seal and leak-free stationary seal.  This is accomplished by using both an activated stationary mechanical seal and a dynamic rotating seal.  The dynamic rotating seal uses the developed head in a small Drag pump to prevent leakage during rotation.  The energized mechanical face seal is used only during system cooldown prior to actual rotation.  This concept overcomes the problems associated within both face type mechanical seals and labyrinth seals in providing reliable sealing.,,"The Long Life Lox Compatible Seal has immediate commercial as well as NASA applications.  Currently commercial LOX pumps use cryogenic mechanical face seals.  These seals provide some sealing but tend to leak soon after installed, requiring replacement at intervals as low as 50 to 100 hours of operation.  NASA uses many of the same type of sealed pumps and would be prone to the same type of failures.  The Barber-Nichols concept prevents seal failures and will allow the seal system to last for the life of the pump.  BNI can use this seal in their cryogenic pumps as well as retrofit other's pumps.  Potential applications for this seal system are NASA LOX pumps, commercial cryogenic air product plant transfer pumps, and over-the-road truck transfer pumps.

A significant improvement in structural efficiency is made possible by two important features: 1) the superior damage tolerance characteristics of stitched composites, and 2) the ability to produce a lightweight hollow core geometry. The combination of these two features enables the design of a revolutionary fan blade structure that is capable of meeting even the most stringent birdstrike loading requirements. In addition to the structural benefits, by using a proven lowcost fabrication approach like Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), this blade concept is capable of creating new markets because its fabrication costs will be even lower than those currently realized for solid titanium fan blade components.",,"Commercial and military jet engines where weight and fabrication cost savings are important.

The goal is to reduce the cost from the current $10,000 per pound of payload to $100 per pound.  Studies indicate that a key technology requirement is a single stage to orbit (SSTO) using rocket based combined cycle (RBCC) engine.  In the third stage of a RBCC launch, an air breathing vehicle will travel at speeds from Mach 5 to Mach 10 prior to exiting the atmosphere.  Under these conditions, the vehicle requires cooling in excess of that available through sensible heating of the fuel.  Although this heating can be supplied by endothermic cracking of the fuel prior to combustion, the temperatures required to achieve necessary rates are very high.  High temperatures reduce the allowable stress in the heat exchanger, increasing its weight and reducing its efficiency.  In this Phase I SBIR, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to test chemical initiators that greatly accelerate the rate of thermal cracking reactions, allowing them to proceed at lower temperatures.  We will then carry out a systems analysis which will model the behavior of the fuel passing through the test section, allowing us to identify the most effective operating conditions.",,"In addition to the immediate application, cooling reusable launch vehicles, TDA's initiator technology could also find use in the chemical refining industry.  Ethylene, which is the largest volume building block for the petrochemical industry is produced by thermal cracking of heavier hydrocarbons at temperatures up to 900°C.  TDA's initiator technology may allow the process to be carried out at significantly lower temperatures, which would lower costs and increase profit margin."

The second class includes exercise rehabilitation equipment companies and physical therapy institutions.  As eccentric contraction provides more workload on the muscles than does concentric contraction, research has shown that eccentric exercise is a highly important factor in rehabilitation of injured or weak muscles.  In this respect, the incorporation of a new increased eccentric to concentric ratio mechanism to the CFREU is ideal for use in physical therapy regiment. The third class includes the personal home exercise equipment industry.  The compact force packs of the CFREU allow the overall unit to be small enough for easy use as a home gym.

Salinity also has a major influence on the dynamics of buoyancy-driven coastal jets and currents and serves both as a tracer and index of flow strength.

Perhaps the most reliable long-life cooling systems finding applications in space are passive; namely, heat pipes. Unfortunately, the balance between capillary pressure and viscous resistance limits the performance of these devices. Overall fluxes of 100W/cm^2 may be achievable with such systems, but local fluxes will never exceed pool boiling critical heat flux values that peak at approximately 100W/cm^2, but are normally much less. The novel thermal cycle proposed here circumvents this limitation. The cycle is passive yet generates pressure gradients substantially larger (up to 100-fold) than capillary systems.

However, the business that has the greatest near-term commercial potential is the use of high heat flux loops for high-performance electronics cooling in terrestrial applications.  High-end computing/electronics requires heat removal from high-density sources. Thus heat fluxes are large and only enhanced convective heat transfer techniques can transfer such heat rates the required distance between heat source and heat sink. The proposed inexpensive, robust cycle can transfer heat loads comparable to mechanically pumped loops, it is silent, and it can provide uniform temperature cooling at the heat source without drawing additional power.

Also the inefficiency of the canopy over the reflector can be great, requiring doubling the reflectors size to compensate.  We plan to make the inflatable membrane concentrators for space solar power viable by reducing these two largest weight penalties. We can greatly reduce the first penalty by lowering inflation pressure to a minimum by constructing the reflector from formed gores, requiring essentially zero strain to obtain the desired shape. We will learn in laboratory testing how to seam such formed gores to retain surface accuracy.  Thus we allow large hybrid reflectors of combined, formed gores to be made. The second penalty can be reduced by selecting proper canopy configurations to minimize oblique incidence of solar energy and by applying anti-reflection coatings.  We will perform a system configuration study and laboratory tests to learn how to do this.  Thus we will make viable the replacement of hard reflectors with inexpensive, light-weight, and easily deployed inflatable membranes.",,"Missions that may be enabled by the inflatable solar concentrator include deep space missions using solar power rather than the controversial nuclear power modules, with an added benefit that the reflector may be useful as an antenna and also to provide heat to the spacecraft.  Once this type of reflector is accepted, the solar rocket orbital transfer vehicle may finally be financially feasible.  The application of inflatables may also make orbiting solar power stations more attractive.  In general, the application of these relatively inexpensive collectors may bring solar dynamic power systems for spacecraft into direct competition with solar cells.  Furthermore, there are several microwave applications where very large antennas are needed, that can be based on this proposed technology.  These include interferometers (high-resolution studies of the universe) and radiometers (e.g. Earth-soil water-content measurements)."

Unfortunately, hydrazine only offers an Isp of about 230 s, and is extremely toxic, so great care and expense must be incurred in its handling and containment for only modest performance.  NOOLMRs, however, use a relatively benign high-performance monopropellant, and so are cheaper and easier to use.

The natural graphic representation of this approach can then take advantage of the human supervisors natural ability to recognize normal and abnormal operating modes, without requiring the necessity of a detailed and lengthy search through candidate failure modes. The addition of a temporal dimension to traditional Bayesian belief network structures facilitates analysis of time-varying commands and their current and predicted effects on the spacecraft. Our proposed incorporation of sensor measurements as belief network evidence will allow the user to detect faults, while a what-if type of speculative analysis mechanism on the same network will diagnose faults. Efficient, single-pass evidence propagation algorithms, which are consistent with probabilistic semantics for representing uncertainty in complex systems, makes this TBN approach particularly suitable for real-time operational environments such as the spacecraft control stations envisioned under this approach.",,"Commercial applications of our approach to model-based reasoning with temporal belief networks exist for a wide variety of contexts characterized by high rates of information flow and decision-making under uncertainty.

Conventional deployable spacecraft booms made from rigid structural members face fundamental packaging size constraints that directly relate to maximum allowable strain of the materials used in the boom. Inflatable booms and inflated-then rigidized booms seem to offer some packaging advantages over coiled or hinged booms, but complications associated with inflation systems and the potential for leaks diminishes some of the appeal of inflatables. This proposal describes a new hybrid material approach that could lead to revolutionary performance improvements in spacecraft boom technology while eliminating the complications associated with pressurization. In Phase I KCI will perform analytical and experimental studies of our proposed concept to generate preliminary verification of projected performance improvements compared to conventional and inflatable booms. Appropriate materials will be identified and purchased, and lab-scale test articles fabricated and tested. Test results will be used to project a design for a very large deployable boom.

The push for smaller satellites, often launched as multi-satellite constellations, as well as concepts for super-scale deployable structures for use as solar sails, optical systems, and large aperture antennas, suggest that new boom designs that provide significant performance advantages in size and/or reliability will be readily accepted by the military, scientific and commercial spacecraft market. If low cost manufacturing methods such as pultrusion and filament winding can be adapted to automate the assembly of boom structures, and further cost savings can be achieved by stepping back slightly from the ultimate in performance demanded by space applications, it seems likely that new terrestrial market opportunities for lightweight, easily transported, and potentially disposable mast systems based on the proposed concepts might be developed, particularly for military applications."

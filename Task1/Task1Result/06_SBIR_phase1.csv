Paduano,jpaduano@aurora.aero,"One Broadway, 14th Floor, Cambridge, MA  20110-2702",(617) 225-4381,,,,,,,"Aurora Flight Sciences proposes to develop specialized algorithms and software decision-aiding tools for four-dimensional (4D) vehicle-centric, tactical trajectory management (TTM), derived from algorithms developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to perform similar functions in military scenarios.  These algorithms, based on the concept of receding horizon mixed-integer linear programming (RH-MILP), will be specifically tailored to the problem of optimizing the trades between multiple 4D trajectories (4DTs) in the dynamic airspace environment.  In particular, the innovation that Aurora proposes is to model and address the stochastic nature of weather and associated airspace and resource restrictions in the flight path, respecting the fact that the time horizon over which sufficiently accurate weather estimates are available may be short compared to the overall TTM request-assign-update cycle (as envisioned by planners of the Next Generation Air Transportation System).  The general problem of increasing uncertainty as planning horizons increase will be a central focus of algorithm development.  This innovation addresses the needs for rapidly accommodating dynamic changes in aircraft tactical situations and responding to detected external hazards, for introducing any-time planning algorithms, and for generation and specification of 4D trajectories.  Currently algorithms that directly address these needs in the context of the NGATS concept of operations (CONOPS) are in the early development stages; technology transition from related military approaches as described herein will therefore greatly benefit the state of the art in national airspace system (NA) operational tools.","The primary application for our TTM decision-aiding software is the Next Generation Air Transportation System.  Aurora also expects the software to be developed, or derivatives thereof, to have capabilities in the area of vehicle management in the NAS, which will lead to other applications within NASA.  Given Aurora's specialization in UAV systems, applications of specific interest will include situations involving ferrying and/or operate UAVs in the NAS.  This vision is consistent with Aurora's strategic plan to continue to evolve from a company that primarily provides unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to one that provides unmanned aircraft systems (UASs).  Increased levels of autonomy in our vehicles, as well as increased levels of operability in the NAS, is focus for future UAVs, which will benefit from the algorithms that Aurora will develop here.","Other applications for MILP-based planning tools abound.  Multi-vehicle planning in experimental, fire response, and homeland security applications will benefit from some of the core algorithms to be brought to bear in this program.  Aurora also foresees the opportunity to play a role in flight-deck automation.  Since the current proposal is focused on 4DT generation and assignation from the perspective of air traffic management, the focus is on the multi-vehicle problem.  Understanding how this problem is posed and solved will provide insight into the best methods for creating and updating flight plans on the flight deck.  This is important when vehicles are performing autonomous (a.k.a. 'free flight') operations, and will also streamline NGATS operations, because of compatibilities on the flight deck versus centralized TTM planners.","Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Expert Systems; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems"

To maintain and improve aircraft safety as air capacity grows as part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS), it is necessary to address the primary causes leading to in-flight loss of control accidents, including aircraft upsets, degraded flight operations, and environmental disturbance effects.  A model-based upset detection and recovery control architecture is proposed that combines fault detection algorithms to identify the onset of an upset condition with optimal and near-optimal control responses.  On-line parameter identification algorithms are used to adapt the core detection and recovery algorithms for degraded flight operations and/or modeling uncertainties.  Distributed MEMS-based sensing and SMA-driven control effectors are used to augment the installed aircraft state measurements and control capability for rapid detection of and recovery from upset conditions.  During Phase I, preliminary system design and application to a small unmanned aircraft will be performed, including flight test demonstration of the upset detection and control algorithms and hardware.  This work will form the foundation for subsequent development of a family of aircraft upset mitigation systems for both manned and unmanned aircraft.","The primary outcome of this research and development will be control algorithms and flight hardware that will provide for the detection and mitigation of aircraft upset conditions.  Aircraft upsets, which may occur due to degraded flight conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and environmental effects, are a common cause of in-flight loss-of-control accidents.  Potential NASA applications of this technology include development of an aircraft upset warning system, flight director, or flight control law, which will address NASA goals of improving safety attributes of new and legacy air vehicles, in particular key metrics such as fatal aircraft accident rates.  Applications will also be found in supporting NASA unmanned aircraft operations by enhancing reliability and expanding science mission capability.","In addition to improving safety of existing and future manned aircraft, the results of this research and development will also benefit unmanned aviation.  Detection and mitigation of upset conditions for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) will directly impact military operations in which UAV accident rates are one to two orders of magnitude greater than for manned aircraft.  Furthermore, by decreasing the susceptibility of UAVs to upset-induced losses through increased autonomy, a significant hurdle impeding public acceptance of UAV operations in the civil airspace will be overcome, opening the door for commercial and civil applications of unmanned aircraft systems.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems"

Once proven in the aircraft engine environment, this life monitoring system will be used in a wide variety of airborne and land-based air-breathing engine systems.

The in-flight service monitor will treat the engine as a whole in response to sampling data of torque, speed, temperature and time. The engine analysis algorithm will determine the engines' operation parameters from those of its components. It also will determine the life and reliability of individual components based on the service monitoring algorithm's output. The component-life algorithm will accumulate life and reliability tables.

It will affect cost-effective design and manufacturing for new production engines and can reduce life cycle and maintenance costs.","The cost-effective, reliable use of expansive aerospace and land-based air-breathing engine systems can be extended with more accurate knowledge of the remaining component and system fatigue life.

Whereas prior damage-adaptive control work focused on reconfiguring from unforeseen aerodynamic changes (e.g., effector or airframe damage), the proposed damage-adaptive control approach also accounts for the current health of the propulsion systems and key structural elements.  The integrated controller merges available system identification and diagnostic information to compute a new ""safe"" operating envelope for the vehicle that accounts for identified changes in structural integrity/dynamics.  Once this envelope is computed, the controller then proceeds to compute (1) an achievable flight path for landing the aircraft, and (2) a set of inceptor (or effector) and propulsion commands that will track the computed achievable reference trajectory in a decoupled way ? all the while assuring that, if physically possible, the aircraft will not excite dangerous structural modes or create structural loads that would risk further damage.  The research will also investigate advisory and retrofit implementations of the proposed approach that will enable early V&V and implementation.","The technology directly addresses the IRAC element of the NASA Aviation Safety Program.  Additionally, by integrating structural health monitoring with inner- and outer-loop control, the approaches developed here would also be suitable for life extending control (i.e., using effector redundancy to minimize wear on key structural elements).  Finally, the technology is directly applicable to NASA's space exploration mission in that it provides trajectory generation and control algorithms that are capable of compensating for unforeseen failures or massive uncertainties in atmospheric conditions.","The immediate Non-NASA application is algorithms, software, and tools for the civil aviation industry.  Additionally, the technology is well suited for high-level autonomous operations of unmanned vehicles (air and otherwise).

Among these are adverse conditions and uncommanded motions which may be the result of vehicle or propulsion system failures or damage. One possible source of projectile damage is uncontained engine debris.  This proposal focuses on development of a robust methodology for predicting the damage to aircraft structures from uncontained engine debris. The two objectives of this phase of the work proposed are: 1. Development of rigorous criteria and methodology for determining projectile sizes, shapes, velocities, and weights resulting from uncontained engine debris. 2. Research and development of techniques to predict realistic damage sizes and shapes resulting from projectile impacts on aircraft structure.The Phase I SBIR is intended to be a proof of concept and demonstration of the feasibility of interfacing UEDDAM with LSDYNA.  One of the main products of the effort will be to well prepared plan for proceeding to Phase II. Whereas the Phase I product will be a proof of concept, it will not be ready for commercialization.  It will be a prototype that does not have the user-friendly features such as graphical user interface (GUI).  Nor will it have the ability to account for composite materials in the target.  Thus the Phase II effort will focus on these two issues.","This product has direct application to NASA's Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) Project.  As the IRAC project evolves, RHAMM feels that realistic damage states will be critical to the success of the overall program, since simulation will necessarily be a large part of it.  Furthermore, as wind tunnel testing is being planned and executed, these realistic damage states and sizes will be important in bounding the problem and in leading the fabrication of experimental models.  The UEDDAM-LSDYNA interface will be an integral part of the IRAC modeling and simulation effort.RHAMM also believes that the UEDDAM-LSDYNA interface could contribute greatly to NASA's Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) Program.  Specifically, we believe that it would have application on the objective that states: ""Diagnose coupled degradation/malfunction/failure/hazard conditions and predict their effects on vehicle safety"" and the approach that states:  ""Couple state awareness data with physics-based and data-driven models to diagnose degradation and damage caused by environmental hazards and electro/thermo/mechanical failures.""","Upon successful completion of the Phase II SBIR, we will have a stand alone UEDDAM-LSDYNA interface code that we will offer to International (if approved), Commercial, FAA, DHS, and DoD (and their contractors) for use in damage effects modeling of aircraft structures.

Both wide area inspection of fuselage and wing structures and characterization of adhesive bonds in built-up structures are addressed.  JENTEK will develop both (1) hybrid methods in which spatially registered, digital images, produced by two or more sensing modalities are combined, and (2) a new method called Magneto-Thermography, invented by JENTEK, which offers both wide area inspection advantages and potential for characterization of adhesive bonds in built-up composite and metal structures.  In one implementation of a hybrid method for graphite fiber/epoxy composites, the MWM-Array could sense and locate fiber damage and fiber movement under loads, while thermography could sense both fiber and matrix damage, allowing discrimination between fiber breakage, fiber/matrix disbonding, matrix cracking, and disbonding in built-up structures.Magneto-Thermography will use the demonstrated capability of the MWM-Array to monitor temperatures of buried fibers and to monitor temperatures at buried interfaces to replace IR cameras with MWM-Arrays in thermographic methods.  This will enable both wide area inspection of thick composites and enhanced characterization of adhesive bonds in built-up structures, for foam layers, and other aerospace and space applications.","Magneto-thermography and hybrid methods have the potential to provide revolutionary capabilities for condition assessment and life management of composite components and adhesive bonds.  Composite components and adhesive bonds will play an increasingly important role in aircraft and spacecraft.  Effective life management will require advances in nondestructive test methods to provide information on composite component health and usage states.  Magneto-thermography and the hybrid methods proposed here have the potential to enable significant advances in life management for composites for both aircraft and spacecraft, reducing life cycle costs and increasing safety margins.","Advanced life management tools for composite aircraft components will play a major role in fleet life cycle management practices.  These will include advances in (1) sensing material condition, (2) modeling material behavior and predicting future behavior, and (3) decision support tools.

Modeling uncertainties and errors decrease system sensitivity to faults and decrease the accuracy of failure prognoses.  However, the behavior of many physical systems changes slowly over time as the system ages.  These changes may be perfectly normal and not indicative of impending fail-ures; however, if a static a priori model is used, modeling errors may increase over time, which can ad-versely effect health monitoring system performance.  Clearly, one method to address this problem is to employ a model that adapts to system changes over time.  The risk in using data-driven models that learn online to support model-based diagnostics is that the models may ``adapt'' to a system failure, thus ren-dering it undetectable by the diagnostic algorithms.  An inherent trade-off exists between accurately track-ing normal variations in system dynamics and potentially obscuring slow-onset failures by adapting to failure precursors that would be evident using static models.

The new nano-engineered joints embody nanomaterials which are self-assembled and anchored onto the joining surfaces.  Compatible functionalization of nanomaterials on opposite surfaces creates favorable energetic conditions for their effective engagement and joining via massive primary (chemical) bond formation.  Complementary self-assembly techniques will be used for rapid, low-cost, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly processing and anchorage of nanomaterials upon substrate surfaces.  Various nanomaterials and anchorage conditions can be used for different substrates (ceramics, metals, polymers, composites) and service requirements.

The proposed nano-engineered joints promise the high performance attributes, multi-functionality and versatility needed to meet the growing demands on joint performance in today's hybrid, complex structures.  An example application, which is subject of our planning efforts with Boeing, focuses on joints within and between (ceramic) thermal protection systems and (composite) structures in reentry vehicles.  As a versatile class of high-performance and multi-functional joints, the proposed technology promises to replace traditional joining (adhesive bonding, mechanical fastening and welding) techniques in a variety of applications in NASA's aerospace vehicles.","Joints are inherent elements of practically all aerospace systems, since such systems are rarely made of a single piece.

One important detail in the design of such structures is that of joining and attachment. Large-area hot structures will likely be fabricated by mechanically joining smaller component sub-assemblies. Conventional metallic fasteners and fastening techniques do not provide structurally tight joints over a wide temperature range. A metallic fastener, which is snug at room temperature, will loosen at elevated temperature due to its relatively high thermal expansion. Excessive preloading at room temperature to maintain a tight joint at elevated temperature may be detrimental to the structural integrity of the joint. Ceramic composite fasteners on the other hand can be designed with near-perfect thermo-elastic compatibility with the adherends, however their prohibitively high cost to produce severely restricts their utility. The objective of this proposed program is to demonstrate the feasibility of a unique, cost-effective thermal stress-free ceramic composite mechanical fastener system suitable for assembly of high-temperature ceramic composite structures. The innovative fastener design facilitates joining load-bearing hot structural assemblies and can be produced at a cost much lower then other competing designs and methods.

Sensors based on high-temperature optical fibers (including sapphire fibers) have been developed through extensive research; however, little advancement has been made with regard to achieving cost-effective sensors that can be employed in large numbers.  Currently, the materials of the mounting site, the materials of the sensor coupon, the fiber itself, sensor assembly methods and the optical interrogation methods have limited compatibility, resulting in each application becoming a custom installation.  Recent demonstrations at Virginia Tech, under NASA hypersonic program funding, of advanced Fracture-Release coupon structures, novel connectorization techniques, and improved assembly methods have enabled more rapid fabrication of high-temperature sapphire fiber sensors well-suited to instrumentation of advance materials in hypersonic research.  Prime Research, teaming with Virginia Tech, proposes to leverage these previous demonstrations to improve the manufacturability and ease-of-use of sapphire fiber strain gages, and to modify the assembly methods to permit their use with Prime Research's patented spinel-clad sapphire fibers, which have improved optical properties over unclad sapphire fibers.","A key research goal for NASA is the advancement of hypersonic flight.  It is a stated NASA objective to advance knowledge in the application advanced materials (e.g. carbon-carbon, carbon SiC, etc.) and test & diagnostic capabilities to further hypersonic research.  Particularly important to this objective is the requirement for high-temperature sensors (including strain, temperature, pressure, mechanical properties, etc.) applicable to supporting advances in the state of the art in hypersonic research, in addition to other flight regimes.  The proposed program has specific relevance to NASA strategic sub-goals 3E.3 and 3E.1 as stated in the 2006 NASA Strategic Plan, in that a capability to measure flight mechanical, structural, and material parameters is required for research extensions of fundamental flight performance and mechanics, and operational performance monitoring functions.","The product that will emerge following successful conclusion of the proposed SBIR program will satisfy a need in a small but important market.  High-temperature strain gages that are currently available suffer from a number of drawbacks that prohibit their use for gas turbine instrumentation.  Electrical strain gages are prone to electromagnetic interference and are limited to uses below 1000C.  Commercially-available optical fiber strain gages are limited to temperatures below about 800C by dopant diffusion and glass devitrification.  The sapphire fiber strain gage being developed through this SBIR program will be the first practical strain gage for direct measurement of strain in the hot sections of gas turbine engines.

No single code or model has been able to capture, with high fidelity, all the complex effects that come into play, especially at higher velocities. Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to create an innovative software tool to develop and demonstrate high-fidelity chemistry, radiation, and flow models for NLTE hypersonic flows that will address all the important effects in a unified way. SSI will demonstrate an end-to-end capability to simulate the kinetics and radiation transport for NLTE hypersonic flows through the development of prototype software and demonstration for a candidate hypersonic flow scenario. The software will be designed to be modular, in order that they can be used by other codes and other applications. Testing and validation will include studies of the interaction of gases in the shock layer with the ablating material making up the thermal protection system of the vehicle as well as an assessment of other available codes. It is intended that the software tool be used as a benchmark to test lower-fidelity models, or as an inexpensive substitute for laboratory or field tests.","Potential NASA applications include the accurate prediction of NLTE, hypersonic aerothermal environments near spacecraft. The software developed from this effort will have applications to spacecraft design and development for the Crew Exploration Vehicle and aerocapture missions to Titan, Neptune, and Venus. The software will potentially avoid the need for expensive measurements and/or complement existing measurements of hypersonic flow properties. The software tool will provide benchmark results to help assess NASA flow models that may be less computationally expensive, but perhaps more flexible to the geometry of the actual problem or in the ability to explore a large parameter space of trajectories and conditions. The NLTE kinetics and radiation transport portion of the model will be modular and general in order to be easily adapted for other potential uses involving other NASA hypersonic, NLTE flows, or flow-solvers.","The proposed software tool will have wide application for Earth atmosphere hypersonic flow problems, including the development of military hypersonic vehicles and military applications involving the modeling of re-entry flows for missile defense. Other important military applications include the modeling and analysis of missile base heating, and modeling associated with the radiation signature of flows near missile bodies in rarefied, hypersonic flow regimes. The radiation signature due to NLTE flows near the missile body will be critical for development of missile defense sensors and associated algorithms.

The Navier-Stokes solvers adopted in current hypersonic CFD codes like LAURA and GASP use Riemann solver for the convection part and central scheme for the diffusion part. As a result, their integration with DSMC in the transitional and rarefied flow regimes may cause an artificial flow across the interface between CFD/DSMC zones because of the inconsistency in the estimated fluxes. On the other hand, the proposed gas-kinetic BGK solver for the Navier-Stokes equations (BGK-NS) computes the inviscid and viscous fluxes as a single entity, consistent with the DSMC approach. Furthermore, this BGK-NS solver has been demonstrated very accurate for hypersonic heat transfer prediction. The approach has also been successfully extended for solution of the Burnett equations whereas the macroscopic Burnett approach has some numerical difficulties. This SBIR project will further extend this BGK-NS solver to hypersonic flows in thermal and chemical non-equilibrium. In Phase I, a prototype non-equilibrium BGK-NS solver will be developed for the nitrogen shock dissociation cases and then in Phase II, a gas-kinetic CFD counterpart of LAURA will be fully developed and well validated.","NASA current mission focuses on human lunar and martian exploration. The design of crew exploration vehicles requires a computational tool, which is able to accurately predict hypersonic flows in thermal and chemical non-equilibrium. Compared with the macroscopic CFD approach, the proposed gas-kinetic CFD approach is more suitable for simulation of high-temperature non-equilibrium processes. It is not only accurate for prediction of shock stand-off distances, peaks in thermal loads, skin friction drag, forces and moments on the vehicles, but also ready for extension beyond the continuum flow regime. Such a computational tool can be used for accurate prediction of wake heating, single/multiple rocket plume effects on the vehicle aerodynamics and heating.","Except Exa's Powerflow code, current commercial CFD software in the market is based on the macroscopic CFD approach, which is not well suited for simulation of non-equilibrium flows. On the other hand, Exa's Powerflow code only works for incompressible flows. The developed gas-kinetic computational algorithm can satisfy people's desire of accurate simulation of high-speed non-equilibrium flows. It can significantly enhance the capability of aerospace industry for accurate prediction of the aerothermal loads on a space vehicle, and can be used to analyze aerobrake systems, to predict leakage flows past seal teeth in gas turbine engines, etc. Such a computational tool is currently lacking in the market.",Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

When drawn and processed in wire form, the shape change is an aggressive contraction with useable lifetimes of millions of cycles. Despite this fact, SMAs have largely been a scientific curiosity, finding very little commercial use as actuators since their discovery over 30 years ago. The apparent lack of practical application may be due to their low recoverable strain (~4% of total wire length). MIGA Motor Company has numerous international patents covering Displacement Multiplication (DM) techniques that allow us to package strokes of over 1 inch in highly compact, lightweight packages. Our current commercially available linear actuators provide 1/2"" of stroke with 4.5 pounds of output force. We propose to develop several high force variants of the DM designs, allowing up to 45 pounds of force in a device weighing less than 2 ounces.  The manufacturing techniques that we have developed in manufacturing the DM actuators have paved the way to expansion into the high force realm: high reliability wire attachment methods, use of high temperature thermoplastics, Teflon-coated or over-molded precision chemically-etched stainless-steel motive elements, and various load-sharing techniques have enabled the design of these actuators to finally become a reality.","There are numerous applications for high-force linear electric actuators in the aerospace industry including latch-release devices, telescope and instrument door and aperture mechanisms, thermal management louver and thruster control actuators, aircraft control surface actuators, and remotely operated vehicles. Robotic manipulators, rovers, and other exploration technologies can benefit significantly from these lightweight, high-force actuators with an extremely high force/weight ratio (over 360:1). MIGA actuators are compatible with ultra-high vacuum: made entirely out of high-temperature thermoplastics, Nickel-Titanium, and stainless steel (or titanium). There are no lubricants. The total part count is very low, enhancing reliability on orbit or in any other application. Also owing to their low weight, they are nearly immune to high-g loads.","The medical industry represents the most urgent need for modern, high force, linear electric actuators.  The miniaturization of electronic components has fueled the desire for more portable equipment, and much of the diagnostic equipment in the medical industry today relies on motors, solenoids, and pneumatic actuators to move, latch, squeeze, etc, samples and subjects -in ever diminishing package sizes. There is a huge pent-up demand for assisted medical devices: those which require a human input, but also demand higher forces than can be applied by a single technician, or for long periods of time. The defense industry is another important market, requesting efficient electric actuators that can open and close weather-station doors in harsh environments across the world, for instance. Security is becoming an increasingly important business sector, and there are numerous demands for integrated security solutions, including electronic latching, dead-bolting, assisted entry systems, and use as redundant mechanisms in biometric security systems.

The approach features a new hybrid pump, which is powered by active material stacks, and produces fluidic power to directly power hydraulic actuators. The compact, sealed unit eliminates external hydraulic components, such as accumulators, reservoirs, and, especially, long hydraulic tubing runs. By increasing system efficiency, reducing system mass and exploiting the unique characteristics of active materials, we expect to get a significant performance improvement in representative applications.  This is in contrast with many commercially available actuation systems, composed of either traditional hydraulic or electromechanical mechanisms.  Each of these systems is limited due to either excessive mass or limited bandwidth, or both.  And yet these technologies have been adopted across a wide spectrum of applications, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), high performance fighter aircraft, active automotive suspension systems and mobile robotic systems.  Each of these applications would benefit greatly from the introduction of an actuation system that can provide mass-savings and bandwidth improvements, simultaneously.","The actuator proposed is suitable for a wide range of actuation scenarios across a number of NASA missions.  Fundamentally, we propose to deliver a higher mass efficient actuation system than currently available commercially.  In Aeronautics, the use of high performance actuators could enable advanced flight control of experimental aircraft.  In Aerospace, they could be used to actuate thrusters on satellites, position payloads on orbital platforms or provide efficient control for planetary exploration on-board NASA rovers.","The non-NASA applications are numerous.  In addition to uses similar to those described for NASA, the system can also be used to enable high performance UAV flight control in battlefield applications, and actuation on war-fighting robotic platforms.

This understanding can help in solving on-blade problems as well as in designing and optimizing the blade profiles for improved aerodynamics and noise attenuation in the next generation rotorcraft. Therefore, a Wireless Optical Pressure/Strain Sensor (WOPSS) system for helicopter on-blade pressure and strain measurement is proposed to utilize the benefits of low coherence interferometry system to create an innovative real-time pressure and strain measurement technique. Leveraging past and current experiences with fiber optic sensor development, a proof-of-concept of optical pressure/strain sensor system with wireless data acquisition and transfer capability will be demonstrated at the end of Phase I. The distributed optical pressure/strain sensor measurements will be used to obtain real-time dynamic pressure fields and mode shapes and displacements by integrating strain data for the helicopter rotor blade. Phase I efforts will conduct optical pressure and strain sensor design analysis to meet on-blade pressure and strain measurement requirements and demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototyped wireless optical pressure and strain sensor package.","Throughout the Phase I effort, we will work in concert with NASA sponsors and our industry to ensure that the WOPSS technology can be seamless integrated with rotor blade systems.  To facilitate technology transfer, we will work in Phase I to address top-level hardware and software integration issues from a systems engineering perspective. Issues such as hardware and control electronics, software architectures, hardware interfaces, manufacturability, ruggedness, and reliability will be considered in Phase I and implemented in Phase II.","The WOPSS technology will be applicable to a wide range of end-users in the defense, commercial, and industry sectors. TSi's WOPSS will be an integrated software/hardware product that can be licensed for manufacture to our strategic manufacturing partner, or a similar rotorcraft producer, depending on the market being addressed. Because TSi already enjoys market share of adaptive materials for precision control of structures, noise, weapons effectiveness, etc., through our existing customers, we plan to leverage these marketing outlets and offer WOPSS systems for enhanced performance where conventional sensors have not been successful from performance and cost perspective. TSi will finalize a formal partnership with a strategic manufacturing partner, who will produce the WOPSS systems specific to commercial rotorcraft. TSi will partner with an OEM manufacturer in an appropriate field of use (e.g., electro-optics manufacturer, weapons systems integrator, aircraft OEM, etc.) to modify the WOPSS as a generic sensor. We will perform final systems integration of the WOPSS systems and conduct direct marketing and sales of the product to the end-use through our internal resources.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

Approaches that have been explored for on-blade active control or individual blade control include control surface actuation, such as trailing edge flaps, and integrated blade manipulation, such as controllable twist.  For retro-fit and upgrade purposes, the advanced rotor system needs an actuation scheme with appropriate force, deflection, and bandwidth, without detrimentally increasing on-blade mass.  Research in this area has been conducted with potential solutions employing various conventional active material actuator configurations, but these systems have typically suffered from inherent disadvantages.  Due to these limitations, Techno-Sciences, Inc. proposes the use of pneumatic artificial muscles to actuate a trailing edge flap device for management of rotorcraft vibration.  The proposed actuators are constructed of passive materials that are very mass efficient and low cost, while maintaining adequate force, stroke, and bandwidth.  Oriented along the blade span and located within the airfoil contour near the blade root, the antagonistic configuration of actuators offers bi-directional flap deflection and operation under a low centrifugal field.  A lightweight mechanism accompanies the actuators, running along the span, to transfer and tailor the mechanical work from the actuators to the span station of the flap.  The proposed research plan will work to properly size and scale the actuators and mechanism for the desired response, and construct a prototype device that demonstrates the feasibility of the concept on the bench-top and in a rotating environment at full-scale loading.","Throughout the Phase I effort, Techno-Sciences, Inc. will work in concert with NASA sponsors to ensure that the proposed trailing edge flap device operated with pneumatic artificial muscles can be seamlessly integrated with existing rotor blade systems and future vertical flight technologies currently in development.  These include single or multiple passenger vehicles for transportation, search and rescue operations, and package delivery, in addition to unmanned vehicles for meteorological and atmospheric measurements, operations in hazardous environments, and traffic control.  To facilitate technology transfer, we will work in Phase I to address top-level hardware and software integration issues from a systems engineering perspective.  Issues such as control electronics, software architectures, hardware interfaces, manufacturability, ruggedness, and reliability will be considered in Phase I and implemented in Phase II of the program.","The pneumatically actuated, trailing edge flap device for rotorcraft vibration control will be applicable to a wide range of end-users in the defense, commercial, and industry sectors.  Its broad applicability is enabled by the scalability of the pneumatic artificial muscles for the entire range of small unmanned vehicles to larger transport vehicles.  In addition to the noted NASA applications, vibration control in vertical take-off and landing systems is attractive to the military for tasks such as mine detection, troop insertion and extraction, and biochemical weapons cleanup; and commercial and industry tasks such as construction in hazardous terrain, maintenance of bridges and buildings, and storm tracking.  The proposed flap technology will be an integrated hardware/software product that can be licensed for manufacture.

RCAAPS primary focus is aeroacoustics, which has application in environmental noise reduction for rotorcraft and fixed wing aircraft in high-lift configurations. The fundamental technologies (integrated high-performance parallel I/O, high performance CFD-specific numerical methods, 'point and click' interrogation of large unsteady runs) will be applied to the software products that the offeror currently markets, such as FIELDVIEW and FIELDVIEW eXtreme (for Virtual Reality environments), along with next-generation tools currently under development.","Aero-acoustic analysis is of high importance to manufacturers of both fixed wing aircraft and rotorcraft.

In particular, market-based mechanisms are needed for transferring system-imposed delay from more critical to less critical flights.  In this SBIR, we will develop a National Airspace Resource Exchange System (NRES) that will provide the FAA and the aviation community with a means for trading scarce resources and priorities for ATM services.  Today's airspace system has rudimentary market mechanisms in place.  However, these are valid only for highly specialized circumstances: airport arrival slot trading in ground delay programs applied by FAA traffic managers.  We propose to develop an infrastructure necessary to support secondary markets for the full spectrum of NAS resources and services.","The proposed SBIR directly benefits the NASA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) Air Traffic Management Airspace Project, whose primary goal is to develop integrated solutions for a safe, efficient and high-capacity airspace system.  Efficient airspace allocation requires early research in market-based mechanisms for design of the next-generation air transportation system.This research also extends NASA objectives from the recently completed Advanced Air Transportation Technologies (AATT) project, whose primary goal was to improve the capacity of transportation aircraft operations at and between major airports within the National Airspace System. As part of AATT, NASA helped develop decision-support tools for air traffic controllers, airline pilots and air operations managers to handle the growing demand for safe and efficient air travel. Our research extends effectiveness of those NASA tools and concepts (CTAS, TMA, McTMA, Regional Metering), by increasing utilization of capacity by increasing the efficiency of NAS resource usage.","The NAS Resource Exchange System (NRES) has application in commercial air traffic management (ATM) within the United States and abroad. In the United States ATM market, the FAA will require the tools and procedures output by Phases II and III of this SBIR to act as a central processor and tracker of ATM-induced delays. At the same time, US air carriers will require tools with which to monitor and manipulate their delay management accounts. Estimates of ATM costs due to delays range from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions of dollars per year. The opportunity to save even a fraction of these costs creates a significant amount of motivation for airline participation in a delay management system. It is reasonable to assume that the number of carriers willing to participate in this system will be comparable to the number of carriers now signed up as active members of the collaborative decision making (CDM) program, which is 27. Air-traffic delays in foreign countries are generally not as pronounced as in the U.S., but this has been achieved by sacrificing flexibility in the system ? a major limitation on the ability to handle growth in demand for air transportation.

The Dynamic Airspace Configuration Tool (DACT) takes as an input the regularly updated projections of aggregated demand and weather forecasts and produces optimum airspace boundaries that balance the airspace complexity under various global and regional constraints for time horizons as short as four hours. The optimality criteria are defined separately for different levels of automation in Air Traffic Control (ATC) procedures. DACT enables the ATC managers to initiate high volume operational corridors and other classes of airspace to best serve the user demand for airspace resources. Additionally, when fully developed, DACT provides a capability for airspace managers to dynamically manage the allocation of Special Use Airspace (SUA) and Military Operation Airspace (MOA) to ensure security of the airspace system. DACT enables a more efficient utilization of airspace capacity and reduces the operational cost for air traffic control services by dynamically re-aligning the airspace boundaries to comply with the monthly, daily, and hourly alterations in user aggregated demand, route structures, and changes in weather patterns. DACT address one of the main components of NASA's NGATS Airspace effort in developing an operational framework for DAC concept that provides the air traffic service providers with a new degree of freedom to accommodate the user demand for airspace capacity, balanced against needs of national interest (e.g. security). The proposed effort will combine state of the art mathematical optimization techniques with ATC functional requirements necessary for development of the DAC concept.","Airspace capacity is limited by the ability of controllers to deal with complex traffic situations. In congested areas of the National Airspace System (NAS), the controller workload limitation is a critical capacity constraint that generates significant en route delay. In today's rigidly structured airspace system, the airspace managers do not have the flexibility to reconfigure the airspace based on aggregated demand. The only local tactical solution is combining two or more sectors and opening all or part of SUAs. These tactical modifications are not well communicated with the users, and the resulted capacity is often lost. To address these issues, NGATS envisions a more automated control system in which tactical separation assurance is fully automated and controllers will perform more strategic functions for managing the traffic. Accordingly, NASA's NGATS Airspace effort [1] is envisioned to develop an operational framework for Dynamic Airspace Configuration (DAC) (Milestone AS 3.3.01) that provides the air traffic service providers with a new degree of freedom to accommodate the user demand for airspace capacity, balanced against needs of national interest (e.g. security). The DACT system proposed in this SBIR combines state of the art mathematical optimization techniques (Milestone AS 1.3.03) with ATC functional requirements necessary for deployment of the DAC concept.","As demand grows, more efficient procedures for airspace capacity management will be required to address the users' demand. Both Europe and the United States have reached a conclusion that airspace configuration should be dynamically adapted to user aggregated demand. If fully developed, the DAC concept can potentially change the ATM paradigm by introducing a revolutionary way for managing the airspace capacity and entire aviation community can benefit from this new concept. Estimates of ATM costs due to delays range from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars per year. The opportunity to save even a nominal percentage of these costs creates a significant amount of motivation for implementation of the DAC concept. This concept can also result in long-term savings for the FAA by reducing the controller workload and potentially decreasing the total number of controllers in the NAS. In the US government ATM market, the primary sources for funding are the organizations and agencies that maintain and improve the ATM systems of the US. Because of our role at the ATCSCC, Metron Aviation is well connected to these agencies. Similar to the US, the European airspace is suffering from excessive delays due to airspace design inefficiencies and, as such, European countries are other potential customers for decision support tools and design methodologies related to DAC.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

Such predictions are not currently feasible because the configuration often is not completely determined by factors such as weather forecasts, future demand, and noise restrictions that might be input to an automated predictor.  When this is the case, the air traffic control tower personnel choose between the feasible configurations based on factors such as staffing issues and individual controller preferences.  Furthermore, the primary meteorological forecasts currently available to the tower are not adequate to enable accurate runway usage prediction.  In fact, they often fail to predict required changes in flow direction, causing reactive rather than proactive airport configuration management.  In this SBIR, Metron Aviation and WSI Corporation will jointly develop an airport configuration planner incorporating optimized weather forecasts to assist tower controllers in planning runway usage more accurately at longer time horizons than currently possible and to communicate the plan to appropriate National Airspace System (NAS) stakeholders and planning systems.

In short, maximizing throughput of a runway complex and optimizing efficient use of airport resources depends upon these reliable configuration plans, which can only be obtained with better weather forecasts.  Furthermore, including tower controller feedback in the planning process will allow them the flexibility they need and avoid incorrect predictions when unforeseen circumstances arise.","The FAA will require the planner developed in this SBIR to implement the NGATS vision.

There are 3 special challenges of measuring pressure on Mars: (1) the thin atmosphere requires high ensitrivity sensors; (2) the extreme temerature range; and (3) the survival of the landing impact. This proposal address them all. At home on the Earch, air pressure measurements reveal a lot of useful information about aircraft engine performance, about the air flow on aircraft wings, about the on-blade dynamic pressure of a helicopter, and about the optimal design and motion of a parachute among other things. The unique advantage of our solution lies in its high stability against temperature variations and mechanical disturbances, rendering the proposed system rugged and robust enough for Mars landing and exploration while keeping the cost at the level of commercial off the shelf fiber-optic communications systems. In Phase I of this program, we propose to demonstrate a bench-top system with several high-sensitivity etalon pressure sensors with high temperature and mechanical stability. In Phase II, we will develop the complete pressure sensor system using existing fiber optic components with monitoring and feedback control software.",Mars atmospheric pressure sensing for landing and exploration,(1) earth atmospheric pressure sensing for weather and environmental studies(2) on-blade pressure measurement for helicopters(3) aircraft engine health monitoring(4) aerodynamic pressure sensing for prototyping parachutes.,Aircraft Engines; Optical; Perception/Sensing; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors

(RSI) proposes to develop the Retroreflector Array for Test Environments (RATE), an innovative technology that will non-intrusively measure pressure on aerodynamic surfaces in NASA ground test facilities with high sensitivity and bandwidth.  The signal from RATE units will change locally due to pressure changes.  Pressure sensitive paints, in comparison, have serious drawbacks: they must applied to a rigid surface, are specific to the flow species, and do not retroreflect.  Because RATE will be independent of the flow species, and applied as a very thin, flexible, adhesive material, it will be able to measure the aerodynamic pressure while minimizing changes in the flow field.  The Phase I RATE program will involve design, fabrication, and test of various candidate designs in order to select the most promising approach for Phase II.  RSI will use its experience in microfabricated structures and pressure sensors to employ a highly innovative technology in order to non-intrusively measure aerodynamic pressure in NASA ground test facilities.  The result will be a product that will address a critical NASA instrumentation need.","NASA will use the technology for non-intrusive wind tunnel diagnostics; there is a need for a pressure diagnostic with high sensitivity, ruggedness for survivability during wind tunnel startup, and that will not alter the flow field.  In addition, NASA can employ the RATE sensors in flight tests because the retroreflector divergeance will provide high signal at long ranges; the sensors will be useful for NASA flight vehicle monitoring for the same reason.","In addition, several non-Government applications are possible.  Pressure sensors have a lucrative commercial market in manufacturing (for process monitoring) and medical diagnostics, as well a healthy market in scientific applications.  Sensors that can be applied as an adhesive patch to existing devices will be very attractive, particularly if they are thin, sensitive, and robust.","Biomedical and Life Support; Control Instrumentation; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Inflatable; Instrumentation; Optical; Perception/Sensing; Photonics; Portable Life Support; Propellant Storage; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Testing Facilities"

But, for example, as we are now concerned with small changes in drag count, potential sources of improvement are much more likely to be masked by poor flow quality.  We may have reached the stage where the lack of suitable facility flow quality will hinder and dictate the rate of progress of ground based testing.  Few measurements have been made in the Nation's wind tunnels, and in those cases, large discrepancies have been found between full-scale and predicted performance.  Consequently, there is an urgent need for in-situ measurements to measure flow quality and the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices.  To meet these challenges, a unique research program is proposed to clarify and alleviate the aerodynamic problems associated with adverse wind tunnel flow quality.  It combines innovative advances in data base assessment and management, and new approaches to turbulence instrumentation and analysis.  Standardized turbulence measurement techniques and data analysis procedures will be established and used to document the flow quality in our major test facilities.",There is a national need to develop improved test capabilities for proposed civil and military aerospace systems.  Detailed flow quality measurements and assessments of the performance of turbulence and noise suppression devices will lead to cost effective improvements in wind tunnel flow quality which will be needed to help design and ground test the proposed new generation of fuel efficient commercial transports and advanced military aircraft proposed for the new millennium.  Standardized test procedures will enable meaningful assessments to be made of individual tunnel operational ranges with adequate flow quality related to specific test programs.  These advances will help provide NASA with superior test capabilities at competitive cost and so attract a viable customer base that will be required for cost-effective facility operations.,"Measurements are urgently needed in the Nation's major facilities if we are to successfully combat the ever increasing European test facility challenge. Wind tunnel disturbances must be measured to the highest accuracy to allow the aerodynamicist to distinguish between aerodynamic, aeroelastic, and Reynolds number effects. Measurements will help provide U.S. companies with superior test capabilities at competitive cost and so help attract a viable customer testing base that will be required for cost effective facility operations.  This state-of-the-art turbulence testing capability available to support commercial aerospace needs meets two of the three main goals of NASA's Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) for corporate management of Aeronautical facilities namely: to ""increase the probability of having the right facilities in place at the right time"" and to ""operate those facilities in the most effective and efficient manner.""",Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures

Investing in re-usable elements, such as Programmable Communications Radios, for ground and flight data handling that are capable of receiving both highly-reliable low-rate links and highly-efficient high-rate links would address current Communication and Navigation needs without foregoing future capabilities.

We envision the radio to be well matched to small satellites, terrestrial ground links, and autonomous vehicles. The design is based on the latest in field programmable gate array (FPGA) and general purpose processors (GPP). Typical software defined radios (SDRs) rely heavily on digital signal processors (DSPs) due to their ease of software development and ability to multitask well. Our emphasis will be on performing all baseband processing inside the FPGA due to its ability to offer over an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. While this approach does significantly decrease power consumption and associated platform size, it requires special considerations, particularly in terms of software development. As such, we will leverage Toyon's ongoing experience in computationally efficient waveform and associated software development using the latest in FPGA behavioral design tools. In addition, the architecture will stress logic component reuse between multiple waveforms to support rapid reconfiguration as well as reduce development time. Our RF front-end design will be a direct-conversion architecture to reduce size and provide frequency agility. The use of open-standards interfaces will provide for rapid systems integration.","The NASA vision for space exploration is to have humans return to Earth's moon and eventually other planets, such as Mars. These missions will call for miniature space vehicles as well as an array of different types of ground stations and autonomous vehicles. As illustrated by the twin Mars rovers, equipment originally designed for a short lifetime can often greatly exceed expectations. Thus, for equipment that will be in service for years and possibly decades there is a desire to provide reconfiguration in order to adapt to new mission needs. The radio proposed in this effort will provide this utility while being sufficiently compact and low-power that it may be used on equipment that is severely resource constrained. The use of radiation-tolerant parts and the ability for the system to return to a default operating state means that the equipment will be resistant to event upset.","With a desire to reconfigure and reuse wireless equipment, there is tremendous interest in SDR for the military, emergency response, and consumer applications. At the same time, numerous factors have limited its penetration into these markets. With the military's ability to combine a large number of radios into a single package, JTRS does have potential; this is particularly true for its use in larger platforms that are not constrained in size and power. However, integrating SDR technology into smaller equipment, that is cost and power constrained, will require the use of more computationally efficient processing and considerations on overall architecture. The proposed concept is specifically targeted to these requirements by leveraging FPGA processing and direct-conversion RF translation. At the same time, our goal will be to exploit logic and processing reuse in order to allow rapid reconfiguration for the support of multiple waveforms.","Architectures and Networks; Highly-Reconfigurable; RF; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Ultra-High Density/Low Power"

NxGen has been developing rugged, high reliability, light weight 3D memory stacking technology which would improve the density over a monolithic package by a factor of 8.

Many of these EMI sensitive payloads can be damaged by seemingly benign sources such as communication networks or microwave ovens. The problem becomes more difficult when these sensitive payloads and instrumentation require movement from one location to another.  It is extremely difficult and time consuming to identify and characterize the potential threat to these payloads with current tools and techniques. Soneticom proposes to utilize a small network of sensors to quickly and efficiently identify and locate sources of EMI radiation. Once the source is located Soneticom will utilize available signal parameters such as Received Signal Strength (RSS) at each sensor to estimate the signal strength at any point within the network's coverage area.  Figure 2.1 is a conceptual diagram of how this innovation might look once displayed on a map. Soneticom will utilize the existing Lynx Geolocation platform which has the capability to identify and locate an EMI radiation source in the 20 MHz - 3 GHz range.  The Lynx system will provide the hardware platform to develop algorithms required to estimate the signal strength across the network's coverage area.,"There are a number of potential NASA applications for Soneticom's EMI Field Strength Mapping Products: EMI Threat Mitigation would be a primary use for the field strength mapping system.  It greatly increases the speed and efficiency of insuring that EMI sensitive equipment will not be compromised while in transit.  The system will identify, locate and display relative signal strengths of potentially damaging levels of radiated power.  Additionally, the system could be used to provide persistent monitoring of EMI levels for instance for the duration of a payload while in processing or on a launch pad. Communication Validation is another mission that a field strength mapping system could be used for.  By deploying a field strength mapping system communication equipment coverage areas can be effectively mapped highlighting areas of poor coverage or potential interference issues.Interference mitigation around the Space Center is a problem that the EMI filed strength mapping system could help resolve and locate and evaluate sources of potential interference that may pose a threat to safe flight operations.  Uninterrupted communication between flight systems and ground operations is critical to safe flight operations.","Interference mitigation around commercial airports is a problem that the EMI filed strength mapping system could help resolve, locate and evaluate sources of potential interference that may pose a threat to safe commercial flight operations.

Cellular provider coverage mapping can be accomplished with the proposed system allowing commercial cellular providers to validate cellular coverage area.  The field strength mapping system would allow providers to quickly identify poor reception areas and potential cross cell interferences.

The gashopper will first retrieve CO2 gas from the Martian environment to store it in liquid form at a pressure of about 10 bar. When enough CO2 is stored to make a substantial flight to another Mars site, a thermal storage bed is heated to ~1000 K and the CO2 propellant is warmed to ~300 K to pressurize the tank to ~65 bar. A valve is then opened, allowing the liquid CO2 to pass through the hot thermal storage bed that heats and gasifies the CO2 for propulsion. Gashopper can be designed to function as either ballistic flight vehicles or winged airplanes, with the former offering simplicity and the latter greater range. The advantage of the gashopper is that it provides Mars exploration with a fully controllable aerial reconnaissance vehicle that can repeatedly land and explore surface sites as well.The key technical issue that determines the potential performance of a gashopper is the overall specific heat of the thermal storage bed. In previous work, Pioneer Astronautics has demonstrated working gashopper airplanes and ballistic flight vehicles that utilized magnesium oxide pellets for thermal storage. While convenient for test purposes, MgO has a specific heat that is only roughly equal to CO2. This severely limits the attainable mass ratio and thus vehicle range. In contrast, lithium has four times the specific heat of CO2, so its use as a gashopper thermal bed material would greatly improve vehicle performance.  The low density and liquid nature of high temperature lithium makes its utilization for gashopper engines a challenge. In the proposed program, Pioneer will resolve this challenge by designing, building, and testing high specific heat gashopper engines using liquid lithium for thermal storage.","The gashopper concept is primarily designed to enable greatly enhanced mobility for robotic Mars exploration vehicles.  However the advanced gashopper engine system (AGE) has many potential important commercial applications in space. Small AGE thrusters could be used for stationkeeping and reaction control system (RCS) propulsion for satellites.  Currently the propellant of choice for such applications is monopropellant hydrazine, which is extremely toxic, dangerous, expensive, and offers a rather low performance (Isp = 220 s).   Small AGE based propulsion systems with ammonia propellant will be much cheaper, safer, and easier to integrate than hydrazine, while offering comparable or even superior specific impulse performance.  If the AGE operates above 1200 K, there can also be an extension of satellite life. With their ability to store thermal energy over time and release it suddenly, advanced gashopper engines offer all the flexibility, reliability and safety of resistojets with much higher thrust. Thus, gashopper engine technology could find a major commercial market in the satellite industry. Advanced gashopper engines could also be used to great advantage to provide stationkeeping propulsion for the International Space Station employing waste CO2 from the life support system as propellant and the AGE to provide thrust at a much higher level than would be possible using resistojets.","Another possible commercial application for advanced gashopper engine (AGE) technology is for rocket assisted takeoff (RATO) units for small aircraft. The AGE can easily be made to deliver large amounts of thrust, and because it can use water as propellant it poses no danger of fire to the surrounding area. Therefore an AGE RATO system offers interesting practical possibilities, which in fact were demonstrated by the short takeoffs achieved by the aircraft flown in the LaRC Phase 1 gashopper airplane program. One concept would be to build droppable integrated tank/engine units that would be heated on the airfield using locally available electric power. It sometimes happens that under emergency conditions an airplane might be forced to land at an airfield that is to short for it to takeoff from. Using a detachable RATO unit to augment thrust, the airplane could be made airborne again. Propellant could be obtained from local water sources, and autogenously pressurized by heating. Since the use of a RATO engine in such a case would avoid loss of an entire aircraft, the sale of such a RATO assist could be priced high enough to justify using such a system, even if it had to be expended after being dropped from a single flight. A suitable parachute system attached to the RATO unit might make expending such systems unnecessary. AGE systems could also be used to store solar thermal power acquired during the day and then generate electricity at very high efficiency at night.",Cooling; Energy Storage; In-situ Resource Utilization; Metallics; Mobility; Monopropellants; Renewable Energy; Reuseable; Thermodynamic Conversion

This X-ray source will enable further miniaturized X-ray instruments to be deployed for surface and subsurface exploration of the solar system. The basis of this innovation is in the application of state of the art materials to produce a low power passively cooled grounded-anode X-ray tube.These objectives will be achieved with an X-ray source that combines the advantage of easy thermal management and simple control electronics.  The concept relies on the use of state of the art ceramic materials that combines very good electrical insulation properties with good thermal conductivity.   This source will allow using the grounded cathode geometry for simple and compact electronics, and rely on the heatsink properties of the ceramic electrical insulator for heat dissipation to the ground.

The compactness needed for the hand held instruments is readily transferable to mounting on small rovers and landers for unmanned missions or left behind to monitor changes induced by changing environments.  The cold CNT cathodes are also much better suited to the rigors of space travel and landings because the emitter can be hard mounted directly to the device structure so they are resistant to high levels of shock and vibration and nearly immune to changes induced by extreme temperatures.,"Development of the miniature, focused beam, x-ray source will immediately extend the utilization of hand held and portable x-ray fluorescence and diffraction instruments because of smaller size and greater efficiency. They will find uses in imaging applications that require small focal spots and higher intensity for in situ locating flaws in small assemblies on  factory floors. The cold CNT cathode and metal ceramic construction of the tube adds a degree of ruggedness and environmental tolerance that will enable them to be used for in situ identification of hazardous compounds in industrial spills.

This will provide key enabling technology for mission planners, especially where hard landers or penetrators may be required to meet science objectives within challenging mass, volume and power constraints. Our innovative approach employs high strength inert materials to provide a direct interface between components such as a MEMS-GC injector chip, valves and GC column.  This eliminates fittings and tubing connections to greatly enhance robustness, improve system inertness and reduce mass. We believe it will be possible to develop the miniaturized GC system at a mass of about 200 grams, with an average power consumption of less than 50 mW for isothermal operation.  Our use of a modular design approach will make it possible to interface the proposed miniaturized GC to miniature mass spectrometers, ion mobility spectrometers, or other detectors of interest to NASA.  The goal of our proposed SBIR Phase 1 effort is to demonstrate feasibility for a miniaturized, high inertial load MEMS-based gas chromatograph, and to develop a detailed design for fabricating and demonstrating prototype instrumentation in Phase 2.","Miniaturization and robustness of in situ instrumentation are key drivers in the overall payload mass required for NASA missions. In the tradeoffs associated with mission design, instrumentation that can survive higher inertial loads allows propellant mass to be reduced.  This can be used to increase the science payload or reduce launch vehicle requirements. Thorleaf Research's proposed GC system addresses this need in an innovative way, providing enabling technology for ""hard"" entry into the atmospheres of Venus or the giant planets, and hard landers or penetrators at the surface of Mars, Europa or other bodies. Our miniature GC will be especially useful when coupled to miniature mass spectrometers or ion mobility spectrometers currently under development at NASA/JPL and NASA/ARC. With our modular design approach, this system can be adapted for NASA Space Exploration Initiative needs, such as environmental monitoring in space habitats and process monitoring for the extraction of planetary resources.","Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%.  Our modular design approach for the miniaturized, low power gas chromatograph designed to resist high inertial loads will help it be adapted for field measurement needs in scientific, energy exploration and environmental monitoring applications where ruggedness and reliability are especially important.

One of our innovations is the application of ""D-rod"" laser-diode side-pumping technology to the laser material Nd:YLF, which possesses substantially higher energy storage and will provide significantly higher output energies for the same volume compared to the more common Nd:YAG laser crystal. The negligible stress-induced birefringence and greatly reduced thermally induced distortion of Nd:YLF will allow us to provide linear polarization and excellent laser-beam quality from a conduction-cooled system. Another innovation is the use of passive Q-switches, Cr4+: YAG or F2-: LiF saturable absorbers that will greatly improve laser reliability and also eliminate the size and weight associated with active Q-switching. A key factor of our design is quasi-CW pumping with a variable duty cycle, which will not only reduce power consumption but will allow for developing a variable repetition rate source (as high as a 1 kHz), thereby reducing the data acquisition time.","NASA applications are in systems requiring compact, efficient, reliable, moderate-energy, nanosecond-pulsed lasers.

During Phase I a first-generation prototype motor/resolver will be designed, built, and tested in Venus-like conditions (486oC temperature and mostly CO2 gas environment). Phase I testing will verify the feasibility of the designs and confirm that the motor/resolver combination can operate at 486oC for an extended period of time.  Fully developed and optimized versions of this motor/resolver could be used to actuate drills, robotic arms, and other devices outside of an environment-controlled landed platform on the surface of Venus. The device's ability to survive for hours (and potentially longer) in that environment is a major benefit to future Venus science missions. It would permit time for communication ground loops to optimize sampling and drilling target selection as well as allow for multiple samples to be acquired from the subsurface.  In a potential Phase II effort, an extreme environment brushless motor/resolver combination will be developed to TRL 6.","High temperature motors are needed for future Venus surface exploration missions, and these missions provide the most immediate need for such devices. According to NASA's latest mission roadmap document, three different in situ Venus exploration missions are planned, with the first to be developed under the New Frontiers program with a potential launch date of 2013. The successful completion of the proposed effort would be essential to a New Frontiers Venus mission proposal as it would offer significant new opportunities for improved science, data gathering and operational life. According to the New Frontiers program schedule, the next Announcement of Opportunity is scheduled for release in about one to two years, which would be timed well with the proposed motor development here. Following a New Frontiers Venus In-Situ Explorer mission, two missions are planned in order to prepare for sample return, the first is a planned surface mission to demonstrate critical technologies and the second would be a fully equipped sample return mission.

The relatively low density of TMC (10% lower than Titanium) combined with its excellent mechanical behavior, results in significantly higher specific static properties than conventional material systems.

A VCHP is similar to a heat pipe, but has a reservoir and a controlled amount of non-condensable gas (NCG) inside the reservoir.  At low power, most of the condenser is blocked by the NCG.  As the power increases, more and more of the condenser becomes active.  This allows a VCHP to passively control the temperature while the power varies.  Aluminum/ammonia VCHPs are commonly used in spacecraft thermal control.  The proposed program will extend this concept to the alkali metal heat pipes that will be required for a Stirling system.  During normal operation, the VCHP will be inactive.  If the Stirling engine stops working for any reason, the VCHP will passively remove the heat from the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) preventing the GPHS from overheating.  The benefits of the VCHP radiator include increased safety and reliability, and the ability to design an optimum Stirling engine.","The immediate NASA application is to provide backup cooling for a radioisotope Stirling system.  This design has three benefits, the first two related to safety, and the last to performance.  First, if the Stirling engine stops operating during ground testing, the VCHP radiator will prevent overtemperature of the MLI insulation.  Second, the VCHP radiator will prevent overtemperature of the GPHS modules when in near earth orbit, preventing excessive grain growth from harming the integrity of the iridium shell on the GPHS module.  Finally, the VCHP can be used to remove the excess heat at the beginning of the mission, allowing an optimum engine design.","Commercially, ACT believes that there is a commercial application for alkali metal VCHPs in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  A typical system must maintain inlet and outlet temperatures within ±30oC despite a turndown ratio of 5:1 in reactant flow rate.  The current scheme uses a bypass valve, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control, requires power, and has a large pressure drop.

In this program, we will (1)optimize deposition conditions to improve reliability, repeatability, uniformity, and filter performance, (2)develop and optimize filter designs for radioisotope power,  (3)conduct extended high temperature, long life, radiation, and environmental durability testing, (4)identify other potential high temperature materials, (5) address the use of multiple spectral control architectures including spectrally selective emitters, back surface reflectors (BSR) and photonic crystals, and (5) integrate the spectral control architectures with RTPV technology to address NASA missions.","Exploration goals for the moon, Mars and the planets require the ability to move about on the surface at will and perform the required science and engineering tasks. Concepts for returning to the moon require the construction of a lunar base and full operational readiness of that base before any manned missions are made. Power systems for rovers and robot explorers are a key to meeting mission goals. Radioisotope power systems (RPS) offer the advantage of long duration operation (7 to 14 years), operation without regard to solar lighting conditions or shadows and without regard to low external temperatures. Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) RPS direct energy power converters take advantage of recent developments for high efficiency TPV cells, spectral control filters and spectrally selective emitters. The TPV RPS has no moving parts. It can be constructed to withstand high mechanical shock and the 'G' forces of landing or a potential 'driving' accident.","TPV energy conversion systems have no moving parts and are, therefore, very quiet and reliable.  TPV systems are suitable for portable generation of electricity for remote sites or on boats or recreational vehicles.  TPV can be combined with solar photovoltaics (PV) to provide electricity 24 hours a day.  This program seeks to improve efficiency and thermal stability, as well as reduce TPV cost.  As TPV efficiency improves and cost decreases it will find commercial applications such as recovering industrial heat waste, as a replacement for an automobile alternator, and in hybrid electric vehicles.  High efficiency TPV can be a cleaner, more efficient solution to the growing electric generation concerns.",Nuclear Conversion; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics; Photovoltaic Conversion; Power Management and Distribution

The estimation accuracy achievable during spacecraft operation depends not only on the algorithm, but also on its implementation. Typically, the algorithm will be implemented on a real-time multi-tasking processor that allocates on-board computational resources to multiple tasks and functions according to some scheduling policy. The processor's task scheduler  may induce delays that were unaccounted for at design-time and may sometimes preempt estimation tasks in favor of other tasks. Hence, estimation accuracy and in general the performance of any embedded algorithm can be significantly lower than expected during execution.

This long-wavelength region of the EUV includes the important solar emission lines O V near l=63.0 nm and Mg X near l=61.0 nm, formed at intermediate temperatures in the solar atmosphere.   While narrow-band EUV multilayer coatings are by now widely used in NASA missions for high-resolution solar imaging at wavelengths shorter than 35 nm, the observations made at those wavelengths probe coronal and transition region lines formed at either low (e.g., He II at l=30.4 nm) or high (e.g., numerous Fe lines) temperatures.  In contrast, the 60?65 nm wavelength region provides a unique spectral window in which to observe intermediate-temperature solar emission lines.  However, efficient multilayer coatings operating in this range have been unavailable until now.  The successful development of efficient, stable Gd-based multilayers as we propose, based on preliminary experimental results, will therefore enable the construction of new high-resolution solar telescopes tuned to O V or Mg X that will complement existing multilayer telescopes tuned to shorter EUV wavelengths, thereby providing more complete temperature coverage, and leading to better understanding of the solar atmosphere, its variability, and its crucial role in driving space weather.  EUV imaging instruments incorporating the multilayer technology we propose to develop may be included in future missions such as RAM, Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter, as well as future GOES satellites and new Explorer-class missions.

Lighter, more affordable, more stowable optical substrate surfaces will allow larger primaries which in turn provide higher resolution, better signal to noise, and significantly reduced time per observation, hence yielding better scientific return/mission cost balance.  At longer wavelengths, the aperture technology could support a broad range of additional NASA Science mission areas (i.e. microwave, THz, IR, LIDAR (incoherent then coherent) based imaging/observations).  RF and Laser comm applications are possible as well.  While non optical, there are also many possible additional space science related applications.

We designate this new combiner the Spatial Frequency Remapper (SFR).  In the SFR, the large field-of-view of the Fizeau design is sacrificed in favor of simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths.  Also, depending on the details of the design of the rest of the telescope, the SFR should either produce better images or relax the very tight stability requirements.  Since the large field of view of the Fizeau combiner is not needed for the mission, the SFR, if it works, is clearly the better design; it's only expense is the addition of one or perhaps two extra reflections, needed to incorporate the spectral dispersion.The work that will be accomplished, including Phase 2, will include A) completing the analysis of the design as it pertains to Stellar Imager, B) performing a laboratory test at longer wavelengths to verify the soundness of that design and C) developing a more rigorous test of its imaging capabilities to be performed on a large, ground-based telescope.  This final item will be the main component of the commercialization plan.","The direct application of the Spatial Frequency Remapper (SFR) is to the Stellar Imager Mission where it significantly improves the capabilities of that mission by providing simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths.

Combining this wavefront-sensing with its imaging capabilities, the SFR may be the ideal sensor for a high-dynamic range coronagraph such as that once needed for the TPF-C.","On ground-based telescopes, aperture masking is the only technique that has produced repeatable, high dynamic range images of complex surces at the diffraction limit of the telescope.  The SFR, interfaced to the telescope with a coherent fiber bundle, is a cadillac aperture masking system; it overcomes the sensitivity limitation of that technique by utilizing the entire telescope aperture.  This should give it a sensitivity approaching that of a standard camera with a similar integration time.  With its built-in wavefront sensing, it is immune to the artifacts that limit the combination of a simple camera with an adaptive optics system.",Optical

This approach incorporates two important innovations:  (1) new ALEX design--an adjustable array of smaller Lobster-Eye lenses for improved sensitivity, and (2) lens fabrication from two sets of iridium-coated semiconductor-grade silicon plates via POC-patented technology, satisfying the requirement for high flatness compatible with operating wavelengths. These innovations reduce weight 2-3 times compared to conventional Wolter I telescopes, increase angular resolution (8 arcseconds) and versatility, and reduce cost.  In high-sensitivity mode, ALEX will have an effective collecting area of >1600 sq. cm. in the 0.25 40 keV range, and operate up to at least 80 keV; in wide-angle mode, ALEX will span a field of view >1.8 deg. In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of ALEX technology by building/testing a prototype single Lobster-Eye lens, reducing Phase II development risk.  In Phase II POC will develop a fully functional prototype lens array and demonstrate its performance as a hard X-ray telescope. These results will allow NASA to build lightweight, high-performance hard X-ray telescopes.",The proposed ALEX technology will offer effective true focusing X ray optics that will have a wide range of astrophysical NASA applications. ALEX will support exploration of the structure and evolution of the Universe in the X-ray range from 10 to 40 keV with increased focusing ability and angular resolution which was never achieved before.,"In addition to its applications in X-ray astronomy, the ALEX will have applications in X-ray medical imaging, nondestructive inspection, National Accelerator experiments including neutron focusing, and other scientific, commercial, and military areas.

This project significantly advances the size and accuracy capability of GFRC reflector technology for future missions by focusing on innovation in two limiting areas: precision mandrel fabrication, and core induced surface error.  Mandrel cost and quality can often be thee most significant budget and schedule challenge to a reflector program.  To reduce cost, recent commercial innovations in optical grinding and polishing will be investigated for applicability to fabrication of a 4m convex tool.  A variety of traditional and non-conventional tool materials will be considered.  No-mandrel assembly concepts will also be investigated.  To improve reflector surface accuracy, improvement is needed to mitigate the anisotropic nature of GFRC core.  Novel methods of attaching core elements to faceskins will be investigated, as well as alternative core materials and manufacturing approaches.  Phase 1 will result in a preliminary point design for a 4m-class submm reflector.  Concepts for improvement in mandrel cost and quality, and reduction of core induced surface error, will be defined.

The alloy Hg0.834Cd0.166Te is predicted to also have zero energy gap at T=0 K and a heat capacity even less that that of HgTe due to: (i) a greater Debye temperature (resulting in a lower lattice heat capacity), and (ii) a smaller electron effective mass (resulting in a lower electronic heat capacity). Thus Hg0.834Cd0.166Te-based microcalorimeter arrays are expected to have an energy resolution superior to that of HgTe-based ones. We propose the growth of single crystal Hg0.834Cd0.166Te layers by molecular beam epitaxy on Si substrates. Mercury vacancies will be filled after growth to reduce the possibility of them acting as acceptors and introducing a significant electronic heat capacity. The Hg0.834Cd0.166Te layers will be characterized by x-ray diffraction to asses their structural quality and crystallinity, FTIR mapping to confirm the uniformity of their energy gaps and alloy compositions, Hall measurements to assess their electrical transport properties, etch pit densitycounts to determine dislocation densities, transmission electron microscopy to determine microscopic structural information, and heat capacity measurements at mK temperatures to test their promise as high energy resolution quantum calorimeters.","The principal application will be as next-generation soft x-ray calorimeters for astrophysical observations. The material system to be developed under this program, Hg1-xCdxTe/Si with x=0.166, promises high x-ray energy resolutions and benefits from well-established device and array processing technology (already developed for infrared arrays with x>0.166). Hence the fabrication of large (greater than 1000 pixel) arrays is feasible with energy and spatial resolutions superior to the current state of the art.  Achieving heat capacities lower than HgTe would also make high resolution microcalorimeters more feasible for hard X-ray and gamma-ray instruments, where much thicker absorbers are required.","Soft x-ray calorimeters have several industrial applications including X-ray microanalysis and ground-based scientific instrumentation, for example in the fields of laboratory atomic physics and the analysis of biological materials at synchrotrons.

Current wavefront correctors, while dimensionally stable, require closed loop control using a wavefront sensor and complicated electronics to maintain mirror shape. For space based systems, simplified open loop control is desirable since it reduces power and weight while greatly improving system reliability by reducing complexity and electronic parts count. Xinetics proposes a Programmable Relaxor Open-Loop Mirror using Integrated Spatial Encoders (PROMISE) that combines surface parallel actuation and micro optical encoders. The programmable relaxor open-loop mirror uses a surface parallel actuator array, made using ferroelectric micromachining originally developed for silicon based MEMS. The programmable actuator array enables the dimensionally stability and angstrom level control provided only by relaxor ferroelectrics, as has been demonstrated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The integrated spatial encoder features an optical encoder that monitors dimensional change and is integrated directly between the actuator array and the surface mount interconnect. The voltage output of the optical encoder is used as a direct input to the feedback loop for the actuator circuit enabling electroactive control of the mirror surface without the necessity of an optical sensor, thereby enabling open loop control.","Surface parallel actuated deformable mirrors capable of open loop control offer a greatly simplified approach to future NASA adaptive optics programs for both ground based and large (20m) space telescopes. The proposed device maintains the large scale integration feature of Xinetics' Photonex mirrors while enhancing the stroke response and enabling open loop control. The system complexity and resultant processing are greatly reduced while improving the dynamic range of high density deformable mirrors. This also overcomes the problems of optical quality, dimensional stability, and bandwidth associated with present MEMS devices while retaining the fabrication methods developed for MEMS. Open loop control significantly reduces the complexity, cost, and weight of using adaptive optics in space while greatly enhancing mission assurance. Given the development go ahead, PROMISE could be applied to primary, secondary and tertiary optics as well as in the instrumentation.","These types of mirrors hold great promise in extending adaptive optics to a wider community including amateur astronomers. Also, imaging, laser propagation, and laser control would all be able to use these mirrors, since they don't suffer from the MEMS limitation of little or no coating compatibility. Immediate application would be within the Airborne Laser program, where weight and control are critical.

Modern optical design and manufacturing procedures have begun using such components more and more in routine applications to improve optical system capability. Since the optical tolerances achieved in the manufacture of such components have an important bearing on the performance capabilities of the systems that employ them, instrumentation and techniques for precision metrology are vital for quality assurance. Inspection tools required for these types of optical components have lagged the capability to manufacture them. The proposed work will demonstrate a technique for full aperture precision metrology of such optical components and is anticipated to yield instrument designs that incorporate an extremely robust, reliable, and accurate wavefront sensor for precision metrology of a transmitted or reflected wavefront, together with a projection system that covers the full aperture. The proposed wavefront sensor comprises a unique combination of digital holographic interferometry, Hartmann wavefront sensing, and adaptive optics that results in an extremely flexible tool. For the Phase I study, we propose to employ an existing wavefront sensor instrument to accelerate progress towards production of useful experimental data from tests conducted on existing optical elements.","The ability to evaluate modern optical components to high tolerances is anticipated to provide new standards for manufacturing and quality control. This development will, therefore, have a corresponding and widespread impact on the performance capabilities of the many NASA systems that incorporate these components. The improvements gained by these measures may also provide substantial cost benefits compared to alternative, more complex, and expensive solutions. The versatile optical inspection system proposed here would be extremely valuable to NASA in manufacturing and acceptance testing of a wide variety of optics.","This program can provide a unique system for high accuracy testing of test objects and optics vital to a variety of military seeker and sensor systems. Both the US Army and the US Navy have requirements to develop metrology procedures for a new generation of infrared aspheric transmitting test objects with aerodynamic shapes that can depart from spherical by as much as millimeters.

Current systems incorporate a parachute which lacks the controllability necessary for precision landing.  The non-controllable parachutes act only as a delivery system but afford no way to direct the parachute descent.  The new technology will eliminate the uncontrollable system and, rather than using a round parachute variant, will have a high L/D parafoil capable of precision control and landing.  This controllable parafoil will have a multistage deployment sequence which will accomplish high speed, even supersonic parachute deployment with the parachute in a reefed condition.  The first stage of the deployment will approximate a conical ribbon parachute which will slow the system to subsonic speeds.  Once the system has slowed sufficiently, subsequent stages of the deployment will transition the non-controllable parachute to a fully controllable, precision-landing parafoil.","The primary initial purpose of the Stratospheric Deployment Parafoil is to enable precision landings in both thin atmospheric terrestrial and extraterrestrial applications. The SDP can be used for NASA missions requiring precision recovery of payloads from stratospheric balloons and low Earth orbit. Such payloads could range from small scientific capsules to manned vehicles like the CEV.The SDP can also be used to enable precision landings on Mars of near term robotic Mars missions. Many human Mars mission scenarios also require precision surface rendezvous capabilities, and a support of a human Mars base absolutely will need them, since otherwise return visits to the same base will be impossible. Therefore development of the SDP provides a critical technology not only for the ongoing robotic Mars exploration program, but for realizing the presidents Vision for Space Exploration as well.","The SDP could be used to enable precision delivery of supplies from aircraft to the surface using parafoils. Such application is of great interest for both military missions and disaster relief. The SDP is also an extremely attractive technology for enabling high speed aircraft to deploy low speed devices such as battle damage assessment UAVs.  SDPs could also be used for life saving of both pilots and passengers who could be forced to bail out from aircraft at speeds that would create opening shocks which exceed the strength of normal parafoils. For this reason, round parachutes have thus far been used for such applications, but parafoils would offer their users a better chance of avoiding dangerous objects on the ground. The SDP would make this possible.The system could also be used by High Altitude High Opening Special Forces paratroopers. The opening shock of a parachute at high altitude on a soldier who is heavily laden and falling very quickly in thin air is very high. The SDP could be used comfortably on HAHO mission, while allowing the paratrooper the mobility of a parafoil instead of a round parachute. Commercial space ventures utilizing reentry vehicles can use this technology to recover their capsules. There is currently a considerable interest in high altitude ballooning for edge-of-space and ballistic rocket planes for suborbital tourism. The SDP could be used for the recovery of such vehicles or as a safety device in case of structural failure.",Aerobrake; Kinematic-Deployable; Mobility

The entire sparker package includes low voltage batteries that must supply a high voltage (50 kV) pulsed-power capacitor to deliver the energy needed for generating an acoustic source for underwater mapping of hulls and other underwater shape detection. To make the sparker feasible, the entire power supply must fit into a small package, have a high efficiency, and be robust.

Automatic electronic defibrillators, arc spectrometers, Xenon arc headlamps, and x-ray generators are example applications where we are planning to apply the technology commercially. We are also commercializing AC-link in renewable energy applications, including solar and wind power. We are developing a 40 ? 250 W integrated power supply for solar panels that will have very similar software and a similar package design, operate at a lower voltage, and enable modular designs, easier installations, and reduced maintenance by eliminating the single point of failure that currently exists at the power converter.","DC-DC power converters are essential for regulating power in spacecraft where the primary power supply is a photovoltaic generator and energy storage is a regulated battery bank. Photovoltaic cells should be allowed to run at optimal voltage levels, which will vary depending on temperature, solar irradiance, and other factors, while the battery bank and most loads must be supplied with a regulated DC power source. A smaller and lighter weight package helps optimize the design and load of the craft.These DC-DC converters have a configurable voltage range, and can be scaled for different power levels, making them applicable to most NASA photovoltaic and battery power conditioning applications on a variety of vessels. The international space station, for example, uses 28 VDC in the Russian segment, 120 VDC on the American segment, 34 V batteries, and other voltages for specific instrumentation, requiring, according to one astronaut, ""inverters everywhere"".

Such wheel-induced mechanical noises are not well characterized. Disturbances can be amplified by wheel and other structural dynamics (for example, isolator modes), that are coupled to gyroscopic effects and therefore are wheel speed dependent. Tonal disturbances and wheel structural modes thus sweep across a frequency band. When one or more tones crosses the frequency of an observatory mode, a large jitter response will result. These higher harmonic effects have not been very significant in the past, for larger spacecraft having looser pointing requirements. However, many current and planned missions have much tighter pointing requirements than past missions. The higher harmonic wheel disturbances are being found to interact with structural modes to cause jitter exceedances.

Other advantages are absence of magnetic fields, high voltage, toxic chemicals, fuel and/or oxidizer storage tanks, heaters or valves, and the fact that the source of concentrated energy is physically removed from the thrust converter, so that only the fuel, not some engine component, wears or ablates during operation. Engine lifetime will be limited only by the amount of fuel onboard, not by the 200k year lifetime of the diode lasers which generate the ms pulses. Problems which we want to address in this Phase I effort are inadequate ablative layer thickness control which has led to excessive rms thrust noise, a footprint which is larger than we would like and plume contaminants generated by carbon doping used for laser absorption in the present fuel tape. Our goal is 1% rms thrust noise and an order-of-magnitude reduction in contaminants deposited by the thruster plume.","The work we propose will provide NASA with an innovative, miniature, precision propulsion system which is robust, lightweight, long-lived, with high thrust/power ratio and essentiallly zero erosion of any components beside fuel.

It could be useful as a compact, high thrust device for extending complex structures in space.

For Mars exploration missions, where large quantities of equipment will be required, an aerobrake that is adequate for the size and amount of equipment will need to be quite large.  Unfortunately, carrying a large aerobrake to orbit requires either an unreasonably large shroud or an expensive on-orbit assembly process.  Flexible aerobrakes have promise, but  pressure-supported ribs with tension-supported areal TPS have potential flagging instabilities. Andrews Space, Inc. proposes an innovative aerobrake design that is deployable and rigidizable, meeting initial launch volume constraints and satisfying terminal aerobraking requirements.

Protective coatings deposited by FCAPD have low defect density, excellent adhesion to space tether material, low mass and thickness and have been shown in initial laboratory tests to protect against atomic oxygen (AO) erosion on Kapton as well as Zylon.  Because of the low process temperature (<80 oC), FCAPD can minimize the thermal effects the process has on the tether material, which is believed to be a major disadvantage of current types of protective coatings such as Photosil , TOR-LM and POSS.  These polymer coatings offer a level of protection against AO and UV damage, but at a significant cost to the tether's tensile strength .","By 2015, space tether momentum exchange launch boost missions and other space tether missions (such as Jovian) will be launched by NASA and ESA.  AASC, by developing the space tether coating, plans to become an integral part of this technological roadmap. AASC has established a commercialization strategy for the FCAPD space tether coating technology for the next 5 years.  During the first two years of the project, AASC will use NASA SBIR funding to understand the science and seek optimal protective coating parameters.  We plan to achieve a TRL-5 coating by validating our prototypes at AOBF. Following validation, we will establish a path to production by partnering with tether companies such as TUI and seek a space flight test opportunity by the end of year 2.  During year 3, we plan to achieve higher TRL by testing coated tethers in MAST test flights (perhaps on a technology demonstration micro-satellite) to gain flight heritage.  In year 4, AASC will start a joint venture with tether material manufacturers and obtain external funding to begin full scale production of tether coating.   AASC and its partners will be in the position by year 2011 to become NASA's prime contractor of space tethers for propellant-less missions.","FCAPD coating can be applied in the photovoltaic (PV) industry to create excellent PV cell encapsulation moisture barrier coating. As a result of high module cost and reliability issues, current thin film products in the cost sensitive PV market have not seen widespread commercial use.  AASC recognizes that even a successful and effective moisture barrier coating cannot alone bring immediate widespread use of the thin film PV cell technology.  It is, however, instrumental to the improvement of the reliability and cost competitiveness of thin film PV technology. The thin film PV module market is vast but not immediate.  Lower module cost, better reliability and higher efficiency must be met for their use to be widespread.  In the short term, thin film PV modules will be sold mainly to high-value markets such as remote power generation for developing countries, replacing high emission/noisy diesel generators; and also for military uses.  The US Department of the Army has initiated a rechargeable battery program aimed at reducing the number of batteries used in the field, to reduce cost.

Several optical systems, lasers, and detectors require tight temperature control to better than +/-1K.  Some new missions even desire temperature control and thermal gradient control to the milli-Kelvin level.  Typically precision temperature control is achieved by cold biasing the device and using electrical trim heaters.  Variable conductance heat pipes are also used; however, the control band is not precise enough without unusually large reservoir volumes.  The pressure controlled heat pipe has the potential to achieve precise temperature control without energy wasting control heaters and without unfavorable mass and volume reservoirs.  PCHPs are essentially actively controlled VCHPs.  In a PCHP, the control system senses an increase (or decrease) in pressure and actively changes either the gas charge in the reservoir or the volume of the reservoir to maintain the operating temperature precisely at the set point.   The Phase I program will prove the feasibility of the PCHP concept.  A prototype heat pipe will be built and tested.  In Phase II, the integration and implementation of various control strategies will be performed.","The NASA applications include pressure controlled heat pipes (PCHPs) for precise temperature set point and temperature control for sensitive optical systems, lasers, and detectors.  The PCHP can be a direct replacement for traditional power wasting cold biasing with trim heaters technology.  The PCHP can also replace VCHPs where more temperature control is desired.  The PCHP may eliminate the often necessary need to change the desired orbit to modify the temperature extremes at the expense of the science mission.","The calibration industry is continuously looking for higher precision temperature control at lower costs.  A very small number of high temperature PCHPs have been built and tested for this industry; however, one of the reasons for the calibration industry's hesitation to adopt this technology in a widespread manner is that the price to benefit ratio is too great.  This is primarily because a set of sensors, controls, actuators, control algorithms, and predictive performance models do not exist.  A commercial customer, who wants one device, is unwilling to fund the development work; and, the business risk is too great to develop the system with company profits.  A successful Phase I and Phase II effort focused on precise spacecraft temperature control will be directly applicable to ACT's calibration products.",Control Instrumentation; Cooling; Large Antennas and Telescopes; Optical

The project members typically use different thermal design analysis software, making the vital exchange of data between team members difficult, costly, or impossible. One solution would be for everyone to use the same software, such that there would be no loss of data when exchanging models and predictions. However, the end result would be little innovation in thermal design software. Competition drives the development of new technologies, but also creates communication barriers. Each tool suite has unique capabilities and specializations, such that a superset of all tools would represent a tremendous advance in and of itself. We propose to develop a ""best of both worlds"" solution by adopting and extending an international open standard, STEP, for data exchange of thermal models, results, and test data. Such a standard, if available in all major design tools without limiting the unique capabilities of each, allows customers, contractors, and subcontractors to work simultaneously on the same project while using different software. It also allows each organization to choose the best software for each mission, component, and even design task, resulting in the best overall total project efficiency.","International cooperation is increasingly common for advanced science missions, which would otherwise strain the budgets of any one space agency. Cooperative thermal design activities, however, are extremely difficult to achieve because the NASA standard tool suite is different from the ESA standard tool suite. No direct means of exchange exists for models, much less predictions and test data. ESA has developed open standards used for data exchange within its suite of tools. This proposal seeks to make the NASA standard tool suite compatible with this current standard, streamlining the engineering process and improving the resulting designs as well. Ultimately, this proposal seeks expansions of the standard in order to make the best tools available for each component or design task, harnessing competition without the current side effect of communication barriers.","The result of this proposed development will be immediately marketable since it overcomes an obstacle with respect to the European aerospace market for military and commercial spacecraft. If the ability to use the best available software product, independent of the delivery format, were available, many European contractors, universities, and other agencies would readily adopt newer and more capable software. A similar effect is expected in America and Asia even though the choice of design software is unconstrained in those markets. An organization might choose to use one software suite for preliminary design, and a different one for final design optimization. The elimination of the current all-or-nothing scenario enables each supplier greater opportunities to provide partial solutions where no such opportunity existed before.",Cooling

Accompanying this is an unprecedented need for reduction in spacecraft size and weight.  However, reduced weight leads to higher power densities, and waste-heat dissipation densities have grown by an order of magnitude with the use of smaller, more powerful electronics.  Active thermal control methods are needed to cope with the increasing heat dissipation requirements and environmental extremes.  In recent years, spacecraft have employed mechanically pumped fluid loops to efficiently transfer large amounts of thermal energy between two points by means of a forced liquid convention loop.  The development of long-life fluid pumps, however, has not kept pace with the demands of advanced thermal control systems.  Conventional electric motor-driven fluid pumps are heavy, bulky, inefficient, and prone to wear.  Lynntech proposes to extend the operating temperature range of its long-life, low-power, miniature, electrochemically-driven pumps to -60oC to 110oC, which will allow their use in space and planetary environmental extremes.","A rugged, long life, low power, miniature pump capable of operating in extreme environments will have applications in the advance thermal control systems that will be required in future robotic missions and spacecraft.","With the increasing power density of electronics, there is a growing market for miniature, low-power pumps for use in the thermal management of consumer electronics.

Phase I will also deliver a clear technology roadmap in terms of algorithmic and architectural innovations needed to bring the project to success by the end of Phase II.Four mission-critical areas to the success of an FPGA-based non-von-Neuman system within a von-Neumann-based supercomputing environment are identified, namely (1) portability; (2) ease of use; (3) algorithmic speed balance between von-Neumann and non-von-Neumann components; and (4) communication speed. Innovative architectural and algorithmic methods aimed at boosting system effectiveness through each one of the four areas are proposed.

Software writers can then move forward by working in high productivity interactive languages such as Mathworks MATLAB. Star-P already has this general capability, but what is further needed are functional transformations from the language as it appears on the desktop.  In this work we will identify those transformations that will benefit NASA codes, and apply them first as a prototype in Phase I.  In Phase II we will complete the prototype fully automating what might be thought of as semi-automatic transformations.

These limitations can be improved upon by porting OSCAR into Star-P. Such codes will be hooked in and compared with MATLAB and most importantly users will be able to continue forward with existing MPI codes and build further in the MATLAB language knowing they will reap the productivity benefits of the Star-P platform by reusing old codes and obtaining performance from new codes.","This project addresses the needs of scientists and engineers who wish to access the speed and memory capabilities of high performance computers, but do not possess a computer science background.

GRIDL will automate generation of the IDL clients of Web Services for analysis and visualization of astronomical data and provide services for running parallel and serial IDL processes on Grids facilitating astronomical data analysis.In Phase I we will develop a prototype of GRIDL working with Flexible Image Transport System (FITS).  Based on the mapping of FITS data types to the Web Services Definition Language, we will implement a prototype Web Service with an IDL client for accessing remote FITS data and develop a prototype Web Service for running parallel IDL processes on a Grid.   Our approach is based on the ability IDL to call external C and Java and the Grid interoperability with these languages.  In Phase II we will fully implement the GRIDL and include other data formats common in astronomy.","GRIDL enables astronomical researchers to use the IDL tools to which they are accustomed within the emerging standard for remote, distributed computing. NASA projects provide collaborators from various, distributed research organizations with remote access to a tremendous amount of data.  Grid computing is becoming the widely accepted paradigm for such distributed collaborations.  For example, researchers participating in the US National Virtual Observatory would benefit by having their data and tools available within a standardized environment.  Other projects, such Deep Impact and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are examples of projects providing data to a network of researchers around the world.  Once these tools are developed, Tech-X Corporation will license them to ITT Visual Information Solutions providing IDL.

Environments such as Matlab/IDL allow ease of use, but unless simulations are extremely fast, they cannot be used naturally.Many large-scale numerical calculations require storage and computation that grow as the square/cube of the number of variables, including such linear algebra operations as solving dense linear systems, computing eigen-values/vectors, and others. The use of fast algorithms such as the fast multipole method (FMM) coupled with iterative methods allows many problems of interest to be solved in near linear time and memory. We have taken a leadership role in applying and extending the FMM to various problems in acoustics, fluid flow, electromagnetics, function fitting and machine learning.Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are now ubiquitous in game consoles, in workstations and other devices and are special purpose processors for graphics, that are predicted to shortly achieve performance in the hundreds of gigaflop range for specialized calculations (much faster than COTS PCs) at low price points.It is conceivable now to equip personal workstations with several CPUs and GPUs, and solve problems with millions or billions of variables quickly using fast algorithms. We will take an important algorithm with wide applicability: the FMM, and implement it on the widely available heterogeneous CPU/GPU architecture, and prove the feasibility of accelerating it tremendously. A fundamental reconsideration of the algorithm that maps appropriate pieces on to the correct part of the architecture forms the basis of our approach. Developed software will be tested, and benchmark problems solved. A library of software that will support the porting of the FMM and other scientific computing to the CPU/GPU architecture will be developed.","NASA is fundamentally a science and design driven organization where simulation is used extensively. Scientists and contractors routinely use simulation to develop new aircraft/rotorcraft propulsion systems and mitigate the noise created by them; design new space and satellite antennas, compute electro-magnetic and other cross-sections of objects; design new lenses and masks; compute free surface flows in microgravity; solve inverse problems to design for heat transfer, or develop material properties; solve problems of stellar dynamics and molecular dynamics and others. All these computations have been shown to be accelerated tremendously by the FMM. Availability of high quality FMM software capable of being accelerated by CPU/GPU environments will help achieve NASA achieve its objectives cheaper and faster.","At the end of Phase II and in Phase III we will have available an FMM library that can be used to accelerate various scientific simulation software.

No comparable software offering is available that will allow these companies to easily incorporate the FMM in their offerings, and improve them dramatically.

In this project, we propose the development of general purpose computational libraries capable of solving numerous core numerical functions on commodity graphics cards.  These solvers will be based on accepted, industry-standard interfaces and will be easy to integrate with current and future applications.  The result will be a GPU-based numerical coprocessor capable accelerating a wide range of computationally intense functions, thereby reducing processing times in applications where numerical computations are the primary bottleneck.","Virtually all software requiring extensive numerical processing could benefit from the solvers developed in this project.  Most such software is already created using BLAS or similar libraries, thus requiring very little modification to be used with these accelerated solvers.  They can have an immediate impact on numerous NASA applications such as vibration analysis for a number of multi-body spacecraft configurations such as Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), and rotorcraft and computational fluid dynamics for space craft flight through the atmosphere and rocket design.  Other application areas of interest to NASA include mechanical and stress modeling, heat transfer analysis, and image processing.","These solvers could be integrated into everything from specialized computational engines to general purpose tools such as MATLAB.  MATLAB currently integrates BLAS compliant routines to solve computationally intense problems.  Some versions of MATLAB even ship multiple implementations of this interface and allow the user to select between them.

The objective of this proposal is to incorporate hardware acceleration into the latter using a cluster of graphical processing units (GPU). During Phase I, the direct interaction component of FMM (vortex only), which constitutes roughly half the computational cost, will be offloaded onto one GPU. Feasibility will be demonstrated by achieving order-of-magnitude GPU speedup over a CPU. Phase II activities will involve the porting of the entire FMM code (for both vortex and boundary elements) onto a cluster of GPUs.

It will also provide a number of novel features such as (i) Profiler which replaces the need to create personalized websites, (ii) searching documents for query hits rather than the usual ﬁle name only, (iii) U-publish which enables ""publishing"" scientific papers and their supplementary materials, and EmailAttacher which works by dragging a file into an email utility but rather than attaching and sending the file, it simply creates a link to the folder where the file resides with the instructions for the user on the other end to retrieve it.","We expect strong marketing opportunities for SciPerNet within the federal government, scientific organizations, and commercial sector through (i) creation of online communities, (ii) cost savings and enhanced offerings to content provides, and (iii) rapid adoption among the public of a new file sharing mechanism using EmailAttacher feature of SciPerNet.  Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency, US Geological Survey, and Housing and Urban Development are among the federal groups that are deploying distributed content systems to move the US government to the next level of interdepartmental information sharing.  NASA and other federal agencies would be obvious targets for the cost savings that SciPerNet would provide.  NASA is a data centric organization and accessing and sharing of data among scientists remains a challenge. Virtual observatory is a promising technology for making accessible data access from various missions and instruments through a web browser.  SciPerNet provides a complimentary solution to Virtual Observatories by enabling distributed collaboration and sharing of downloaded and/or processed data among scientists.  This will, in turn, increase science returns from NASA missions.  As such, SciPerNet can serve a two-fold purpose for NASA, as cost-savings software as well as a productivity tool for scientists working with data from NASA missions.","SciPerNet enables creation of online communities, provides cost effective ways for organizations to disseminate content/data, and EmailAttacher allows users to easily share photos,videos/music files through their email utility.  The creation of online communities generates ""traffic"" among targeted audience with obvious marketing potential in delivery of ads and products.  P2P also offers a major savings to content providers.  One recent Bear Stearns report estimated that Napster would have had to pay nearly $7 million a month for bandwidth costs alone if it had been hosting all the songs its members were downloading at its peak. Such examples are a powerful attraction for companies looking for ways to cut costs. EmailAttacher feature of SciPerNet holds the promise of rapid adoption among the public sector. Email remains the dominant means of electronic communication but with the growth of broadband internet, there has been a desire to share large files (movies, audio files, scientific data files) over the internet. Large files cannot be sent as attachments via email, and this had led to photo-sharing websites like Kodak, EasyShare Gallery, Snapfish, and Shutterfly.  However, all these websites share a common flaw: The need to upload photos to a Web server, a process which just gets lengthier and more prone to error the bigger the files get.  Email Attacher overcomes the existing limitation of email and enables the user to ""attach"" large files.",Computer System Architectures; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

We propose to implement a graphical user interface that allows the user to manage and assemble rule-profiles.  A rule profile would be created by assembling and parameterizing one or more low-level code modules.  This user interface would then be able to save these profiles into a revision archive, perhaps alongside the applications and the data sources.  These profiles could then be checked out, and used.  Locking the version of such a profile would freeze it in a known state.  Leaving it unlocked would allow it to evolve.

This system is able to import  Vetronic components of varying age, which leads to the exact problem this proposal addresses.

Though work at JSC by Tuan et al. has targeted modeling and verifying the model of a stagnating radiator with one candidate fluid, Paragon proposes to parallel this effort with an alternative fluid as a back-up to that currently base-lined in the Orion program.  This technology will be a significant innovation in that stagnating radiator designs provide self regulation of thermal dissipation parameters.  As heat flow to the radiator is reduced, less cooling capacity is required; stagnating radiators incorporate fluids that gradually change properties. If increased heating loads are encountered, the radiator working fluid changes again to increase the heat transfer capability of the radiator.

For example, it seems likely that a wearable monitor system could be linked to a central medical database through telephony or internet access such that patients may go about their daily routine without having to remain under strict supervision at a hospital or clinic. It also allows personal physicians to monitor the health status of individual patients during normal lifetime pursuits, or before and after surgical procedures.

Also, prognostics can support remote diagnostics/prognostics. The value proposition is that early detection of impending failures can be made remotely, via the web, and corrective actions quickly employed to preserve overall system integrity. With remote systems deployed on other planets, autonomous operation enabled with electronic prognostics is very important. Advance warnings and mitigation of failures are facilitated using electronic prognostics that detect an impending failure before it occurs. Another potential application of Ridgetop's technology would be the Advanced Diagnostic Systems (ADS) project, which is interested in reasoners and PHM in the Space Station. Among the level 1 requirements for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is rapid launch capability, enabling its use as a Crew Rescue Vehicle for the Orbital Space Station in the event of an emergency. Ridgetop has developed ground-based prognostic tools that can be leveraged to develop applications that provide ground-based logistic support for spaceflight hardware on NASA vehicles.

Ridgetop has initiated commercialization activities stemming from its prior work in prognostics with the introduction of the Sentinel SiliconTM Library and Sentinel PHMProTM products.There is a large potential for prognostics in the commercial sector, which is expected to exceed $200M by 2010. Ridgetop has segmented the market to focus on high reliability applications, such as automotive, banking system, industrial process control, and commercial aerospace.Prognostics, to the extent that it can leverage existing diagnostic backbones such as JTAG, I2C, and CAN buses, supports Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) strategies for critical industrial applications. For CBM and PHM applications, the value of preserving operational readiness is paramount and these applications are not expected to be cost-sensitive.One useful application of this prognostic approach is to monitor the health of electronic power systems.

Lightweight verification techniques have proven themselves effective in finding defects in large software systems by balancing rigor with scalability and usability.  Lightweight verification techniques do not exhaustively check software, but they can find defects in systems that are too large for more rigorous analysis techniques, and are fast becoming an essential tool for software developers.  The techniques generally fail to address key sources of problems specific to embedded systems: paths due to asynchronous transfer of control or context switches between tasks are not considered; assembly language components are ignored; it is hard to detect violations of domain-specific rules.

Adaptive systems incorporate learning to adapt the control system to the current operating conditions of the system, certifying their performance is a complex and tedious process. Ongoing effort in the development of tools for verification and validation of adaptive control systems, there is little research directed at the development of analytical methods. Learning rules for adaptive systems derivation using Lyapunov's second method, is based on the derivation of an energy-type function whose derivative must be negative to guarantee convergence therefore the asymptotic stability of the system. The first problem is that Lyapunov's second method provides a sufficient condition for stability thus the synthesis of an appropriate Lyapunov function for a particular application is a major challenge. The second problem in many applications, including the design of adaptive neural flight control systems, it is only possible to prove that the derivative of the Lyapunov function is non-positive, rather than being negative. For practical purpose, it is only possible to conclude that the control system errors are ultimately bounded, and it not possible to estimate the magnitude of these errors or the time it takes for these errors to converge to their steady-state limits. The objective of this research project is to develop analytical methods for the analysis of adaptive neural networks (ANN) based flight control systems including analytical estimates of the settling time and the steady-state magnitudes of the error dynamics. The magnitudes of the error bounds will be related to the performance handling qualities of the system and provide very important information about the performance of the closed-loop system.","The proposed technology is designed to be compatible with current safety requirements for conducting aircraft systems ground and flight tests in order to take advantage of the state of the technology in expert system.

To determine the electrical responses of transistors and circuits to radiation events, physics-based Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and mixed-level tools are required. This project will provide models and tools that will improve capabilities for prediction of technology-dependent responses to radiation in wide temperature range, which will lead to better design of rad-hard electronics, better anticipation of design margins, and reduction of testing cost and time. Future NASA missions will use nanometer-scale electronic technologies which call for a shift in how radiation effects in such devices and circuits are viewed.

The prototype plasma reactor on which the PADS will be based has also shown successful destruction of organic carbon with good power efficiency. Incorporation of this technology would facilitate a decrease in size or total elimination of the intensive re-supply of activated carbon for adsorbent beds, and possible elimination of the high temperature catalytic reactor.

Reverse osmosis (RO) is a compact process that has proven its ability to remove inorganic and organic contaminants from space mission wastewater. The objective of this Phase I study is to ascertain whether composite hollow fiber membrane elements are a more efficient alternative to the current generation of spiral wound membrane elements for the reclamation of space mission wastewater. In particular, the use of low-energy composite hollow fiber membrane elements being developed at SFST for treating multi-component (both inorganic and organic contaminants) wastewater streams found aboard spacecraft will be investigated. The higher membrane surface area of these composite hollow fiber membrane elements enables the RO membrane element to have 30% higher water productivity at substantially higher single-pass recoveries (60-75% vs 10-20% for spiral wound elements). Furthermore, we will also investigate possible solutions to minimize fouling of these hollow fiber membranes by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface using a variety of surface modification techniques. Such hollow fiber membranes are expected to show better resistance to fouling by hydrophobic compounds, and thus these membranes will be less likely to be clogged by potential foulants. These improvements to the RO membrane element have the potential to decrease the mass, size and power requirements of the RO subsystem, and also decrease the size of the pre-treatment unit.","The technology is specifically targeted towards the wastewater treatment systems on board spacecraft to produce potable water on long duration missions, such as the establishment of bases on the lunar surface or human planetary exploration. Reverse osmosis technology is well suited for wastewater treatment in space because it has the advantages of high rejection of contaminants, durability for removing inorganic contaminants with high water recoveries, a compact configuration and minimal re-supply of consumables for continuous operation when to compared to other physical-chemical treatment processes. The current design of the RO subsystem in NASA's Integrated Water Recovery System employs spiral wound membrane elements. Composite hollow fiber membrane elements have many advantages over spiral wound membrane elements for reclamation of space mission wastewater applications (i.e. higher module productivity/lower feed pressure, higher recovery and reduced mass). These advantages should make the use of composite hollow fiber membrane elements a viable alternative to spiral wound membrane elements being considered for the Integrated Water Recovery System.","Reverse osmosis membranes consist of a dense surface layer (50 ? 500 nm) that is highly permeable to water, but highly impermeable to dissolved salts, organic molecules, microorganisms, and colloids. Consequently, reverse osmosis membrane elements have been successfully used in municipal water treatment (desalination of brackish water and seawater desalination), industrial water treatment (power generation/boiler feed water, food & beverages, wastewater treatment and reclamation), and producing ultra-pure water for microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing. End-users of reverse osmosis membranes continue to look for products that perform at lower pressures and have improved fouling resistance. If this project is successful, these composite hollow fiber membranes offer significant performance improvements over spiral wound membrane elements in terms of being able to operate at lower pressures or by operating with lower numbers of membrane elements with the additional benefit of reduced fouling.",Waste Processing and Reclamation

In addition to limiting bio-fouling the brine evaporation system is designed to completely and autonomously recover usable water and isolate waste salts. Crew interaction is limited to periodically removing the bio-isolated waste byproducts from the system.","The EBDS enables water reclamation from waste water brines without the use of consumable wicks. EBDS can interface with the Advanced Water Recovery Systems (AWRS) of the Advanced Life Support (ALS) project or similar systems required for all long-duration human spaceflight systems and extraterrestrial colonization to process waste water created by reverse osmosis treatments and provide water suitable for post-treatment and human consumption. The EBDS can be used to recover water from laundry washing and drying applications. By using EBDS, launch mass and volume can be greatly reduced by limiting the amount of water needed to support the mission by reducing the amount of water lost to waste. In addition to saving the volume and mass associated with carrying extra water, crew time and stowage are reduced by greatly increasing the time between service operations.","EBDS provides a reliable, scalable, energy efficient, and low maintenance method of recovering usable water from brines. Primary use of the EBDS technology is in microgravity due to the gravity independent nature of the phase separation provided by the brine evaporator and condenser, thus commercial space travel will benefit. Immediate terrestrial applications of this system could be as a self-contained package for concentration and stabilization of non-volatile toxic or high-value wastes (e.g., dyes, heavy metal salts, or lumber-treatment solutions) from environmental cleanup sites or small scale manufacturing processes. The system is especially suitable for mercury salt remediation because the closed air loop will contain any volatile organomercury compounds present in the water feed solution. The EBDS could also be used for recovery of solvents or fuels from spills or leak sites in areas of saline groundwater.",Waste Processing and Reclamation

This proposal seeks to develop a method that is, above all else, simple, inexpensive, and maintenance-free. Previous programs to develop flight hardware, including CHeCS, PCWQM, and previous SBIR-funded efforts, failed to produce workable hardware and were relatively complex and expensive. Since the product water in a closed life support system will not likely vary in characteristics as much as terrestrial water and wastewater samples for which commercial TOC instrumentation is designed to analyze, adaptation of the complex commercial methods for spacecraft application should not be required. We therefore propose to fabricate a simple, low-volume, flow-through device that is based on a micro-reactor to convert organics to organic acids, followed by liquid-phase detection of the acids. Innovative detection methods that do not require frequent calibration are proposed. Phase I will consist of prototype fabrication followed by feasibility tests to quantitatively assess reactor performance and detector sensitivity and precision. Phase II will result in high-fidelity instrumentation that is suitable for flight qualifiication.","This device will have applications in ISS, Lunar bases, and Mars bases, and will be developed based on the assumption that the system(s) in which it is employed will be of Crit 1 or Crit 2 hardware fidelity.","This device will have immediate application in the >$100M commercial market for TOC instrumentation.

The device will be a prototype bucket ladder excavation tool with a pivot arm, and will have a target mass of 20kg and a target production rate of 500kg/hr. It is intended to be integrated into a roughly 80kg mobile platform for a total projected mobile system mass of 100kg. The system will be designed for minimum power consumption for the lunar case, with a target power consumption of less than 200 watts for the terrestrial demonstrator (note: lunar power consumption is expected to be lower due to gravitational differences). Productivity goals include a maximum berm height of 3 meters (based upon multiple passes), a single-pass excavation depth of 30 cm (with a width of between 10 and 25 cm), and a multi-pass road width of 4 meters.","MPED is offered in support of NASA's ISRU efforts, with the expectation that lunar resources will be utilized as specified in the NASA Exploration Vision. Continuous excavation is key to maximizing ISRU productivity because of its ability to acquire a steady stream of ore. The system will also be capable of performing civil engineering operations that could be required for the setup and preparation for a lunar outpost or base, as well as other activities such as building of infrastructure, or site preparation for telescope deployment. A future robotic system based on MPED could also use its trenching capability to assist human geologic explorers, and is expected to become a candidate payload as a component of future ISRU missions.

Conventional solar-fired furnaces face significant challenges in fabricating, deploying and pointing the large aperture, high concentration ratio reflectors that power them. The Modular Distributed Concentrator (MDC) is a systems solution comprising an array of identical, modestly sized solar concentrator dishes with a network of optical or thermal transmission links that route the high quality concentrated energy to a centralized receiver.  The approach provides lower mass because of the ability to optimize the scale of the individual reflectors to achieve high concentration ratio without the heavy structure needed to achieve and maintain optical alignment found in large aperture optics.  The minimum deployed height associated with an array of concentrators allows for good packaging efficiency and minimum deployment complexity, and since the dishes are one-piece and identical, tooling and manufacturing costs are significantly reduced.  The proposed program performs system optimization trades and then proceeds to the preliminary design and development of key components such as the optical light guide and thermal heat pipe transmission links that carry the energy to the furnace, as well as the key input and output interfaces.  A proof-of-concept demonstration in Phase I will be used to validate the performance model and guide the detailed design, development and environmental testing of system components in Phase II.","In addition to application to the needs for high temperature regolith processing for oxygen, silicon and other materials on the lunar surface, NASA can benefit from the application of this technology to manned spacecraft requirements.  The MDC provides an alternative to the large deployable solar concentrators which were the main impediment preventing the realization of benefits from solar dynamic converters with thermal energy storage for space station and other large habitable space modules.  The use of solar energy directly as light and heat also provides a more efficient resource for climate control functions of space, lunar and planetary habitats.","There are a significant number of applications that could be enabled by a modular concentrator approach that allows transmission of the high-power, concentrated solar energy.  Medium- and high-temperature industrial processes could enjoy significant monetary savings by replacing electrical energy with direct solar firing, but most processes cannot be reasonably located at the focus of a solar concentrator.  A significant energy user that would benefit from the MDC is in the fabrication of solar grade silicon from sand ? a process that can take place in desert areas where direct solar is abundant.  Another potential significant user of this technology is the environmental remediation industry which can purify water by dissociating chlorofluorocarbons with concentrated sunlight piped directly to the ground water table.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Power Management and Distribution; Renewable Energy; Solar; Thermodynamic Conversion

In this system solar radiation is collected by the concentrator array which transfers the concentrated solar radiation to the optical waveguide (OW) transmission line made of low loss optical fibers. The OW transmission line directs the solar radiation to the thermal receiver for thermochemical processing of in-situ resources or for manufacturing of materials and components on the planetary surface. Key features of the proposed system are:1.  Highly concentrated solar radiation (10^3 ~ 10^4 suns) can be transmitted via the flexible OW transmission line directly to the thermal receiver for thermochemical or manufacturing; 2.  Power scale-up of the system can be achieved by incremental increase of the number of concentrator units;3.  The system can be autonomous, stationary or mobile, and easily transported and deployed on the lunar surface; and4. The system can be applied to a variety of ISRU processes.","The specific application of the proposed solar power system is for production of oxygen and other useful materials on the lunar surface. The solar thermal system could be set in place prior to the initiation of various lunar projects such as mining, processing or manned outposts. Therefore, the solar thermal system is the key enabling technology for building up the infrastructure for the lunar base.

Two US patents were recently awarded to the PI on a means to separate all isotopes of regolith in a single pass using either a continuous or pulsed operation.  This method of in-situ resource utilization has been studied at a system level, and results published at a national space conference.  Phase I of the proposed work will extend the favorable results obtained so far towards a system-level model of the process suitable for more accurate computation of performance metrics.  Mathematical models of the SiO2 molecule dissociation, ionization, transport and separation will be derived and applied to the patented apparatuses.  Preliminary calculations on silicon extraction indicate the potential for solar cell production at approximately $6/Watt, a 50 times improvement over other proposed methods of space-based manufacture.  We will apply this novel method of beneficiation to a simultaneous extraction of oxygen and silicon.  Key questions to be answered include estimates of the physical dimensions conducive to efficient extraction (Watts/kg, kg/sec), which will drive system parameters of mirror size, solar power needs (for magnetrons and chillers), shielding, thermal management and infrastructure.  Milestones within the six-month project will be:  (1) vaporization, energy flow and system architecture; (2) addition of self-shielding, double-ionization, three-dimensional considerations and slag rates; (3) inlet design considerations, multiple molecule separation, and velocity profiling; and (4) composite separation rates and overall tranfer function characterization.  Upon completion of Phase I we will have detailed design equations needed to construct a prototype oxygen extraction unit during Phase II.","Oxygen molecules separated from a plasma will be condensed on a cold plate and gravity-collected for use as a fuel oxidizer.  Oxygen is also a component of a breathable atmosphere, and as a raw material for other ISRU applications.  Silicon extraction is used for solar cell production using float-zone crystallization and ion implantation to form photodiodes.  Aluminum extraction (also possible with these inventions, but not studied herein) provides for conductors and Ohmic contacts to the silicon to form solar arrays capable of supplying power.  This power can be used to power additional beneficiation apparatuses, or for baseline power to a lunar habitat or science station.  A machine delivered to the moon in advance of a manned mission can be readily assembled and operated during lunar day.  Waste slag from the separation process can be deposition-formed into bricks of any convex shape.  Waste heat from these bricks can drive a Sterling cycle engine for mechanical power, and the bricks can be assembled into shelters for equipment or habitats.  This concept leverages the capability to produce 100s of times the mass of extracted resources compared to the delivered payload mass.  Adaptations of the same invention, covered by patents, allow use in microgravity environments, thereby extending applicability to future missions to the moons of Mars or to target asteroids, where additional beneficial elements (such as nitrogen and carbon) can be found.","The three biggest problems facing mankind today are nuclear proliferation, global warming and peak oil.  If it can be made cost-effective, space solar power can ameliorate all three.  To be cost-effective, extra-terrestrial sources of silicon and aluminum are needed for the solar cells.  Transportation of workers and material throughout cislunar space, a non-trivial contributor to overall costs, can be greatly reduced with a source of extra-terrestrial oxygen.  Therefore a system capable of extracting all three of these vital elements from lunar regolith represents a considerable economic benefit to any enterprise producing space solar power.

Honeybee will test key concepts for a pneumatic drill, intended for use in the lunar cold traps, and will also investigate a method for mining the top few centimeters of lunar regolith with a gas system that has no moving parts. Analogous to the high-powered drilling done on Earth, the proposed pneumatic drill will derive its mechanical power from a chemical fuel (NOFB3), and it will use a fluid (in this case, low temperature exhaust gases extracted from the power system) to remove drill cuttings. A drill of this sort will have a number of advantages over traditional electromechanical drill/auger systems, including reduced power consumption, lower mass, less mechanical complexity, and better durability at extreme temperatures. In Phase I, the team proposes to investigate the production of mechanical power from the monopropellant via a small turbine, and, separately, to study removal of cuttings with gas flow while drilling in a laboratory vacuum chamber.The second part of the proposed research will be to investigate a method for mining the top few centimeters of lunar regolith using a method similar to ""jet-lift dredging"". This method will use a stream of gas, also provided by the partial decomposition of NOFB3, to draw simulated lunar regolith into a delivery pipe connected to a storage bin. The system has no moving parts and is thus well suited for the abrasive lunar environment.The proposed coupled propulsion/pneumatic system for excavation and prospecting will enable robust, rapid, subsurface access into an in-situ medium, and particularly into permanently shadowed regions on the moon without requiring solar illumination, potentially large nuclear power systems, or potentially complicated distributed power systems.","The drilling and mining technologies stemming from this research will directly meet the Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program (LPRP) and human lunar exploration mission objectives. To date, traditional methods of drilling and mining have failed to reach high TRL levels. If this research is successful, the resulting technologies will have the simplicity and robustness to operate under the extreme lunar conditions, particularly in terms of exposure to the abrasive lunar regolith and the large temperature extremes. The same drilling technology could have applications on Mars and the mining system may also be suitable for future use on asteroids.Given the large range of applications for gas generators in both aerospace and commercial applications, Firestar Engineering, LLC anticipates that this work will lead into focused product development after Phase 2. One immediate and closely related application that will be investigated for application is a pressurant system for upper stages and launch vehicles that may operate from NOFB3 monopropellant.","The turbine-powered pneumatic drill system could be useful for terrestrial drilling in Polar Regions, where gasoline engines perform poorly at very cold temperatures. The basic system for generating power via a small turbine could also be adapted to other mechanical devices, such as pumps or winches.

The SPIES system launch weight and energy consumption will be 33% of those of the current distilling/purification systems because it eliminates the requirements for consumables and downstream distillation equipment.  While requiring minimal system maintenance, this system will operate without consumables, and will be easily reconfigurable for different ISRU scenarios.  In Phase I POC will establish the feasibility of the SPIES system by assembling a proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrating separation of a simulated lunar volatile, reducing development risk in Phase II.  In Phase II POC plans to optimize the SPIES system design and assemble an advanced system prototype that can perform multiple gas separation tasks, enabling NASA to selectively remove and purify a range of gas streams in lunar solar resource prospecting.","POC expects substantial NASA opportunities for the SPIES system for selective removal/purification of a wide range of gas streams, including hydrogen, helium, oxygen, ammonia, nitrogen, and water vapor.

The advantages of this design lend themselves well to spaceflight mechanisms in general and specifically to the extreme conditions at the lunar poles.  The high gear reductions possible within a single stage, coupled with the already compact size make gear bearing transmissions ideal for spaceflight hardware where size and weight are at a premium.

One method of increasing the mechanical strength of polymers is to reinforce them with high-strength cylindrical glass fibers. In most cases, however, the introduction of glass fibers into an optically transparent polymer destroys the transparency of the polymer and an object at distances greater than a few feet cannot be clearly seen through them. MO-SCI Corporation proposes to develop novel large high-strength and optically transparent, flexible panels of glass fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites, as light-weight structural components, by layering a polymer matrix reinforced with glass ribbons (micron-size glass fibers with rectangular cross section) and a tough compliant polyurethane film. MO-SCI Corporation has produced research quantities of rigid epoxy-matrix composites which use glass ribbons that are index matched to the polymer matrix to be used as high-strength windows as described in U.S. patent 5,665,450  and licensed to MO-SCI Corporation. The objective of this proposal is to use this technology to produce nearly defect-free composites as demonstration samples for marketing structurally strong and impact resistant composites that are optically transparent.","The main application of high-strength ribbon-reinforced flexible composites is as a component of light-weight inflatable structures, as requested by the NASA SBIR Subtopic. These flexible composites may be opaque if carbon-fibers, for instance are used, or transparent, if glass ribbons are used. Transparent flexible composites may have applications as deployable domes for the Mars environment for plant growing. Rigid transparent composites may have applications as high-strength windows. Rigid and opaque composites, reinforced with glass ribbons may have applications as cryotanks, as the glass ribbons may offer a much lower permeability than circular fibers.","The potential applications of high-strength rigid transparent composites described in this proposal include protective eyeglasses and face shields, high security display cases, airplane windows and fighter jet cockpit canopies, transparent armor and security shields, display and filter elements, blast-resistant windows in buildings, and solar cell substrates. These composites are light-weight, as compared to laminated high-strength window glass or ceramic-based composites, and would be of high value in Home Land Security applications, structural windows for resisting hurricanes and tornadoes, and as protective armor for vehicles and airplanes.",Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Composites; Fluid Storage and Handling; Inflatable; Radiation Shielding Materials

Some components are in thin film form and the specific rigidity and dimensional stability needs improvement.  Components of landers and vehicles are subject to dust impact. All these solid or hollow components are vulnerable in space because of the foreign object impact or radiation attack. In this Phase I project, we propose to develop ultra-lightweight, microcellular nanocomposite foams and sandwich structures that possess all the desirable properties mentioned above.   The structural module can be compacted into a small volume to facilitate launching. The proposed microcellular nanocomposite foam and sandwich structures do not involve or release any toxicity and will have much higher specific mechanical properties than foams and sandwich structures processed by the conventional techniques.  They can be used to either replace or supplement to the inflatable technology for improvement in reliability, durability, and safety in space operation.

Lightweight structures are desirable for space transportation vehicle systems in order to reduce launch costs, increase mission flexibility/efficiency, and add robustness with respect to the ability to add weight or additional materials to the mission with minimum sacrifice in performance.  The use of non-eroding materials, coupled with lightweight materials, as rocket nozzles can further increase mission flexibility by allowing an increase in performance, higher maximum temperatures, greater speeds, greater range, bigger payloads, and longer lifetimes.  The higher maximum temperatures may eliminate the need for cooling air, while simultaneously increasing engine efficiency.  Higher maximum use temperature additionally allows for increased stagnation temperatures and pressures, increasing the propellant enthalpy, which, in return, can significantly increase the velocity and performance of the projectile.  These benefits result in increased fuel savings.  The advanced materials study will include monolithic ceramics, refractory metals, and high temperature ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials.  The manufacturing processes for the monolithic ceramics and refractory metal materials will include hot isostatic processing (HIP), vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), electrodeposition.

To accomplish these missions, NASA will exploit to the maximum degree possible the Apollo architecture and especially the lessons learned and technological advances that have occurred over the intervening 40 years in building robust, cost effective, efficient, and, partly reusable launch, lander, explorer, and resupply vehicles.  In support of this effort, Technology Assessment & Transfer (TA&T) proposes to develop a magnesium metal matrix composite (MMC) for use as aerospace structural members.  This material exhibits three times the specific stiffness of the best aluminum-lithium alloys and two times that of PMCs.  TA&T will demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of a low temperature method for achieving high loading of ceramic particles in a magnesium matrix that will enable a cast or extruded structural material of non-uniform cross-section exhibiting the unusual combination of light weight, high specific stiffness and strength, radiation shielding, and low cost.

There is a need for lightweight structures in space transport, vehicle systems, instrumentation, planetary access, as well as operations including facilities and habitats.  These vehicles, equipment, and structures will be subjected to rigorous environmental exposures and assaults.   Innovations that increase specific strength and stiffness, reduce weight, provide radiation shielding, enhance thermal management, and improve robustness, in a safe, reliable, cost effective manner will contribute to the success of these missions.  This proposal offers an innovative solution utilizing fundamental mechanical engineering principles taken to a multi-hierarchical level.   Directionally oriented reinforced composites, structural foam, honeycomb, and core-shell designs are mature technologies.  The distinguishing element of the approach for this proposal is the unique, new to the world, X-aerogel core material developed by NASA GRC.  Aerogels are touted as the lowest-density solid materials known and have excellent insulation capacity but are extremely fragile.  Through conformal polymer crosslinking of the silica structure, these sol-gel castings can be strengthened into the realm of load bearing materials at densities in the 0.2 to 0.3 g/cc range.  Further, this proposal explores manipulation of the core material nanostructure through surfactant induced micelle formation.  This will create controlled morphology nano-honeycomb, which is expected to greatly enhance the strength and reliability versus the sol-gel random nanofoam through elimination of stress concentrators and optimal distribution of load.  When these cores are coupled with advanced composite skins, resulting structures are extremely lightweight with strength, stiffness, and insulation performance far beyond what is currently commercialized.","High strength, light weight, robust, thermally insulative, and radiation protecting, structures for planetary exploration are needed.  The largest anticipated applications for this development is building structures for operations facilities and habitats that can be kitted and quickly erected with minimal effort.  These structures will have conductivity imparted as required to provide lighting strike deterrence, will have very high thermal insulation efficiency, be very impact, abrasion, and wind resistant, and provide radiation protection.  A typical building kit would consist of anchoring, framing, and load bearing wall and roofing panels.  The lightweight panels could consist of an outer shell utilizing either carbon fibers or carbon nanotubes to impart electrostatic dissipation in the case of lighting strike. This skin will be ballistic/storm grade composite to withstand aggressive impacts.   The highly insulative core material will be X-aerogel or polymer modified nano-honeycomb siliceous structures that have been modified with high hydrogen content species to impart radiation shielding.  The inner skin could be less robust and aesthetically desirable.   Other areas of use will be in armoring vehicles and aircraft for the same hazards with reduced weight.  Thermal and acoustic insulation benefits for these transport applications in addition to impact resistance, radiation protection, and low weight will be realized.","These nanoporous composites have a wide range of utility for defense applications. It is a logical extension that the DOD will have interest in these materials and structures for aerospace, marine, vehicles, and ballistic protected facilities.  As the technology is proven successful and processes are streamlined, commercialization will follow into civilian marine, airline, consumer, and construction markets. Because of the unique combination of exceptional properties, a network of eager end-users for a number of applications including boat cores, building panels, skylights, aircraft, automotive, pressure vessel, ballistic protection, and refrigeration insulation already exists.In buildings, the combination of structural walls and highly efficient insulation could reduce overall materials and installation costs.  The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy reports that in our buildings today we consume 39% of the energy and more than 70% of the electricity in the nation.  In these energy conscious times, improved insulation materials will be quickly be approved for use.  Drywall type forms could replace the need for foamed in or fiberglass insulation allowing for thinner wall sections and reduced material costs.  The weight and bulk of roofing structures could be greatly reduced.  With a single 1"" windowpane of aerogel equivalent to the insulation provided by 32 windowpanes of glass, translucent  X-aerogel are a highly desirable material for daylighting.",Airframe; Composites; Erectable; Fluid Storage and Handling; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Radiation Shielding Materials; Thermal Insulating Materials

In a conventional Li-ion battery when the rate is higher than C, their charge/discharge performance is severely degraded and loss its capacity permanently. Now we are focusing our interest to develop Li-ion batteries that can rapidly charge/discharge at high current rates.

Additionally, ionic liquid electrolytes are well suited for space applications because they have near zero vapor pressure and are a non-flammable alternative to the organic solvents commonly used in batteries. It is anticipated that this technology will benefit a broad range of Exploration mission applications including portable power for landers, rovers, and astronaut equipment, as well as stationary energy storage applications such as base power, and storage systems for crew exploration vehicles and spacecraft.   In phase I we will deliver a laboratory prototype cell capable of performing between the NASA temperature extremes of -60oC and 60oC while retaining greater than 80 % of its room temperature capacity and cycle life.

This Phase I proposal is based on demonstrating the feasibility of fully packaged Li-Ion batteries that have a superior specific energy (>200 W·hr/kg) through the use of novel polymeric cathodes (composite conducting polymer/disulfide materials) when coupled with room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte. Compared to traditional organic electrolyte systems (e.g. (e.g. lithium salts dissolved in alkyl carbonates), RTIL electrolytes have favorable electrochemical windows (> 5 V) and high ionic conductivity over a wide range of temperatures from ?60?C to 250?C and are known to prolong the lifetime of conducting polymer electrochemical devices.

Fueling of the rocket motor adds an additional complexity in that inspection of the interior becomes impossible while creating the possibility of disbonds between the case and fuel. These factors can have potentially catastrophic consequences for the space vehicle performance. Acellent Technologies is currently developing structural health monitoring systems to address this issue. The TRL at completion of the current technology development is anticipated to be TRL 5-6. The proposed program focuses on maturing the technology to a TRL level 7 for implementation on existing and future space transportation vehicles. The development will be conducted in close collaboration with ATK-Thiokol who fully support the developmental and commercialization efforts.,"The Next Generation Space Vehicles architecture definitions will require built-in damage monitoring tools such as those based on the proposed system. Structural integrity determination of critical components of a reusable launch vehicle such as impact damage monitoring for solid rocket motors can be extremely important especially during ascent, in-orbit and re-entry. Unforeseen impact events during this time can cause damage that if not monitored can lead to catastrophic failure of the vehicle. Since nearly all next generation launch vehicle structures will require some form of inspection and maintenance procedures to monitor their integrity and health condition during pre-launch, during space operations and post-flight, the potential applications of the proposed system are very broad. In the future, this system can potentially be used to monitor all major structural components of launch vehicles.","The system to be developed under the present proposal offers the potential to provide a complete solution for a wide range of structural analysis, evaluation, and maintenance requirements and enable a number of high value economic benefits to the aircraft, missile and spacecraft industries. The largest and nearest-term impact areas for the technology are critical but inaccessible areas on structures. The system can potentially be used for applications ranging from aircraft (to monitor impacts on door surrounds, fuselage, wings etc. )to automobiles (crash sensing) and monitoring of bridges and buildings.","Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Composites; Launch Assist (Electromagnetic, Hot Gas and Pneumatic); Launch and Flight Vehicle; Metallics; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Propellant Storage; Reuseable; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Tankage; Testing Facilities; Thermal Insulating Materials"

Sand casting is a relatively inexpensive casting method not traditionally used to manufacture superalloy castings. Instead of invested ceramic shells, the molds are produced from a mixture of fine sand and/or rammed graphite powder. Friction stir processing is an emerging microstructural modification technique based on friction stir welding (FSW). It can be applied to enhance the microstructure-properties of the cast material thus improve the damage tolerance capabilities. This step is needed to allow cast superalloy rocket propulsion components to be used without a casting factor.",Advanced superalloy castings can be used for rocket and air propulsion applications.,Potential non-NASA commercial applications include components for land-based gas turbines and petrochemical pumps and valves.,"Aircraft Engines; Airframe; Beamed Energy; Ceramics; Chemical; Cooling; Fluid Storage and Handling; High Energy Propellents (Recombinant Energy & Metallic Hydrogen); Launch Assist (Electromagnetic, Hot Gas and Pneumatic); Launch and Flight Vehicle; Metallics; Monopropellants; Nuclear (Adv Fission, Fusion, Anti-Matter, Exotic Nuclear); Propellant Storage; Reuseable; Structural Modeling and Tools; Thermal Insulating Materials"

These design requirements result in significant unsteady, transient effects both on the fluid mass flow rate, as well as the torque required from the actuators controlling the valve. However, there currently are no fundamental analytical or numerical modeling tools that can predict the unsteady/transient performance of these valves; current design tools are limited to quasi-steady models and empirical correlations.  The innovation proposed here is a high-fidelity, comprehensive numerical tool that can characterize the transient performance of these flight valves and provide design support.  Geometry complexity and numerical accuracy problems associated with resolving valve configurations with moving surfaces are addressed via a grid adaption strategy within an unstructured framework. Unsteady effects due to both turbulence interactions as well as multi-phase cavitation are addressed with advanced numerical framework that incorporates both real-fluid thermodynamics for cryogens as well as advanced LES models for unsteady turbulence modeling.  The tools and technology developed here would directly impact design support efforts for the J-2X upper-stage engine in the Ares 1 launcher envisioned under the Constellation program for the mission to the moon.","The end-product will be a high-fidelity, numerical simulation software (CRUNCH CFDREG code) that would predict the transient performance of flight valve configurations , provide design support by supplementing current empirical rules, and diagnose system anomalies.  Our product addresses core needs of NASA in the Constellation program, and the mission to the moon, for reliable and well-validated computational tools that can provide accurate simulations of performance in an accurate and efficient manner to be useful within a design cycle timeline. The technology developed here would directly impact analysis of the valves and the feed systems to be designed for the upper-stage J-2X feed system in the Ares 1 launcher by providing the transient mass flow through the valve, unsteady torque loads on the actuator controlling the valve, as well diagnosing the potential for damaging water-hammer as well as multi-phase cavitation effects that may result during rapid on-off control.","The commercial market for our product is very large and includes the broad market of rapid response control valves in industries such as nuclear power generation, chemical process plants, and hazardous waste facilities among others where the transient performance characterization of valves play a vital safety role. In addition to these traditional markets, commercial space ventures ranging from space transportation systems (COTS) for the international space station (ISS), to low-cost satellite launch systems are getting an infusion of venture capital and would be receptive to accurate simulation tools. The primary market for this product will be in the design and analysis of high-performance, high-reliability valves used for inherently transient operations in the nuclear and chemical process industry.

Additionally anticipated benefits of the injector include low inert mass and low manufacturing costs.  IN Space plans to carry out the feasibility assessment of the injector design by conducting broad parametric test fire evaluations of a notional LOX/hydrocarbon workhorse thruster based on present NASA needs to assess the effects of several design considerations on the combustion efficiency, static combustion stability, and startup transient duration performance merits.  A preliminary flightweight injector design will also be generated in order to compare the estimated injector mass with similar injector designs.","NASA space-based propulsion systems deriving the most benefit from the innovative swirl injector characteristics are LOX/hydrocarbon engines that may experience significant LOX boil-off due to long periods of inactivity or thermal soak-back.

Therefore, the development of a crack resistant coating system on fuel elements nuclear thermal propulsion that is insensitive to hydrogen corrosion and erosion is considered enabling.  Ceramic Composites Inc. (CCI) proposes a systematic approach for CVD deposition and evaluation of a family of zirconium carbide (ZrC) and niobium carbide (NbC) coating systems for both uranium carbide-zirconium carbide solid solution [(U,Zr)C]-graphite composite fuel elements and advanced triple carbide (uranium carbide-ziconium carbide-niobium carbide) solid fuel elements designed for use in space nuclear power and propulsion reactors.  These refractory metal coating systems will be evaluated in high temperature hydrogen in concert with a preliminary performance modeling effort.","The development of a high quality coating for space nuclear reactors will be enabling for the development of nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), in particular if one uses fuel elements based on the Rover/NERVA heritage design or the Pebble Bed design. The higher specific impulses afforded by NTP will provide significantly shorter travel times to the moon and Mars, reducing the time in zero gravity for manned missions and greatly increasing the speed of cargo/supply deliveries and unmanned exploration missions.","The development of a high quality coating for space nuclear reactor fuel elements could have potential across a variety of nuclear applications. A variety of designs exist for the next generation nuclear power plant, such as the Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) and the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR). In the case of both of these the final fuel form has not been decided. The triso fuel particle has been suggested for both as well as clad solid fuel pins. Either of these two fuel forms could benefit from an improved fuel coating of this type. The idea of using mixed carbides (U,Zr)C, (U,Nb)C, which would allow for much higher operating temperatures, for both pellets and solid fuel pins has been put forth and both would require a cladding material. Most of these systems will operate above the temperature limit of SiC or would have compatibility issues with the standard C/C/SiC/C (triso) coating developed for pebble type fuel. The case of the VHTR the reactor has the ability to generate hydrogen by splitting water molecules, the presence of hydrogen and oxygen pose serious problems for the triso coating.","Ceramics; Nuclear (Adv Fission, Fusion, Anti-Matter, Exotic Nuclear)"

NanoSonic specializes in the production of advanced, non-commodity resins as adhesive, sealant, and novel coupling agents.  One aspect of our synthetic method involves the systematic replacement of nonpolar groups along well defined polymer backbones with sidechain chemical moieties capable of complexing with metals, hence significantly increasing adhesion to metal or composites relative to nonpolar resins.  Synthetically engineered hybrid copolymers allow the inherently hydrophobic backbone to mitigate moisture ingress, while the tailored sidechain moieties offer adhesion orders of magnitude greater than unmodified commodity resins.  NanoSonic also tailors the number and type of crosslinking sites available to minimize CTE, while maximizing the mechanical properties and cohesive strength to prevent catastrophic disbonding from aircraft adherend. The specialty adhesives are available in 1-55 gallon drum quantities.  Down-selected adhesives and coupling agents shall be tested under harsh thermal (-90ºF to 800ºF) and environmental conditions and in a wind tunnel (subsonic, Mach <1) along-side state-of-the-art structural aerospace adhesives to increase the TRL from 4 to 6 during Phase I.","NanoSonic's high performance polar, yet hydrophobic adhesives would result in advanced aerospace adhesives and surface treatments with increased durability to minimize subsonic aircraft aging and durability related hazards with a TRL of 6 upon completion of the Phase I program.  NanoSonic's polar resins are synthetically engineered to offer stronger adhesion over commercial aircraft adhesives, and the hydrophobic backbone allows for superior moisture resistance and corrosion mitigation.  The down-selected polymers would also serve as adhesives or sealants with solvent resistant against jet fuel, sea water and harsh aircraft solvents.  The adhesives offered will be delivered in volumes up to 55 gallon drums and are roll-to-roll compatible for repair appliqué.  TRL 9 would be reached via successful flight testing and platform integration of the adhesives onto commercial subsonic, supersonic and near-space aircraft such as 787 Dreamliner, V-22, AH-1, UH-60 F/A-18, JSF, HAA and ISIS.","NanoSonic's hydrophobic yet polar hybrid adhesives and coupling agents shall offer excellent adhesion, moisture and corrosion resistance over a wide service temperature range of -90oC to > 350oC.  While typical epoxies offer good adhesion, the proposed copolymers offered herein are synthetically engineered to provide service over a wider thermal range with enhanced solvent resistance (sea water, jet fuel and solvents) and weatherability against UV and ozone.  The backbone allows for cryogenic compliance, while the novel copolymer design offers inherently higher thermal stability relative to commodity structural adhesives.  During Phase I, accelerated ageing studies will be carried out to verify peel and lap shear adhesion of > 10,000 psi up to 1,000 hours.  Additional thermomechanical studies shall be carried out under cryogenic and elevated temperatures (-65ºF to 285ºF) for supersonic simulations and after soaking metal-to-appliqué peel specimens in boiling water and heated solvents.",Airframe; Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Composites; General Public Outreach; Inflatable; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Radiation Shielding Materials; Thermal Insulating Materials

However, fastening/joining and design methodologies in current use are artifacts of metallic aircraft component use and are not yet optimized for use with composites.  Furthermore, limitations in our current ability to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential. Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations. Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.The goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  In Phase I we will focus on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.  JENTEK and MR&D are well-positioned to deliver this methodology in the form of commercial software and NDE equipment.  We will also work with a major aircraft OEM to maintain our focus on practical solutions to high priority needs.","If the program is successful, it will provide NASA with a framework in which a variety of NDE methods can deliver enhanced performance for manufacturing quality assessment and life management of composite components and bonded structures.  This will be enabled by improving the understanding of the interactions between the incident energy associated with particular NDE methods and the composite constituents, including the use of thermal and mechanical loading sources.","Civilian aircraft designers will experience the same benefits in terms of being able to more fully utilize the capability of composite aircraft components to provide weight reductions, payload improvements and fuel efficiency.

In order to provide early detection of aging and damage processes in composites, we propose to develop a ""virtual inspection"" simulation toolbox specifically for ultrasonic guided waves. This toolbox will be able to evaluate ultrasonic guided wave NDE methods for its feasibility as part of the design process for critical system components, and it would include modeling the changes in critical material properties as indicators of material aging and then quantifying the levels of detectability of these material properties with the guided wave NDE technique. This computational tool will be able to accurately model the interaction between the changes in the material properties and the probing energy of guided waves to allow the development of the inspection parameters needed for application on a particular structure.","Substantial budget expenditures and schedule delays are often required to develop and demonstrate effective NDE techniques for critical components not designed for inspection.  To avoid such problems as NASA moves forward in the Constellation Program to develop the CEV, CLV, and follow-on spacecraft and habitat structures, it is essential to provide design tools that will enable rapid assessment of the feasibility of NDE methods as part of the design process for critical system components (thermal protection systems, pressure systems, composite structures, etc.).

One of these key technologies is the detection of wake vortices generated by other aircraft.  This is of particular concern during take-off and landing, both because the danger is particularly acute, and because of the large economic impact of having to widely space the aircraft.  About $5 billion of revenue is lost each year due to delays and lower throughput in our nation's airports.  Ground-based lidars have the ability to detect and track wake vortices, but mounting similar systems on aircraft would be prohibitively expensive.  We propose to develop an intrinsically low-cost lidar that would be suitable for deployment on commercial airliners.  Costs are kept low through an extremely simple design: a passively Q-switched single-frequency laser that uses a fiber delay-line in place of a local oscillator.  The Phase I effort will also include a modeling task to explore detecting wake vortices using an on-axis lidar instead of imaging from the side.

When tasks demands exceed the operator's available cognitive resources, potentially costly errors occur.  A task mitigation system that is able to monitor the task and the operator's functional state (OFS) and implement task mitigation strategies before an operator becomes overloaded could significantly reduce errors and allow operators to work more efficiently.   This proposal describes the development of a closed-loop task mitigation system that uses advanced regression techniques to identify the relationships between the OFS, the physiological measurements, the mission-related context, and the task mitigation strategies.  To maximize accuracy, we use task analysis to develop a computational cognitive model of the planned mission profile, which is then used to train the regression model.  The computational cognitive model describes the OFS as a continuous function along four dimensions: executive function, spatial working memory, verbal working memory and attention.

Two competing technical approaches will beconsidered; Aurora collectively refers to them as ""Safety Verification-based algorithms.""To this end, Aurora proposes the innovation of applying a suitable version of these algorithms to the design of a flare maneuver guidance and planning logic.  The planner will be capable of dynamically producing a flare maneuver guaranteed not to violate the aircraft flight envelope and other stipulated constraints.  The planner will meet the robustness requirements stipulated in the topic solicitation; namely, it will apply to both impeded and unimpeded aircraft, and it will operate under significant weather disturbances.  The main technical challenge in developing the planning logic is extending and applying the chosen control algorithms to 6-DOF aircraft dynamics models under the required variety of operating conditions. The ultimate goal of the Phase 1 effort is to explore the feasibility of applying Safety Verification-based optimal control algorithms to an appropriately sophisticated model of the aircraft dynamics during the flare maneuver.","Aurora envisions two related NASA Commercial Applications resulting from the proposed innovation, both of which align with NASA's Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) project.  First, the planning logic is envisioned as a separate, specialized module tailored specifically to the flare phase of flight, thus fulfilling the multi-disciplinary IRAC project goal for one flight phase.  In a broader context, the success demonstration of applying Safety Verification-based algorithms to this difficult flight regime would spur similar efforts and thus, applications to many other flight regimes.","Aurora envisions two possible non-NASA Commercial Applications resulting from the proposed innovation.  The first, and immediate application of the planner is to UAV Automatic Take-off and Landing (ATOL) systems on Aurora'sfleets of UAVs.  A second, and broader application is based on the opportunity of becoming experts in developing Safety Verification-based algorithms and their application to both manned and unmanned systems.  An example application in the manned systems domain is the extension of the planner to autolander systems.For unmanned systems, Auroraviews this effort as a technical opportunity that will eventually assist in improving UAV safety and reliability.","Attitude Determination and Control; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems; Simulation Modeling Environment"

This is due to a proven harsh environment compatibility of the proposed sensors and a predicted harsh environment compatibility of the proposed actuators. In each of these applications the proposed health management system is expected to provide a significant impact on important characteristics such as safety, reliability of the structural components, and minimization of maintenance/replacement cost. This, in turn, will cause a significant impact on the cost, safety and reliability of future NASA missions.","In addition to NASA applications, the  proposed all-fiber optic ultrasonic sensing system (the heart of proposed health management system) can be potentially applied to such fields as health monitoring and management of structural components including naval vehicles, civil structures (buildings and bridges), power plants (wind turbines, stuck liners).

Recently, we have been able to demonstrate the shape memory effect  in these foams, which is a unique capability.   Unlike solid, monolithic TiNi, the open-celled foam structure allows for very rapid response times when immersed in fluids, such as hot water or hot air. The SHS process makes net shape components, and so the cost of the tube can be dramatically reduced, and can have features introduced into the end of the tube to allow for simple torque transfer into a structure.  Thus, in developing a foam torque tube using SHS, all of the key obstacles to its incorporation into existing aerostructures can be resolved, while preserving the key benefits of a lightweight, solid-state structure.","The development of porous foam TiNi torsional actuators fits into a niche of a large torque, large strain, fast response, solid state actuator. Our initial thoughts on NASA applications are to introduce these into new NASA concepts, such as in  ""morphing"" UAVs, or such as the concept vehicles   where wing twist can be used to control flexible wing structures.  In addition to aircraft, the torsional actuators can also be used for deployment of booms, both for deploying sensors in aircraft but also in spacecraft where the lightweight, minimal part count  actuators could be heated electrically. For next generation shuttles, where the actuators must also be space qualified, this type of actuator to control wing twist, nacelle structures or ancillary aircraft structures would be of great benefit.","Commercial applications take two forms, one is introduction of these tubes to control variable nacelle structures, for example in Boeings new concept.

Resulting aircraft designs such as blended wing bodies with distributed propulsion can provide the large reductions in emissions, fuel burn and noise required to make air transportation growth projections sustainable. The power density requirements for these electric machines can only be achieved with superconducting materials. However, their feasibility is dependent on improving the power density of the cryocoolers needed to cool the superconductors to their operating temperatures.  We propose a Cryoflight turbo-Brayton cryocooler, optimized for low weight and high efficiency.  Our initial design studies indicate that this design will exceed the mass and performance targets identified by NASA for superconducting aircraft.  In Phase I of this project we will extend our initial design study to include a system trade study and individual component designs (TRL 3). In Phase II we will demonstrate the turbomachine, the most critical component in the system (TRL 4). In Phase III we will demonstrate a complete cryocooler (TRL 4 and TRL 5).  Our proposed Cryoflight cryocooler development effort will provide an enabling technology for superconducting aircraft, which have the potential to revolutionalize future air transportation.","The proposed Cryoflight cryocooler development effort will support NASA's long term goal to increase aircraft efficiency and reduce aircraft emissions and noise. By providing a cryocooler optimized to meet the aggressive power density target required for aircraft systems, we will remove a key obstacle hindering the development of superconducting aircraft.  While such aircraft are still two or three decades from production, supporting technology development needs to begin now if such aircraft are to become a viable alternative to the aircraft configurations in production today. The results of this SBIR project will support NASA design trade studies, system demonstrations, and eventual superconducting aircraft demonstrations.   Other NASA applications include space applications such as cryogen liquefaction and storage for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, CEVs, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, in-space propellant depots and extraterrestrial bases.  Terrestrial NASA applications include cooling for spaceport cryogen storage and transportation systems and for demonstration hydrogen production and transportation systems.  The highly reliable and space-proven turbo-Brayton cryocooler is ideal for these applications.","The primary private application for this cryocooler is for cooling superconducting devices on electric aircraft once these aircraft are accepted in the commercial market.  Other private sector applications include cooling for laboratory- and industrial-scale gas separation, liquefaction, cryogen storage and cryogen transportation systems; high-temperature superconducting magnets in motors and alternators; liquid hydrogen fuel cell storage for the automotive industry; and commercial orbital transfer vehicles and satellites.",Cooling

Enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity in these polymeric composites could eliminate this damage.  The addition of this multifunctional capability to composites will result in lower manufacturing costs and weight reductions in future aircraft since the addition of coatings, conductive mesh, or expanded foil materials can be eliminated.  A combined materials and engineering approach will be utilized to accomplish this objective by modifying a high performance composite system with a combination of conductive nano and micron size filler materials.  The large difference between the two filler sizes will create a stratified composite structure that consists of the conductive micron size particles residing in the interlayer region of the composite with the nanomaterials dispersed evenly throughout the matrix and in the fiber tows.  Using this approach, these composites will have the same or better balance of mechanical properties as current state-of-the-art composite systems but also have the added functionality of a conductive interlayer and network to eliminate damage from lightning strikes.  The Technology Readiness Level will be between 3 and 4 after the Phase 1 program.","The successful completion of the Phase 1 and 2 research programs will enable the development of lower weight and low cost composite structures that traditionally require lightning strike protection from secondary applications of conductive materials.  All four of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Programs would benefit from this technology including Subsonic Fixed Wing, Subsonic Rotary Wing, Supersonic, and Hypersonic programs.  Specific composite applications that would benefit from this technology include primary and secondary aircraft structures, such as fuselage sections, aircraft control surfaces, leading edges, fixed panels, and fairings.  In addition, propeller blades, turbine blades, and engine core cowl applications may benefit from this technology.  Other applications may be found in missile and rocket components that would benefit from enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity.  Also, applications that involve EMI shielding and electrostatic discharge could benefit from this technology.","Next generation commercial, military, and civil aircraft, as well as helicopters can benefit from this technology to reduce weight and costs from the elimination of added lightning strike protection to composite structures.  Since the lightning strike protection is built into the composite, better reliability and reduced maintenance will be observed over that of conductive paints, meshes or foils.  This technology provides enhanced conductivity in every ply, not just on the surface plies.  In addition to lightning strike applications, this technology may find use in composite structures that could benefit from better heat dissipation or heat transfer.  Military ships, aircraft, missiles, and rockets may benefit from this added multifunctionality.

The primary goal of this SBIR is to make available a new technology that will make it feasible to manufacture small diameter one-piece cooled axisymmetric scramjet combustors.  The availability of the proposed technology will result in scramjet program cost savings and engine design improvements and a strong near term technology commercialization is likely.  In fact, scramjet developers have expressed that there is no other known means of manufacturing some of the most desired axisymmetric combustor designs.Although Ormond, LLC currently manufactures scramjet engine panels using a novel abrasivejet machining process and software that is available nowhere else in industry, new engine developments have created the need for key technology advancements.  A principal advantage of the proposed technology is that it can generate small high-aspect-ratio channels in nearly any material, and is now used to machine the complex cooling flow field patterns found in the Inconel scramjet heat exchanger circuits.  There are technical and economic benefits over all of the existing manufacturing methods because it is a cold, non-chemical low-mechanical load process that has no affect on workpiece material crystal structure.  Developments that will be made under this SBIR are: 1.) miniaturization of the specialized cutting head to fit in the axisymmetric combustor, 2.) development of a new numerical model and software needed to implement the process, and 3.) development of an appropriate long reach manipulator arm and control software to provide appropriate tool motion in the combustor cylinder.  The Phase I program will initiate the development and demonstrate feasibility of the proposed technology.","Scramjets: Commercialization of the technology developed in this program has a huge economic value when the scramjet application is looked at alone.  It is projected that scramjet engines will be manufactured for 300 missiles per year and 3 reusable launch vehicles per year once production starts.  ABMACH is already considered to be the baseline manufacturing method for scramjet panels by a major prime because it was found to be the only cost effective technology available.Channel Wall Combustors: Channel wall liquid rocket combustors will benefit from the successful completion of the proposed SBIR.  Engine developers have asked Ormond to mill channels from the inside of the combustor, but the capability does not currently exist.  This application has requirements very similar to the axisymmetric scramjet.  Adaptation of the proposed technology to manufacture channel wall rocket combustors can have a huge impact on the economic and technical success in implementing channel wall combustor technology.  A principal advantage is that it can economically generate geometries that are not possible by other methods.  The global market estimate for rocket propulsion systems over the next ten years is $4 billion/year.  The domestic market represents half of this.  The cost of manufacturing the channel combustor accounts for a significant fraction of the propulsion system cost and the technology developed in this program addresses the market directly.","Ground based turbine engine transition ducts are consumable high-temperature heat exchangers used in power generating gas turbines.  Currently, over 90% of electric power in the world is produced using gas turbines.  In one Westinghouse design, 16 transition duct pairs are used per turbine.  ABMACH reduces the manufacturing cost by nearly 70%, resulting in $10M in savings per year.  Ormond is currently working under funding by ground turbine manufacturers to evaluate implementing ABMACH in the manufacture of these components.Ormond is currently working with a major down-hole energy company to develop tooling with internal features machined into integral cases.  The development of the proposed technology will support this proprietary effort directly by making available a means of machining features in tubular components made from tough materials.","Aircraft Engines; Ceramics; Composites; Cooling; Launch Assist (Electromagnetic, Hot Gas and Pneumatic); Metallics"

AMS data have been critical to much of our understanding of aircraft PM emissions, but it has limited utility in probing the smallest (<100 nm) particles in the exhaust.  Also, to date the AMS has been able to detect only volatile PM and other instruments have been required to characterize the non-volatile (soot).  We propose to improve greatly the capabilities of a novel version of the AMS to cover two important gaps in our understanding of gas turbine engine particle emissions: 1) size resolved composition of particles with diameters less than 50 nm; 2) size resolved mass and chemical composition (e.g., fullerenic composition) of black carbon soot.  Specifically in Phase I, we aim to: 1) improve AMS detection of particles smaller than 100 nm by refining an existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and use the CFD model to guide the design of new AMS particle focusing designs, and 2) evaluate for model soot characterization a newly developed instrument which combines a laser ablation system with AMS technology  an instrument which we have termed the SP2-AMS.","NASA provides substantial potential commercial applications for an improved AMS technology.  NASA has a long-term commitment to understand and reduce the trace gas and particle emissions of gas turbine engines.  The current lack of robust composition information for nucleation particles smaller than 50 nm and the lack of direct, size-resolved mass measurements of soot limit current understanding.  We expect that NASA will be eager to take advantage of the advanced lens and laser ablation technologies that we will develop during this SBIR program.  NASA provides at least two types of commercial opportunities for advanced AMS technology: 1) direct instrument sales and 2) research contract jobs.  At this time, NASA has not purchased an AMS for its own use.  An improved lens technology and soot detection capability may provide the motivation for NASA to purchase an AMS.  Due in part to the unique insight provided by the standard AMS, we have been an active participant in a series of NASA sponsored PM measurement activities, including the APEX experiments.  Enhanced AMS technology will continue to make us an attractive NASA contractor for future measurement activities.","The general commercial applications of the improved AMS technology are extensive.  Engine manufacturers are currently seeking reliable methods that directly measure the mass of soot emissions; we anticipate strong interest from enigne manufacturers in the SP2-AMS technology, either for direct sales or for contracting opportunities.  US EPA and DOE have long-term commitments to understanding and reducing PM emissions and they are potential customers.  The chemical content of the SP2-AMS data set may differentiate aircraft soot from other sources.  The ability to distinguish aviation PM from other combustion sources would be of great interest to FAA and the airport community; their support will provide ample research contract opportunities.  Optimization of the aerodynamic lens technology for particles smaller than 100 nm will also enhance our field measurement capabilities and provide new opportunities in our emissions characterization business.  The new lens will also increase new sales of AMS technology and will be a stand-alone product for existing AMS owners.  Over the past 5 years, we have sold over 60 instruments to customers in industry, academia, and government laboratories.  Improved understanding of the lens performance may provide insight necessary to expand the range of particles detected by the AMS, which in turn will open new applications in pharmaceutical characterization and related fields.",Particle and Fields

This active control component will be capable of modulating fuel flow at multiple injection locations with minimum fuel pressure drop and thus enable critical improvements in aerospace vehicle turbine engine combustion dynamics, notably mitigation of thermo-acoustic instabilities. These instabilities have impeded development of advanced lean-burning combustors for reduction of NOx emissions and improvements in combustion efficiency. While passive approaches to control combustion instability have been successful on particular new engine designs, the ultimate solution is active combustion control where the greatest challenges are the bandwidth (1 kHz) and system temperature requirements. The Phase-I goal is to demonstrate that these are achievable by designing and building a proof-of-principle system complete with high-frequency, high-temperature actuator and valve. Active Signal has selected Terfenol as the most suitable actuator material and will apply 25 plus years of actuator, valve and pump experience to meet the goals. The system will be tested against pressure and flow requirements to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach before fabricating a prototype suitable for the GRC test stand in Phase II.","The NASA interest in this field is generic to the extent that it can cover ramjets air breathing jet engines rocket motors, etc.  Each has a similar challenge but the categories contained within engines with combustors will vary to the extent that they may well require unique control systems with actuator needs proper to each.  For instance, force and displacement requirements generated by pressure and flow requirements will imply actuator subsystemsthe focus of this proposalthat are unique.  This may well extend to frequency control  and temperature requirements that will vary, having implications for the designer.  At the same time, size, weight, and cost constraints will remain a significant factor set that a successful actuator designer teamed with a controls group can implement across a broad line of applications to build a business base with NASA.  Teamed with Moog, it is this approach that Active  Signal will pursue with NASA.","Active Signal will team with Moog for the principal part of its Non-NASA applications given the fact that Moog is active in the turbine fuel control markets for both aero (military and commercial) and ground based turbine applications.

This capability is very important due to the extreme scramjet operational environment, which makes cut-and-try development approaches impractical.  With UCDS, it is now possible to accurately predict the scramjet pressure oscillation amplitudes, along with critical parameters, including the unsteady wall heat flux. The UCDS tools were recently applied to the Ares I thrust oscillation issue in support of NASA's Thrust Oscillation Focus Team (TOFT).  This effort included the analysis of the Shuttle four segment solid rocket motor (RSRM) to validate the capabilities of UCDS.  After analyzing the new five segment (RSRMV) motor being developed for Ares I, GTL used the UCDS insight to identify a relatively minor motor modification that will eliminate the organized motor oscillations.With this validation of the capabilities and effectiveness of UCDS, GTL proposes to extend the application of UCDS by applying it to examine the stability characteristics of a representative scramjet.  In addition to predicting the amplitudes of the scramjet pressure oscillations, a UCDS sensitivity analysis will be used to identify critical design parameters and establish development guidelines.","Since the UCDS models are built from a general formulation, they can be used to analyze practically any combustion device, including rockets (liquid, solid, hybrid), turbojets (combustors, augmentors), ramjets, scramjets, combined cycle engines and so on.

The approach proposed is to simulate the distributed boom load on the structure using an array of discrete forces. The forces are applied sequentially making the approach effective and implementable in real structures. In addition, the method allows evaluating the contribution of individual structural components to the vibro-acoustic responses. The main goal of Phase I is to experimentally demonstrate the approach in a realistic environment.  Phase II efforts should involve the experimental validation of the proposed technology in a real house subjected to real sonic booms. Fortunately, this data set exists and corresponds to the latest field test performed by NASA at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) property. This will imply implementing the proposed method to the same house (preferred) or a similar one and use the outside pressure profile and direction to estimate the same vibro-acoustic responses measured by NASA in 2007. Comparison of the predicted and measured responses will provide the best validation of the approach. In support of this ""real"" validation of the method, a numerical model to better understand and improve the excitation methods should also be part of Phase II. At the conclusion of Phase II, it is expected that the method will be fully validated and ready for implementation on a range of structures for evaluating the human response to sonic booms as required by current industry needs. According to technology readiness levels (TRLs) guidelines, at the end of Phase II a TRL level of 6 would be achieved, i.e. system model/prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.","There is a clear increasing demand for supersonic commercial airplanes that can fly overland. This will be possible only if current restrictions are lifted. To this end, the human response inside buildings to the expected weak sonic boom will need to be accurately estimated. The proposed method here will provide a validated synthesis/auditory tool for the evaluation of human objection to these types of sonic booms in real structures.","There are a number of potential commercial opportunities for the technology proposed here.

However, the dynamic behavior of these structures at different frequency range is governed by different phenomena and as a result, a single numerical solution procedure is not suitable for the resolution of the entire frequency spectrum. Thus, on the basis of the numerical modeling techniques, the frequency spectrum is typically divided into three regions; low frequency region, mid-frequency region and high frequency region. The low frequency region is the frequency range where the characteristic dimensions of all component members of a vibroacoustic system are short with respect to wavelengths and these members are also referred to as 'short' members. On the other hand, in the high frequency region, the characteristic dimensions of all component members are long with respect to wavelengths and these members are referred to as 'long' members. There exists a broad mid frequency region in which not only some components are long and others are short with respect to wavelengths The proposal is directed towards the development of an innovative hybrid element method by coupling deterministic, transition and statistical Finite Element Methods to yield a solution system that is applicable for the solution of full frequency spectrum vibroacoustic prediction of nonuniform aerospace structures including metallic/composite configurations, accurately and efficiently.","The development of space vehicles and space stations requires the prediction of vibration levels to asses the fatigue life of critical components and noise levels to assess the comfort and functionality levels of crew members. The software product developed as part of the proposed project will enable NASA to effectively evaluate and apply noise and vibration control procedures spanning the entire frequency spectrum. It will also substantially reduce the effort involved in the design of products since the proposed development is based on finite element method that is already used extensively for low frequency noise and vibration analysis. Since low frequency (FEM), mid frequency (HEM) and high frequency (EFEM) analyses can be performed using mostly the same database, the modeling effort associated will be substantially reduced. The software will also enhance NASA's ability to evaluate the acoustic environment and resulting vibration in the payload bay of launch vehicle, diffuse sound field excitation on payloads during rocket launch and ground qualification, and structural integrity of airframe. Manufacturers of  aircraft engines and components will also find the software useful for analysis and design.","The proposed development will extend and enhance the computational modeling capabilities in many industries such as automotive, naval, heavy equipment and consumer products.  Customers equate quality of a product with the sound the product makes. As a result of elevated demand for quieter products from customers together with the increased government regulations, manufactures of products with noise problem in all industries are searching for effective ways to make products with improved noise characteristics. For example, in automotive industry, the increased use of multi-media and telemetric devices demands quieter vehicle interiors and the manufactures and suppliers of interior products not only need to consider functionality, but also the noise control capability of the products. Consequently, there is increasing demand for tools based on computer simulation that can be used to guide design at the early design stage.

Recent studies at Princeton have demonstrated the utility of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators for aerodynamic control.  Nanosecond pulse sustained DC driven DBDs are predicted to have much higher flow velocities than conventional control systems. Our initial work in the area discovered that these devices produce charge build-up on pulse sustained DC driven DBDs which has hindered the realization of this prediction.  If the charge build-up can be minimized, the DC driven DBDs have the potential for higher flow control efficiency than previously attainable with either AC or DC driven DBDs in laboratory experiments.  The proposed research will develop integrated surface structures that simultaneously optimize the DBD performance to take advantage of the pulse or RF sustained DC bias approach while suppressing the surface charge build up.  This success of this project will be critical for the development of a practical DBD actuator that can be implemented as a control device.","Important vehicle applications for transient operation of DBD devices include the enhancement of wing lift performance and reduction of stall probability during maneuvers, stall margin increase for high angle-of-attack slow flight (landing), enhanced performance of engine inlets under non-cruise conditions, initiation of transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and recovery from spin and other separation-related undesirable aerodynamic phenomena.  If separation control can be accomplished with little penalty in power, then operation can be continuous.  In such cases, contoured engine inlets may be designed with greater turning angles, higher lift may be achievable for in-flight operation, transition initiation or delay may be possible, and new methods for enhancement or suppression of shock induced separation may become practical.","Improved DBD technique with higher flow velocities than conventional control systems would be advantageous in many non-NASA commercial applications.  For example, this technique could be utilized in civil aviation where drag reduction plays a crucial role in designing new high performance airplanes. Application of the improved DBD technology in turbine blades will attract the commercial sector to design high efficiency turbines.  Other commercial applications of DBDs are as a source of ozone production and in medical applications where the weakly ionized plasma can be used to heal wounds.  DBD medical applications can find wide markets especially in military and defense industries.

Morphing aircraft, particularly unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), have thus received considerable attention in this respect.  Aside from safety and aerodynamic efficiency, a single morphing UAV platform could possess the ability to carry out multiple mission objectives.  Nearly all forms of conformal morphing vehicles have since been investigated, including twist, camber, span, and sweep, where simulation results showed the potential performance benefits that could be achieved.  It was not until recently that material and actuator technology had reached a point of development that allowed viable prototypes to be fabricated and tested, however.  Having successfully researched, designed, and evaluated supporting technologies, Techno-Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop an innovative morphing control surface system that is capable of in-plane (span extension) reconfiguration, sized and scaled for a candidate subsonic fixed-wing UAV platform.  This morphing system will make use of high performance, light weight actuators to articulate the shape change, a morphing core to provide structural support, and a flexible skin as a viable aerodynamic surface layer.  All components are custom-made in-house from COTS elements and have patents pending.  The proposed research plan will work to design the morphing system to fit inside the volumetric constraints of the host vehicle with the goal of increasing efficiency and maneuverability.  The Phase I program will end with prototype evaluations of a morphing wing section under representative loading.  Successful demonstration here will lead to integration with the UAV and a flight test in Phase II.","Throughout the Phase I effort, Techno-Sciences, Inc. will work in concert with NASA sponsors to ensure that the proposed morphing control surface technology can be seamlessly integrated with an existing and possible future unmanned air vehicles (UAVs).  These include standard runway take-off vehicles, catapult launched vehicles, and vertical take-off vehicles.  Typical UAV mission objectives include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), search and rescue (SAR) operations, and payload delivery, in addition to collecting meteorological and atmospheric measurements.  Aside from UAVs, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) also stand to benefit from this development.  Not related to vehicle technology, but another possible application area is that of deployable systems, where the honeycomb-like core could be contracted during stowage and expanded to deploy a payload, while also serving as a stabilizing and controllable frame.  To facilitate technology transfer, we will work in Phase I to address top-level hardware and software integration issues from a systems engineering perspective.  Issues such as control electronics, software architectures, hardware interfaces, manufacturability, ruggedness, and reliability will be considered in Phase I and implemented in Phase II of the program.","The morphing control surface system for improved flight performance characteristics will be applicable to a wide range of end-users in the defense, commercial, and industry sectors.  Its broad applicability is enabled by the custom-fabricated components.  More efficient control surfaces featuring chord/span extension and contraction and camber change are particularly attractive to the military.  Increased efficiency allows for longer missions to take place, whether they be mapping of unexploded ordnance, monitoring of assets, or other ISR-related tasks.  Other applications include supporting mine detection, biochemical weapons cleanup, and operations in other hazardous environments or rough terrain.  Additionally, research in biomimetics and reconfigurable dwellings are other opportunities for application.  It should be emphasized that while the proposed development focuses on a small UAV, the enabling technologies are scalable to larger craft using established design laws and material selection criteria.  Overall, the proposed technology will be an integrated hardware/software product that can be licensed for manufacture.

Hypersonic flight poses a wide array of difficulties, including significant guidance and control challenges.  For example, flexible airframes and highly integrated airframe and propulsion systems common in scramjet designs mean that aerodynamic and propulsion control are closely coupled.  Control laws for hypersonic vehicles must also handle a very broad range of dynamics as hypersonic vehicles often operate from subsonic through hypersonic speeds and possibly with multiple propulsion modes for different speed ranges.  Actuator saturation and significant models uncertainty also pose control challenges, and demanding energy management requirements make guidance and trajectory optimization challenging tasks as well.  The proposed research will develop innovative control strategies to address the challenges of hypersonic flight.  These will be based on recent advances in switching control methods that provide large stable regions and disturbance rejection guarantees in the presence of actuator saturation.  The proposed control methods will ultimately be integrated with advanced guidance approaches for hypersonic vehicles developed by Barron Associates.","The proposed guidance and control approaches will help to facilitate successful hypersonic flight.  Reaching and returning from orbit both involve hypersonic flight, and hypersonic flight is therefore essential to NASA's mission, which traditionally includes space access and exploration.  In particular, hypersonic flight is an integral part the Highly Reliable Reusable Launch Systems (HRRLS) program and the High Mass Mars Entry Systems (HMMES) program.  The HRRLS program calls for air-breathing horizontal takeoff/horizontal landing launch vehicles to provide reliable and cost effective access to space.  The HMMES program is closely related to the strategic goals set by the President, which include manned exploration of Mars.  Supporting humans on Mars will require landing of higher mass cargo than has been previously attempted, and targeting this cargo more precisely.  The HMMES program addresses these needs, and advanced guidance and control techniques will be critical to the success of the program.","With the significant recent interest in commercial space access and enhanced military space access, control technology for hypersonic vehicles has the potential for significant non-NASA applications.  Several private companies are currently working to provide commercial space launch capabilities.  For example, Orbital Sciences has several commercial launch vehicles and has conducted a number of successful launches already, and SpaceX has made several launch attempts in recent years.  As these and other companies field the next generation of launch vehicles, improved guidance and control technology will be of interest.  The rapid mission planning capabilities currently being developed by Barron under other funding, combined with the highly robust inner-loop control approach to be developed under the proposed research should have significant appeal to these organizations.  Technology for rapid and robust access to space will also serve the goals of the military to rapidly deploy surveillance assets and to conduct rapid long range strikes.","Controls-Structures Interaction (CSI); Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Launch and Flight Vehicle"

For example, on the UH-60M, the weight of the current vibration systems is about 270 lbs.  On the MH-60S the vibration control weight is about 400 lbs. Similar weight savings will likely be accrued for tiltrotors including the heavy lift tiltrotor being pursued by the Army and NASA Ames.

Significant rotorcraft problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved in order to understand the underlying physics. Often these unsteady pressures are difficult to resolve in the rotating frame due to difficult installation of pressure transducers, and data is available only at discrete points. Pressure-sensitive paint formulations have been developed to provide surface pressure information in situations such as this, but conventional PSP formulations have slow response times. Conventional skin friction measurements, for example oil flow, do not offer significant frequency response. In order to improve the frequency response characteristics of PSP, sprayed porous paint binders have been developed for measurement of unsteady pressures. Fast-responding Surface Stress Sensitive Films provide both quantitative skin friction and qualitative flow visualization measurements. These techniques can provide high-spatial-resolution, time-resolved pressure and skin friction information that will provide unparalleled insight into the physical mechanisms driving certain rotorcraft problems. Both of these techniques will be demonstrated in Ohio State's unique 6""x22"" transonic wind tunnel, where an airfoil may be tested for dynamic stall simulation in compressible flow. Successful demonstration of fast-responding PSP and S3F on a dynamic stall test in the 6""x22"" tunnel will serve as a proof of concept that will allow transition of the technologies into larger-scale wind tunnels at NASA and elsewhere.","Distributed measurements of skin friction and pressure are of significant interest in a variety of fields including aeronautical and bio-medical engineering. ISSI is currently pursuing commercial applications in these fields by demonstrating skin friction and pressure measurements on aerodynamic models, micro-channels, artificial heart models, and contact force measurements such as force distribution under a foot. In the aeronautical community, the skin friction and pressure measurements offered by this technique are essential for the validation of CFD codes and the design of low Reynolds number airfoils for micro air vehicles.","Non NASA commercial applications of this technology are mostly in the bio-medical field where measurements of skin friction are essential to the design of artificial implants to minimize the occurrence of clotting. Also with respect to contact force measurements, ISSI has developed a sensor based on the S3F technology which is being used to study the effect of shear and on diabetic ulceration in feet. In conjunction with these proof of concept tests, ISSI has recently developed a commercial Pressure Sensitive Paint system.

Such expectations are amplified in the VIP market where people are used in the acoustic and vibration levels of civil and executive jets.  One of the most critical excitations for interior noise in helicopters is the one from the gearbox.   Thus, the structure-borne noise path (i.e. excitation propagating from mounting locations through the fuselage structure to the panels of the cabin and to the interior) must be captured in rotorcraft interior noise computations.  This proposal addresses the need stated in the solicitation for developing physics based tools that can be used within a multi-disciplinary design-analysis-optimization for computing interior noise in rotorcraft applications.  The hybrid FEA method can be used for structure-borne helicopter applications and can be integrated very easily (due to the finite element based model) with models from other disciplines within a multidisciplinary design environment.  During the Phase I project the main focus will be in demonstrating the feasibility of the hybrid FEA technology for computing rotorcraft structure-borne interior noise from gearbox excitation.  A multi-discipline optimization rotorcraft case study will also be performed for demonstrating how the hybrid FEA facilitates the design of a rotorcraft fuselage based on simultaneous crash landing/passenger safety and structure-borne noise considerations.  The new developments will become part of MES' commercial EFEA code and of its implementation within SOL400 of NASTRAN.  UTRC will participate in the proposed effort for ensuring relevance of the work to rotorcraft interests and for providing technical consultancy.","Structural-acoustic concerns are present in rotorcraft, aircraft, and launch vehicles, since they are directly related with occupant comfort, and noise induced vibration on payloads and electronic equipment.  In all of these areas simulations are utilized during design.  Currently, structural-borne paths are difficult to address, particularly in rotorcraft applications due to the nature of the excitation and the physics of the rotorcraft structure.  Bringing structure-borne noise simulations within a multidisciplinary design environment will enable the evaluation of advanced concepts and offer cost and weight savings.  Therefore, the proposed developments will be useful to all NASA groups interested in reducing weight and cost when designing rotorcraft, aircraft, and launch vehicles.","Structure-borne interior noise concerns are present in the shipbuilding, the automotive, the military ground vehicle, and heavy construction equipment industries since structural-acoustic performance is directly related with the perceived product quality, occupant comfort, and health regulations.

Accurate prediction of rotorcraft noise is directly related to the ability to predict the highly complicated interaction between the aerodynamic surfaces and their wakes, and while current numerical tools can, in principle, model the complete rotorcraft, they are severely hampered by modeling assumptions or numerical formulation.  Consequently, commonly used tools fail to adequately predict the load distribution, and hence noise, of arbitrarily shaped rotors and fuselages.  The proposed effort directly supports NASA's mission of assisting the development of advanced rotorcraft by developing an innovative physics-based multidisciplinary tool for predicting rotorcraft aeroacoustics.  This tool, consisting of a fully coupled FUN3D CFD code, VorTran-M module and acoustic propagation model, will be able to address interactional aeroacoustics problems unique to rotorcraft, capturing rotor-fuselage interactions that lead to both structural vibration and undesirable interactional acoustics.  This effort will build upon recent work addressing critical issues such as numerical diffusion, grid generation, turbulence modeling and rotorcraft noise prediction and reduction at CDI, GIT and elsewhere.  The hybrid code will achieve TRL=4 during Phase I and TRL=7-8 by the end of Phase II.","The proposed effort directly supports NASA's Subsonic Rotary Wing Fundamental Aeronautics Program goals by leveraging emerging research into first-principles multidisciplinary technologies for simulating advanced rotorcraft configurations.  This system will incorporate validated NASA design and analysis tools with CDI's novel VorTran-M low diffusion CFD wake module and an acoustic propagation model to create a hybrid system for the development and aerodynamic/aeroacoustic evaluation of manned and unmanned rotorcraft.  A critically important result of this effort would be cost savings associated with the reduction in resources required to setup (i.e. grid generation) and perform adequate aeroacoustic predictions, as well as the ability of NASA rotorcraft design practitioners to exploit the large amount of NASA research into aerodynamic design and optimization that has previously been exclusive to the fixed-wing community.  Moreover, this system will also support interest within NASA in vorticity dominated flows, such as bluff body (i.e. unsteady vortex shedding from the shuttle and other rockets when sitting on the launch pad), aircraft in landing configurations and wake vortex hazards.","A successful SBIR effort would produce a fully-validated physics-based multidisciplinary tool for rotorcraft performance and external noise analysis that directly addresses the failings of current methods.  This tool could significantly diminish the cost and risk of new designs by reducing the need to perform tests and modifications (i.e. the evolution of the AH-64 empennage from T-tail to cruciform configuration) to ensure both mission suitability and public acceptance.  Thus beyond direct commercial gain to CDI, the tool will provide a large indirect commercial benefit to the government and to the rotorcraft community at large.  While CDI cannot market FUN3D directly, significant commercialization is anticipated from licensing the VorTran-M module to rotorcraft manufacturers and government branches involved in rotorcraft development/support.  Further interest would come from organizations that routinely use CFD to analyze vortex-dominated flows such as meteorology, submarine and ship wakes, building and vehicle aerodynamics.

A flight-deck automation experimental prototype will provide the platform for simulating the designs. The findings will benefit future designs of flight-deck automation systems, as well as tower automation systems which rely on accurate understanding of the flight deck's operational behaviors to plan efficient and safe operations for the entire surface traffic.","The proposed research contributes directly to trajectory-based surface operations (TBSO), which constitute an important area of research being pursued by the NextGen-Airportal Project under NASA's Airspace Systems Program. The research will produce realistic and favorable surface 4D trajectory designs to enable TBSO. Sharing these design models with the control tower will allow its automation system to plan safe and efficient operations, and enhance separation assurance by using the models to infer intent when monitoring the traffic movements.","Whereas NASA's NextGen-Airportal Project investigates innovative new technologies, approaches, and procedures to enable capacity enhancements within the airport and terminal domains to meet the JPDO NextGen capacity goals, products from the proposed research will contribute to this cause. The research findings will strengthen the understanding of flight-deck automation potentials for trajectory-based surface operations (TBSO) to help avionics companies design and develop flight control systems that enable such operations. Knowledge of the flight-deck automation will also help developers of air traffic management systems develop control tower automation to realize the full potential of the TBSO concepts. NASA research products, including the technologies envisioned from the proposed research, can be transferred to the FAA through the Research Transition Teams (RTT) set up between NASA and the FAA, to promote transition of these products to real-world applications and acceptance.","Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Pilot Support Systems; Simulation Modeling Environment"

Improvements to current methods of spacing aircraft could significantly increase airportal capacity, but there is currently limited awareness of wake encounters and information with which to assess spacing in real-time or to design new spacing schemes.  AeroTech proposes to improve situational awareness of wake vortices and enhance the prediction of wake vortex transport and decay by developing an In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS).  The VEDARS will quantitatively detect wake encounters using flight data; downlink encounter reports in real-time to enhance ATC awareness and enable assessment of spacing schemes; and collect and report meteorological parameters from aircraft for use in wake transport and decay predictions.  Additionally, the VEDARS software can process historical flight data to identify prior wake encounters and assess spacing for a given weather day at an airportal.  Phase I will develop and test the VEDARS methodology and algorithms, and perform a feasibility assessment.  By the end of Phase II, the VEDARS will have been both ground and flight tested, and will be enhancing wake awareness.","When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, the In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS) will directly support NASA's NextGen-Airportal project goal to realize an airportal environment that will achieve the highest possible throughput and operational efficiency, while balancing safety and environmental requirements.  VEDARS will support the Safe and Efficient Surface Operations and Coordinated Arrival and Departure Operations Management (CADOM) focus areas by enhancing researchers' awareness of wake encounters; supporting the assessment and optimization of aircraft separation schemes; providing data that assists in the characterization of wake transport and decay; and providing a capability for simulations that can be used to assess airportal operations and procedures within various weather conditions and airfield layouts.  The VEDARS will also support NASA's research efforts under the JPDO in NextGen Super Density Arrival/Departure Operations and Trajectory-Based Operations.","AeroTech's In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS) will provide benefits to both research efforts and real-time situational awareness of wake vortices.  The VEDARS will enable the FAA Wake Vortex Program and other commercial researchers to assess historical spacing schemes through identification of wake encounters from historical flight data, and develop new techniques for various airfield configurations.  Real-time implementation of the VEDARS on aircraft and within wake vortex spacing systems will enhance controller's awareness of wake encounters and their decision making regarding the current separation distances.  Additionally, the meteorological information provided can be incorporated into wake transport and decay predictions to assess real-time safety issues for parallel runway operations.

Although LIDAR systems have been used to measure wake vortex strength and position in NASA and FAA measurement campaigns and too little is known about their accuracy in quantifying location and strength in different regimes. Field data analysis suggests that strength may be commonly overestimated compared to theoretical models, but no study has been conducted to determine the validity and accuracy of the sensing techniques to determine these estimates.   Additionally, these uncertainties cannot be determined since no other remote sensing system has been verified to accurately measure and characterize the wake vortices.  A risk with no quantitative assessment is that it may negatively impact the separation standards.Aerospace Innovations, LLC proposes to design and develop a physics-based Monte Carlo LIDAR Simulation and Visualization (LiSiVi) Tool to provide NASA and industry researchers the ability to accurately model the performance of LIDAR based wake vortex sensing systems.  The significance of this innovation is that it combines the advancement of knowledge in the wake vortex modeling research and the laser technology areas.",The potential NASA commercial application exists in aeronautics and sensors research.  LIDAR sensors are being considered for remote detection of wake vortices in the National Airspace System both in the terminal area and en route.  NASA Langley researchers could use this tool in their current work in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Project to evaluate and assess current and candidate LIDAR systems for their ability to accurately measure wake vortices.  No simulation tool is commercially available to provide the comprehensive modeling and analysis capabilities that LIDAR Simulation and Visualization Tool will be able to provide.,"As laser technology advances, companies interested in developing LIDAR sensors for wake vortex, turbulence, and other atmospheric phenomena could use LiSiVi Tool to help conduct parametric studies for the design of their LIDAR sensor system.

One key component to these ground based test facilities are the force balances used to measure aerodynamic loads on models undergoing characterization and testing. NASA currently maintains an inventory of balances that were designed for previous models and operating ranges that may not be as relevant to current test conditions. Project resources do not always allow a balance to be designed for specific testing applications due to the associated costs and schedule. Luna Innovations is proposing to develop new and innovative force balance technology that will reduce the cost of facility instrumentation and allow for reduced design and instrumentation time, while providing more accurate and reliable results when compared to current balances. This development utilizes proven fiber optic sensor technology that integrates active thermal compensation with a miniaturized, highly accurate, multi-channel sensing network. The versatile operating range of this technology with respect to temperatures and loading conditions, combined with a high channel count data processing system designed by Luna, will provide advanced measurement capabilities for NASA facilities and enable accurate testing of emerging propulsion and transport technologies.","The implementation of fiber optic technology into a 6-component force balance will enable improved accuracy in aerodynamic measurements made across NASA facilities under a variety of test conditions at a reduced cost when compared to traditional, electrically instrumented balances. Operating at a reduced cost will allow more extensive testing of design features and system level designs in support of the next generation CEV, Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), and advanced propulsion systems. The reduced machining and instrumentation cost of the balances themselves will also enable individual designs to be completed for specific models at a scale that was previously not feasible due to project resource limitations. The versatile operating ranges of this technology will also reduce the design time as the limits of aerodynamic testing are extended. This technology will demonstrate itself as being vital to increasing the future design and testing capabilities of NASA.","While NASA is the leader in fundamental research for advancing aerospace technology within the United States, commercial entities are also working to advance the state-of-the-art in high and low-speed propulsion, flight vehicles, and fundamental aerospace sciences. Key to verification of computer simulations is the ability to cost effectively obtain data under ground based simulated flight conditions. The technology developed during this project will enable commercial air and spacecraft developers to obtain vital data which will improve vehicle design, safety, and efficiency.   In addition, the strain gauges and system developed during this program will also be applicable across industry to all harsh-environment applications in which electrical gauges cannot survive. Fiber optic gauges provide a miniature, non-intrusive EMI-resistant method of accurately measuring strain and temperature.

This technique can operate over a range of temperatures from cryogenic (160 K, -113aC) to well above ambient (470 K, 197aC). The operation of the sensor is based on the deformations of an elastic film that distorts under the action of the applied normal and tangential loads. Skin friction and pressure gradients are determined by monitoring these distortions and applying a finite element model to the film. Quantitative measurements of skin friction and pressure have been demonstrated on aerodynamic models from 10-m/s to Mach 5. Among these tests was an experiment that included S3F on one side of the model and PSP on the other side. Data from each sensor was acquired simultaneously, thus demonstrating the compatibility of the S3F with existing PSP hardware. Tunnels with existing PSP systems could be upgraded to include skin friction capability. The opportunity to develop this sensor system for measurements of skin friction in production facilities, including cryogenic tunnels as well as tunnels with operating temperatures up to 200C, is recognized and this is the focus of this proposal.","Distributed measurements of skin friction and pressure are of significant interest in a variety of fields including aeronautical and bio-medical engineering. ISSI is currently pursuing commercial applications in these fields by demonstrating skin friction and pressure measurements on aerodynamic models, micro-channels, artificial heart models, and contact force measurements such as force distribution under a foot. In the aeronautical community, the skin friction and pressure measurements offered by this technique are essential for the validation of CFD codes and the design of low Reynolds number airfoils for micro air vehicles.","Non NASA commercial applications of this technology are mostly in the bio-medical field where measurements of skin friction are essential to the design of artificial implants to minimize the occurrence of clotting. Also with respect to contact force measurements, ISSI has developed a sensor based on the S3F technology which is being used to study the effect of shear and on diabetic ulceration in feet. In conjunction with these proof of concept tests, ISSI has recently developed a commercial Pressure Sensitive Paint system. The components of the skin friction technology have been developed to be compatible with this commercially deployed system and therefore, extension of these systems to include skin friction measurements is offered as a system upgrade.

In addition to real world cueing (vestibular, visual, aural, environmental, etc.), flight test provides intangibles that can not yet be duplicated in a ground-based simulator. There is, however, a cost to be paid for the benefits of flight in terms of budget, mission complexity, and safety including the need for ground and control room personnel, additional aircraft, etc. New technologies and test techniques are therefore needed to maximize the investments and perhaps even reduce some of the related costs associated with flight test. Systems Technology, Inc. proposes to develop a Fused Reality (FR) system that will allow an animated virtual environment to be integrated with the test aircraft so that tasks such as aerial refueling, formation flying, or air-to-air tracking can be accomplished without additional aircraft resources. Furthermore, for the first time, the dynamic motions of the simulated objects (e.g., refueling drogue or tanker) can be directly correlated with the test aircraft. The FR system will allow real-time observation of and manual interaction with the cockpit environment that serves as a frame for the virtual out-the-window scene.","Following the successful completion of a Phase 2 in-flight evaluation program, a prototype FR-based flight test system will be ready to transition into a commercially viable product. The FR system will have potential applications for NASA, other government agencies, and commercial aviation. For NASA this product will directly address the stated need for highly innovative and more efficient flight test techniques. FR will reduce the need for specific aircraft that are costly and often difficult to schedule. Critical flight test evaluation tasks involving other aircraft and related dynamic elements can still be conducted in a safe and repeatable manner.","For other government agencies, specifically the DoD, a FR-based flight test system will find new uses in addition to those identified for NASA. These include; target tracking of simulated enemy aircraft and/or ground targets, interaction of test aircraft with unmanned aerial vehicles, mission training and rehearsal, degraded visibility for all aircraft or brownout training for rotorcraft, etc. For commercial aviation, a FR-based flight test system can be used for advanced training involving up-and-away collision avoidance, poor visibility approach and landings, runway incursions, etc. Finally, potential applications for all areas include in-flight synthetic vision. Here, the entire cockpit window area can be a virtual HUD where symbology/objects are superimposed on the actual out-of-the-window scene.

It was designed for space missions, and in particular is designed to implement in low power hardware. This solicitation calls for creating a hardware solution capable of decoding 16-bit image samples from this format, called in this document the ""CCSDS"" image format, at the rate of 640 Mbps, presumably for ground based image acquisition systems. Cybernet teaming with University of Dayton Research Institute proposes to design and build a FPGA based hardware image decoder capable of decoding 16-bit samples with a rate at least 640 Mbps, which, given the specifics of the image specification, is completely feasible. Dr. Chris Lomont at Cybernet is currently PI on a project implementing precisely the CCSDS 122.0-B-1 specification and transcoding algorithms for a NASA Phase II SBIR, and is intimately familiar with the format. This coupled with Cybernet's long history of designing and delivering hardware solutions makes us a perfect fit for this project.","NASA has a large investment in low-bandwidth image transmission, and is furthering this with their CCSDS lossy image compression format. The specification is finalized, and in order to become really useful there needs to be a fast decoding solution for receiving data from space. This hardware can be designed and built by Cybernet for low cost, which can then be deployed throughout NASA for dealing with data coming back from satellites.

Multiple NASA, government, and commercial programs plan to use the Ka-band due to its large capacity and flexible scheduling relative to other bands such as S, X, and Ku.  Current digital communications systems have become increasingly adept at managing degraded channel conditions using robust FEC codes and strategies such as adaptive or variable coding and modulation (ACM/VCM).  These strategies do not adequately address long burst error conditions on the order of 100,000 symbols.  Existing FEC codes of up to 16,000 symbols are inadequate.  New methods to address this fast fade or burst error condition must be considered.

We will leverage our extensive experience in developing electrically small, flexible, wearable, radiators to create unobtrusive antennas that are compatible with the UHF frequency band for NASA lunar or Mars exploration missions.  The key innovations of our proposed research effort are the development of several new technologies: small radiator technology based on slow-wave engineering principles; efficient, small Electromagnetic Bandgap structures; and the integration of these technologies with diversity techniques to create an efficient body wearable antenna platform suitable for EMU integration.  Our new technology will provide an unobtrusive, high performance body wearable radiating platform that will facilitate the next generation of astronaut RF communication systems.  Throughout this effort rigorous, full-wave electromagnetic simulation tools will be used to predict the performance of the new concepts and the resulting antennas will be fabricated and tested in our measurement facilities.","The Pharad efficient, compact body-worn antenna technology is being developed specifically to improve astronaut communications.  The reduced size and enhanced performance of this new antenna technology will be able to directly improve the RF characteristics and link performance of astronaut EVA communications.  Current astronaut antennas are either relatively electrically large or have minimal gain.  In addition, antennas that are poorly interfaced to the astronaut's spacesuit and gear can hinder an astronaut's mobility and thus their ability to accomplish their mission.

Also, the ability to provide fire fighters with the capability to carry out hands-free communications without the need for obtrusive antennas helps to realize a safer communications system for such emergency personnel.

The requirements are a low phase noise RF output concurrently with a rugged, reliable, small, power efficient, and frequency tuning ability. VIDA Products has developed technology that will ultimately enable an integrated circuit YIG oscillator with high Q resonators and low power consumption that fills these requirements. The high Q YIG resonators are made possible by quantum electron spin precession and are essentially lossless. In general, a resonator is realized by a YIG sphere RF magnetic fields coupling to the oscillator circuit structure.  A bias magnetic field on the spheres at a right angle to the coupling field vector sets the frequency of operation. It is a linear function of exactly 2.8 MHz per Gauss. Its equivalent electrical circuit is composed of circuit elements unrealizable by finite components that vary over frequency so the filter bandwidth does not change with tuned frequency. Thus the Q increases with frequency since a definition of Q is the tuned frequency divided by the bandwidth. For oscillators using these resonators the phase noise is excellent and continues to perform as the oscillation frequency increases. The Resonant Ring Oscillator topology is easily realizable using MMIC technology to reduce a YIG based oscillator to a single IC with the ability to produce external fields of the correct vectors and path losses.  To make use of this phenomenon, a proprietary circuit utilizing leakage shielding and frequency locking will control the magnetic bias field and be integrated in the UO IC. The result will be a Universal Oscillator that can be produced to operate at any frequency between 3 and 30 GHz at cost equivalent to current VCO technology but with 30 to 40 dBc improvement in phase noise performance. Completing the development of this technology now will save immeasurable resources.","The Universal Oscillator will invaluable in communications and sensors such as ADC. It can be used for both fixed frequency clock oscillators and multi-octave tunable receivers and transmit exciters. This capability has never existed before and will make profound changes in systems design. When used to clock the latest ADC developments, direct digital radios operating above 15 GHz will be possible. Sensor accuracy will provide the tools for the next generation of earth atmospheric monitoring satellites to provide exact information to gain control of Global Warming. The versatility of the Universal Oscillator will provide redundancy for deep space application since several clocks can be reconfigured as necessary for the task at hand. High-speed computers will also more reliable when utilizing low jitter clocks. The recent advances in SiGe bipolar transistor frequency dividers can be used with GHz clocks to generate most of the lower frequencies improving phase noise by 6 dB per octave of division.","The Universal Oscillator is extremely scalable in production and can be made in quantities and for cost equivalent to the current cell phones. The improved phase noise performance has potential to revolutionize WiMax of the future in that the number of users in a zone does not impact the data speed. The application of cognitive radios is waiting for the existence of hardware to permit reconfiguration of the radio links and the Universal Oscillator is able to supply that ""missing piece"" of the puzzle. Robotics needs sensors that are not jammed by neighboring signals from other nearby source, for example other robots. The low phase noise means that adjacent channels can be clean of interfering signals.

The architecture is based on mapping key Radio DSP operations onto clusters of 2D-Grid networks of primitive computation agents. The primitives in each cluster consists of multiply, accumulate and CORDIC operations. RISC agents and a primary RISC provide for reconfigurability. All agents are individually accessible for testing and configuration. The reconfigurable radio trades throughput for power by turning off primitive agents, using subsets of agents and routing links. Key agents that require SEU immunity for robust operation are identified and registers are implemented with Rad Hard temporal latch technology. The radio is reconfigurable for both beamforming and open-loop MIMO-OFDM operation with variable length FFTs to meet throughput/range requirements. The chip area and power is drastically reduced by maximum reuse of primitive agents by taking advantage of orthogonality between DSP operations. In Phase-II an NoC with support for 4x4 MIMO-OFDM will be synthesized on IBM 90nm process using Rad Hard agents and routing links that can be reconfigured for 4x1,4x2 and 4x4 MIMO-OFDM and single carrier operation, including FPGA emulation.","The proposed reconfigurable NoC radio has the advantage that it is based on networks of primitive agents that are arranged in clusters that match the mapping of complex high performance communications signal processing signal flows to the architecture. The key algorithm mapped to the architecture is 4x4 and 4x5 MIMO OFDM systems. Therefore, the system can encompass high throughput demands and at the same time by shutting down primitive agents and their routes the system can scale down power and throughput. In addition, damaged agents can be identified and isolated. This system, therefore, can serve the needs of access points and basestations in the main planetary or lunar lander and at the same time meet the requirements for  low power and range of rovers or outposts communicating with the lander. The architecture supports long term operation of the devices with self repair in hazardous conditions. The support for maximum diversity using 4x1 beamforming allows the rover to use a single antenna yet achieve very long range and reduced power. The mapping of MIMO-OFDM with pilot tracking also allows communication through turbulent ionospheric conditions and combating Doppler shift. The system can be deployed in low orbit satellites communicating with planetary landers and rovers and meet the radiation hardening requirements of space born applications.","The reconfigurable NoC based radio has a huge commercial application and will directly compete with successful array based reconfigurable radios in the MIMO-OFDM basestation market in cellular and MAN and LAN  applications. The proposed architecture results in reduced time to tapeout for an enhancement in design to keep up with the high throughput demands of the emerging 3GPP LTE and 4G cellular markets. In particular, the architecture presents a highly adaptable baseband processor for the RF front end so that the device can be upgraded through firmware as progress is made in the RF front end, or as more receive and transmit chains are added. The fact that a single chip can serve both the requirements of the basestation and the mobile subscriber is a huge plus in the cellular and WAN/LAN market and it drives up demand and volume for the device.

Traditional RF links suffer 1/r2 losses, resulting in low received power, thereby limiting overall data rates. NASA has recognized optical links offer potential improvements in power and in size due to a substantially narrower beam and smaller components. An ideal technology for such links is a laser transmitter master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) using pulse position modulation techniques.  Previous work has demonstrated laser transmitter MOPAs up to 100 MHz with wall plug efficiencies up to 18.9% and operating at 1064nm which requires bulky optical components.

The flexible beam path and distributed thermal dissipation make fiber lasers ideal  for many applications, especially CW ones, and for this reason fiber lasers have made significant inroads into many CW based laser markets such as material processing and long pulse laser marking.  Pulsed fiber lasers have not been successful in penetrating laser markets due the adverse effects of fiber non-linearities on pulse width, and non-linear optical generation efficiency.  At peak powers in the 100's of kW, SRS and SBS play a destructive role in widening pulses and lowering peak powers.  A well designed MOPA structure can alleviate many of these problems. The narrow pulse width and fast rise times of the MOPA system create opportunities for temporal pulse shaping and multi-pulse operation.

Thirdly, for orbit access networks, a dynamic delay and disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) routing protocol is designed by integrating DTN and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) reactive routing. It is disruption tolerant and capable of supporting intermittent links. Finally, beacon based communications serve as the remedy to handle the emergent situation where neither lunar surface network nor orbit access is available.","The proposed technologies can support lunar exploration and will be used to provide lunar surface networking and robust orbit access networks. Similar application scenario can be found even in Earth environment, where the surface network will be on the Earth surface and the orbit access will be from Earth to its satellite. The same technologies can be applied to the explorations of other stars like Mars and also to any deep-space communication networks. They will become critical building blocks of Inter-Planetary Internet.","The same technologies can be adapted to DoD applications. For example, a communication network formed by both planes and ground battling units is similar to the integrated system of lunar surface networks and orbit access. On the non-government market, the most promising application areas will be IEEE 802.11 mesh networks, IEEE 802.16 mesh networks, and their integrated systems. The technologies will draw tremendous attentions from service providers, chipset companies, and networking software companies. The hierarchical architecture and routing protocol for IEEE 802.11 and 802.16 mesh networks will provide viable solutions for service providers to deploy cost-effective and reliable wireless mesh networks. The dynamic DTN routing protocol will also find good applications in system integration between satellite communications and wireless mesh networks.","Architectures and Networks; Computer System Architectures; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Highly-Reconfigurable; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Pilot Support Systems; RF; Tools"

New Braunfels, Suite 603, San Antonio, TX 78217 - 3586",(281) 461-7884,,,,,,3 to 4,"With the advent of the new exploration initiative, the number of customers and missions to be supported by the NASA Space Communications infrastructure will increase dramatically. As well, new antenna types to be developed in support of exploration will increase, thus increasing the complexity of constraints governing the use of space communications assets.  In a new concept,  the communications architecture will evolve from the present legacy assets but with the addition of new assets.  This future architecture will need a radically new user interface paradigm that must allow space communications missions to both unequivocally specify their requests and also iteratively get those requests integrated with those of other users in increasingly crowded bandwidths. It is our contention that such an interface cannot be developed easily with conventional means, but instead is best designed using intelligent agent technologies, resulting in an intelligent space communications scheduling agent for each user/mission. Therefore, to meet the increased scheduling needs we propose to:  design and develop software scheduling agents to interface with existing space communications scheduling engines, using local working databases of active schedule possibilities; to incorporate in the agents models of user preferences for communications requests, conflict resolution and notification of schedule changes; to allow the user/mission to vary the autonomy of the scheduling agent; and to imbue the agents with the capability for planful interactions for peer-to-peer resolution of schedule conflicts.","Scheduling is a primary enterprise at NASA and the new exploration initiative will only increase the need for efficient interactive scheduling.   Besides space communications, we also see potential applications to assist geographically distributed users to schedule time on NASA's orbital and ground based telescopes.   Mission planning is at the core of all space missions due to the high cost of space assets such as astronauts, equipment and communication links.  Our new agent services, connected with planning engines,  will have applications across many NASA programs, from Mission Control to on-board NASA vehicles and outposts, especially for EVA planning. With the new exploration initiative, EVA mission planning and scheduling will increase dramatically  from an EVA every few months to one or two a day, and that will increase the need to integrate science and exploration training tasks into a coherent EVA plan/schedule. We also expect applications of our technology to immediately impact NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP), in particular, the Automation for Operations (A4O) managed at NASA ARC, which is investigating automated planning and scheduling to enhance spacecraft operations.","The military has a number of arenas wherein tasks are requested of limited availability assets.  Examples are the Air Force Satellite Control Network (FSCN) and the defense intelligence use of high altitude aircraft and special operations surveillance assets.  The needs of the user/missions of these assets are similar and would benefit from the application of our enhanced DCI technology. The military is also currently a large customer for unmanned vehicle operations. Unmanned vehicles, both air and ground, are becoming more and more common in battlefield  situations. As these unmanned vehicles are increasingly deployed in tandem with dismounted forces, coordinating software will be necessary to ensure successful operations. In particular, unmanned surveillance vehicles, are becoming more and more common in battlefield  situations as evidenced in Iraq and Afghanistan. As these unmanned vehicles are increasingly deployed, scheduling their use by an increasing number of users will require the kind of distributed agent systems described in this proposal.  Mission planning will also play a large role in integrated manned and unmanned operations. Distributed planning and control systems will serve to better merge competing user needs to accomplish military missions. Finally, non-military applications include distributed scheduling of aircraft in municipal airports, trains and other transportation systems, as well as factory production lines.",Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Database Development and Interfacing; Human-Computer Interfaces

The system for launch surveillance/intrusion detection is based on a network of uncooled long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imagers with associated Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors and magnetic compass heading indicators, integrated into a small  package which can be deployed on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), balloons or blimps, and fixed towers.  Infrared imagers are chosen for their day/night and all-weather capability and because recent advances in uncooled technology has allowed the price of these sensors to become low enough for fielding a relatively large number of imagers in a cost effective manner. These LWIR sensors and integrated instrumentation will provide for the remote detection, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded into areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. In order to achieve accurate identification, the time and position of potential intrusions will be recorded in a ""track file"" for each detection incidence.  Data fusion techniques will fuse tracks from various sensors into a single track when possible, and objects will be tracked with multi-target tracking techniques as necessary. This will require the use of encrypted communication, so track data and associated intruder imagery from individual sensors can be combined at a centralized control station as a fused track file. In the cases where intrusions are deemed security risks, further action can be undertaken, such as deployment of a small UAV to the intrusion site for real time observation, while range control and security evaluate the situation.","Prioria and its partners will provide a low cost, rapidly deployable, multi-platform sensor surveillance network to remotely monitor controlled areas and detect intruding entities. The network defines a perimeter and provides surveillance capability for a controlled area, which may consist of land, sea, and/or near-ground air. The system consists of an interconnected autonomous sensor network of fixed towers, static balloons, and mobile UAVs. The primary NASA application for this system is for range monitoring and access control during launch and landing operations. Intruders are targeted and tracked by the sensor network, and target tracking data is provided to a ground control station.  A human operator will determine the appropriate course of action for tracked targets.  The proposed sensor network improves security of the range by automating target detection within the controlled area. Operational costs are minimized by using low cost, small size, low power system components and by limiting human interaction to reported target tracking data.","Both the proposed system in entirety and the constituent innovations have non-NASA commercialization potential.  The largest potential customer is the U.S. Government, and the individual innovations produced in this proposal can give Prioria and partners a significant competitive advantage with this customer.  In light of the intense competition in the UAV market, the importance of this competitive advantage cannot be understated.A list of non-NASA commercialization opportunities and more details are provided in Sect. 10.2.","Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Human-Computer Interfaces; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Optical; Perception/Sensing; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

The successful deployment, recovery, and operation of these assets are essential to our scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security. Range surveillance is a significant factor in enabling safe, reliable, and cost effective operations.  Our ranges encompass large ocean regions that are not under the exclusive control of the spaceport. As such, these areas must be cleared in preparation for launch and reentry operations to ensure overall safety to the public as well as the space transportation system itself.  Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. (Emergent) proposes to research a integrated marine autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) range surveillance (MARS) system to enhance spaceport situational awareness. The surveillance payload includes an array of optical, infrared, and RF sensors and onboard software to facilitate measurement infusion and analysis. The surveillance payload provides state estimates including position, velocity, and heading for marine assets.  State measurements are relayed to the range control personnel to aid in operational decision making.  The MARS system is intended to increase range availability and safety while decreasing operational costs.","The MARS system is initially being developed to support NASA range surveillance and intrusion monitoring activities for spacecraft launch and recovery operations. MARS is intended to augment existing surveillance operations in the range's marine corridor which is expansive, expensive to monitor, and prone to incursion by commercial and recreational boats. The MARS system is intended to support Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and sounding rocket launches at the Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and Constellation program launches at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The technology might also be deployed on land-based stations to monitor launch, processing, and recovery facilities.   When paired with appropriate sensors, the MARS system will also support autonomous in situ oceanographic and atmospheric data collection and transmission for NASA Earth science applications including satellite calibration and validation, physical oceanography (temperature, winds, salinity, current, CO2), harmful algal bloom monitoring, and hurricane/storm research.","Emergent's MARS system has the potential to support a wide array of non-NASA government and commercial autonomous marine surveillance and in situ data collection applications.  Application domains include natural and man-made disaster response, energy, environmental, homeland security, law enforcement, military, public health and safety, transportation, and weather forecasting. Regardless of application domain, the MARS systems offers the potential to decrease operational costs, decrease human workloads, reduce human exposure to hazardous environments, increase situational awareness, enable extended duration observations, and customize temporal and spatial surveillance and monitoring scales. State and local governments tasked with conducting increased surveillance and environmental monitoring activities on increasingly limited budgets are expected to benefit from the MARS system which will ultimately enables more effective use of employees and resources.",Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Perception/Sensing; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety

Difficulty in verifying acleared range causes significant launch delay that may significantly affect the operation safety, cost and schedule.We propose this SBIR to develop a novel ""Smart Pan/Tilt/Zoom Visible/IR Sensor"" platform, especially suited for detection, tracking,recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safelaunch operations.Conventional optical sensors have limited field of views (FOV). They observe objects through a small solid angle subtended in front of thesensor. Although the high optical amplification may provide high resolution image of a target, detecting and tracking potential target within alarge area is difficult, resulting in lengthy search time, costly UAV maneuvers, low efficiency of verifying range clearance, even missingintruded target due to limited FOV. Increasing FOV, however, is a double-edged sword that, for any given sensor, leads to a decreased spatialresolution, causing difficulties in target recognition and classification.To address these contradicting requirements on FOV and resolution for range surveillance applications, we propose a novel Smart PTZsensor concept with the following unique advantages:(1)Novel optical design of wide FOV optics, no blind spot, no image distortion;(2)Simultaneous wide FOV and zoomed high resolution images;(3)Smart PTZ target tracking;(4)Intelligent video analysis algorithms for automatic target detection and tracking;(5)Embedded on-board DSP processing module;(6)Novel optical design applies to both visible and infrared sensors;(7)Flexible mounting options: on-board UAV, land vehicle mounted, and fixed camera.","The proposed Smart PTZ technology solves the critical problem of conventional optical sensors that are not able to satisfy the contradicting requirements of achieving both wide FOV and high resolution target imaging capabilities.

The compact light weight and low-power visible/infrared sensor package is ideally suited for mounting on UAVs and land vehicles for launch range surveillance.  The system can also be installed in fixed locations with critical importance for constant 7/24 real-time video surveillance with intelligent target detection capabilities.  The proposed Smart PTZ visible/Infrared sensor technology offers an efficient, low-cost, and high performance solution to NASA launch range surveillance applications.","Beyond NASA uses, the proposed Smart PTZ sensor has immediate commercial applications to various applications in homeland security, video monitoring, and IP based remote video surveillance.

Power systems are an integral component of virtually any electronic or electromechanical system and thus are an excellent application for non-intrusive power system state-of-health and IVHM-enabled sensing.  Ridgetop will provide a non-intrusive, eigenvalue-based,  IEEE P1451-compatible, power system health sensor.  The sensor connects to the power source, as a ""black box"", by means of a current pickup loop, and load changes produce a characteristic response that contains the intrinsic eigenvalues.  Variations in the eigenvalues from nominal are correlated with internal component degradation or aging, and reveal the overall state-of-health of the power supply.  By P1451 enabling the Smart Sensor, interfacing to Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring (IVHM) systems is fully supported and adoption of this technology will be much more rapid.","Virtually any spacecraft system, including the Constellation family, have power systems that are complex and conditioned through switch-mode converters.

These power systems are critical to the proper functioning of the larger systems and overall mission success.   The ability to utilize a Smart Sensor to assess the state-of-health is a very powerful tool for diagnostics, and the remaining useful life (RUL) prognostics stemming from this sensor are useful when linked to NASA's IVHM systems.  By having accurate and timely indications of power systems' integrity, mitigation of faults and load shedding schemes can be supported.

Active tags use batteries to power their communication circuitry, sensors, and microcontroller. Active tags benefit from relatively long wireless range and can achieve high data and sensor activity rates. However, the batteries required by active tags are disadvantageous for device cost, lifetime, weight, and volume.  In contrast, passive sensor tags receive all of their operating power from external RF transmitting sources and are not limited by battery life.  One attractive feature of passive sensor tags is the prospect of permanently embedding them in objects for structural monitoring. Another is their suitability for applications in which neither batteries nor wired connections are feasible, for weight, volume, cost, or other reasons. A limitation of purely passive sensor tags is the requirement of proximity to a RF transmitter.  Since lower power consumption is one major trend in RF circuit design, a self-powered system by means of energy harvesting becomes very attractive. It can serve as the enabling technology for novel applications such as ambient intelligence.

Yet, it is important to have reasonable estimates of these probabilities in order to make informed decisions about managing the associated risks.  NASA's mission is and always will be to push the envelope, to go where no historical record exists to give guidance.  Consequently, it is necessary to consider additional sources of information, like expert opinion, analog studies, and controlled studies.  To combine this information in a principled way, each source should be documented and should be characterized according to its ""level of evidence."" NASA's researchers need the capability to gather information about each possible event, calculate the probability, update the calculations as new information is discovered, and support informed decisions about risks and risk mitigation strategies.S&K Aerospace (SKA) proposes an innovative Web-based system  to collect relevant evidence for medical events and facilitate the assignment of its ""level of evidence"", and combine evidence from multiple sources so that principled decisions can be reached concerning the probability of those events.

For each event, information and references can be added; this information can take any form.

Each event will have a range of hypothetical mitigation strategies, along with the current best recommendation.","The proposed system will provide NASA with a way to track potential medical events that could affect proposed missions, and support decisions made to mitigate the risks of those events. The system will allow researchers to perform ""what-if"" analysis of risks under different scenarios, and will automatically recalculate the probabilities of events as more information becomes available or mission planning is updated.","The application would be of interest to any large organization that needs to estimate and track risk. A large potential market for a system of this nature would be the project management for a major engineering project. The system could be used to estimate the risks of various events that could disrupt the project, and it could support decisions made to mitigate those risks. As the project is worked, the system could be used to track events and update the probabilities of events occurring as situations develop.",Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Database Development and Interfacing; Human-Computer Interfaces; Operations Concepts and Requirements

In order to advance the space program, NASA must find cost effective solutions to store and disperse propellants at cryogenic temperatures.  The true cost for an insulation material depends upon the energy tradeoff between thermal efficiency and lifecycle maintenance for an insulation system.  Durability is a critical factor for insulation systems because performance can degrade over time if appropriate attention is not given to environmental exposure and thermal cycling.  Aspen Aerogels proposes to develop a cost effective, low density, aerogel insulation material that is liquid oxygen compatible for terrestrial LOX and LH2 pipes and feed lines applications.  Besides its exceptional thermal insulation performance, these novel aerogels are super-hydrophobic and durable, affording a superior protective layer for the pipelines against environmental corrosion.  During the Phase II Program, Aspen will further optimize the material and scale-up to production levels with a focus towards long-term applicability to replace conventional cryogenic insulation material in the pipelines and expand its use in other government and commercial applications.  This novel insulation will reduce cryogenic storage costs by increasing the life expectancy of the system while decreasing the cost of installation and lifecycle maintenance.","The development and optimization of Aspen's low cost and durable aerogel insulation will be immediately useful for wide variety of cryogenic applications such as cryogenic tanks, transportation (pipelines) of cryogens and propellant, Mars exploration, near earth orbit spacecraft and also non-cryogenic applications such as high temperature insulation up to 500oC.

We achieve this by employing Bragg grating sensor arrays and using a novel interrogation technique combined with state-of-the-art AE method to detect and pinpoint composite defects in these structures.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate the sensor's capability to measure loads and acoustic emission in a composite structure in comparison with conventional piezoelectric type AE sensors.

Corrosion of KSC ground assets is exacerbated by the highly acidic exhaust of the Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs). During launch approximately 17 tons of hydrochloric acid are generated from the SRB exhausts. Thus while the launches are infrequent, they produce a highly acidic environment on coated structures leading to excessive corrosion.  To mitigate the corrosion of carbon steel structures in and near the launch areas, KSC uses solvent-based topcoated inorganic zinc rich coatings. Regulations arising from Clean Air and other environmental legislation restrict the use of most solvents in paints and may restrict the use of inorganic zinc rich protective coatings. TDA will produce and test environmentally friendly smart coatings using its low-cost nanostructured carriers for corrosion inhibitors that provide smart release of the corrosion inhibitors via both pH-triggered and controlled release mechanisms. In the Phase I program TDA will demonstrate that its smart materials approach can provide higher-performance, environmentally-friendly protective coatings for NASA infrastructure and equipment. At the end of the Phase II effort we expect the technology to be at a technology readiness level of seven to eight.","The technology developed in the Phase I and follow on efforts will be smart corrosion inhibitor packages that will be added to low-VOC protective coatings to NASA to protect is ground support facilities and equipment at the Kennedy Space Center.

Like a CRPA, the number of jammers that the proposed system can suppress is one less than the number of elements.  In contrast to a CRPA, the individual elements of the proposed system need not be precisely located relative to one another.  The proposed system is compatible with any GPS antennas and receiver hardware, operates on the C/A code, and has a small processing load.The suppression of the jammers and interference creates slightly delayed copies of the code from each satellite.  Because the delays are known and small, any degradation in the accuracy of derived antenna positions (relative to that without jamming and interference) should also be small, without any consequence on range safety.  The proposed program will quantify the accuracy achievable in individual position measurements, and the utility of combining the measured positions of multiple antennas for purposes of antenna pointing, docking maneuvers, and attitude determination.In order to transition the proposed technology to NASA, the DoD, and commercial markets, we plan to team with The Boeing Company in Phase II and beyond.","The principal NASA application of the proposed technology is making GPS metric tracking for the Constellation Program's Ares launch vehicles robust to interference with and jamming of the GPS signals.  Effective GPS metric tracking is a crucial component in the success of NASA's autonomous flight safety system and its space-based range demonstration and certification project.  Besides the Ares launch vehicles, the same range safety technology applies directly to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles, and to the SpaceX Falcon 1 launch vehicle.  Through the use of position measurements at multiple locations on the launch vehicle, the technology may also apply to antenna pointing, docking maneuvers, and attitude determination.","The most likely non-NASA customer is the Department of Defense.  The most direct application is for range safety in the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS).  However, other DoD applications constitute much larger markets.  Platforms that are small or unusually shaped are especially promising candidates.  These include Small Diameter Bomb and its variants; A-160 Humming Bird helicopter, High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft; and Scan Eagle UAV.Many nonmilitary missions could be enabled by a UAV that could safely fly autonomously in civilian airspace.  Extensive efforts are already underway to develop guidance and collision avoidance sensors to enable autonomous UAV flight in civilian airspace.  Effective guidance depends on the availability of GPS signals.  Cost and weight considerations preclude use of a CRPA.  Hence, without the proposed approach, the UAV would be extremely vulnerable to being blinded by an inexpensive jammer or by inadvertent interference.","Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

(BCI) proposes to develop a new Navigation Robustness and Accuracy Improvement (NRAI) system, based on BCI's innovative noise nulling and observable combiner technology. BCI's novel approach incorporates the innovations of the highly successful multiple-antenna detection technique and the optimized fast quad diversity combiner technique, enabling BCI to meet NASA's requirements for reliability, safety, and high accuracy by effectively nullifying the interference noise from GPS receiver data and eliminating errors and ambiguities in observables. The NRAI system offers a 4-6 dB SNR improvement factor over current techniques and increases the accuracy of L1 C/A navigation to less than 1 m and 1 cm/s, which directly fulfills NASA's requirement of anti-spoofing ability and high accuracy. In Phase I BCI will demonstrate the feasibility of the NRAI system by building and testing a preliminary prototype, which will demonstrate TRL-level 3-4 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, BCI plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate the anti-spoofing and high-accuracy navigation performance of NRAI. The demonstrated results will offer NASA capabilities of accurate and reliable navigation using L1 C/A code.","As NASA attempts to deliver a better product for less money, and as it attempts to partner with private industry in order to increase its efficiency and make money, the importance of a versatile metric tracking system for launch vehicles becomes even more important. An important benefit of BCI's NRAI system is that it can be embedded in any GPS receiving system; our NRAI system can improve accuracy for most NASA navigation applications that require Range Safety and high accuracy. For example, BCI's NRAI system can be used for high-accuracy antenna pointing, docking maneuvers, and attitude determination. Most NASA navigation systems will greatly benefit from the development of BCI's high-accuracy NRAI system by enhancing the anti-spoofing capability and positioning accuracy of L1 C/A code-based navigation. With BCI's NRAI system, NASA can provide more efficient services at a lower cost.","A desirable benefit of BCI's NRAI system is its ease in transitioning to private industry. The NRAI system, because it is independent of any particular GPS receiver design, can provide benefits to many private businesses, especially those industries involving ships and automobiles. Aircraft navigation, commercial automobile systems, such as those that enable safe, semi-autonomous driving, and ship navigation can all benefit greatly from the advances of the NRAI system. More accurate positioning and measuring of speed in many different types of settings can help to streamline products in these industries, saving consumers much time and money. In addition, robotic navigation can use the measurement and positioning accuracy of BCI's NRAI. The NRAI system can also benefit such governmental entities as Homeland Security. With the ever-increasing demand for better and more precise technologies in automobiles, ships, aircraft, and robots, the possibilities for commercialization of BCI's NRAI seem endless.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

Ideally, a system that, in one package, provides 3-dimensional relative information about external objects is needed.  Existing laser range finding systems are expensive and consume large amounts of power. Additionally, they are sensitive to only a narrow solid angle, and must be scanned mechanically in order to provide more than a single dimension of depth information. Nanohmics proposes to design an electro-optical imaging device capable of autonomously determining the range to objects in a scene without the use of active emitters or multiple apertures.

The system will be designed so that it is inexpensive, easy to integrate with existing/planned planetary rovers, rugged, and low in maintenance.  Nanohmics will develop a custom optical system along with embedded digital signal processing electronics and a unique opto-mechanical design; and develop firmware/software algorithms for determining range to objects within the system field-of-view.

For accurate long term measurements, the calibration and stability of the radiometer is of primary importance. Thus, the noise-injection radiometer (NIR), which greatly reduces drifts due to gain and noise figure variation in the receiver system, is highly preferred. The NIR architecture requires an electronic noise injection system consisting of a noise diode, a switch and a coupler to inject the noise into the signal waveguide. NIRs are now commonly used at lower frequency, but above about 100 GHz the noise diodes become much more difficult to achieve. Recently, VDI has measured significant ENR above 100 GHz from GaAs Schottky barrier diodes. This preliminary measurement with a non-optimized diode design, coupled with the fact that the VDI diodes have been used as mixers and multipliers to well over 1 THz, offers some promise that GaAs diodes can be used to achieve useful noise power levels to well above 100 GHz. Thus, the focus of this Phase 1 proposal is the investigation of noise diodes and noise sources based on GaAs Schottky diode technology for noise-injection radiometer systems above 100 GHz.","The focus of this proposal is the development of electronic calibration systems based on noise diodes for frequencies in the range from about 100 GHz through 1,000 GHz. Such noise sources will be useful for a wide range of NASA applications, including the high frequency radiometers proposed for SWOT and other remote sensing missions.","VDI's research program is focused on developing the fundamental technologies that are required for the full development of the terahertz frequency band for scientific and commercial applications. Noise sources based on diode technology are an incredibly useful tool that is routinely used in a wide variety of applications below 100 GHz. The lack of suitable noise diodes above 100 GHz significantly hinders the continuing development of terahertz applications. In the specific example of NASA's space based radiometer systems; the lack of electronic noise sources greatly complicates the routine calibration of radiometer systems, and thereby reduces the power and usefulness of remote sensing systems. Non-NASA applications include noise figure measurements, analog and digital test equipment, spectrum analyzer calibration, and a range of military applications.",Microwave/Submillimeter

Building modules using these devices opens a goldmine of military and commercial applications. Systems integration of these devices into affordable and reliable modules has been a challenge due to costs associated with assembly requirements. Research into: placement precision requirements, material selection and cost, assembly processes, and automation are the subjects of this proposal. Because of its capabilities, NxGen Electronics is uniquely qualified to perform this research.Since 2003 JPL has been developing Miniature MMIC low power Radiometers for GeoSTAR and PATH Missions. Current weather and surface observational satellites employ both infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) atmospheric sounders. Since clouds are almost completely opaque at infrared wavelengths, sounds require cloud free observation. POES satellites provide coverage but provide coverage in relatively narrow swaths, and with revisit time of 12-24 hours. GeoSTAR offers the possibility of MW temperature and water vapor soundings as well as rain mapping from GEO. The results of this SBIR research will be a direct benefit to these programs by using their requirements as a focus for the study, and provide the groundwork for broader support for the commercialization process.","For years NASA/JPL and NOAA have been engaged in providing weather forecasting data to the meteorological community. Current systems are lacking in terms of real time, continuous measurements of temperature and water vapor. As recent Hurricane events have demonstrated, this data would be crucial to minimize dangers and damage from such events. Another important project involves research into how global precipitation, evaporation, and cycling of water changes. Together the GeoSTAR and PATH  projects have developed instruments  to support this need based on 90 GHz MMIC technologies. Satellite deployable designs will require assembling large arrays of 180GHz MMIC devices, which has proven to be costly and labor intensive. For the past two years NxGen has been a participant by providing many of  the 90GHz modules. NxGen believes it can lead the research into assembling low cost MMIC module assemblies at 180 GHz which will benefit many future NASA/JPL designs.","Non NASA applications for low cost MIMIC devices operating at frequencies above 60GHz are enormous. Traditionally microwave designers have used discrete devices at great expense and size penalties limiting their applicability. The emergence of Indium Phosphide heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT's) has now made it possible to offer 60-100GHz system solutions at lower cost with unprecedented performance advantages. Missile Radar (smaller antennas), Telecommunications (competing with cable), and Collision Avoidance systems are but a few of the applications where operation at these high frequencies in a compact and low cost implementation would benefit. Two major obstacles needed to be overcome are cost of assemblies in large volume and substrate costs. NxGen Electronics believes that full implementation of the proposed SBIR would greatly enhance its abilities to compete for some of these applications.","Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Attitude Determination and Control; Composites; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Metallics; RF; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Teleoperation"

However, its effectiveness in downlooking applications has been limited, primarily because variations in surface albedo degrade the performance.  Our DAGR approach builds on traditional GFCR concepts and combines several new key elements: two-dimensional detector arrays, pupil imaging (imaging the aperture), and a novel calibration approach.  With these enhancements and appropriate signal processing, the DAGR design overcomes the historical limitations of GFCR in downlooking applications.  In addition, this design significantly boosts the sensitivity and expands the dynamic range traditionally available to these sensors.  Finally, the innovation provides a calibration technique that nearly eliminates errors due to detector drift effects.  The result will be a compact, static, robust system that can accurately measure important boundary layer species from a variety of platforms.","Being insensitive to varying background albedo, DAGR sensors are well suited for sensing boundary layer gases such as CO, CH4, and N2O in downlooking solar scatter applications.  The interest in these particular species stems mainly from their role in global climate change.  Measurements of CO are essential to separate biomass burning fluxes from fossil fuel emissions.  Tracers such as CH4 and N2O reveal the extent of horizontal mixing and spatial patterns of the age of the air.   Future NASA missions called for by the NRC Decadal Survey are likely to include such measurements, and would benefit from the DAGR innovation proposed here.  DAGR sensors could be configured for aircraft, low-Earth orbit or geostationary platforms.  The DAGR design makes it impervious to misalignment and therefore vibration, resulting in a rugged instrument.  Candidate NASA missions include ASCENDS, (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days and Seasons), GACM (Global Atmospheric Composition Mission), and Geo-CAPE (Geostationary Coastal Air Pollution Events).  Additionally, a DAGR sensor could be used aboard planetary missions, for example to measure the spatial distribution of CH4 in the Martian atmosphere, thought to be an indicator of biological activity.","Pollutant and Agricultural MonitoringAircraft and UAV measurements with a DAGR could be used to monitor effects of agricultural and industrial activities for specific emissions in geographical areas of interest.  Agricultural operations produce a variety of particulates and gases that influence air quality, including NH3, H2S, CH4, N2O and airborne pathogens.  These impact human health, the environment and climate.  The Space Dynamics Lab (SDL), teamed with the Department of Agriculture, is developing systems to measure pollutant and greenhouse gases.  DAGR would be an excellent compliment to these efforts.  With innovative methods for combining gas cells and fiber optics, extremely small (the size of digital cameras) and sensitive DAGR instruments are possible.Climate MonitoringGreenhouse gas credit trading is becoming a sensitive issue, but a major obstacle is the inability to accurately measure baseline emissions.  A DAGR system could provide such measurements.  SDL is a participant in the Utah Science Technology and Research (USTAR) initiative, designed to bring new products to market.  If successful through Phase II, GATS and SDL plan to work with USTAR to develop and market DAGR as a commercial climate-monitoring sensor.

Plasmonic/photonic hybrid crystal films are an enabling technology and can be used to develop high spectral resolution, low crosstalk components for other NASA missions, such as GEO-CAPE, as well as transparent metal contacts for high-efficiency sensors and solar cells, Additionally, hybrid crystals eliminate several problems, such as diffraction, light scattering, moving parts, and the need to dice/bond components.

The polarimetric control of the flow of light allows the development of devices that separate polarization components of an incident beam and detect the separate components in the same or different pixels of a FPA. The hybrid crystals can play several roles, including polarization splitter/filters, antireflection coatings, superfocusing elements and electrical contacts.","The proposed project will lead directly to commercialization of polarimetric sensors ideally suited to NASA's upcoming ACE and CLARREO missions and VIIRS NPP project. Through knowledge gained about theoretical modeling and fabrication methodologies, the project may also lead to other photonic devices of use to NASA. For example, the light-concentrating abilities of Phoebus's recently designed plasmonic Fresnel zone plates are well-suited to creation of pixel-sized microlenses, to be fabricated atop IR focal plane arrays. Such devices improve sensitivity of space-based imaging and remote sensing systems by enabling smaller, lower-noise detector elements without loss of light-gathering power while simultaneously reducing system mass. Fabry-Perot interferometers are currently used as narrowband wavelength filters for select remote sensing and astronomy applications. By tapping into very narrow bandwidth light-circulating modes, Phoebus's could also improve on current devices by providing even narrower bandwidths with a simpler, lighter and lower-cost device.","Phoebus's plasmonic/photonic hybrid crystals are an enabling technology with a variety of potential applications spanning multiple device types and industries. With relatively minor adjustments to their dimensions, geometries and material composition, Phoebus's hybrid crystals can elicit extremely diverse light-management phenomena, ranging from wavelength filtering, polarization filtering and polarization beam splitting to light localization, focusing, circulation, weaving and trapping. Phoebus has developed a disciplined device development pipeline, which includes i) polarimetric infrared sensors for improvised explosive device (IED) detection, ii) high-efficiency multi-junction solar cells, iii) chemical/biological photonic sensors and iv) all-optical memory arrays. The total combined annual value of the targeted markets exceeds $10 billion.

The LFMG innovations include the ability to make both extremely high-resolution scalar field measurements (10 fT/rtHz) as well as stable and accurate scalar gradiometer measurements. The high stability of the gradiometer measurements makes possible exploratory investigations of temporal variations and gradients in the magnetic field at the Earth's surface due to crustal field changes, core changes, ELF and ULF magnetospheric disturbances, and surface electromagnetic effects associated with earthquakes and volcanic activity. LFMG instruments can be deployed as station magnetometers in gradiometer arrays to monitor geopotential gradient variations over ranges from meters to kilometers. Recently, an extremely high-resolution scalar measurement technique achieving 39 pT/rtHz sensitivity was demonstrated under Navy sponsorship. High-accuracy data linking for vector gradient measurement was demonstrated under the ONR 3MDS Program. The LFMG combines these key innovations to develop an instrument for exploratory research in geomagnetism. The Phase 1 effort will result in an LFMG conceptual design and establish the feasibility of designing and fabricating a brass-board in Phase 2. A plan for the LFMG brass-board installation, calibration, and performance evaluation will be developed for demonstration in Phase 2.

The LFMG will be used to observe magnetic fields at the Earth's surface with extremely high resolution. The major features of the LFMG that set it apart from other magnetic measurement systems are its outstanding accuracy and its ability to difference scalar measurements at many kilometers separation. LFMG magnetic field measurements provide means for studying the structure and dynamics of Earth's interior. On the Earth and other planets, the magnetic field provides unique information on the structure and dynamics of the planetary interior, fluid flow within and upon its surface, and the influence of the solar environment.

For example, the Single Aperture Far-IR (SAFIR) telescope and other cryogenic telescope missions must provide distributed cooling and multiple heat lift. Also, the management of cryogenic propellants requires distributed cooling through integrated heat exchangers for zero boil-off, densification and cooling of structural members. To address these requirements, we propose to develop a lightweight, continuous-flow cooling loop that can provide cooling and temperature control to multiple, distributed loads. This approach allows relatively simple mechanical and electrical integration and maintains high refrigeration system efficiency. The basis of the loop is a rectifying interface that converts the oscillating pressure that characterizes the operation of a regenerative cryocooler into a quasi-steady pressure difference that can be used to drive a continuous flow of cold gas over distances of several meters. The rectifying interface has the potential secondary benefit of rapid and therefore precise load temperature regulation of multiple sensors or structures using actively controlled throttle valves to regulate the local gas flow.","There are many potential NASA applications for the rectified cooling loop, including cooling large deployable telescopes and multiple distributed loads such as CCD cameras. A prime example is the use of the PT/RCL to provide active shielding and re-liquefaction for zero-boil-off (ZBO) dewars. For example, the manned Mars mission, which requires the in-situ manufacture of propellant, will require the capability to store seed hydrogen, as well as, liquid oxygen and liquid methane for substantial periods of time. NASA also has terrestrial applications for zero-boil-off technology, including cryogenic propellant preservation for Space Shuttle power systems.","There are numerous potential commercial applications for zero-boil-off technology. It has been pointed out, that ZBO would be advantageous for systems used to cool superconducting power lines, superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage, high temperature superconducting filters for cellular telephone base stations, and MRI magnets and SQUID magnetometers for heart and brain studies. In each of these applications, cryocooler reliability is an issue. Using a system cooled by a ZBO dewar addresses the reliability issue by ensuring that cooling liquid is always present. In the event of a cooler failure, the stored liquid provides a buffer i.e., a period of time during which the cooler may be repaired, or at worst the  dewar refilled. It seems, then, that there exists a large potential market for ZBO technology and hence the  PT/RCL proposed here",Chemical; Cooling; Fluid Storage and Handling; Instrumentation; Production; Propellant Storage

In particular, airborne measurements of CO2 profiles throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere have provided a great deal of useful information, but the instrumentation used has been restricted to airplane or large stratospheric-type balloon gondola platforms due to the size, weight and power requirements of these instruments.  While a  more widespread measurement campaign using smaller, less expensive balloon sondes could provide very important data, such an approach has been limited by the lack of suitable instrumentation.  In this SBIR program, Southwest Sciences proposes to developed a lightweight, inexpensive greenhouse gas sensor suitable for balloon sonde measurements, yet exhibiting specifications that approach those of the much larger and expensive research instruments used on current airborne platforms.  Using a novel ratiometric measurement technique, this sensor will provide dry air mixing ratios of CO2 without the need for concurrent measurements of temperature, pressure or moisture.","The proposed self-calibrating greenhouse gas sensor will be designed for NASA for use on UAV, balloon, and aircraft platforms.  One of the goals of NASA's Office of Science is to use satellite data and suborbital platforms to understand weather and climate of the Earth, both in the present and in the future.  Suborbital field campaigns composed of balloons, aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles are used to identify processes, validate satellite data, and eventually create parameterizations that allow full use of satellite data.  Measurements of the precise variations of carbon dioxide as a function of altitude have been tremendously difficult in the atmosphere, and this sensor will more widespread measurements than currently possible using only large expensive airplane or gondola platforms.","The initial market for the self-calibrating greenhouse gas sensor would be the international atmospheric research community.  Research groups that are involved in field campaigns from university, government, and private laboratories would be the customers.  Beyond the atmospheric science community, high precision gas measurements are needed in industrial applications.  The proposed method will allow for non-intrusive measurements of fluids in fast flows of pipelines, chambers, and smokestacks.  Non-intrusive measurements are critically needed when caustic gases are used or when an integrated measurement is needed without disturbing laminar flow.

The proposed fused instrument has the ability to measure the spatial distribution of chemical species containing C, N, H, O, S, Cl, and/or water, ice, and hydrated minerals on a 1-5 mm spatial scale enabled by a novel set of wide aperture, high sensitivity ultraminiature deep UV Raman spectrometers. Raman spectroscopy is a non-contact, non-destructive, method of identifying unknown materials without the need for sample acquisition and processing. This technique is ideal for in situ exploration from extraterrestrial Rovers or landers. There are three main advantages of deep UV Raman methods over near-UV, visible or near-IR counterparts.  1) Rayleigh-law: signal enhancement of 20x at 248nm compared to excitation at 532nm. 2) Resonance: much higher signal enhancements; for water 5 times greater than Rayleigh-law enhancement alone, for a combined effect over 120x between 248 nm and 532 nm.  3) With excitation below 250nm, Raman scattering bands occur in a fluorescence-free region of the spectrum.  At longer excitation wavelengths fluorescence from target or surrounding materials overwhelm Raman emissions and require gating with high power lasers with narrow pulse widths leading to sample alteration/damage. When deep UV Raman is combined with native fluorescence, it becomes possible to characterize mineral alterations and detect trapped chemicals with exquisite sensitivity and differentiability. The New Frontiers has placed a South pole-Aitken Basin sample return as a future mission scenario. Using the enhanced detection capabilities of DUV-RF, water, ice and chemical species can be detected and mapped to provide an understanding of their distribution in the lunar regolith.","This technology is useful for a broad range of in situ measurements for: space science and terrestrial geochemical, geophysical and geobiological studies; planetary protection applications such as measuring/characterizing organic or biogenic contamination on outbound and inbound spacecraft; and for general application to high quality non-invasive, non-destructive measurement of trace levels of contamination on surfaces, in liquids and in the air, such as aboard the International Space Station.  The proposed instrument will provide the ability to measure trace levels of organic material at working distances up to 1 meter or more.  For space science applications, this would enable a Rover-body mounted instrument that could interrogate the vicinity of the Rover.  For terrestrial applications the stand-off measurements could be made in full sun-light conditions at least for Raman and potentially for the deep UV native fluorescence emissions.  For planetary protection applications it would enable direct measurement of bioloads on spacecraft surfaces without the need for sample collection using traditional methods.","The technology being addressed by this proposal is immediately useful for Department of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (HS) applications as well as non-government commercial and industrial applications.  DOD and HS applications include in situ biological and chemical warfare sensors to detect trace levels of biological, nerve, and blister agents as well as low-volatility toxic industrial chemicals (TICs).  The ability of the sensor to measure hazardous materials a meters of working distance vastly improves their use by first responders.  In addition, a broad range of non-government commercial and industrial applications are addressed by the proposed sensor including: environmental testing of water, soil and air; municipal and industrial water and waste-water quality testing; commercial product quality control testing of manufactured food, chemical, semiconductor, and other commercial products; and a wide range of research applications enabled by the core technologies developed on this program.",Biochemical; Biomedical and Life Support; Biomolecular Sensors; In-situ Resource Utilization; Optical; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Waste Processing and Reclamation

The instrument inherits from the general concept of CheMin, the XRD/XRF instrument of MSL, but is entirely redesigned to provide a more compact and lightweight unit, and reduced costs.   Many implementation details of the proposed instrument will inherit from the design of a small portable XRD/XRF instruments developed and marketed by inXitu, Inc. and a robotic instrument derived from this design. The objective of this proposal is to bring this development to a high TRL of 6 to 7, to enable fast and cost effective development of subsequent flight systems.

The µPIT prototype is a small (< 230 g) thruster that produces and accelerates plasma.  In the solid fuel mode, µPIT_SF is able to substantially extend the performance of standard PPT systems by ionization and heating of the high density neutral gas produced after the arc.   A small power-processing unit (PPU) is attached directly to the thruster which isolates the high voltage igniter section from the main spacecraft bus. Further development of the µPIT has implications that could include dramatic weight reductions of onboard station keeping and attitude control systems for miniature spacecraft and increased thruster efficiencies.  Anticipated development of the µPIT in Phase 1 of the proposed work would lead to a 2nd generation prototype at or near the NASA TRL 5.  Anticipated results from a Phase 2 program would be to produce a prototype at NASA TRL 6 with a corresponding experimental determination of the thruster's Isp levels and operational characteristics including a thrust measurement.","The µPIT has many NASA applications in the areas requiring the use of micro- propulsion systems, attitude control and station keeping.  Specifically, the µPIT system could function as the primary propulsion unit for micro-spacecraft weighing less than 5 kg. The µPIT system has a high precision (< 10 µs) controllable plasma pulse length. This allows for high-resolution impulse bit control, which can be modified with each pulse. Integration of a µPIT system onto constellation spacecrafts could allow for real time precision attitude control. This could be especially useful for NASA science missions similar to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave detection experiment where extremely precise spacecraft attitude control will be required over long periods.","As miniature spacecraft technology progresses, the µPIT has many potential applications for both civilian and military commercialization.  These include station keeping and attitude control systems for small communication satellites and precision pointing systems.  Other non-NASA applications could include materials coating applications where the precise plasma control available with the µPIT system could lead to more uniform thin film deposition.  Additionally, the µPIT system can generate the initial Teflon arc at atmospheric pressure.

Rf discharge was chosen to eliminate the life-limiting internal cathode of a dc discharge ion engine. Thrust actuation on the order of 0.03µN resolution is proposed with a closed-loop control system. This controlling scheme can be achieved by varying only one parameter: the rf power with a feedback from the beam current. Uniquely, the rf ion engine can also produce enough thrust for coarse constellation corrections or reconfigurations. Argon will be the base-lined propellant to ease concerns of propellant condensing on optics or other cryogenic surfaces. This feature can be critical for close formation flying as micro-thrusters such as field emission electric propulsion (FEEP) and colloids could potentially coat neighboring spacecraft. The proposed rf ion engine, combined with Busek's space-qualified carbon nanotube field emission cathode (developed for the ST7 DRS mission) as a neutralizer, will create a new opportunity in precise thrust actuation. Further implementation of a simple propellant feed system and power electronics will create a compact, low power, high performance spacecraft propulsion system.","Missions such as LISA, TPF, DARWIN, and the follow on to the GRACE mission, require extremely precise propulsion. Thrust noise will be the largest hurdle in these missions and our proposed thruster can achieve extremely low thrust noise. In addition to precision thrust for optic alignment or similar applications, larger thrust may be required for counteracting solar pressure or reconfiguring the constellation. Precisely varying thrust in a closed loop by the actuation of just one parameter can be a simple implementation with powerful attributes. Because of cryogenic sensors, the propulsion effluent should not thermally radiate or condense on cryogenic surfaces. These considerations lead to the proposed thruster.","Precision propulsion is required by DoD and NRO constellation missions such as the Space Based Radar. Constellations of multiple micro-spacecraft are envisioned to form sparse aperture optics and similar applications. Micro spacecraft have limited power and mass available, thus the thrust actuators must be low power and low mass. The micro rf ion engine can fulfill the requirements. Commercial earth observation missions could achieve greater accuracy and resolution by using the proposed propulsion capable to maintain extremely precise and jitter-free pointing.",Electrostatic Thrusters; Micro Thrusters

Current implementations consist of arrays of 37 mirror segments (currently available commercially) and 163 segment arrays (first prototypes under test).  Existing thin-film based MEMS fabrication techniques used by competitors typically can not achieve an adequate degree of optical flatness and maintain it over a range of temperatures.  Even newer thick-film methods suffer from the same problem to some degree.  The Iris AO segmented mirror approach, on the other hand, uses a thick and rigid single-crystal-silicon optical surface bonded to an electrostatically driven actuator platform.  This results in excellent mirror flatness and insensitivity to temperature even when specialized optical coatings are used.  This proposal addresses scaling this technology up to 10^3 segments.  Key technical issues to be addressed in accommodating the larger number of segments include: (a) controlling overall bow of the larger chip; (b) developing the electrical interconnect design and fabrication process, and (c) modifying the mirror-wafer bonding process.

Open-cell foam core mirror technology has evolved over the past ten years and has produced somewhat large (0.5 m dia.), lightweight (<10 kg/m2), rapidly and uniformly cryo-cooled and dimensionally stable (tested to 25 K) mirrors configured with monolithic chemical vapor deposited (CVD) skins.  Significant problems have arisen as the size has increased that prevent their use on large aperture telescopes.  These problems include the inherent stress in the monolithic skins which can result in skin cracking during the substrate manufacturing and finishing processes, the non-uniformity of the .040""-.050"" thick monolithic skins that typically require .010""-.015"" of material removal before a continuous surface can be achieved for optical finishing, the long schedule of manufacturing the mirror substrate, and the large $2M/m2 cost to produce the polished mirror.  OPC proposes an innovation where the monolithic SiC skins are replaced with SiC fiber reinforced/SiC CVD skins.  This hybrid design consists of a .020""-.030"" thick SiC fiber reinforced layer ground to a smooth finish and near net shape, and then post coated with a .005""-.010"" thick CVD SiC polishing layer.  This provides increased skin strength and toughness to enable the technology to produce meter class mirrors without skin cracking.  The manufacturing time and CVD chamber cost are reduced because premanufactured SiC fibers are used to provide the bulk of the skin mass rather than laying down a monolithic skin atom by atom via CVD.  The net effect is to produce a SiC FOCAL mirror substrate that is stronger, tougher, scalable to meter class, and potentially better than 50% faster and cheaper to manufacture.","With the increase in size capability enabled by the hybrid skins, OPC's SiC FOCAL mirrors can potentially provide discriminating critical capabilities to future NASA missions that require cryogenic mirrors or mirror segments.  The planned NASA Universe Mission Roadmap for large aperture IR cryogenic telescopes includes SPIRIT in 2015, TPF-I in 2019, SAFIR in 2020 and SPECS in 2025.  The mirror or mirror segments required  have apertures of one to two meter and three of the four missions require cooling the telescope to 4 oK.  If the cost of manufacturing SiC FOCAL mirrors can be significantly reduced, they may be competitive for NASA missions that require large ambient mirrors such as MTRAP (2014), SCOPE (2015), NHST (2020), and TPF-C (2020).","OPC's SiC FOCAL mirror technology represents both a cost and performance breakthrough and is expected to have high visibility within the Government (NASA GSFC, NASA MSFC, Missile Defense Agency, Air Force Research Laboratory DE/VS/ML/SN, National Reconnaissance Office, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Joint Program Office) and commercial industry (Ball Aerospace  off-axis telescopes, Raytheon - scan mirrors, ITT  scan mirrors, Boeing SVS mirrors for Relay Mirror systems and Advanced Tactical Laser, Boeing Phantom Works  antennas for LEO IS&R missions, Brashear LP  telescope optics, Lockheed Martin  fast steering and beam control optics, and Northrop Grumman  transformational communications).

Recent SOC IRAD results showed that significant modifications to the basic LLNL protection scheme are possible, without sacrificing coating durability.In Phase I, a variety of protective compounds will be fabricated by an ion-assisted evaporation process and optimized for their protective properties, adhesion characteristics, and effect on coating reflectivity.  In addition, SOC will create a more precise method to deposit protective NiCrNx atomic clusters, which are a critical element of LLNL's silver protection recipe.  By modifying SOC's evaporation system and monitoring process, it is expected the necessary volume of these highly absorbing clusters may be reduced by a factor of 2, while still providing adequate engineering margin to insure durability.  These modifications will significantly improve coating reflectance in the UV and visible spectral regions. In Phase II, scale-up issues will be addressed and the improved silver coating process will be applied to a 2.2-m mirror substrate in SOC's 3.3-meter vacuum coating chamber.","Coronagraphs, space telescope programs such as TPFand SNAP, and space-based interferometers","TMT, LSST, Hobby-Eberly, Keck, BBSO and many other multi-mirror telescope and instrument systems.",Large Antennas and Telescopes; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials

The urgent need for low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused by conventional reflective Ir coatings that have high stress.  In particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 3 GPa in the case of 30 nm Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering techniques.  The distortions in thin glass mirror shells (such as those suitable for the Constellation-X SXT) resulting from these extremely large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the SXT telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.  Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the imaging requirements of Constellation-X, or other future high-resolution X-ray missions, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is precisely the aim of our proposal.","The low-stress Ir coatings we propose to develop will be suitable for use in the Constellation-X SXT instrument, as well as other future NASA X-ray telescopes comprising thin shell mirror elements.","Low-stress Ir X-ray coatings may also find application in non-NASA applications, such as diagnostic medical and homeland security (i.e., baggage and cargo screening) X-ray imaging.",Optical & Photonic Materials

Low-spatial frequency errors (figure errors) cause distortion in the system wavefront, resulting in degradation of the point spread function.  Mid-spatial frequency errors cause small-angle scattering of light (flare), which reduces image contrast.  High-spatial frequency errors scatter light out of the optical beam over larger angles, reducing the energy throughput in an optical system.  The Zeeko Precessions polishing is a sub-aperture process that has been developed for the control of form and texture in the production of aspheric and other optical surfaces.  The Precessions process is deterministic and provides dramatic reductions in production time due to its high removal rate and repeatability.  Similar to other sub-aperture finishing processes, the Precessions process is prone to leave mid-spatial frequency defects on the surface.  Zeeko has developed a unicursal random tool path that does not follow a regular pattern and is non-crossing.  The goal of this Phase I project is to expand on promising initial results obtained by using the random tool path.  The results generated by the research project will be used to demonstrate and improve the performance of the Zeeko polisher for this critical application.  We propose a study that employs the polishing methodology used by Zeeko Technologies to determine whether trial procedures using the Zeeko approach can effectively correctively finish an optic without inducing unwanted frequencies onto the surface of the part.","The advancements and enhancements to polishing capability resulting from the proposed research will improve the quality and range of surfaces currently shaped by a range of processes.  Such improvements benefit a number of NASA missions including The Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM), TPFC (Terrestrial Planet Finder - Coronagraph), TPFI (Terrestrial Planet Finder  Interferometer), SAFIR (Single Aperture Far-Infrared Observatory) and TMST (Thirty Meter Space Telescope) missions.  Reducing the occurrence of structure that gives rise to performance-limiting scatter on polished optical surfaces is a crucial technology needed to prove the feasibility of these future missions.  In addition, many ground based extremely large telescope projects including the TMT (Thirty Meter Telescope, formerly the CELT  California Extremely Large Telescope) and the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) could gain from the proposed research.","In addition to NASA missions, other industries that require large high precision optical surfaces could benefit from the successful completion of this Phase I project such as the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  Within this industry, next generation EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) and the polishing of semiconductor wafers and photomask substrates could gain from the proposed research on PSD control.

Present techniques for post-polishing of DPT grooves fail to completely remove the periodic structure resulting in a loss of specular energy into undesired diffracted orders.  The long-term objectives of this project are to transfer the 2D process onto a 3D polishing platform, and to develop robust, automated production processes for both 2D and 3D Aluminum optics.  Once achieved, this will be the most significant advance in the polishing field in many decades.  Super-polished surface finishes below 10 Angstroms will allow scientific instruments utilizing mirrors to achieve results at or near their theoretical limits.  Robust, automated production processes for Aluminum optics will result in significant improvements in the technical performance and cost-effectiveness of optics in many scientific and commercial markets.  The general methodology for achieving these goals is to collaborate with Zeeko Technologies and use well-chosen designed experiments that will efficiently screen the tool parameter response space and identify the best operating window to achieve super-polished surface finishes on the Zeeko IRP200 platform.The technology for producing super-polished Aluminum optics will assist NASA in surpassing optical specifications required in upcoming missions such as Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), Single Aperture Far Infrared Observatory (SAFIR), International X-ray Observatory (IXO), and Space Interferometry Mission (SIM Lite).  Aluminum 6061-T6 has been used extensively in past optical designs and it will continue to play a critical role in these and future NASA missions.","Some of the potential applications of super-polished Aluminum 6061-T6 relative to the needs of NASA include the post-polishing of diamond point turned mirrors to remove the surface grooves, greatly enhancing the optical performance of the mirror in a cost-effective manner.  In addition, mirrors fabricated with super-polished Aluminum 6061-T6 dovetail with NASA's needs for upcoming missions such as Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), Single Aperture Far Infrared Observatory (SAFIR), International X-ray Observatory (IXO), and Space Interferometry Mission (SIM Lite).  Aluminum 6061-T6 has been used extensively in past optical designs and it will continue to play an important role in future missions.  For example, the TPF mission, designed to detect very faint and small planets orbiting other stars, could benefit greatly from the super-polished Aluminum 6061-T6 mirror surfaces especially in the manufacturing of the fold mirrors.  It is critical that all of the mirrors used to resolve the star signal from the planet's faint, reflected light have minimal scatter signatures with low mid-spatial frequencies to address the requirement for high resolution and low beam dispersion in planet detection.  The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM Lite) which consists of two Michelson configured interferometers and a telescope, may also benefit from the Aluminum super-polished mirrors.  Specifically, there is potential to super-polish the fine steering mirror (FSM) in the Guide 2 telescope.","The super-polishing technology is a fundamental improvement to a basic manufacturing process which will enable mirror components to operate near theoretical limits. Economically priced, super-polished Aluminum 6061-T6 mirrors will have a broad market pull because 2D and 3D mirrors are a critical optical components in a variety of markets.Examples of targeted applications of super-polished Aluminum 6061-T6 relative to other government agencies include Concentrating Solar Power mirrors for research programs at DoE run facilities such as National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories.  Fine steering mirrors and component mirrors for imaging and remote sensing for DoD and Defense Missile Agency.  Some targeted commercial applications of super-polished Aluminum 6061-T6 include component mirrors for imaging/scanning instruments used in semiconductor manufacturing lines.  High energy laser reflectors also require superior metal surfaces; otherwise surface defects absorb too much incident energy causing mirrors to catastrophically fail.  And finally, super-polishing of Aluminum mirrors for concentrating solar power (CSP) systems is another commercial application that would benefit from a fast, automated, and economical manufacturing process.

To accommodate this in a grazing incidence design, extremely thin mirrors are formed in concentric shell configurations. A slumping technique has been demonstrated with such thin, lightweight shells. However, the optical surface is found to contain a significant amount of mid-spatial frequency errors. It is proposed to demonstrate  a sub-aperture figuring technique that does not impart mid-spatial frequencies to the optical substrate geometries planned for integration into next-generation X-ray telescopes.Reactive Atom Plasma (RAP) is a sub-aperture, atmospheric pressure, non-contact figuring technology that relies on a deterministic gas-phase etching of the optical surface with high material removal rates. RAP has already been demonstrated as a very credible approach for fabricating the lightweight wedges required for the assembly of such mirrors. RAP is especially suitable for damage-free processing of extremely lightweight mirrors given the non-contact operation, and its ability to ameliorate sub-surface damage. The tool footprint is a Gaussian and hence has a limited capability to both impart mid-spatial errors, as well as to fix them. In phase 1, we plan on demonstrating the ability of the RAP process to impart minimal mid-spatial errors into the optical surface while a figuring demonstration using adjustable footprints is planned for phase 2.","Key NASA applications that could immediately use the technology are those involving high energy X-ray telescopes such as NuSTAR and Constellation-X. The technology developed is also applicable to other NASA programs that seek to minimize payload without sacrificing sensor performance. Phases 1 and 2 of this proposal will also create the core competencies required to minimize mid-spatial frequency errors on glass optics of any size and shape, and given the preponderance of glass optics used by NASA for both space and ground-based observation, we expect this technology to be applied to many future NASA observation programs.","Other optics applications involve lithography, surveillance tracking and fire-control systems with various commercial and DoD agencies. Making precision surfaces with a high aspect ratio is a common problem across optics, semiconductors, compound semiconductors, photo-voltaics etc. The high aspect ratio results from a need to reduce mass (as in the case of lightweight mirrors), improve device performance/packaging (as in semiconductors), decrease costs (as in photo-voltaics).

With a low thrust, however, Hall thrusters need to operate for a long period of time to achieve the necessary  of the mission. For these missions, the lifetime requirements can reach into tens of thousands of hours. For Hall thrusters, the most important life-limiting process is the erosion of the channel walls. However, experimental verification of lifetime is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, computational method is a useful tool to predict thruster lifetime. Many of the Hall thruster lifetime models were developed, and some of theses models gave quite promising results. However, while qualitatively interesting, the results did not match well with experiment. The reason of this discrepancy is that these numerical models assume electrons as a fluid. The proposed innovation will provide a better understanding of the erosion physics and will be useful for future thruster development with low cost and time. This tool also will allow to aid in the acceptance and implementation of Hall thrusters as a primary propulsion device through improving confidence of their long term reliability.",The erosion model proposed here would be of use to NASA personnel to predict the lifetime of Hall thrusters.

They all need an accurate tool which can predict the lifetime for developing Hall thrusters. Recently, Space Systems/Loral has developed the BEPPA code for modeling plume interactions with spacecraft. They chose the detailed electron fluid model developed by Boyd at University of Michigan. It is known that the detailed model results are very sensitive to the channel exit conditions. The model proposed here can provide accurate initial conditions for plasma plume simulations for the hybrid model.

Busek has identified three attractive light metal propellants:  magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and a eutectic (Mg/Zn).  These metals are plentiful and practical alternatives to Xe and Kr, which are expensive and scarce, and Bi, which is overly condensable and requires a high voltage power processing unit (PPU) to reach velocities of interest.  Because Mg and Zn are lightweight, specific impulse > 3000 s will be available with a near term, low voltage PPU, decreasing propellant mass and program and hardware costs.  Both metals have favorable ionization properties, implying high efficiencies are possible.  Mg can also be combusted with water in a rocket, enabling a multi-mode propulsion system where the Hall thruster and rocket share propellant.  The availability of a high thrust impulsive mode can greatly decrease delta V and trip times for SMD spacecraft.These light metals are non-toxic and solid at room temperature.  They can be stored and fed to a thruster as a wire.  For Zn and Mg/Zn, liquid distribution is also feasible.  Life testing will be low cost because the light metals are inexpensive and self pumping; they will condense on the vacuum chamber wall.  Vapor pressure curves suggest minimal spacecraft interactions. In-situ propellant production is also possible.  Mg, for example, can be extracted from Martian regolith using solar energy.The key innovation in this proposal is the use of light metals to fuel a Hall thruster.  In Phase I, Busek will design and demonstrate a wire based light metal feed system that will be integrated with an existing 1-2 kW bismuth vapor Hall Effect thruster.  Busek will then demonstrate a Mg, Zn, or Mg/Zn discharge and measure its operating parameters. Finally, Busek will lay out a dedicated thruster and feed system to be built and tested in Phase II.","Light metal vapor may be a better propellant option for high power missions than Xe, Kr, or Bi.  Both Mg and Zn are non-toxic, condensable, plentiful, and inexpensive, and easy to ionize.  Because these metals have favorable vapor pressure curves, high temperatures are not required to avoid condensation inside the thruster, and spacecraft interactions will be minimal by comparison with Bi.Because both metals are much lighter than Xe, high specific impulse will be available from low voltage PPUs.  This makes the technology well suited for high Delta V SMD missions.  Examples include exploration missions to asteroids, comets, and other small bodies, as well as outer planets.  Sample return missions are also enabled.Light metal Hall thrusters can also accomplish valuable missions to the moon and mars.  One possibility is the deployment of multiple robotic spacecraft into lunar orbit form Busek's ESPA orbit maneuvering system, (OMS).  A high power cluster would even support for manned missions.  Transport of fuel and cargo to the Moon and Mars is possible. In-situ propellant utilization is a distinct possibility.  Earth return missions from Mars could be fueled by Mg present in Martian regolith.  A high power system could be extensively ground tested, greatly reducing risk.  Such a test is affordable because Mg and Zn will condense on water-cooled panels.","Light metal Hall thruster technology may enhance many critical DoD and commercial missions such as satellite orbit raising and repositioning.  Zinc and magnesium offer performance similar to xenon with the possibility of long term, low maintenance, solid propellant storage.  If a wire feed system proves practical, no tankage is required.  Spacecraft interaction issues should be minimal by comparison with bismuth.  Mg and Zn Hall thrusters could be integrated with Busek's EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) Orbit Maneuvering System, which presently carries a multi-mode propulsion system based upon hydrazine and xenon.  A Mg or Mg/Zn Hall thruster could be paired with a Mg-water rocket to provide both high thrust and high Isp.  The two systems would share propellant feed system components, tanks, and fuel.Light metal thrusters also have terrestrial applications.  A zinc plasma thruster can be used for zinc plasma spraying.  Zinc is an extremely common metal coating.  Zinc spraying is normally accomplished by feeding zinc in wire or powder form into a heated gun, where it is melted and sprayed on to the part to be coated using combustion gases and/or auxiliary compressed air.",Electrostatic Thrusters; Feed System Components; In-situ Resource Utilization; Metallics; Propellant Storage

When integrated into a full propulsion system, this pump will increase payload mass fraction, reliability, safety, and operating flexibility.  The same pump can be used for the main engine, attitude control thrusters, and fuel transfer, since the pump provides variable pressure at variable flow without using extra consumables. The pistonless design avoids sliding seals, which can cause problems for piston pumps. No precision components are needed, and all active components can be redundant and/or contamination-tolerant.

Specifically, the sensors would be integrated onto the load bearing seams and/or outer balloon mesh surface of the pressurized balloon system to accurately and continually measure axial loads.  Large axial load forces and wide/extreme temperature ranges (-90oC to >450oC) are typical for planetary balloon missions, therefore a durable, flexible, and thermally stable sensor material.  NanoSonic would use its highly flexible, low-modulus Metal RubberTM (MRTM) materials as strain/pressure sensors that are capable of large cyclic deformation without failure.  MRTM is a free-standing nanocomposite material produced by the layer-by-layer combination of high performance polymers and electrically-conducting metal nanoparticles that provide durability and recoverability for sensor transduction, and a wide thermal operation range.  Importantly, MRTM can behave like a rubber band in that it can be folded and compressed for stowage and then can be deployed and continually pressurized and stretched without failure during operation.  Also, because of the very low amount of metallic nanoclusters in the system (<0.02 volume %), the sensor system is extremely low-weight and would not alter the performance of the balloon.","In the near future, NASA plans to use light-weight and lower cost terrestrial and planetary superpressure vehicles for space exploration and to conduct scientific studies to gather important information about the universe and atmosphere.  Incorporating nanostructured sensor materials into/onto the balloon itself will provide for the means to push the limits beyond current capabilities and would also allow for more reliable flight missions.  Nanostructured Metal RubberTM sensors that do not alter or impair the mass-density or modulus of the balloon membrane would provide the ability to measure and monitor the axial pressure that is exerted during a mission.  There is much commercial potential for low-weight high strain sensors for scientific balloons and similar inflatable systems, specifically for NASA and the aerospace industry.  NanoSonic's low modulus Metal RubberTM sensor plies and multi-element sensor arrays have unique applications in systems where strain is large and conventional stress and strain sensors mechanically fail.","There is a large market for low-weight high strain sensors for scientific balloons and similar inflatable systems, specifically for NASA and the aircraft industry.

Balloon-based Mars exploration has the capability to cover a larger portion of the Martian surface than is accessible via a rover and to provide better resolution than is available from satellites. Due to the low density of the Martian atmosphere, the balloon envelope for even a small payload is quite large (tens of meters in diameter); therefore, balloon deployment is a major challenge for a Mars balloon.  A ground launched balloon, as compared to descent launched, allows a longer time constant for deployment, more control over the timing of the deployment, and, if coupled with a rover, also allows more control over the location of deployment. A challenge to ground deployment is the possibility of the envelope being damaged during deployment by winds, surrounding rocks, or parts of the associated lander.  Aurora's Shielded Mars Balloon Launcher (SMBL) concept addresses this challenge by using inflatable structures to provide a safe environment for balloon inflation and deployment. The proposed SMBL system has a 15 kg mass and packed volume of 0.15 m^3, and is therefore feasible as a secondary payload on existing Mars exploration missions.",The SMBL system is intended for use on Mars exploratory missions. Aurora believes the SMBL system has the potential to be light and scientifically valuable enough to be included on multiple missions.

In addition the concept could be applied to surface exploration of other planets with additional design work.,"The SMBL concept is also marketable in terrestrial applications where autonomous exploration is valuable.

A candidate launch vehicle could use 7 modules for the first stage, 4 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the fourth.  Whittinghill Aerospace proposes to investigate many modular designs for 3, 4, and 5 stage vehicles of different (solid, liquid, and hybrid) propellant types.

Inc. proposes to develop/design an integrated propulsion, power, ACS, and separation module for secondary ESPA payloads. The standardized secondary payload orbit maneuvering system (OMS) will have; 1) 200 W or 600 W Hall effect thruster system for primary propulsion, 2) Xe cold gas thrusters for propulsive ACS, 3) solar array, batteries and power conditioning with steady state power of ¡Ö230/680W and 4) an integral structure that supports the payload and a LightBand separation mechanism for the ESPA ring. The proposed system architecture is based upon an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA).  Because the ESPA OMS has power, avionics, and propulsion, it is a free flying spacecraft capable of delivering payloads to disparate altitudes and inclinations.  In Phase I, Busek will design an OMS to meet NASA mission needs including deploying large numbers of micro satellites and CubeSats.  Preliminary analysis suggests the each secondary OMS can provide 780 m/sec delta velocity to a 125 kg payload.  A key Phase I activity will be a prototypical orbital deployers adapter for clusters of CubeSat.  With this adapter, the system could deliver large numbers of CubeSats to discrete, pre-defined orbits.  Phase II products will include a clustering adapter ready to fly in 2010, along with the OMS propulsion system.","The proposed system can distribute secondary payloads among different predefined orbits.   The proposed system will increase the number and value of flight opportunities for NASA and University researchers by more than an order of magnitude.  Adapting the P-POD system for Cubesats to the OMS it could deliver CubeSats, a 125 kg payload, or a mix thereof to widely disparate orbits and destinations.  NASA Ames estimates there is an estimated 13,500 kilograms of excess lift capacity for ESPA payloads available between now and 2013.","There are at least 3 upcoming Air Force ESPA class S/C (15  secondary payload rideshare opportunities) currently scheduled.  Each EELV launch provides an opportunity for the secondary payload OMS and associated launch space to be purchased or procured.  For the military, this capability will produce launch opportunities and missions of interest to customers such as MDA, DoD, NRO, and industry users. For commercial users, a successful demonstration will greatly increase the utility of ESPA-derived launch opportunities and will increase demand of ESPA secondary payload OMS within the commercial industry.

To achieve this goal, Eclipse proposes in Phase I to employ EclipseVEDTM technology and demonstrate automated control systems capable of in-flight thermal regulation of a cubesat or other small satellite. Phase I will include the construction of a single small satellite panel for in-house testing and principally work on the hardware and software required for autonomous regulation.  In Phase II, Eclipse will build a complete multi-panel cubesat and work with Marshall Space Center to lab test a completely functional prototype.","The electrochromic technology and its control systems suggested in the present proposal possess a wide range of  applications relative to the needs of the Agency in satellite, spacecraft and component thermal control, space communications, chemical and biological monitoring of environmental control and  life support systems, and in optical processing of information.

Our SSP-IP stack offers Internet-based protocols that provide seamless network command and control continuity between terrestrial and space-based platforms as well as networked operations of distributed ground stations. NASA will benefit from our SSP-IP by increasing simplicity of seamless network transmission and lowering cost. In Phase I BCI will demonstrate the feasibility of using SSP TCP to reliably transmit space imagery from a Nanosat launching vehicle by building, testing and integrating with hardware a preliminary version, which will demonstrate a TRL-level 3 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, BCI plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate the low complexity and embeddability to NASA's platform with high performance. The demonstrated results will offer NASA capabilities to use our reliable SSP TCP in future ground and spacecraft operations, increasing efficiency and saving money.","There are many potential NASA applications for BCI's SSP IP & TCP. As an enabler of Space Internet and TCP-based reliable communications for a NanoSat Launch Vehicle and for other small satellite launching vehicles and resource- and footprint-constrained space networked spacecrafts, the SSP IP & TCP can greatly improve communications for small spacecraft. It increases flexibility, decreases cost, and provides continuity between Earth and space networks. Our technology can be also applied for the International Space Station or the Moon and Mars Initiative. It will help astronauts, increasing their efficiency and success through seamless communications. The SSP IP stack will also provide sensor or embedded devices with IP capabilities, allowing NASA to offer the emerging products to private enterprise. Our SSP IP & TCP will not only save money, but it will also make space travel more effective and efficient.","The SSP IP & TCP is also directly applicable to commercial network applications that can benefit from wireless enhanced TCP performance, especially in devices that are resource constrained. Major private markets include cell phones and wireless packet networks for public IP access. Potential applications include wireless Internet access networks, performance management of wireless technology, and commercial sensor applications.

InterCAX's Composable Object technology provides the backend wrapping, model management, and simulation orchestration capabilities to the visual SysML-based mission model at the front end.The Composable Object technology has already demonstrated the ability to power SysML-based models with math simulation capabilities for early design stages. ParaMagic is a commercially available tool being used by early adopters of SysML at JPL. The Composable Object technology has also demonstrated the ability to associate detailed design and simulation models such as those created in CAD and FEA tools. However, a big gap exists in the SysML-based world for conceptual system design and the detailed system design-based world. If the detailed system design and simulation models could be wrapped as SysML objects and the simulations and workflows orchestrated by the Composable Object technology, it will cover the entire gamut of complex system modeling and analysis world from trade studies and optimization to project scheduling.The key objective of Phase 1 is to wrap both conceptual and detailed system design and simulation models as SysML objects which has not been done before, and to demonstrate continuity of mission concepts from simple to detailed implementation.","Several NASA laboratories are exploring Model-Based Engineering processes with pilot projects in SysML model development and simulation. InterCAX has worked with several such projects at JPL where its ParaMagic product is being evaluated for potential applications at both exploratory (e.g. TeamX environment) and development phases.

Current parametric space system cost estimation tools such as NAFCOM (NASA/Air Force Cost Model) and SSCM (Small Satellite Cost Model) provide good results when schedules and design and management approaches are similar to those in their existing databases primarily traditional approaches, but they can fall-flat when applied to programs focused on rapid design and development and/or very low costs.  To address these types of programs, more and better data is required.The Microcosm team proposes an approach similar to and complementary to earned value data collection and reporting.  In addition to gathering detailed actuals, this approach also requires cost and schedule forecast updates and forecast uncertainty estimates to be updated and collected as well as supplementary explanatory information.  With this additional data models can be improved, and program and task managers can be trained to become better forecasters.","The proposed solution will initially be targeted at low-cost, fast-turnaround NASA programs where it is expected to provide significant improvements to cost estimates.  It can be implemented at the part/subsystem level, the project level and/or the enterprise level and would ultimately be expected to be offered as an add-on to program management or earned value tools.  Over the longer-term, the approach would be expected to be implemented across the broader set of NASA programs.  This would result in not only improved cost estimates, but also near real-time monitoring of ongoing programs including cost and schedule forecasts (with uncertainties) rolled-up at any desired WBS level.  This visibility into program dynamics along with the ability to apply powerful analytics to model and analyze programs should enable tighter control and improved program related decision-making.","The non-NASA applications are very similar to the NASA ones improved quality and quantity of data driving improved cost models and improved cost estimates.  The capability would similarly be applicable to DoD and commercial spacecraft development activities with similar results anticipated.  If the approach were adopted NASA and/or DoD wide, it would drive most of the relevant aerospace primes and subcontractors to adopt it just as they have with earned value management.

This application will directly affect the development cost by avoiding the need to develop software from scratch and allowing the efficient reuse of flight software even across vehicles. Odyssey proposes to use NASA's Trick simulation environment to form the basis of the flight software executive and to use NASA's Common Model Library to form the basis for the reconfigurable modules. Trick is currently capable of producing a software architecture that is easily modified to allow the use of software modules in the production of a simulation framework. We are proposing modifying and adapting Trick for the production of software that easily moves out of the simulation realm and into the embedded flight software realm. Our proposed approach to providing reusable flight software is innovative in that it takes a well established open platform simulation tool and advances it to a level where it can be combined with reconfigurable software modules. This in turn can be used to produce highly reconfigurable flight software allowing for the same software development environment to be used across the entire life cycle of the system.","Reconfigurable and re-usable flight software has potential application to any developer of spacecraft with missions that are contained in the defined software module envelope. Additional modules will likely expand the potential scope and applicability. The range of ""potential post applications"" for NASA can include science missions, university sponsored science missions formation flying or constellation missions (i.e., missions with multiple identical, or nearly identical spacecraft), and ultimately service missions (e.g., weather, communications, etc.). Any NASA mission in the small spacecraft class would be a candidate for re-using the software.  The motivation to reduce cost will attract significant interest and buy-in once it is demonstrated on a real, flying spacecraft -- most probably on a NASA-based mission such as the ""small spacecraft build"" project.  Since this approach involves a paradigm shift among spacecraft developers, applying the same architecture and software on two similarly classed (but not identical) missions would provide the best proof.","Reconfigurable and re-usable flight software has potential application to any developer of spacecraft with missions that are contained in the defined software module envelope.

We recognized upon analyzing the constituents of the traditional process that a disproportionate fraction of time is spent working with software that falls under one of two categories - developed from scratch to suit the needs of a new mission, or recycling ""heritage code"" that subsequently requires extensive rework to achieve compatibility with a new system. The development segment devoted to software may never be truly compressed to zero, but significant measures can be taken to streamline the process. Code reusability has the potential to offer tangible savings. DNet is leveraging AFRL and NRL data standards to develop Application Programming Interfaces (API) that allow code modules to be ported to new systems with no modification of the application-level code and minimal modification of the subservient layers that facilitate compatibility with lower-level system facilities and transport layers. This API will facilitate the creation of a satellite system from modular applications that can be combined in such a way as to provide support for a wide range of missions and be completely reusable as the physical composition of the satellite is changed.","The standard Application Programming Interfaces and supporting tools developed through the course of this research have great utility to NASA for supporting the SBIRSat (e.g. Ames Research Center Small Satellite) program, which seeks more effective methods for constructing mission capability more rapidly and with lower cost. We would expect that the SBIRSat program is merely an opening for more widespread implementation of these standards, which could ultimately flow beyond the SBIRSat technology tracking into subsequent missions and eventually into larger programs.","We already have significant heritage in the development of these software standards and tools for our military customers, AFRL and NRL. The utility of the offered software classes and supporting tools are unique to spacecraft development, but there are ample opportunities in the commercial space area for this work to be embraced and extended by the larger aerospace community.

QuickDirect will address the generic needs of science instrument control and will provide a template for the control of mission specific detectors and mechanisms. It will contain modules for command & telemetry handling, engineering data collection and monitoring, memory upload and downloads, and software and hardware watch dog maintenance. QuickDirect will contain common command and telemetry interfaces (serial, UART, Mil-Std-1553-B) as well examples of mechanism and detector control modules. QuickDirect provides a template for the development of the specific instrument control software, freeing the QuickDirect user to focus on the interfaces and specialized processes that are specific to the detectors and mechanism, knowing that the generic payload control requirements are fully and effectively covered.  While the software package is designed to operate on a processor platform dedicated to operation of the instrument, the software itself is not tied to any specific operating system or platform.  Notably, QuickDirect will leverage the QuickFlex Reconfigurable Logic Manager (RLM), a set of proven software that enables simple and effective exploitation of the full range of capabilities offered by field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices, including partial dynamic reconfiguration.  The QuickDirect software package will be thoroughly reviewed, tested and documented.","Many of the satellites deployed by NASA are built in-house at JPL/GFC. QuickDirect provides a useful technology that is broadly applicable and can be inserted in various internal NASA programs where payload development is planned or underway, including: numerous science programs, ground support systems, and new command and telemetry, and storage technologies on various spacecraft. Additionally, other organizations providing payloads for various NASA missions can save NASA millions of dollars in development costs and redundancies by using the proposed QuickDirect technologies. Smaller organizations which have innovative technologies, often for small satellites, lack the development tools and history to cost-effectively create supporting payload software. Organizations of all sizes will benefit from the increased flexibility of the innovative software-managed reconfigurable computing processing platform. NASA will reduce the time and costs of developing payload software, with QuickDirect's ready modification for the particular payload instrument, a working example system with documentation, test suites and a design for ground test systems, while providing reliable payload control software in an efficient and highly cost-effective manner.","The DOD has a significant focus on space and satellite technologies as outlined in the DOD's 2015 and 2020 future planning. Organizations such as the AFRL Space Vehicles Directorate, Navy SPAWAR and US Army Space Missile Defense Command (SMDC) are among a few of the DOD organizations that have various satellite technology payload projects. The QuickDirect technologies can benefit the DOD's programs and the vendors who provide payloads for them. Other applications include the commercial satellite industry.

Rather than focusing on libraries and other failed strategies, the contractor proposes to use the modern architectural concepts of service-oriented architectures, persistence and predictive computing to build a real-time executive for flight systems in a standards-based and platform-independent manner.  The reuse infrastructure being built in parallel consists of a framework and related toolset that makes it easy for engineers to identify and retrieve reusable assets that provide proven value.  The contractor will develop specifications for the common software executive and library of reusable support modules during Phase I.

A market survey will be conducted as part of the effort to scope the commercialization prospects and develop an initial business plan that will be used to interest potential pilot projects in partnering for a Phase II effort.","The common software executive and library of reusable support modules being specified by this effort have direct applicability across NASA in aeronautical, science, space and exploration missions.  Because the common executive software and associated library will be built using modern architectural concepts, it will be portable across platforms and operate on different processors.  As such, it could be used to mechanize on-board software systems in small satellites, science instruments/experiments and commercial applications like robotics.  The facilitating reuse infrastructure being built in parallel represents a product that can be used by just about anyone to make reuse determinations and findings.  The organizational framework and tools being constructed provide engineers with a way to put reuse to work in government, commercial and academic environments.","The common software executive and library of reusable support modules has applicability in real-time systems such as those developed for defense, manufacturing, space, software production and telecommunications.  The facilitating reuse infrastructure that we are developing in parallel consisting of our framework and toolkit seems to have broader applicability because it can be used by anyone to identify and retrieve reusable assets that fit their needs.

Flash Ladar sensors are 3D video systems that return range and intensity information for each pixel in real time, and is functionally equivalent to 16000 range finders on one chip.  Actual data collected, at the JPL mars yard, using ASC's compact Flash Ladar system demonstrated in a previous NASA phase I SBIR effort confirm that the ASC Flash LADAR Video Camera (FLVC) system can meet the requirements for Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL).   The FLVC's small size, low power and very fast range data frame rate (30Hz) make the sensor ideal for EDL missions.  Flash Ladar is ideal for determining real-time spacecraft trajectory, speed, orientation, and range to the planet surface, as well as evaluating potential hazards at the landing site.  Sloped ground, craters, rocks and surface composition are among the potential hazards.  The ""framing camera"" nature, of Flash LADAR systems, makes them well suited as hazard avoidance sensors for EDL.   An existing Phase two effort is fabricating a compact FLVC for delivery to NASA for field testing, however the system is not hardened.  A proposed Phase 2 effort would produce a space qualified sensor engine which can be integrated with the system being delivered to NASA.  The sensor engine is the break-though enabling technology for the FLVC.  This proposed effort will develop techniques to improve the sensors measurement accuracy.  ASC will develop improved calibration techniques, improved sensor non-uniformity and improved on-board real time automatic range correction.

Due to the rapid expanse of space exploration, a need has been identified for the proper handling of extraterrestrial samples.  Not only must the sample return system maintain the physical integrity of the sample in sometimes rigorous conditions (e.g., rover driving loads, diurnal temperature fluctuations, cruise, atmospheric entry and impact), it must address potential contamination issues.  The samples themselves can become contaminated and they also present a serious contamination danger to the Earth.  Therefore, the highest possible level of precaution must be exercised when handling the outer space samples until there are studies proving them harmless.  In this Phase I project, we are proposing a ""foam-in-the-capsule"" system for containing and encapsulating samples of extraterrestrial material to be returned to Earth for detailed study.  The system will eliminate or dramatically reduce the risk of contamination on flight hardware and ease the handling of the sample on the spacecraft, in landing, and in the process of sample transfer to the appropriate facility for investigation.  The ""foam-in-the-capsule"" system combines the effectiveness of encapsulation and flexibility to improve design according to new scientific data or changes in the capsule carrier's interior.  The proposed system consists of a compliant outer restraint based upon the DoverPacREG system for containment of potent pharmaceutical powders and a foam-in-place encapsulation process.  The decontamination foam will be effectively sealed within the inflatable polymer capsules.  The dimensions of the capsules are variable to fit the dimensions of the sample to be encapsulated.

However, most geospatial software programs use different internal formats and are often incapable of ingesting data in HDF-EOS format. Therefore, the development of capability for converting NASA HDF-EOS data into formats compatible with GIS/Geospatial software programs will greatly enhance the interoperability and public use of EOS data.  NASA benefits because images collected by their satellites will be more accessible to the GIS community and other geospatial data users.  The proposed HDF-EOS toolbar will also represent a significant improvement over the HDF-EOS to GeoTIFF Conversion (HEG) tool, which is currently used by the GIS/Geospatial community.","We will provide various entities from the national scale to the local scale with improved tools to increase the usability of NASA EOS data in GIS/Geospatial software programs.  Some of these entities include: universities, state and federal agencies, private consulting companies, etc.  Because the proposed tools are directed at increasing accessibility and facilitating the use of NASA EOS satellite data, essentially anyone who uses or is interested in using satellite imagery are potential end users of our product.  We will provide users with information and training on incorporating the HDF-EOS toolbar into their operations/research.",Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools

These techniques yield higher-resolution measures than ever before of environmental parameters by fusing synoptic imagery and time-series measurements. These techniques are general and relevant to observational data, including raster, vector and scalar, and can be applied in all earth and environmental science domains.  Because they can be highly automated and are parallel, they scale to large spatial domains and are well-suited to change and gap detection.  This makes it possible to analyze spatial and temporal gaps in information and facilitates within-mission re-planning to optimize the allocation of observational resources.As a demonstration project, we have selected a standard climatological metric and will show that we can generate an analogue of this metric by using our method. In particular, we will use the MineTool algorithms to derive an analogue for Palmer's Drought Severity Index.  We will compute this index for a region of the western United States using a set of archival terrestrial products (e.g., Landsat, AVHRR, Aqua/Terra) and a set of weather and climate products (e.g., NOAA satellites, federal, state, local hydrological time-series).   Then, using the same dataset, we will produce a physics-based model from the MineTool analysis of the data.","MineTool's automation and parallelization features mean that it will be possible, for example, to run continuous monitoring and data assimilation operations for important environmental indices, with great socio-economic significance, in a 24/7 mode.  The drought index is only one example and one can imagine a variety of others including atmospheric CO2 which is not typically measured by AQMDs (Air Quaity Management Districts) but is destined to become an important index of regulatory important and value in carbon-trading.  We envision a continuous operation where on-going receipt of current data can be woven into a cumulative geo-spatial fabric of observations to reveal gaps and anomalies along the temporal dimension.  This information can be used to support mission re-planning and new mission design as well as establishing a long-term baseline record for environmental monitoring.","Satellite observations have been integrated with ground-based observational data for decades but MineTool will extend the user base for these data more deeply and broadly than ever before.  MineTool promises to simplify the application of satellite observations to broad class of important social and economic problems by providing a tool that can be used to build locally-meaningful parametric models for resource management, planning, as well as research and education. MineTool provides a platform for a broad range of data and users and to do it in a scalable way that exploits the expanding computational resources available throughout society. For example, each farm community could have its model specifically for its crops and its conditions, each urban area could have its model accounting for its coastal or inland location, traffic patterns, and population distribution.

The leverage of PRL for the project provides significant benefits, but even without such its use, the PEP system is suitable for executing, monitoring, and projecting at least portions of any vehicle or habitat procedure.","Because the design approach for the PEP system is modular and adaptive, there is a broad range of commercialization opportunities: Military squads who need to use remote robotic systems for tactical surveillance and engagement, such as the US Army Maneuver Center and the US Army Infantry. These groups are currently developing Operational Requirements Documents that specify the need for remotely controlled robotic systems. The US Marine Corps is also developing an ORD for a larger, remotely controlled system (Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle). Search and rescue teams, who need flexible, robust, controllers that will be deployed to natural disasters. The National Guard has planned the deployment of multiple remotely controlled robots for search and rescue. The robots will be stationed with various National Guard units, ready to be sent to any area that needs robotic support. The Department of Energy (DoE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), need robust robotic control for cleanup of hazardous waste sites and chemical contamination. Large amounts of highly toxic wastes were stored on sites maintained by the DOE and pose significant hazards to personnel who need to characterize the level of contamination. The EPA has also been actively working to characterize other contaminated sites. Both the EPA and DOE have used robots fitted with monitors and sensors in order to reliably and accurately characterize the site and a high level of control is needed.",Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Expert Systems

However, there is not a reusable framework and code base that can be used to create such automation tools even thought there are many commonalties in the functionality and form of such tools. As a consequence, existing automation tools cannot be easily adapted across missions or languages.We proposed the development of an authoring and debugging framework for the definition of spacecraft operation plans. The framework provides a reusable code base that facilitates the creation of authoring and debugging tools tailored to a particular language and particular user type. Traditional text based authoring will be complemented with graphical representations of plans that provide friendly abstractions of a language's low level execution details. Traditional in-line debugging techniques will be enhanced with context-based visual debugging techniques suitable to understand the rationale of why a plan or rule has been applied and the interactions between different plans running in parallel.  The Phase I prototype will illustrate the utility of the proposed framework by developing editors and debuggers for PLEXIL and SCL.","The proposed framework for graphical authoring and visual debugging will provide NASA with a unified toolkit with enough out of the box functionality to reduce the time and manpower needed to build IDEs for NASA command languages.

It is estimated that 2 to 4 million cardiopulmonary patients in the U.S. require supplementary oxygen; approximately 500,000 of which require continuous oxygen therapy. Current means to supply oxygen include compressed oxygen cylinders (heavy and expensive); liquid oxygen (cryogenic and expensive); and molecular sieve-bed oxygen concentrators that use molecular sieve technology. Weight, size, power, and cost requirements for current commercially available oxygen concentrators have been the major hurdles for gaining the market acceptance, thus limited availability to those in need of oxygen therapy. With Lynntech's advanced electrochemical oxygen concentrator technology, this need can be satisfied very easily to improve the quality of lifestyle of those in need of a portable, compact oxygen generator.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Biomedical and Life Support; Portable Life Support

The approach is conceptually similar to pH or urinalysis test strips which allow multiple measurements in a linear format.  The main difference is that we are proposing test strips at the nanoscale, shrunk in size over 100,000-fold in surface area, allowing multiple sensing elements to be included in a small area.  The fluorescence from each element assesses the concentration of each measured analyte.  In this Phase I, we will fabricate, test, and characterize test nanostrips and fabricate ones for bone metabolism.  For Phase II, we will develop an entire suite of nanostrips for cardiac function, bone metabolism, liver function, lipid analysis, and hormone measurements.

AM will enhance the current clinical gold standard immunoassay methodology by using its proprietary bead-based aptamer selection process to select dithiophosphate backbone-modified (PS2) ""thio"" aptamers (PS2-thioaptamers) as replacements for antibodies in immunoassays.  The PS2-thioaptamers are binding agents with functionality comparable to antibodies but with very long shelf-life under ambient environment storage.  The PS2-thioaptamers bind much more tightly to their targets than regular aptamers without sacrificing specificity, and are much more nuclease resistant.  AM's bead-based process allows fast selection and identification of PS2-thioaptamers, which cannot be directly selected using older aptamer technologies such as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX).  AM will demonstrate PS2-thioaptamer integration into a state-of-the-art microfluidics instrument from Sandia National Laboratory that meets NASA's form factor needs for space flight.  The Phase I Project will demonstrate detection and quantification of osteocalcin (OC) using a PS2-thioaptamer in a prototype microfluidics device (TRL-4).  Phase II will entail completing the panel of biomarkers for bone demineralization and delivering a prototype of the system to NASA.  In Phase III, AM and Sandia will deliver a flight test system to NASA and begin FDA validation of the system for potential use in clinical diagnostics of osteoporosis as well as other conditions.","The combination of AM's proprietary PS2-thioaptamers with the microfluidics technology from Sandia National Laboratory will result in a biomarker diagnostic system that is compatible with long duration spaceflight.  The PS2-thioaptamers offer performance comparable to antibodies but have a very long shelf life and can be stored in ambient conditions.  The Sandia microfluidics instrument is very sensitive (fM detection limit), small, low mass, easy to operate and draws little power.  The combination of these two technologies would result in a flight system that would enable NASA to easily detect and quantify numerous biomarkers simultaneously during long duration missions and would also enable AM to develop for NASA clinical diagnostic assays for many conditions of interest.  The stage of development of these technologies as well as the use of proven clinical diagnostic immunoassay methodologies enables AM to develop and deliver a flight test system quickly for near-term NASA flight research into many conditions of interest.","A PS2-thioaptamer assay for potentially any condition that has FDA-approved biomarkers could be developed and integrated into the microfluidics instrument, which provides significant clinical diagnostic market commercialization potential.  The PS2-thioaptamer binding agents could also be used in almost any detection/quantification technology thus opening the possibility of faster diagnostic market commercialization using currently approved instrument hardware.  Prior to FDA-approved diagnostic applications, the PS2-thioaptamers could readily be used in a manner similar to antibodies for life science research. Additionally, since the PS2-thioaptamers are very nuclease resistant, it is possible that the same binding agents selected for diagnostic/research use could also be used effectively as therapeutics.",Biomedical and Life Support; Biomolecular Sensors

We are proposing to build an Individualized Fatigue Meter that incorporates light inputs, sleep history; physical activity; other physiological inputs; and brief performance tests (e.g. winSCAT, PVT SelfTest) to provide immediate individualized feedback about alertness. For the past 8 years, we have been actively developing many of the system components (funded by NASA, DOD, and NIH) that can be leveraged in this project. The result of this project through Phase II will be a system prototype that can be deployed in space analog environments for validation testing and ultimately deployed on ISS and missions to Moon and Mars. The critical need for an Individualized Fatigue Meter has been identified as a priority outlined in the Behavioral Health and Performance Integrated Research Plan GAP 1.1.1. During Phase I, we will perform a literature review of fatigue monitoring technologies, develop an engineering requirements document, and identify key features of mathematical models needed to design a state-of-art Individualized Fatigue Meter (Phase I TRL of 3-4).","The Individualized Fatigue Meter will meet the specific requirements of space exploration to provide astronauts with feedback about alertness and fatigue levels as well as select fatigue countermeasures. It will be designed to be unobtrusive, transparent to crews, and require minimal crew time or effort to operate. The resulting product will be primarily relevant to NASA's Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) research Gap 1.1.1 (What are the best measures and tools to use for assessing decrements in cognitive function due to fatigue and other aspects of spaceflight?). When validated, the Individualized Fatigue Meter will be deployed in the constellation program, lunar and Mars missions. The individualized Fatigue Meter will also be adapted for use by Mission Control personnel (e.g., working long duty schedules or on Mars sol), and for use during training and activities overseas (i.e., launch/recovery in Russia).","Given the large inter-individual differences in performance vulnerability to fatigue that have been scientifically documented, an Individualized Fatigue Meter has potential commercial applications in industries where human performance is required 24/7, with precise operational constraints and important safety implications. Examples of this relevance include but are not limited to military operations, first responders, transportation workers, power plant operators, hospital personnel, manufacturing work forces, etc. Military operations, for example, involve sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment, particularly during sustained operations and/or when multiple time zones are crossed during deployment. The Army has an estimated 238,000 soldiers deployed overseas in 120 countries (source: US Army, 2006) coordinating to provide continuous global 24-7 operations. An individualized fatigue meter has the potential to provide biologically optimized work schedules and recommendations for fatigue countermeasures such as power naps, caffeine, light exposure, countermeasures that will increase safety and the likelihood of successful operations.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical and Life Support; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Database Development and Interfacing; Expert Systems; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Tools

The crew will be working very closely for extended periods of time and the distance between the spacecraft and earth-bound flight surgeons will prevent real-time communication. Breakdown of morale or the psychology of crew may result in increased stress, conflict, erratic behaviors, reduced cohesion, and perhaps even rebellion. Flight surgeons have stated the need for unobtrusive monitoring to help detect if crews are having difficulties with coping with long duration spaceflight environments.NASA has tens of thousands of procedures for the space shuttle and ISS, and the new Constellation vehicles will also have thousands of procedures. These procedures, and the training in performing them, represent the models and data necessary to build a behavioral assessment tool. Currently procedures are authored in Word. Under this paradigm, developing behavioral models of crew procedure performance would require re-coding all procedures by hand. However, the Constellation program is planning to use an XML representation of procedures, which facilitates automatic translation. Nominal performance metrics can determined during training and then compared during the actual missions. Deviations between the nominal and current performance can be flagged for additional attention. Since crew members can perform upwards of hundreds of procedures a week, there will be substantial data with which to assess crew behavioral performanceThe long-term goal of this project is to develop a set of applied technologies that can monitor crew health and cohesiveness in an unobtrusive manner and identify potential abnormalities for feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons for further investigation. The goal of the Phase I will be to develop a set of recommendations regarding technologies and techniques to accomplish the objectives and a conceptual design of a system that implement the recommendations","This technology could be applied to all current and future NASA missions. While it is being developed for application to long duration space flight operations, the techniques are amenable to application in shorter duration flight operations as well, such as related to the International Space Station and Space Shuttle, are obvious application areas. This is particularly true with respect to behavioral and psychological health (whereas crew cohesiveness is anticipated to be less of an issue as duration decreases).  This technology could also be applied to NASA's Aerospace activities.  For example, it could be used to measure stress on air traffic controllers. Adaption to commercial airlines, in which the standardized procedures and repetitive nature of their execution within the close confines of an aircraft facilitates the modeling and establishment of norms for the behavior for individual crew.","The military has teams of individuals working in high stress environments over long durations. Examples include submarine crews, aircraft carriers, embedded special operations forces and pilots flying unmanned air vehicles for hours on end.  We expect this same technology to transfer to military applications.  A variety of commercial activities also have similar characteristics to NASA missions.  As mentioned, air traffic controllers work in high-stress environment where small mistakes can be costly.  Likewise, teams of operators control nuclear power plants, petrochemical plants, oil refineries, etc.  They often perform standard operating procedures and need to be monitored closely for degraded performance.  Even in situations in which lives or property are not at risk, monitoring and detecting problems with individual and team performance is useful for managers interested in achieving peak performance.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Expert Systems; On-Board Computing and Data Management

To achieve this, this Company has developed a plan to identify the specific technical requirements needed to modify the software to properly operate with the NASA space program.  This will include ensuring the software is unobtrusive, transparent to crews, requires minimal effort, and is compatible with NASA's current computing environment.  Additionally, this Company intends to use a rigorous and methodical approach for identifying specific behavioral patterns that would indicate possible crewmember health issues.  The current software product is designed to monitor a soldier's behavior in austere conditions relevant to the Special Forces Operating Environment.  This project is proposing to enhance the current software's capabilities by redesigning the software to monitor behavior for NASA, accept and assimilate feeds from other software (e.g., biometric information), develop feedback tools, and generate customized reports to give flight surgeons pertinent information for making informed decisions about a crewmember's health.","This software would be designed to monitor flight crew behavior for the purpose of identifying potential health issues and possibly other areas of interest, like team cohesion.  The software would provide a framework for NASA personnel to monitor and assess target behaviors demonstrated by the flight crew.  Each behavior would be stored in the software database where reports could be generated that depicts patterns of behavior.  Furthermore, these behaviors could be linked to video feeds via timestamps giving flight surgeons the capability of reviewing specific footage of tagged behaviors.  This would allow flight surgeons to not only identify possible behavioral patterns but also view the context in which these behaviors occurred.  This software could further link other information, like biometric data, to the behaviors.  For example:  A behavioral report may indicate that a crew member appeared agitated at a specific time period.  The flight surgeon would be able to view video footage at that specific point in time along with the crew member's heart rate.","One additional application of this software would be to assist the U.S. military with personnel suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  Specifically, this software could be used to monitor at risk personnel by monitoring their behavior and notifying medical staff of possible PTSD candidates.  This could be achieved by providing at risk personnel with a handheld device that family members could use to identify specific behaviors when they occur.  For example:  the spouse could mark when her husband had a panic attack and how long the attack lasted.  This information would be time stamped and sent back to a central database where it would be stored and used to monitor and assess behavioral patterns.  Furthermore, the at-risk military personnel could use this software to answer questions daily to gauge their health, which would also be immediately delivered to the database.  The software system could modify the questions asked of personnel based on their behaviors and responses to previous questions.  The system could then notify medical staff of personnel that are showing signs of PTSD.  Similarly, hospitals could use the same software to monitor outpatient recovery by allowing patients to assess their condition throughout the recovery process.   All assessments would be collected in a database that would monitor patient recovery based on assessment patterns and notify medical staff of possible recovery issues.",Computer System Architectures; Data Input/Output Devices; Database Development and Interfacing; Human-Computer Interfaces; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Software Development Environments

Detecting, reporting, and correlating related incidents are key to preventing future incidents.  NASA has made significant progress in standardizing the reporting of aviation incidents by developing electronic forms for reporting incidents.   While such forms improve report consistency, incident data are not represented in a way that enables computer-based reasoning across reports (e.g., automatic linking of related reports.)  TRACLabs proposes to develop a human factors incident-reporting tool for gathering incident data, documenting data in incident reports, and archiving incident data. We will define an XML-based semantic language for incident reporting to capture information about human factors incidents, including multi-modal data. We will develop software for authoring incident reports using this language, archiving these reports, and searching the archives using incident semantics. This project is innovative in defining an incident reporting language that uses an ontology-based vocabulary.  This enables improved tools for gathering incident data, and for authoring and archiving incident reports. The semantic indexing provided by the use of incident reporting language permits more sophisticated search of archives, including automatic identification of prior incidents potentially relevant to the current incident.","Incident reporting is an important part of handling issues that arise during missions. It can be challenging, however, to capture incident information accurately and to discover similarities between an incident and prior incidents.  These challenges are not specific to human factors incidents but are endemic in other types of incident reporting at NASA, including the reporting of space operations incidents, safety infractions, and accident investigations.  The proposed incident reporting language and authoring tools can be applied for these other types of incident reporting.  The language for capturing incident knowledge can be adapted by adjusting the domain ontologies used to represent the contents of incident categories. The authoring tools that produce reports using the incident reporting language can be used without change with new domain ontologies. The use of XML to develop the incident reporting language enables extending the language by adding tags for the special information needs of new domains.","Commercial tools for incident reporting are available in a diverse range of domains from crime incidents to corporate security incidents to customer complaints.  Like the proposed software, most of these products support electronic submission and reporting of incident data, and archival of incident reports. The proposed approach differs from these commercial tools in providing a semantic basis for customization and improved search, and in representing incidents in an XML-based language.  Such capabilities permit applying much of the incident reporting software developed for NASA in non-NASA applications.  Promising applications include reporting incidents arising in chemical and nuclear plants, such as incidents arising from human error during plant operations, and reporting medical incidents, such as incidents that arise when monitoring the aged or impaired in performing the activities of daily living.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Database Development and Interfacing; Human-Computer Interfaces

Daily food supplies require food packaged and sent from earth, preparation mechanisms and waste treatment. The window for food preservation could be 3-5 years. This will require food packaging that provides excellent barriers to water vapor and oxygen, is durable at the processing conditions (retort sterilizing, microwave processing), and has low mass. Storage and disposal of used food packaging becomes a significant issue. Incineration is a reasonable waste treatment strategy, but is incompatible with materials used currently for high barrier packaging, like aluminum foil (which leaves ash).TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop a multilayer nanocomposite film with superb resistance to permeation by water vapor and oxygen, for use as an extended shelf life food packaging material.  We propose to prepare nanocomposites from commercially available packaging plastics and TDA's surface-modified nanoparticles.  TDA's nanocomposite research has focused on the design of surface treatments to produce nanoparticles compatible with targeted host polymers.  We can form well-dispersed nanocomposites with several packaging plastics and have seen improved barrier properties  with nanoparticle contents less than 5%.  TRL at the end of the Phase II contract will be at Level 5.","The high barrier films developed in this project would compliment work by the Advanced Food Technology Project, which plans and develops food technologies for astronauts. New packaging technologies for long shelf life, non-foil food packaging are needed that are compatible with NASA's planned food processing and waste disposal methods.

Since barrier properties are one advantage of nanocomposites, packaging applications are a reasonable market.  However, difficulties in processing nanocomposites into traditional packaging plastics have delayed commercialization despite the significant promise (and hype) concerning nano-scale materials.  TDA's surface modified boehmite nanoparticles have been developed to be compatible with traditional processing methods in mind.  Our nanoparticles are easier to disperse in a wide range of plastics, using traditional polymer processing methods.  Successful development of high barrier nanocomposite films would find application in a variety of areas including consumer packaging, packaging for food and food service applications and medical packaging.

Prominent members of the Center for Advanced Processing and Packaging Studies (CAPPS) at OSU (e.g., Kraft Foods) have expressed strong interest in applying this NASA-funded technology to expand their market shares.","For long duration space exploration missions, crew members will find food whose natural characteristics are well preserved more appealing for consumption.  Packaging materials that offer an effective barrier against oxygen and moisture for maintaining food quality also offer a secondary benefit  boosting of the short-term behavior and morale of the crew.  Appealing food has a proven effect on physiological factors such as appetite, alertness, relaxation, and cognitive skills.  Cognitive skills and alertness are crucial during an extravehicular engineering task.  Another area of importance that would be met by the proposed packaging materials is in solid waste management within the spacecraft. Currently waste is collected and stored in bags that act as environmental barriers to prevent the escape of noxious odors into the crew habitat. These issues are addressed by ISL's flexible, nanomaterials-based high barrier technology to the permeation of oxygen and water vapor.","Current consumer trends bode well for companies able to develop packaging materials that keep food natural while tasting good.

The unit is projected to be 2.5x4.5x1 in, weigh less than 8 oz, and consume less than 100 mW of power.   A detector configuration of thirteen half-inch spheres arranged in a 2-D array will be used - twelve connected together to form an equivalent spherical 1.74-inch diameter detector for measuring low fluence environments, and the thirteenth detector connected independently allowing measurements during high fluence periods when the larger detector would saturate (such as during solar particle events). The new electronics  will continuously convert the detector data at 1 Mhz. Digital methods will allow both the setting of any threshold and the determination of event peaks, and allow more sophisticated signal processing to be used to reduce noise and eliminate micro-phonics. In addition, a bi-processing method of analyzing the detector signals will allow determination of dose by both integration method and peak method which can then be analyzed to provide accurate total dose readings for the events from the threshold to below 0.05 keV/micron. The spectra below several kev/micron is important as it can contain up to 40% of the total dose.The detector filled with pure propane will simulate a 2 micron site size. Two spectra will be stored each minute, and total integrated dose, dose above threshold, dose equivalent dead-time will be provided every second. The spectra will have 2048 channels at 1 keV/micron for each channel, to a maximum of 2047 keV/micron. The threshold for peak detection and analysis can be set anywhere from 0.4 to 20 keV/micron. The unit will be capable of measurement ranging from less than 100 nGy/hr to over 100 mGy/hr.","Accurate monitoring of radiation exposure levels are required in order to access health risks, and to help limit exposures levels to an acceptable risk. Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPC) have been used as a critical part of these measurements on the Space Shuttle and on the International Space Station (ISS) for many years. The current design has a number of technical limitations which should be improved for future missions, as well as the size and power consumption being reduced by updating the design with modern smaller, lower power electronics. The smaller, lower power, more capable TEPCs would satisfy the requirements of the upcoming Exploration class missions, and other human activities in space.  This new TEPC design, or variants of it, will allow more extensive monitoring, not only in existing habitats such as ISS, but also in future habitats in space as  well as on the moon and potentially Mars.","The miniaturized TEPC being proposed would be valuable to several mainstream industries.  The nuclear industry and the commercial launch vehicle industry would both have a need for this type of personal radiation monitoring.  Also, monitoring the radiation environment on high-flying military and commercial aircraft could be done with this smaller less expensive unit that currently available HAWK unit. The accelerator industry, as well as all other industries that have regulatory requirements for radiation monitoring (especially neutron radiation and mixed fields), would be potential applications for this new TEPC.",High-Energy; Particle and Fields; Pilot Support Systems; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Radiation Shielding Materials; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety

Once outside the protection of the Earth's magnetic field, astronauts become fully exposed to an array of dangerous charged particles, both cosmic rays (CRs) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs). There exists a need to provide a comprehensive picture of the energetic charged particle environment within manned space vehicles to accurately measure and mitigate the crew's exposure to these hazardous radiations. Along with our partner, the University of New Hampshire (UNH), Aurora Flight Sciences proposes to develop a compact (low volume, mass and power) charged particle spectrometer for manned space vehicles based on heritage from similar spaceflight telescopes using Si solid state detectors and scintillators. The proposed instrument will be capable of detecting and identifying charged particles with single element resolution, performing on-board, real-time data reduction and providing rate and composition data over five to seven approximately logarithmically spaced energy intervals corresponding to ~10-200 MeV for protons, with integral measurements for higher energies.","The principal application for the proposed technology is manned space radiation monitoring.  The technology for a low mass telescope of this type, however, has several other potential applications for NASA:  Probes to Mars and the Moon often include radiation instruments to learn more of potential hazards for future manned missions (e.g. RAD on the Mars Science Laboratory).  Deep space missions, such as Solar Sentinels and Solar Probe, etc., almost invariably include space radiation instruments with similar capabilities for basic research.  Missions for Space Weather research use such instruments as well.  Reduced mass electronics would be of great benefit for any such applications.","Ground applications for heavy ion instrumentation is extremely limited. High energy heavy ions are only found in specialized accelerators on Earth.  (Space radiation ions fragment in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.) Space based applications for space weather monitoring (e.g. the NOAA funded GOES-R program) is one obvious application.  Since the particles measured by the proposed instrument are the main cause of Single Event Effects (SEE), other similar monitoring applications are a likely market.  Other non-NASA applications include the Department of Defense. The DoD is moving more of its assets to higher orbits in response to the ASAT threat in low earth orbit, thereby increasing exposure to radiation events. As a result, monitoring of the radiation environment for these assets will be critical.",High-Energy; Optical & Photonic Materials; Particle and Fields; Photonics; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics

Laurel St, Fort Collins, CO 80524 - 3151",(505) 662-5626,,,,,,4 to 5,"We propose a novel approach to the detection of chromosomal inversions.  Transmissible chromosome aberrations (translocations and inversions) have profound genetic effects, such as disrupting regulatory sequences that control gene expression, or creating genetic chimeras.  These chromosome aberrations play a causative role in cancer, and they are induced by radiation.  As such, chromosome aberrations are relevant to three NASA needs, biodosimetry, analysis of astronaut lymphocytes for cumulative radiation damage, and space radiation risk modeling.  Of all structural chromosomal anomalies, inversions  a reversal of orientation of material within a chromosome  are the most difficult to detect.  This is especially true of small inversions, most of which are invisible to all current cytogenetic techniques.  Yet small inversions are likely the most transmissible (nonlethal) form of chromosomal damage, so they persist, a feature which lends credence to their use in retrospective biodosimetry.  This Phase 1 project is intended to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of a new method of molecular cytogenetics that will permit highly sensitive inversion detection.  The project will help us to perfect our bioinformatics strategy for probe design, optimize probe labeling reactions, refine hybridization conditions, and establish a procedure for cost analysis.  In Phase 2, we will scale-up probe production to make whole chromosome analysis possible.  This next step, although conceptually simple, relies entirely on the processes devised and tested in Phase 1.  Moreover efficient, cost-effective probe-making will be essential to commercialization (Phase 3).  The technology readiness level at the end of the Phase 1 contract is expected to be 4-5, i.e. validated in laboratory and relevant environments.","Three applications of interest to NASA are: 1) Biodosimetry, the retrospective estimation of radiation dose based on observed biological damage; 2) Ongoing analyses of lymphocytes from astronauts.  Chromosomal analysis of astronaut lymphocytes provides a measure of accumulated genetic damage caused by space radiation exposure.  Chromatid paints will increase sensitivity of this analysis by adding a new class of observable aberrations; and 3) Biology-based space radiation risk analysis efforts.  Chromosome aberrations play a causative role in carcinogenesis (as does gene copy number imbalance and cytogenetically invisible point mutations).  One way to bring knowledge of cancer genetics into risk analysis is to estimate dose- and LET-dependent probabilities for specific cancer-related genetic alterations.  For this approach to work it will be necessary to identify all of the major genetic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.  Adequate investigation of cancer-specific chromosomal inversions is currently not possible, and therefore many such inversions, especially small ones, may remain undiscovered.  This shortcoming is particularly pertinent with regard to charged particles in that small inversions are likely to be the most common stable chromosome aberration created by them.  Chromatid paints have the potential to contribute to biology-based risk analysis through their ability to reveal these predicted small cancer-related inversions for the first time.","We expect that chromatid paints will fulfill multiple needs in several fields related to human health.  Markets include, but are not limited to: clinical cytogenetics (cancer diagnosis and prognosis, infertility diagnosis, genetic counseling); biomedical research (mechanistic studies of cancer induction, radiation effects, and chemical toxicology); and biodosimetry (retrospective evaluation of radiation exposure as might occur accidentally or from a terrorist attack).  Multi-color chromatid paints will provide genome-wide translocation identification, just as mFISH and SKY currently do, and in addition will allow simultaneous and sensitive detection of inversions, making it highly probable that chromatid paints will eventually capture much of the market currently held by chromosome paints.",Biomedical and Life Support; Biomolecular Sensors

Several novel concepts are integrated to produce the final design, which is compatible with on-orbit operation from the standpoint of gravity-independence, low mass, low power requirement and automated operation.  The unique design features of the Microfluidic Multichannel Flow Cytometer include compact optics based on diode technology for both illumination and measurement, tested channel branching schemes, no sheath fluid anywhere, bubble-free PDMS lithographic manufacture, and analysis based on quantum-dot technology.  A design is proposed that counts RBC, WBC and three specified WBC subsets. Techshot, Inc. and scientists at Purdue University will collaborate to test the components of this innovation by pursuing the following Phase I objectives: (1) create a critical design requirements document for the Microfluidic Multichannel Flow Cytometer, (2) breadboard and test its three critical physical components (illumination, sensing optics and flow channels) and (3) critically test feasibility of each component  and produce a top-level drawing suitable for initiating Phase II R/R&D to produce an integrated prototype.  The final product will be robust for use in space flight and low-cost on Earth for eventual point-of-care blood analysis and global AIDS patient status monitoring.","Since the early 1980's a flow cytometer has been a planned component of the International Space Station's (ISS) on-orbit analytical capability  one of nearly 100 instruments originally specified to make ISS the equivalent of a terrestrial laboratory in which experiments could be performed repeatedly without resorting to Earth to complete analytical steps and to provide data for experiment redesign.  The proposed innovation will provide this longed-for on-orbit analytical capability for cell researchers.  Real-time blood analysis on ISS crew members is also a longed-for goal.  On deep space missions re-usable compact robust medical laboratory equipment will be critical.  For example, the health status of crew members exposed to a solar proton storm will need to be critically determined using peripheral blood counts.  Therefore, infusion into NASA mission needs and projects constitutes providing this technology for (1) cell and immunology researchers aboard the ISS and ISS National Lab, (2) medical monitoring of ISS crew members via the Human Research Facility (HRF), and (3) medical monitoring of deep-space exploration crews, especially following a solar proton storm.","Three major non-NASA commercial markets exist:  (1) laboratories that do not have access to conventional flow cytometry facilities, (2) point-of-care blood cell monitoring and (3) monitoring of CD4 cell status in global AIDS populations.  With its low cost and potential for automated manufacturing the proposed Microfluidic Multichannel Flow Cytometer, in a specialized version could be used for the monitoring of CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in AIDS patient care in third-world countries, where such a low-cost diagnostic capability is desperately needed.  There is an international movement to reduce the cost of CD4 measuring instruments to $5000 or less and reduce the cost of a single test for CD4 to 50 cents or less by building instruments that do not require large power or computer sources, are robust, very easy to use, and yet of very high quality.

The proposed ASES sensor uses a capacitance read-out method to electronically measure the sensor membrane displacement due to the surface stress caused by molecular binding, (e.g., antibody-antigen binding).  Antibodies specific to the white blood cell surface protein markers (antigens) are precoated on the ASES sensor membrane to recognize the specific white blood cell types with inherently high specificity and sensitivity.  Our proposed cell counting system can meet NASA's requirements for a microgravity compatible, miniaturized, light weight peripheral blood cell counting instrument capable of on-orbit cell counting, without high energy lasers, requiring minimal sample volume or exogenous (sheath) fluid to operate, and generating minimal biohazardous waste.  This ASES blood cell counting system, once developed, can stand alone for white blood cell differential and subtype count, or become a complimentary instrument to others available on-orbit.","The proposed ASES white blood cell counting system could provide on orbit white blood cell counting capability, currently not available on orbit, for monitoring astronaut health and performing biomedical research on International Space Station (ISS), Crew Exploration Vehicles (CEV), and etc.  With its high specificity/sensitivity, compact size, multiplexed counting capability, and automated operation, the proposed system can also provide a powerful cell counting capability for NASA's ground based biomedical research and development.","Besides NASA's on orbit application, the proposed white blood cell counting system could be used to perform immuno-based cell counting similar to that done by flow cytometers.

The development of efficient odor removal systems for use inside lunar mission architectures is one of NASA's critical needs (Topic X2.03). Because of the limited space and resources in both exploration vehicles and non-moving habitats, it is important for a treatment system to be compact, lightweight, and robust, and have low energy and material input requirements with the ultimate focus on reducing equivalent systems mass (ESM). Professors at the University of Florida have developed a novel, robust, and highly effective Silica-Titania Composite (STC) capable of adsorbing and oxidizing VOCs to harmless byproducts.

Resupply of water is prohibitively costly for extended missions.  It is anticipated that NASA will pool urine, hygiene water and humidity condensate into a combined waste stream that will subsequently be concentrated into a brine while recovering some but not all of the water, 90-95%.  The concentrated brine that results from primary water recovery systems contains a significant amount of water.  The proposed innovation will recover virtually all of the remaining water.  This will be accomplished by ultrasonically creating nebulized droplets of the brine that can be readily dried under a partial vacuum with moderate temperature microwave heating.  The process bears some resemblance to spray drying, but uses much smaller droplets (1.6 µm as compared to ~100 µm).  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to their high relative surface area.  This is particularly important when drying wastewater brines which contain ingredients that are thermally labile and require drying at relatively low temperatures.  The proposed system has no nozzles to become plugged, requires no chemical additives, uses a minimal amount of power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronaut attention and uses a continuous, closed cycle process that is gravity independent.","The NASA application of this innovative technology will be as Hardware for Lunar Base and other Early Planetary Bases.  The partial gravity at these locations will permit nebulization without the use of a wick.  Gravity based water accumulation at the bottom of the condenser will be accomplished without the assistance of an air/water separator.  This technology will enable efficient water recovery from brines resulting in a major mass closure for water usage on the Lunar Base.Use as Flight Hardware for Transit Missions is also anticipated.  With this application, a wick will be used to hold the brine at the desired location during nebulization.  An air/water separator will be included to facilitate separation without the assistance of gravity.","For the private sector, a major application is improved drying processes for pharmaceuticals.   Many biologically active compounds are thermally labile and would benefit from the use of this technology for preparation of inhalants.  In addition, the ultra-small size of the resulting particles is desirable for inhalation because they are more easily suspended in air and because solvation and uptake through the alveoli in the lungs is more efficient for small particles.  For example, NaCl particles are widely used in dry powder inhalers for bronchial provocation tests to identify people with active asthma or exercise-induced asthma.  Such powders are currently made using laborious processes to control particle sizes and distributions.

Optical monitoring with its features of high precision, strong species selectivity and fast response is the preferred method if lightweight, small and low power-draw instrumentation can be developed.  Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are now available covering a broad wavelength range.  These single frequency light sources are ideal candidates for high performance gas monitoring and especially suited for space applications due to their small size and extremely low power consumption.  Vista Photonics proposes to develop technology based on these lasers that leads to small sensors that fulfill the strict requirements of spaceflight.  The narrowband output of these lasers combined with wavelength modulation spectroscopy and a compact absorption cell will provide superior sensor performance.  Inherent features like sensor health monitoring and recalibration without the use of expendable gases will be incorporated.  The developed sensor will be fully automated and no maintenance will be required.","The targeted NASA application is monitoring of air composition on spacecraft and space stations.  The emerging technology is adaptable to changing pressure conditions and suitable to operate in diverse environments, including corrosive atmospheres.  The technology will be developed for major air constituents monitoring but is extendable to selective detection of trace contaminants.  Trace gas detection capabilities might be incorporated into the same sensor.  Relevant NASA applications are contaminant sensing in air revitalization and water recovery processes.","The developed sensor will be a general device for highly reliable, sensitive monitoring and/or detection of different gas species.  The developed sensor platform will be broadly deployable for simultaneous detection of a variety of molecules with a cost-effective, small device.

Current cotton clothing is highly flammable and not suitable for fire fighting. There is urgent need to develop non-flammable alternatives for shirts, shorts, sweaters, and jackets without compromising the comfort and flexibility. This Phase I project aims to develop flame retardant textiles using a new class of chemicals called polyoxometalates (POMs).

It offers advantages in performance, ease of cleanup, compatibility with on-board environmental systems, and ability to recharge during a mission. ADA Technologies has designed a prototype hand-held extinguisher that is being tested at ambient environmental conditions.In this SBIR program ADA Technologies proposes to advance this prototype with a new design for a reduced-momentum nozzle to generate a fine water mist that can be discharged into confined and obstructed spaces to attack hidden fires as well as open fires in manned spacecraft. In Phase I multiple nozzle concepts will be designed, fabricated, and competed to identify the most promising concepts. In addition, we will adapt a vacuum chamber at team member Colorado School of Mines to evaluate the advanced nozzles against fires in an atmosphere of 34% oxygen and 7.6 psia total pressure, representative of the conditions in manned spacecraft. These tests will validate the efficacy of Fine Water Mist at these nonstandard atmospheric conditions. Phase I products will include a comprehensive specification for a beta prototype hand-held FWM extinguisher that incorporates the best advanced reduced momentum nozzle. In Phase II we will carry the beta prototype design forward to testing in microgravity and develop a plan for flight qualification of the hardware. We will work with a partner experienced in the production and qualification of flight test fixtures and experiments. ADA will partner with a commercial supplier of fire protection equipment to take this technology into the broader commercial marketplace, targeting aerospace and flammable fuels storage as early market segments.","Fine Water Mist is a versatile fire suppression technology ideal for application in manned spacecraft and planetary habitats. It is effective and efficient, with a small mass and volume impact. The ADA prototype design can be operated in any gravity environment, including microgravity, and with the gravity vector in any orientation with respect to the extinguisher. The ADA extinguisher is rechargeable on-station, a key feature for extended lunar and planetary missions. In addition, FWM is fully compatible with spacecraft systems, using only water and nitrogen as agents which offer no adverse impact to human health. ADA has identified two candidate partners to advance our technology through flight qualification to make hardware available for the full next generation of manned spacecraft. In other configurations, Fine Water Mist Fire Suppression is also useful and effective in a range of applications in NASA facilities and Ground Support Equipment. ADA has designed, built, and tested specialized FWM systems for use in hazardous environments on board US Air Force aircraft, and has worked on conceptual designs for such applications as flammable liquid storage and ground protection of aircraft. We anticipate that Fine Water Mist would prove ideal for many NASA fire protection situations. ADA intends to partner with a commercial supplier of fire suppression equipment to bring this technology to market in the coming years.","Significant market opportunities exist outside the base applications within NASA.  ADA will leverage these to create a commercial opportunity that is of significant potential impact to the company while satisfying the NASA need/requirement.  Aerospace applications (airlines) constitute one major opportunity.  Airplanes are currently equipped with halon extinguishers  both automatic and handheld.  As noted elsewhere in this proposal, halon is no longer in production and the European Union is mandating its replacement even prior to the depletion of Halon stockpiles.  FWM is an excellent candidate for this application as it is very effective, safe for human exposure, and environmentally friendly.  ADA's fine water mist system is also a great fit for the needs in vehicle and enclosed space applications. These applications are found in military vehicles, subway trains, tunnels, museums, passenger and merchant ships, hotels, data centers, flammable fuel storage locations and many other places. Overall, this is a several hundred million dollar market opportunity, and will have a positive impact on safety, human health, and the environment. ADA's approach is to partner with companies that have existing products and market share to update their product lines and increase market opportunities.

This technology development effort will address the most challenging aspects of excavation in the lunar environment and work to develop a design relevant to a range of future lunar missions.  This effort will also serve to guide and inform the requirements for the vehicles and systems that will be necessary for such missions. The fundamental architecture of an impact-actuated digging tool has been demonstrated for terrestrial applications for the Department of Defense.  Honeybee's digging tool design is a novel approach ideally suited for lunar applications to defeat compacted and frozen regolith.  By using the impact energy imparted by a reciprocating hammer transferred through the scoop to defeat the target material, the need for large reaction loads from the vehicle is minimized, allowing for a much smaller, lower mass system. This ongoing effort will serve to instruct and maximize the benefit to NASA.","NASA's draft lunar architecture calls for an outpost at a single location at the lunar pole and a proposed ISRU system for life support and EVA by 2023 and propulsion activities by 2027.  The potentially frozen regolith at the lunar poles has been identified as a likely source for volatile extraction activities to support the presence of humans and provide a resource for the generation of fuel on the lunar surface.  In order to meet these objectives, lunar regolith prospecting and excavation technologies such as the impact actuated digging tool will need to be brought to a high TRL for ISRU activities. The technologies stemming from this research will directly meet the Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program (LPRP) and human lunar exploration mission objectives. The resulting technologies will be robust enough to operate under the extreme lunar conditions, particularly in terms of exposure to the abrasive lunar regolith, and be scalable and adaptable to a wide range of potential system architectures for regolith excavation and volatile extraction. The same technology will be relevant to future Mars missions as well.  Honeybee will build upon its proven record of bringing R&D efforts such as this one to successful flight contracts.","There is an established interest from the Department of Defense in the development of digging tool technology appropriate for integration with small platform unmanned vehicles.  Over 2000 such robotic platforms are currently fielded in Iraq and Afghanistan to deal with the persistent threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), with more on the way.  Currently these systems are unable to access buried IEDs commonly deployed as roadside bombs due to the inadequate end-of-arm tooling and the limited reaction forces available.  Honeybee sees this related effort to develop an impact actuated digging tool for lunar applications as helping to advance the state of the art for this critical application. With the completion of this Phase I and Phase II effort and the related effort for the DoD for whom we have delivered and fielded a prototype of a very similar system, Honeybee Robotics will have matured the fundamental technology to a high TRL for both lunar and terrestrial applications.  This will position Honeybee well to pursue flight contracts for future NASA missions, support activities critical to the military, and seek out commercial markets for robotic digging technology.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety

For exploration of the Moon, one of the most significant resources is the lunar regolith, which is a complex mix of minerals with large oxygen content in their composition.  Oxygen finds its main uses as a propellant, and for life support systems.  There are currently many technologies being developed addressing the production of oxygen from lunar regolith, including carbothermal processes.  The key to sustainability is to make sure any consumables carried from Earth are recycled to the maximum extent possible, minimizing the need of re-supply.

Iridium, a proven inert anode in the process, is expensive, scarce, extremely dense, and difficult to fabricate.  Electrolytic Research Corporation will develop a larger-scale anode optimized for cost, weight, material availability, and manufacturability.  ERC proposes an optimized iridium-based alloy or composite anode using electrochemical and thermophysical materials selection criteria validated with experiments (electrolysis testing) and modeling.

An important product is oxygen, and Molten Oxide Electrolysis has been identified as a potential technology for this application.While MOE has been demonstrated at a laboratory-scale to produce oxygen, critical systems must be developed to meet the goals of producing in excess of 1M tons of oxygen per year in the lunar environment.  The proposed work, Large-Scale Inert Anode Development for MOE, would significantly advance the technology readiness level of the MOE process for ISRU oxygen generation.NASA is currently increasing the MOE process size to produce 5  10 kg of oxygen, and an optimized anode would allow NASA to continue scaling operations with greater confidence, while also providing the future foundation of moving to much larger reactor sizes that could meet the goal of producing 1M tons per year.","While Molten Oxide Electrolysis can produce oxygen from lunar regolith, the process has the potential to make a much larger impact on the global metals industry.  Capable of reducing numerous metals from their oxide states, the process is already under development as a lower-energy, more environmentally friendly method for producing titanium.  This research is being conducted with carbon anodes, which are consumed in the process.  The use of carbon limits the number of metal reduction candidates, and does not earn the process the attribute of being CO2-free.Development of a cost-effective, large-scale inert anode would be significant in the MOE commercialization process.  In the global titanium reduction market, a more than $1B industry, an inert anode could be retrofitted into the MOE reactor to render the process carbon-free.  This is particularly significant in the case of chromium, which cannot be made without carbon contamination by the existing technology, i.e., carbothermic reduction of Cr2O3 in an electric arc furnace. Ultralow levels of carbon confer enhanced metallurgical properties on chromium and, hence, stainless steel. In the extreme, we envision green electrochemical extraction of steel.

The CoRHE is essentially a tube-in-tube heat exchanger with internal and external augers attached to the inner, rotating tube to move the regolith. Hot regolith in the outer tube is moved in one direction by a right-handed auger and the cool regolith in the inner tube is moved in the opposite by a left-handed auger attached to the inside of the rotating tube. In this counterflow arrangement a large fraction of the heat from the expended regolith is transferred to the new regolith. The spent regolith leaves the heat exchanger close to the temperature of the cold new regolith and the new regolith is pre-heated close to the initial temperature of the spent regolith. Using the CoRHE can reduce the heating requirement of a lunar ISRU system by 80%, reducing the total power consumption by a factor of two.","The counterflow regolith heat exchanger (CoRHE) provides an efficient means to transfer heat from hot regolith to cold regolith. The ability to conserve the heat from the expended regolith can lead to significant energy savings for a lunar oxygen production system. If, for example, oxygen is produced at a rate of 1 metric ton (MT) per year with an oxygen content of 2% in the soil, then 50 metric tons of regolith must be processed per year. With oxygen production occurring 50% of the time (only during daylight) then the heating load is an average of 2.8 kW.  In comparison, the electrolysis power required to produce 1 MT of oxygen per year at 50% duty cycle is about 1.1 kW. Thus, heating the regolith is one of the major power consumers of a lunar oxygen production system. The counterflow regolith heat exchanger is intended to reduce the heating requirement for the lunar oxygen production system by 80% with minimal hardware and power requirements. This reduces the total power requirement of the oxygen production system from 3.9 kW to 1.7 kW, a power savings of 55%.",There are many chemical processes where powders or granular materials are processed at high temperatures.

The feedstock contains many contaminates, may not always be available, and can be inconsistent.  Although the standard lunar simulant produced from the mineral industry byproduct feedstock is useful for some applications, many projects require a simulant with a higher fidelity.   This project provides the means to produce individual components that are not available from terrestrial sources.  These components can be mixed in different proportions to determine the effect on a particular process.  The basic theory of the innovation is to mix known industrial ingredients, bring to molten temperatures, allow time for full reaction (in molten state), and then control the cooling rate to cause re-crystallization.  These components are readily available and can be processed at multi-ton rates in the plasma melter.","Applications inside of NASA include:  Oxygen Production, testing of mechanical equipment, bio-medical research, specific beneficiation of lunar materials, development of database of spectrometry data from NASA space equipment, testing excavation and drilling equipment, and connector mating tests.","Contractors and researchers for other Space Agencies, and University Researchers.

The proposed innovation involves the areas associated with the advanced DCFC characteristics and simplified processes turning plastic trash into renewable energy at a high efficiency.  In Phase I, the decomposition/oxidation electrochemistry of polyethylene-based plastic bags and spoons, catalyzed by molten carbonate anode composites, will be characterized.  Tubular electrochemical cells built upon the proposed DCFC technology will be studied at elevated temperatures, followed by performance optimization.","The DCFC-based device integral with a water-gas-shift reactor, a Sabatier reactor and solar cells can in-situ convert plastic trash and crew solid waste directly into electricity, methane fuel and water, providing a residential environment for supporting human extraterrestrial exploration activities.

In granular solids the area of contacts between 'touching' grains is quite small.  Thus, solid-solid conduction often plays only a minor role in heat transfer through granular solids (i.e., 'effective' conduction), and when an interstitial gas is present, heat transfer occurs primarily via conduction through the gas.  If the granular solid is also flowing, then solids convection becomes a significant factor in overall heat transfer and effective 'conduction'.  Under vacuum conditions, and at temperatures above 700oC, radiation will dominate most heat transfer processes; however, solids convection can also play a very significant secondary role.  Utilizing judicious placement of radiation baffles, and a novel counterflow configuration, the approach proposed in this SBIR can accomplish the desired heat transfer between spent and fresh regolith with only one moving mechanical part, by making effective use of both radiative heat transfer and solids convection.  Discrete-element simulations of regolith flow will be utilized to refine the concept.  Utilization of an existing ~1.4 cubic meter partial-vacuum facility at the University of Florida will facilitate construction of feasibility demonstration prototypes during Phase-1 and/or Phase-2.  The Phase-1 project will demonstrate the effectiveness of combining solids convection with radiative heat transfer to rapidly transfer heat from 1050C spent material to heat fresh regolith to 750C under vacuum conditions.","As currently envisioned, the production of oxygen from lunar regolith requires heating the material to a temperature of 1050C.  Since the minerals of interest for oxygen production are stable to temperatures of 750C, the regolith can be preheated to that temperature, before entering the actual reactor without loss of potential product.  Utilization of the sensible heat of the spent regolith (exiting the reactor at 1050C) to preheat the fresh regolith to 750C, can provide significant energy savings, dramatically increasing the efficiency of the oxygen recovery process.  Other lunar volatile recovery operations may, also, benefit from the efficiency of preheating fresh regolith in a vacuum using the sensible heat of the spent material exiting the process.","Similar configurations may also be of use in terrestrial mineral recovery operations; however, the potential existence of an interstitial gas in most terrestrial environments dramatically changes the character of heat transfer in/to/from granular solids.  Thus, terrestrial applications of the specific configurations designed for lunar conditions may be limited to situations where interstitial gases need to be excluded for some other chemical or operational reason.",In-situ Resource Utilization

Penetrometers are used to determine the Cone index (CI), which is a composite index influenced by both soil compressibility and shear strength. A dynamic cone penetrometer is used to estimate bearing strength, soil compressibility, and shear strength (when compared with calibration data), consisting of a percussive actuator and a rod with a sharp 60 degree cone at the end. The penetrometer is driven into the soil under constant load and the penetration, converted to California Bearing Ratio (CBR), which gives an indication of soil trafficability. The Honeybee-developed percussive dynamic cone penetrometer offers the significant advantage of being a low mass, low power, low force, stand alone device that requires limited to no human intervention to operate, as opposed to heavy and cumbersome manual Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) widely used today. This percussive system is also of further advantage with its capability to reach much greater depths than typical surface tools such as Bevameter. The high-frequency vibration of the percussive rod also reduces the force required for pushing a rod into regolith by almost two orders of magnitude. This translates directly into smaller rover/lander or less effort on behalf of an Astronaut.","The vacuum compatible PDCP will enable surveying of extra terrestrial sites to determine their candidacy for establishment of site preparation and outpost infrastructure emplacement, and it will provide vital characteristics for efficient design and future development of all related components, mechanisms, and systems, set up resource mining operations, and survey exploration sites, and routes. In addition, soil physical properties are used to help interpret surface geologic processes and to constrain the origins and formation processes of the soils. This vacuum compatible PDCP is, therefore, not only a necessary surveying, and exploratory tool, but a valuable scientific instrument as well, which would prove to be most useful for lunar missions and for ongoing exploration on Mars. It is also very simple, quick, and efficient way of reaching significant depth. This would be useful to any application ranging from, burying sensory equipment to digging a post-hole.","Within the scope of a flight ready system is going to be the task of making this system not only vacuum compatible, but reliable, heat resistant, and capable of coping with lunar dust. It will also have to be compact and light weight. All of the scientific and technological advances obtained from this project will translate directly to development of a technically advanced, and robust terrestrial surveying tool ideal for commercial, scientific, and defense applications, where its portability and ease of use with minimum user input will be most valuable assets.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Structural Modeling and Tools; Tools

The LSPS improves ISRU oxygen yield by boosting the concentration of ilmenite or other iron-oxide bearing materials found in lunar soils. LSPS particle size separations can be performed to improve gas-solid interactions and reactor flow dynamics. LSPS mineral separations can be used to alter the sintering characteristics of lunar soil. The LSPS can eventually be used to separate and concentrate lunar minerals useful for manufacture of structural materials, glass, and chemicals. The LSPS integrates an initial centrifugal particle size separation with magnetic, gravity, and/or electrostatic separations. The LSPS centrifugal separation method overcomes the reduced efficiency of conventional particle sieving in reduced gravity. Feed conditioning, such as charge neutralization, can be incorporated into the LSPS to release and disperse surface fines prior to particle separations. The conceptual LSPS hardware design integrates many individual unit operations to reduce system mass and power requirements. The LSPS is applicable to ISRU feed processing as well as robotic prospecting to characterize soils over a wide region on the Moon. The LSPS is scalable and is amenable to testing and development under simulated lunar environmental conditions.","The primary initial application of the LSPS is for lunar particle separations in support of improving the feed to hydrogen reduction ISRU. The LSPS has direct use to improve the overall efficiency of hydrogen reduction ISRU by boosting the iron-oxide content of feeds. In addition, the LSPS has uses for optimizing particle size distribution to improve material flow properties and gas-particle interactions in fluidized bed and other reactors as well as adjusting mineral composition to minimize sintering during reduction. The LSPS can also serve as a component of a robotic lunar prospector to characterize soils and their potential for ISRU applications.","One non-NASA commercialization application is directed toward small-scale terrestrial mineral processing. In particular, the LSPS is useful in remote locations where a compact, low-power device is needed to perform dry separations for production of mineral concentrates. A device such as the LSPS can be tailored to dry separation prospecting or small-scale minerals production to reduce the transportation of large amounts of un-beneficiated samples or ore to laboratories or downstream processing facilities.

Gears must continue to function and surfaces must continue to slide over a wide temperature range, the low end of which renders most conventional lubricants solidified while the high end vaporizes them, especially in a vacuum.  Extremely long service lives are needed, and dust can cause abrasive damage.  The solution is to use a high lubricity wear resistant solid, but not even all solid lubricants are suitable for the full range of challenges.We propose to use a novel electrocodeposition process to produce a quasicrystalline coating on the surface of metal parts.  Quasicrystals are a unique family of alloys having symmetries found nowhere else.  They are exceptionally hard, with low surface energies.  Quasicrystalline coatings have been demonstrated to be stable over wide temperature ranges and to have low friction over the entire range.  Our process produces solid, high-density, low friction coatings on a variety of metal substrates.  The coatings are stable for the long periods needed to achieve long operating lives.  They are applied under relatively mild conditions using readily available equipment and can be applied to substrates of any shape or size.  In this project we will demonstrate the application of low friction coatings to gear alloys and show their low friction and wear properties over a temperature range that extends from above ambient to cryogenic.","The initial NASA target application for electrodeposited quasicrystal coatings is as a high lubricity surface suitable for use at all temperatures with no risk of loss of lubricant due to evaporation, even in a hard vacuum.  Additional potential applications include locations where the temperature concerns are less severe, but the gears or sliding surfaces must remain free to move for long periods of time, times sufficiently long that a fluid lubricant could deteriorate, be lost, or just puddle up from surface tension and fail to properly coat the working surfaces.  These applications can be on the surface of extraterrestrial bodies or in space.Quasicrystalline coatings aren't just for low temperature applications.  These materials are stable to above 650 oC.  This makes them suitable for many high temperature applications as well, including applications where conventional fluid lubricants would be oxidized or thermally decomposed.","While commercial space craft do not comprise a large market for these lubricants, there are many other applications available where the high durability and lubricity of electrocodeposited quasicrystal coatings have promise.  These include many types of machine equipment and other devices with moving parts, especially those operating in harsh environments or where access to the components is difficult making regular lubrication challenging.  One completely unrelated application that makes use of these properties is as a non-stick coating for cookware that can be cleaned and scoured like a conventional metal pan.

Passive wireless sensing tags using SAW technology have been demonstrated by Robert Brocato at Sandia National Labs and others.  These sensor-tags consist of a SAW device with an antenna attached to one port and sensor(s) and reference impedance(s) connected to the other ports.  RF signals are reflected off of the surface wave device, and their reflection characteristics are modified by changes in the impedance of the attached sensor(s).  This proposal describes development of novel passive wireless SAW sensor tags that combine radio frequency identification (RFID) coding with dispersive and low-loss SAW transducers and reflectors.  The proposed devices utilize RFID reflective delay line coding techniques to produce devices capable of data densities over 32 bits, enabling production of large codesets.  Variations in the reflected RFID code are used to identify the device and to provide a measure of the attached sensor(s), along with any internal sensing function(s).   The use of dispersive low-loss transducers and reflectors provides increased processing gain and over 10 times the range of conventional SAW RFID tags.  The proposed sensor devices also operate in a manner that is inherently immune to RF backscatter signals, further enhancing S/N.  Successful completion of the proposed Phase I activities will establish the technical feasibility of these sensor-tags, will evaluate their performance in the laboratory when used with at least two external sensor devices, and will provide performance projections for use with other sensors.  At the end of Phase I, devices will be at TRL 4.  Phase II will result in development of multiple uniquely identifiable passive sensor-tags and interrogation systems operable to wirelessly monitor sensors of interest to specific NASA programs (TRL6).","Throughout NASA programs and facilities, sensors and data acquisition systems that require a reduced wire infrastructure are needed.  Exploration systems such as the Ares V launch vehicle require development of lightweight structure technology, and structural health monitoring of these systems is needed to reduce risk and extend operational lifetimes.  Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors have been widely used in testing of composite and other materials, and can provide indications of growing defects as well as incipient failure.  The proposed sensors will allow widespread distributed wireless monitoring of AE sensors for structural health monitoring.  The high S/N ratio of these devices makes them ideal for use in metal environments.  Diagnosis of aircraft aging and damage, detection of incipient failures in cryotanks, evaluation of the structural integrity of bonded assemblies, and inspection of numerous composite and metallic structures are all significant NASA applications.  Ground operations would benefit from the capability to detect corrosion and deterioration in concrete and other structures.  AE sensors and others may be useful in this application as well.  Finally, non-NDE applications such as distributed wireless measurement of temperature throughout inflatable habitats, wireless evaluation of engine plume characteristics, and wireless monitoring of temperature and pressure on the skin of exploration vehicles during descent will also be enabled by these devices.","Distributed wireless monitoring of sensors using passive SAW sensor-tags will have widespread non-NASA commercial applications.  AE sensors have been shown to be capable of real-time detection of cracks, delamination, and other growing failure mechanisms in concrete, metal, composites, and other materials.  Given the current state of the nation's aging infrastructure, this technology will be widely used to monitor the condition of bridges, tunnels, and pavements.  Combination of the proposed sensor-tags with novel AE sensor technologies such as sensors based on flexible piezoelectric materials will provide low cost solutions to this extensive monitoring problem.  Development of intelligent wireless infrastructure monitoring networks utilizing such passive wireless sensors combined with data correlation and interpretation would be capable of providing infrastructure owners with automated information on structural conditions, including likely causative factors for detected fault conditions.  This information would be useful to the owners in effectively prioritizing limited maintenance and repair resources.

The interlocking, angular nature of Lunar dust and its broad grain size distribution make it particularly detrimental to mechanisms with which it may come into contact. Honeybee Robotics Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation (HRSMC) seeks to develop a dust-tolerant, autonomous connector to transmit data and power on Lunar surface systems. HRSMC has extensive heritage in developing mechanisms for extreme and dusty environments, including the development of a dust-tolerant electrical connector prototype and a dust-tolerant mechanical connector concept. There are many near-term applications of such a connector including: the utility and electrical connections that will be used on the next-generation Lunar EVA suit, cryogenic utility connections that will be used to pass liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen during in-situ¬ resource utilization (ISRU) activities, and high-power electrical connectors capable of thousands of cycles for Lunar Surface Mobility Unit (LSMU) battery recharge and data transfer. As noted in current Lunar architectural options, human EVA's, long range Lunar rovers, and ISRU activities are on the mission horizon and are paramount to the establishment of a permanent human base on the Moon. In Phase I, HRSMC will baseline prior dust-tolerant connector work to develop a conceptual design for an autonomous, dust-tolerant, re-usable connector to enable electrical transfer between a LSMU and a central resource outpost or a deployed solar power unit. This connector would be easily adaptable to the needs of other Lunar surface system utility connectors required for EVA suits or other systems such as ISRU utility connections. This development path will result in an autonomous Lunar dust-tolerant electrical connector with a TRL level of 3-4 at the end of Phase 1 with a goal of at least TRL 6 at the end of Phase II.","The dust-tolerant autonomous connection mechanism to be developed through this project will be an enabling technology for extended Lunar operations in that they will allow several cycles of utility connection and disconnection for EVA and surface operations.  Future mission scenarios involving erectable structures, diverse EVA-compliant tools, Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)-to-rover or EMU-to-robot interfaces, and other in-situ assembly or interconnection activities will all call for dust-tolerant reusable connectors. In particular, the Constellation LSMU battery recharge connector will require dust-tolerant technology.","Military and homeland security operations are often conducted in uncontrolled environments. An increasing use of high-technology tools provides for improved performance, but also introduces new risks. The incorporation of dust-tolerant reusable connection mechanisms in military couplings will allow greater reliability and flexibility for modular electronics in operational scenarios, especially in dusty, dirty, sandy environments. Incorporation of dust-tolerant connectors would also reduce maintenance, repair, and overhaul costs by reducing select component failures due to degradation by dust and sand. Current connectors meet stringent mil-spec environmental requirements when connected, but the connection itself must be made under relatively clean conditions. We expect that adding a tolerance to making and breaking connections under off-nominal conditions will result in an increased service life for modular electronics for use in military and homeland security applications. There is also broad commercial potential for dust-tolerant reusable connectors in several commercial applications requiring the reliable performance of modular electronics in uncontrolled environments, including oil and gas exploration, first responders and emergency services, heavy and highway construction, and mining. By employing dust-tolerant connectors, rather than attempting to seal dust intolerant connectors against the environment, the connectors used in these applications may be truly ruggedized.",Airlocks/Environmental Interfaces; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; Fluid Storage and Handling; Human-Robotic Interfaces; In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Liquid-Liquid Interfaces; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Modular Interconnects; Portable Life Support; Power Management and Distribution; Suits; Testing Facilities; Tools

SpaceDev initially designed and developed this coupler to support on-orbit fluid transfer of cryogenics, gases, and water. Further development of and enhancements to this existing design are planned under Phase 1 to demonstrate feasibility for lunar applications, with advanced prototype testing in Phase 2 to make-ready the coupling for formal flight qualification and production. At the heart of the fluid coupling is an innovative re-settable knife edge seal that requires low pre-loads to provide the fluid seal. The sealing surface can be quickly and easily reset with the application of a heater-type electric signal for only a few minutes at ambient conditions. Joint coupling is accomplished by a sharp-edged member piercing and embedding itself into a soft Indium seal ring. After coupling disconnect, reset is accomplished by heating the Indium seal to its melting point. Entrained in an arterial wick, the seal ring surface reflows, leaving a virgin seal surface upon cooling. The arterial wick allows for joint reflow in microgravity environments. The coupling is then reset to allow for successive servicing operations. Current prototypes have been tested with air, water and LN2 at pressures from 0 to 100 psi. SpaceDev recently completed a separate Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated that the all-metal, knife-edge seal con-cept has the capability for maintaining seal integrity even in the presence of the abrasive, lunar dust. The knife edge seal offers two distinct advantages when attempting to mitigate the affects of lunar dust: 1) the knife edge tends toward self-cleaning and exclusion of foreign matter such as lunar dust due to metal cold-flow patterns during penetration, and 2) the Indium can be heated and re-flowed in between mate and demate cycles to reform a fresh seal.","Potential NASA commercial applications include manned and unmanned lunar operations, operations on MARS, and other exploratory missions involving operations in abrasive environments.","Potential Non-NASA commercial applications include on-orbit spacecraft servicing, and terrestrial fluid transfer applications in abrasive environments.",Fluid Storage and Handling; In-situ Resource Utilization; Propellant Storage

Known as lunar regolith, it poses a hazard in the form of dust clouds being generated by all forms of gas expansions in the high vacuum environment of the lunar surface.  This is especially pronounced during spacecraft operations.  Instruments placed on the moon by the Apollo mission showed marked degradation due to damage from dust released during the lander's takeoff.  Since there is no air movement to remove the dust after it is deposited, it is essential that dust is not displaced during everyday operations of a permanent lunar installation.Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has over the last decade developed a number of specialty UV curing resins for NASA applications in space.  ATI is proposing to develop a resin and dispenser system to coat large areas of lunar surface around landing pads and atmosphere locks with a thin, dust-stabilizing coating.  The coating will be UV stable and elastic enough to weather the temperature extremes of a lunar day and night cycle.  Special emphasis will be given to a low outgassing, solvent-free system that does not contaminate the lunar atmosphere.",Dust mitigation is a major requirement for the successful operation of a lunar base or even to deploy instruments on short-term missions close to the take-off site.  The novel new technology proposed here will enable NASA to quickly establish a dust-free zone without contaminating the atmosphere around the application site.,"On earth, dust is commonly fought using non-permanent means like water or oil sprays.  There are several applications however that require long-term dust stabilization.  This is especially true for mine tailings from toxic metal operations like uranium and lead mining.

Negative physiological effects due to dust inhalation by astronauts must be mitigated.  Issues related to lunar dust have been identified since the Apollo missions; however, no credible mitigation techniques have been implemented to date.  The essence of this proposed activity is to develop a dual-use coating system - a highly wear resistant coating surface that can also perform as part of an electrically conductive circuit upon demand to minimize wear surface abrasion and, when electrically activated, repel fine lunar dust particles from wear surfaces, sealing surfaces, and complex geometries. Multi-use wear resistant surfaces are also applicable to space structures such as the trundle bearings on the space station solar arrays.","NASA applications of the technology include all lunar surface operations and all materials/equipment exposed to the lunar surface environment, such as rovers and robotic systems, prospecting equipment, habitat materials, EVA suits and astronaut apparel, thermal radiators, power systems, communications equipment, solar concentrators, airlock systems and seals, and measuring equipment.

The application of the coating is followed by annealing at elevated temperatures.  Initial development is planned for stainless steel, followed later by other metals and plastics.  In addition to dust repellency, the DDRC provides abrasion resistance to lunar hardware.  Some of the DDRC coatings also impart UV resistance to the substrate.

While much of the recent work on the development of new CO2 control strategies has centered on sorbents that can be regenerated during the mission, these system add ""on back"" hardware, increasing weight and complexity, and reducing reliability.  A simpler approach is to use a membrane system to separate CO2 and H2O from the O2 environment.  Unfortunately, separating gas phase molecules with the needed selectivity is difficult with standard membrane materials.  However, converting CO2 and H2O to compounds with much different properties, could allow the needed separation to be achieved.  Therefore in this Phase I project, Reaction Systems will develop a liquid membrane that will have high permeance and selectivity for CO2 and H2O compared to O2, resulting in a TRL = 4.

The wide spread use of fossil fuels has caused a substantial rise in the concentration of atmospheric CO2, a recognized green house gas and further increases in atmospheric CO2 are not desirable.  Thus, there currently is a great deal of interest in the development of methods to sequester CO2 from combustion processes.

Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) is used to insulate cryotanks, but is a high risk for Earth Departure Stage and Altair propellant maintenance. An ultra-high performance thermal insulation, Integrated MLI, is being developed for NASA as an MLI replacement, and offers significantly improved thermal performance under space vacuum conditions. This proposal is for Load Responsive MLI (LRMLI), an innovative thermal system that under atmospheric pressure compresses dynamic Posts to support an integrated, thin vacuum shell for high performance in-atmosphere operation, then disconnects the Posts during on-orbit and Lunar surface operation to provide ultra-high performance thermal insulation.LRMLI will use micro-molded Center-Beam Tripod Posts between radiation barriers with a novel combination of low area-to-length spoke arms to reduce heat leak via conduction under no load, and a dynamic center beam to support a vacuum shell under load. For on-orbit space operation the theoretical thermal conductance is 0.22 W/m² (e* = 0.00048). For in-atmosphere operation, atmospheric pressure compresses the Post until the center beam contacts the underlying layer, supporting an integrated 0.020"" aluminum vacuum shell.  The load bearing configuration has higher heat leak through the center beam (0.84 W/m²), but has a heat leak 93X less than SOFI. LRMLI could offer superior on-orbit performance to MLI, much lower heat leak than SOFI during launch, and no need for N2 or He purge. Cryopropellant boiloff could be significantly reduced during pre-launch and launch operations, especially beneficial for Altair and EDS.In Phase I we would model, design, fabricate LRMLI prototypes and test thermal performance in vacuum and atmosphere, reaching TRL4.  In Phase II we would move toward a commercially viable product and a TRL5.","Load Responsive MLI (LRMLI) could provide dramatically improved thermal insulation for cryopropellant storage, especially during in-atmosphere launch and ascent. MLI has been identified as a high risk component for EDS and Altair vehicles. EDS requires minimal cryopropellant boiloff during launch and LEO operation. Altair also requires minimal losses during LEO and extended Lunar surface operations, and is difficult to top off prior to launch. Current thermal insulation designs use MLI, or SOFI/MLI combinations, and require purge systems to reduce losses and condensation in-atmosphere. Recent IRAD studies by Ball Aerospace indicate the total heat addition to the cryotank due to high heat leak of the purged and venting MLI is significant - up to 36% of heat leak for a 30 day mission. LRMLI could provide thermal insulation and integrated vacuum shell to insulate cryogenic systems on space instruments, satellites, spacecraft cabins and lunar surface habitats. LRMLI could provide micrometeorite protection. LRMLI should provide a high performance thermal insulation with adjustable thickness, mass and thermal conductance to fit mission requirements. It will provide inherent control of layer dimension and spacing, and should provide more predictable performance with less labor intensive assembly.It may be able to provide substantially longer term cryogenic storage, helping enable longer term manned space flights.","Quest has studied commercial applications of our Integrated MLI insulation. Terrestrial non-NASA applications of Load Responsive MLI (LRMLI) are much greater since LRMLI operates efficiently in-atmosphere with an integrated vacuum shell. We have had discussions with dewar and appliance (refrigerator/freezer) manufacturers, who have shown good interest in this early stage insulation technology.Hydrogen powered aircraft are currently in design, with a critical aspect cryotank storage of LH2. Ball Aerospace conducted a trade study of insulations for a High Altitude Long Endurance aircraft, and found LRMLI to be by far the best insulation with lower mass and significantly lower heat leak than SOFI or MLI with heavy vacuum shell.Extremely efficient thermal insulation would have use in commercial cryogenic applications such as cryogenic vessels and pipes in scientific and industrial applications. A major use is insulating LN2, LHe and LOX dewars for research and industrial uses.Other potential applications include large commercial tanks, industrial boilers and industrial hot and cold process equipment, refrigerated trucks and trailers, insulated tank, container and rail cars, liquid hydrogen fueled cars, appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, hot water heaters, mobile containers to keep foods hot or cold, marine refrigeration, potentially even house insulation.",Fluid Storage and Handling; Propellant Storage; Thermal Insulating Materials

Below about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators. One is that the heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thereby, severely limiting the number of useful materials to a few in common use. A second factor is that these commonly used materials are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues. In this effort, we will address both factors.

It is important to protect these LVs from any leakage of liquid propellants through a reliable, accurate, leak detection system.  Currently used analytical methods do not meet space mission requirements of low power consumption, reliability, low weight, and cost effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to adapt, optimize, and integrate optical detection technologies into an accurate leak detection system for H2, O2, and CH4.Due to their extreme low temperatures, these cryogenic fluids induce a contraction of the materials they contact, creating a potential cause of leakage. Hydrogen leakage in air creates an explosive atmosphere for hydrogen concentrations (between 4% (v/v)  the lower explosive limit (LEL) and 74.5% (v/v)  the upper explosive limit (UEL)) at room temperature and pressure. The early detection of cryogenic fluid leakage is extremely important for reasons of safety, reliability, and economy. IOS will provide its expertise in optical sensing to develop a miniaturized, reliable, highly sensitive, multi agent detection prototype, a Multi-Agent Optical Sensor Chip for Cryogenic Fluids Leak Detection (MOSCLD). The study will target detection limits of 1ppm or less and a response time in the millisecond range.","NASA's space shuttle missions are time-critical for launch. Since the risk of launch delay due to hydrogen, oxygen, or methane leakage is very high, avoiding launch delays is a high priority, particularly for the missions manifested for the Space Station. Sensors that can measure hazardous gas concentrations in real time, in situ, at multiple locations, from one part per million (ppm) to 100%, and in a high-vibration environment, are needed. Implementing a distributed sensing system offers significant improvement in detection capability with minimal weight impact and substantial cost savings.  Miniaturized electronic sensors are also used to monitor leakage, with multiple sensors placed at strategic locations.  The presence of electrical wiring in potentially explosive environment, coupled with electromagnetic interference from other systems, makes the use of electronic sensors less than desirable.IOS proposed (MOSCLD), will offer the real time, and multi-location early leak detection down to the ppm levels. The extended optical pathlength enables the achievement of the required detection levels, while the miniaturized sensor chip allows the non-powered multi-site leak monitoring.The MOSCLD sensor will be coupled with optical fibers to remote light sources and photodetectors to eliminate the electric wiring through the cryogenic fluids tanks and hence be intrinsically safe against dangerous spark generation in an explosive environment.","Hydrogen fuel cells will soon be replacing highly emissive petroleum fuels. The integration of such cells in automobiles and other equipment requires the development of a hydrogen leak detector. The proposed sensor platforms, because of their reliability, size, energy consumption, and cost effectiveness, will lead to their application in many different areas, including fueling stations, tank storage, and service stations.",Fluid Storage and Handling

Williams,brian.williams@ultramet.com,"Ultramet, Pacoima, CA 91331 - 2210",(818) 899-0236,,,,,,4,"In previous work for NASA and DoD, Ultramet developed lightweight open-cell foam insulators composed of a carbon or ceramic structural foam skeleton filled with a high temperature nanoscale aerogel insulator. The structural integrity and high insulation behavior have been demonstrated when used in combination with a non-ablating, coated carbon/carbon or ceramic matrix composite outer shell. The potential exists to develop a hybrid ablator/insulator thermal protection system in which a portion of the thickness of a low conductivity, structural foam aeroshell is infiltrated with an ablative material (frontface) and the remaining thickness is filled with the high temperature aerogel insulator (backface). The potential benefit is a reduction in ablator mass required to reject the aerothermal heat load. The vehicle interface temperature will be controlled by the aerogel-filled portion of the foam structure, rather than by ablator thickness, thereby allowing the use of less ablator material. The reduced volume needed will allow use of a conventional high density, high heat flux capability ablator, offering greater mission flexibility. In this project, Ultramet will team with Materials Research & Design for preliminary thermomechanical design work and will construct a ceramic foam-reinforced hybrid ablator/insulator. Preliminary performance will be established through hot-gas testing.","The proposed foam-reinforced hybrid ablator/insulator may meet NASA requirements for increased thermal protection system heat flux capability and reduced mass. NASA applications include the Crew Exploration Vehicle in which entry velocities ranging from 8 km/s for International Space Station missions to as high as 15 km/s for Moon mission return are anticipated. Use of ablatives in rocket nozzles has been extensive, and NASA also stands to benefit in that application.","Commercial applications for the proposed advanced thermal protection system include conventional satellite launch system solid rocket motors, nanosatellite launch systems, launch platform protection, tactical solid rocket motors, nosetips, and internal and external motor case insulation.",Ablatives; Ceramics; Composites; Thermal Insulating Materials

Surface roughness patterns (e.g., scallops, crosshatching) form on many materials ablating under turbulent flow conditions. Equivalent sand grain roughness models are inaccurate and inappropriate for calculating Stanton numbers. In Phase I, we will develop a near-term method based on pattern roughness data, observations, and models from diverse fields. This method may predict Stanton number increases directly from material and aerothermal environment information instead of sequentially predicting pattern dimensions, equivalent roughness height, and Stanton number effects. We will also plan a more rigorous longer-term model and validation tests to be implemented in Phase II.","The ablative material pattern roughness onset and effects prediction method we propose to develop is directly applicable to the PICA heatshield material tentatively planned for the Orion CEV.  Unlike most previous earth and planet entry missions, turbulent flow conditions are anticipated for CEV. Although PICA-CEV pattern roughness development and effects are unknown, other materials ablating in turbulent flow conditions usually develop surface roughness patterns, and factor-of-two increases of  heat transfer and ablation rates are not unusual. Current NASA aerothermal environment and heatshield ablation prediction tools do not account for pattern roughness development or effects on heat transfer and ablation. Our proposed technology will also be applicable to other future NASA exploration missions where heatshields are exposed to turbulent fluid flow.","If our proposed project is successful, it may facilitate an understanding of how to tailor charring ablator material formulations or processing to control turbulent flow induced surface roughness pattern development and effects. This would provide opportunities to partner with material manufacturers and/or patent and license technology. Our predictive model, and possibly our control technology, may also be applicable in other fields where pattern roughness development and effects are issues.

Real-time control is applied to an electric servo-motor to provide resistance and aerobic exercise in a lightweight, compact, and reconfigurable design with self-contained power generation.  The technical objectives of the system design are that it be easily configured and stowed, and require minimal power to operate including a pedal generator to supply electricity. The hardware is instrumented to document exercise sessions and provide whole body axial loading and individual joint resistive loading that simulates free weights with eccentric overloading.  The loads are adjustable in 2.5 kg increments to maintain muscle strength and bone density, and aerobic exercise is provided with pedal attachments.  The Phase 1 work plan includes initial prototype design, fabrication, and demonstration.  The portable design can provide resistance and aerobic exercise in virtually any aspect of spaceflight (extended use on ISS, short-term lunar sortie missions, and future Mars exploration).  The system also has application for in-home neuromuscular rehabilitation and controlled resistance exercise.","The proposed exercise countermeasure could be used in virtually any aspect of spaceflight (extended use on the International Space Station, short-term lunar sortie missions, and future Mars exploration) because of its compact size and portability.

Such a device could have very broad commercial appeal for athletes, aging populations requiring safe resistance exercise, and rehabilitation for patients with neuromuscular disorders such as stroke, Parkinson's Disease, or spinal cord injury. Therefore, the proposed research and development program will develop a device that could be incorporated into exercise and rehabilitation programs benefiting society at large.",Biomedical and Life Support

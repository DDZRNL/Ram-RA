While both systems generate on-line estimates of the failure-related paramaters, the HM system can generate false failure information, while the FLARE system may result in poor performance in subsequent flight regimes if its parameter estimates are far from their true values. The main idea is to combine the failure parameter estimates from the HM and FLARE systems to assure robustness to false alarms, missed detections and detection delays in the HM system, and to use the combined estimate in the adaptive reconfigurable control law to assure the desired closed-loop performance. In order to achieve the project objectives, we plan to carry out the following tasks in Phase I: (i) Modify F/A-18 aircraft simulation to test the feasibility of the proposed approach; (ii) Develop the IHM-FLARE architecture and algorithms; and (iii) Evaluate the performance of the flight control system under false failure information. Phase II will result in algorithm enhancements, and implementation and testing using high-fidelity and piloted F/A-18 simulations. Boeing Phantom Works (Mr. James Urnes, Sr.) will provide technical and commercialization support throughout the project.","Health Monitoring systems are becoming increasingly complex, and are commonly well suited for accommodation of a limited class of single failures since their emphasis is on failure detection and identification. On the other hand, our FLARE system is well suited for accommodation of severe multiple simultaneous failure but may result in poor long-term performance. Effective integration of these systems will enable efficient usage of the health monitoring information to assure robustness of the system under a variety of false failure information scenarios, and improved system performance. Immediate NASA applications are in civil aviation, and the development of an effective IHM-FLARE system is consistent with the goals and objectives of the NASA Flight Safety Program. Other important NASA applications are in the area of spacecraft control, and Space Exploration where an efficient IHM-FLARE system will decrease the crew workload and assure the desired system performance for the Crew Exploration Vehicles (CEV).","The proposed system has substantial potential in commercial aviation where effective control reconfiguration techniques that are robust to false failure information can substantially improve flight safety. Immediate applications exist in military aviation where the advanced fighter and transport aircraft are already equipped with sophisticated health monitoring systems. Other important applications are in the area of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) where effective integration of health monitoring and reconfigurable control that assures robustness to false failure information can substantially increase the autonomy of the vehicle. Related  applications  are envisioned  in the  areas of  robotics, and  unmanned  ground and underwater vehicles.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems"

In addition, it uses the reflected beacon signal as a radar signal to detect and track any non-cooperative targets within its effective range.  A multifunctional RF transceiver serves as both the primary radar and secondary surveillance radar (SSR).  The advantage of the proposed sensor package is low-cost, low-power (estimated power consumption < 50 watt) and compatibility with current aviation technologies. This sensor package is coupled with on-board collision avoidance logic and situation awareness display concepts for a remote ground control station.  Simulation-based demonstration ? leveraging IAI's CybeleProTM agent infrastructure ? is also proposed to exercise the system ""end-to-end"" and allow for nearly seamless transition to human-in-the-loop evaluation of display concepts.","One of the applications of NASA-related application for this sensor system is UAV collision avoidance. For UAVs to be more efficient in their increasing applications, they must be integrated into the Air Traffic Control system that currently only controls piloted aircraft. To achieve this, developers must deliver collision avoidance equipage sufficient to assure air safety. Current procedures for UAV operation within the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) are cumbersome and unsustainable for the long term.  They often require separate attention from air traffic control authorities, limiting user flexibility and responsiveness, and hindering effective operations - military or commercial. The proposed research will add the ability to see and avoid both cooperative (transponding) and non-cooperative aircraft to UAVs.  Such capability is crucial to providing military services and industry with sustainable, flexible UAV operations, sufficiently robust to safely deploy whenever and wherever needed. Additionally, these technologies will increase safety in the civil sector through integration on manned aircraft.","The proposed sensor package can also be used on other onboard-pilot operated aircrafts as a replacement of expensive TCAS system. In the near future more and smaller size aircrafts will be equipped with low-cost ADS-B or UAT system.  Current technologies are based on beacon signaling instead of active sensor, thus cannot effectively detect and track noncooperative threats. The proposed technology will help to develop next generation collision avoidance systems with enhanced situation awareness and minimum cost.","Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems; RF"

However, a mandate for increased National Airspace System capacity has led to efforts to tighten these time-tested separation constraints.  One of these efforts, NASA's Wake Vortex Advisory System (WakeVAS), is intended to measure, calculate, and display wake vortex information to air traffic controllers.  The controllers will utilize this information to decrease the time and distance between aircraft, thereby increasing capacity while maintaining safety.  To complement this ground-based approach and provide an additional layer of safety, we propose to increase pilot situation awareness (SA) to the wake vortex hazards in the airport vicinity.  In this proposal, our goal is to design a conceptual prototype of a wake vortex display for eventual use on commercial air carrier flight decks.  We have chosen the commercial air carrier domain as the focus of our efforts because this is where the pressure to increase capacity is the greatest and thus, we believe, maintaining safety via pilot SA is more critical.  Further, we will develop human performance models to evaluate the effect of the display on pilot SA, workload, and performance.","A potential NASA application for this project is an avionics display within the cockpit that increases air safety.  This display could be implemented in NASA aircraft to allow the pilots to see wake vortex.  This information could be of particular interest to pilots of aircraft in the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS), since wake vortex poses a more serious threat to smaller rather than larger aircraft.  That information can then be used to avoid the hazard areas and reduce accidents and incidents caused by an aircraft entering the wake of another aircraft.  Another application for NASA is the IMSAS-based human performance model.  This could be used to predict pilot performance in future aircraft systems.","The potential commercial application for this project is an avionics display within the cockpit that increases air safety.  This display could be marketed to manufacturers of commercial, military, and private aircraft to allow the pilots of these aircraft to see wake vortex.

We propose to develop an observer-based assessment tool, and associated measures, that will allow National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) researchers to assess the impact of new technologies on crew resource management (CRM) performance. This is particularly important because the new FAA Advisory Circular on CRM training specifically calls for specialized training and evaluation in advanced technology cockpits (AC 120-51E, Page12, Part 13c). Our proposed approach is innovative in two respects. First, in contrast to existing measures of CRM performance, the measures will be sensitive to performance effects related to the insertion of crew-centered technologies in the cockpit. Second, the performance measures will be implemented in a hand-held PC instrument, the Scenario-based Performance Observation Tool for Learning in Team Environments?Aerospace Crew-centered Technologies (SPOTLITE-ACT), with a relational database that will allow for easy collection, storage, and retrieval of experimental data. SPOTLITE-ACT will provide NASA researchers with the capability to measure and evaluate the effects of crew-centered technologies on pilot performance.","The SPOTLITE-ACT tool will allow NASA to conduct human factors research and examine the impacts of new cockpit technologies on crew resource management (CRM) performance. The tool will be implemented on a tablet PC with a relational database allowing for ease of data collection, storage, and retrieval in both operational and simulation environments. SPOTLITE-ACT will allow NASA to compare performance within and across technologies, pilot groups, and operation-types.  Furthermore, the tool provides a flexible software framework for the future addition of other measurement ""modules"" for assessing performance under different conditions and in different domains.  For example, another SPOTLITE module can be developed to analyze air traffic controllers' performance during sector handoff procedures. SPOTLITE-ACT will be relevant for vehicle safety technologies such as synthetic vision systems (SVS) and cockpit displays of traffic information (CDTIs), as well as other NASA-sponsored projects.","The SPOTLITE-ACT tool will appeal to customers who need to assess the impact of new crew-centered technologies on CRM performance and those who develop and conduct training for pilots on new crew-centered technologies. Aerospace system designers can benefit by using the proposed tool to analyze technology-related effects on performance throughout the development cycle. Government or industry personnel concerned with technology implementation and certification can use the proposed tool to compare performance observed with the new technology to that obtained with other new or existing options. Additionally, complex human-machine systems or organizations like an air traffic control tower, power plant control center, or hospital emergency room would benefit from an analysis of the effects of emerging technologies on human performance.",Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools

Cumulative cracks at critical loading and high stress areas, if not detected and repaired in time, can lead to a catastrophic failure. Traditional inspection methods such as Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) and Eddy current are point-by-point methods and very time consuming. Disassembly of the engine is needed for each inspection, which may generate more problems.   We propose a wireless in-situ ultrasonic guided wave health monitoring approach that can eliminate all the disadvantages of conventional methods. It applies light, thin ultrasonic guided wave circumferential patch transducers around the root of the disk. Guided waves travel in the radial direction and can inspect the whole disk area. The electrical signal is coupled wirelessly to the circumferential patch through a pair of RF antennas mounted on the rotor shaft and a stationary fixture around the shaft, respectively. The inspection can be done even when the disk is rotating. The envisioned system has minimal impact to the rotor performance, can instantaneously provide reliable and quantitative data such as crack location and severity level, can minimize and eventually eliminate the need for structural disassembly, and is able to communicate wirelessly for in-situ engine health monitoring.","The ability to detect and characterize cracks in the engine rotor disks in an early and accurate manner is always critical for improving safety and reducing cost for many NASA aviation vehicle propulsion systems. At the end of Phase 2, we will have a small, light weight, low cost, and robust system with both hardware and software integrated together for cracks detection and localization. The success of such a system will greatly enhance the aviation safety while reducing the downtime due to scheduled maintenance.","In-situ wireless health monitoring and fault diagnosis is equally important for many military and commercial systems such as aircraft, automobiles, trains, home appliances, nuclear reactors, etc. The system can either perform continuous monitoring for the critical high strength components or switch on-off when needed.

The two key issues that will be addressed during the proposed work are: (1) the feasibility of obtaining near infrared radiation signatures from inaccessible areas through multiple internal reflections within the enclosure, and (2) the feasibility of decoding the signatures with sufficient fidelity so as to eliminate false alarms.   Three Phase I tasks are planned to address the feasibility of the proposed project.  The first task is to design and fabricate a system for obtaining near infrared radiation signatures within an instrument rack, representative of the inaccessible areas in aircrafts.  The second task is to develop a fire detection system that readily discriminates between real fires and false alarms.  The final task is to evaluate the system in a laboratory.  It is anticipated that at the end of the Phase I work, the feasibility of utilizing reflected near infrared radiation for uniquely distinguishing fires would have been demonstrated.  For Phase II work, a prototype, low cost and low weight system will be fabricated and evaluated both at En'Urga Inc. and at the microgravity facilities at the NASA Glenn Research Center.","The primary NASA application for the proposed fire detector is in the prevention of on-board fires in spacecrafts.  A false alarm free fire detector that can quickly detect and locate fires hidden behind instrument panels and in cargo bays is crucial to developing mitigating strategies in the event such fires occur.  With the ongoing emphasis on space exploration, it is likely that more manned space flights will be required in the future.  For such manned missions, even false alarms that sometime occur in current NASA spacecrafts have the potential of leading to disasters, particularly if their frequency is such that they are ignored.  Therefore, the proposed fire detector is crucial to NASA for building a portfolio of fire detection technologies that can be readily employed for various missions in the future.","The primary commercial application of the proposed fire detector is in the detection of instrument panel and cargo hold fires within aircrafts.  Aircraft fires, though infrequent, can be potentially devastating to the industry.  Every year, there are several dozen instances of false fire alarms in civilian aircrafts, leading to flight delays and high costs associated with dealing with the alarms.  Any fire detector that is as reliable as the existing smoke detectors and less false alarm prone is commercially attractive to the aircraft industry.  In addition to the aircraft industry, the proposed fire detector will be beneficial for various military applications within small enclosed spaces such as inside submarines and ships.  The low false alarm feature of the fire detector will also be beneficial to museums, art galleries, and large warehouses, where a single deployment of a fire protection system due to a false alarm has very high monetary loss.",Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Combustion

This cloud property information is currently obtained by launching an aircraft or positioning a satellite to the desired location, which makes it difficult obtain this information economically. New low cost commercially available semiconductor lasers, developed for the fiber optic communication industry, allows this innovation to be possible. The sensor would measure liquid water content, mean drop size, and droplet phase using a low-power infrared laser based sensor system. These parameters would be used to identify certain cloud conditions that pose airborne icing hazards to aircraft.  Current low cost expendable radiosondes provide altitude, location, temperature, and atmospheric pressure information, but not water content information that indicate aircraft icing potential.  This cloud property information is crucial to aircraft operating at altitudes, as well as important in weather forecasting models.

Overall aircraft safety - Due to predictive nature of FADS and RGPC control system several failure and/or malfunction scenarios can be avoided. Also, in the event they are not avoidable, the proposed system will detect the problem sooner and exploit its reconfiguration capability to recover from the failure efficiently.2.  On-Board Health Monitoring - The FADS system coupled with RGPC provide wealth of information that can be used to monitor the health of the aircraft.   3.  Improved Pilot Information System - The incipient perturbations/ anomalies can be made known to the pilot instantaneously with cockpit display.  4.

MDC has been working to development of a structural health monitoring (SHM) device, which essentially evolves the embedding of sets of sensors into a structure to allow continuous remote monitoring.  MDC's work is aimed at developing a robust infrastructure package to support a variety of sensor types and detection methods for aerospace structures.  Components have been developed to acquire data, excite transducers, store and wirelessly transmit data, as well as a thin-film battery and packaging to protect the electronics from moisture, EMI and impact.  During the course of this SBIR, MDC will work to develop a power replenishment patch that uses piezoelectric technology coupled with an innovative circuit design to ""top-off"" SHM system batteries.  These thin patches would be intimately bonded to the structure in order to harvest strain energy to recharge a thin-film Lithium battery slowly over time.  This concept is unique since it takes advantage of the low duty cycle of SHM electronics, instead of attempting to harvest energy for continuous system operation.  MDC will demonstrate the ability to performing structural integrity testing using only harvested power.","There are four basic areas of applicability to NASA.  The first is long duration spacecraft, such as satellites and space exploration vehicles, which need cheap and light monitoring to confirm damage that occurs during launch or deployment.  Another important area is expendable launch vehicles to facilitate launch/no-launch decisions, due to damage sustained during vehicle assembly or pre-launch.  Of probably greatest importance, SHM systems will be a key technology for reusable launch vehicle for quick turn around times.  Lastly, SHM systems would also be useful for the space station to help guide wear and maintenance, especially near docking regions.","Structural integrity monitoring has the potential for economic benefits in a broad range of markets.  These systems can be utilized by structures from military or civil aircraft, to cars, ships or civil infrastructure.  The first major benefit is that integrity monitoring eliminates the need for scheduled inspections.  A second major economic benefit is that a continuously monitoring system would allow for the use of the much more efficient condition based maintenance (CBM) design methodology of a structure, otherwise known as need-based repair.  A third benefit would be from increased service time of the structure.

Some of these events are detected through a subjective determination by the aircrew.  This subjective determination can result in both maintenance being performed unnecessarily and maintenance not being performed when needed.  AeroTech will develop a multi-tier, Quantitative Condition Alerting and Analysis Support (Q-CAAS) system for aircraft that will in real-time, automatically downlink to maintenance personnel, reports on the occurrence of specific conditions and events (e.g. loads exceedance).  The reports will be displayed on a web based, ground station network.  The system will also track individual aircraft's exposure to particular in-flight conditions allowing airline personnel to tailor maintenance programs to individual aircraft.  By providing quantifiable data in real-time, operational decisions can be made to minimize the impact and maximize the benefits of on-condition maintenance.  The Q-CAAS system will be comprised only of software that can be implemented on most current fleet aircraft, keeping costs low, minimizing the time to market, and therefore maximizing the likelihood of industry adoption.","This system will directly support the Aviation Safety and Security Program's focus of protecting and preventing damage to aircraft due to abnormal operations and system failures, and can be directly applied to two elements of this focus: 1) the Phase I Single Aircraft Accident Prevention element, whose goal is to develop health and usage technologies that enable realtime and trending status of critical on-board aircraft systems in order to reduce failed equipment citings in fatal accident reports by 15%, and 2) the Phase II Aircraft & Propulsion Systems Self-Diagnosis & Self Reliance element, which includes a subproject for developing sensors for self-diagnostics of structural components.

The architecture is based on a flexible and powerful model updating algorithm that provides optimal fusion of diagnostics with model-based state indications and minimization of uncertainty in remaining life predictions. This project will focus on development of several key features of that algorithm, including automatic recognition of a failure that is not progressing according to the physical model, and practical considerations for on-board use such as minimizing computational and memory requirements. By the end of Phase II, Sentient will demonstrate a working prototype of an on-board prognostic system developed using the proposed architecture and tools. This demonstration will use diagnostic and model algorithms developed under the DARPA Prognosis Program, and will be compared to a large set of fault data for turbine engine and subscale bearings.","This general-purpose set of reusable tools and code will substantially reduce the time and cost of developing on-board prognostics for new aircraft and spacecraft health management systems, while helping to ensure robust and accurate performance of the final system. Any system that uses sensor-based diagnostics to indicate state and models to predict fault progression would benefit from the proposed toolset. This includes vehicle health management systems in spacecraft, launch vehicles, propulsion systems, and similar applications.","The proposed toolset will have extensive military and commercial applications.

One of the most challenging issues in today's Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell is to increase unit power and power density (volume and weight). Bipolar plates play a critical role in the PEM fuel cell performance and durability, and they represent the major part of the fuel cell stack in weight and volume.

The reformer will consist of a small heated bed of sulfur tolerant partial oxidation catalyst and will operate by alternate exposure to air and vaporized fuel.  Carbon deposition and steam requirements and, possibly, the need for a  prereformer will be reduced or eliminated by this cyclic mode.

It is desirable to have very light components, such as the stator, for these electric propulsion systems.  Superconducting stator coils can be lighter weight than cryogenically cooled copper stator coils.  The recent development of magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting wires makes possible the potential to have much lighter weight superconducting stator coils than with any other metal or ceramic superconductor.  The MgB2 superconductor, cooled in the available liquid hydrogen fuel, is the ideal candidate wire material for stator coils for large aircraft motors.   The lighter weight coils, especially in the stator, will enable a lighter weight motor.  During the Phase I we will demonstrate using this magnesium diboride superconductor wire in diamond wound stator coil form.  This will show feasibility of fabricating full size diamond patterned stator coils in a Phase II effort.","Besides large aircraft motors, magnesium diboride superconductors can benefit NASA applications for superconducting ADR coils, transformers, inductors, magnetic bearings, actuators, MHD magnets, and other potential power conditioning applications.","Commercialization of magnesium diboride superconducting wires will allow less expensive and more open MRI systems for medical use, and lower cost and more efficient power utility applications such as transformers, motors, generators, fault current limiters, and SMES.",Aircraft Engines; Power Management and Distribution; Superconductors and Magnetic

Significant aerodynamic, systems, and control benefits are possible through the integration of virtual aerodynamic shaping technology into modern aircraft.  Virtual aerodynamic shaping involves using flow control technology to manipulate the flow field to achieve a desired result regardless of the geometry.  A high-payoff approach to significantly increased air vehicle performance is the use of a novel momentum porting concept for the virtual shaping of extended run natural laminar flow sections.  The objective of this research is to incorporate a robust and simple tangential pulsed jet blowing system that requires no external air to design and virtually shape an extended natural laminar flow section offering radical performance enhancement in the form of increased lift-to-drag and maximum lift.  Additionally, the system will produce a wing design enabling a hinge-less, full-span virtual shaping capability which can be used for fully pilot reactive roll control, span load tailoring, and gust load alleviation.  The system will provide significantly enhanced performance for the air vehicle throughout the entire flight envelope.","The proposed virtual shaping natural laminar flow technology has significant potential application in several NASA programs.

The development of Micro unmanned air vehicles (MAVs) and Mars aircraft has received considerable attention recently.  Unlike conventional aircraft, MAVs and Mars aircraft suffer from operation in an extremely low Reynolds number flight regime.  Generally, a low Reynolds number is considered to be between 150,000 and 500,000.  Both MAVs and Mars aircraft, however, can have operational Reynolds number regimes from 20,000 to 120,000.  At these extremely low Reynolds numbers, the aerodynamic flow features are dominated by laminar separation and separation bubble effects, which are highly unstable and very dependent upon the free-stream conditions and atmospheric turbulence.  Although it is often argued that an exploratory vehicle will operate over a benign portion of the flight envelope, an encounter with strong winds or gusts, particularly during a maneuver, could excite a highly non-linear response.  This means that the assumption of linear derivatives for stability and control may not be valid, which could cause the loss of a vehicle designed with a control system based on linear assumptions.  It is proposed that a low-cost, integrated ground test, simulation, and flight control development environment be created to address these challenges.","The use of the water tunnel to acquire aerodynamic databases at low Reynolds numbers, which match the flight Reynolds number for small UAVs and other exploratory aircraft, will make this system highly desirable.

Since many universities currently operate their own UAVs as teaching and research tools, the ability to mathematically model them correctly, simulate them, and develop experimental control systems for them will greatly enhance the value of the UAV as a teaching tool.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Simulation Modeling Environment; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures"

The proposed effort will address these needs by making available modular, state of the art modeling tools for use in full aircraft simulations to support vehicle assessment and control system design throughout the HALE flight test and development process.  These tools will be operable in a range of modes with up to real-time turnaround and will feature a unique ability to support hardware-coupled (""hardware in the loop"") simulation in conjunction with finite element-based aeroelastic modeling.

Phase 1 will study a single resource ? the off-load crews for a cargo operation.","The proposed SBIR is focused primarily towards a commercial product and, therefore, potential NASA applications are limited.  However, one application for this work is to NASA's continuing analysis of the impact and benefits of other automation or surface traffic management changes.  NASA could use the ground resource planning algorithm to study how other changes on the airport surface would affect delays or throughput.  The ground resource planning problem, fundamentally, is a queuing problem where each resource is a separate queue.  The algorithm optimally assigns flights to queues and calculates the wait and service times.  Therefore, the algorithm could even be applied to study runway usage, where each runway is a resource, or taxiway usage where the resources of interest are the intersections.  In addition, NASA could integrate the new user interface into NASA's advanced airport surface automation research to broaden the capabilities available to address NASA's research goals.","The AGRP tool is intended to be used by air carriers or airport authorities responsible for managing ground resources such as parking gate assignments.  Ground resource managers will use the AGPR tool to aid parking gate assignments, off-load and load crew utilization, fuel and catering scheduling, maintenance crew assignments, and marshalling/tug dispatching.  The benefit from the AGPR tool will be most noticeable for air carriers at hub airports or airport authorities responsible for utilization of a resource for the entire airport.  This technology is applicable both here in the United States as well as internationally.  Ground resources, including parking gates, are shared between air carriers at many international airports, making efficient use of the resources including fairness more important.  In addition, fuel or catering companies contracted by the air carriers to provide services could use the AGRP tool to better manage their operations.",Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Expert Systems; Human-Computer Interfaces

FACET has been gaining popularity with ATM researchers in research years due to its well-designed user interface and robust capabilities for simulating the interaction between the National Airspace System (NAS) and new ATM concepts. Since controller task load and performance is a critical aspect of any future ATM concept, we propose to integrate human performance metrics into FACET.  Currently, the only representation of human performance in FACET is through calculation of dynamic density, which estimates controller task load at the sector level through regression analysis of subjective controller ratings for current operations.  However, the applicability of dynamic density in its current form for predicting controller task load of future ATM operations is unknown.  By integrating human performance metrics directly into FACET, preliminary task load implications and predictions of workload-constrained sector capacity of any future ATM concept would be immediately available to researchers.  This would be particularly useful to future ATM tradeoff studies and could be used in lieu of subjective controller ratings for preliminary recalibration of dynamic density for future ATM operations.","FACET is widely used by ATM researchers at NASA and other government agencies.  Since controller workload and performance is a critical aspect of any future ATM concept, integrating human performance modeling into FACET will expand the robustness of the tool for performing system tradeoffs and focusing expensive human-in-the-loop experiments.",The commercial potential of FACET integrated with human performance modeling is growing as more countries privatize or consider privatizing their air traffic services.

The proposed capability, Emissions and Noise Total Impact REduction (ENTIRE) is innovative in the follow ways: 1. It spans the spectrum of environmental impacts, encompassing both noise and local air-quality;  2. It conjoins both ATM and aircraft-based activities for the management of these impact; and 3. It provides a tractable algorithmic approach to achieving specific noise and emissions impact reduction goals. The proposed capability directly supports the next-generation capabilities and environmentally friendly ATM capability sought under Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Subtopic A3.01 ? Next Generation ATM Systems, directly addressing integrated ATM/aircraft systems that reduce noise and emissions.  This software system enables NASA to provide quantitative techniques for finding ATM/aircraft operations that achieve specific combined noise and emissions impact reductions using methods that identify relative contributions of each aspect of ATM and aircraft operations to these reductions. At its core the system will utilize greedy/breedy algorithms with variance in degrees of freedom and comparison of subsequent solutions towards meeting specific impact reduction goals.","The goals of the JPDO mandate that environmental impact be a part of almost all changes in the future systems and procedures being designed and integrated into the NAS.  This indicates that there is a strong need and a growing market for a system like ENTIRE.  This need may lead to commercial opportunities for NASA in the following ways: 1. The ENTIRE effort will allow NASA to design and develop robust and adaptable mixtures of ATM/aircraft operations reducing combined noise and emissions impacts. This capability will potentially allow NASA to develop tools and solutions that may be of commercial value to other firms and other government agencies such as the FAA.  2. With the development of these capabilities, and related expertise in developing solutions to aviation-related environmental impact, NASA may win research opportunities from commercial firms and airlines seeking to mitigate environmental impacts.","The Phase I and Phase II non-NASA commercial potential for the ENTIRE method and supporting algorithms is significant in the following ways: ? Aviation-related commercial firms of all types (airlines, aerospace companies, consultants, etc.) need access to a methodology and algorithms that will help them plan and execute optimal mixtures of ATM and aircraft operational activities to reduce environmental impacts associated with aviation noise and emissions; and ? The long-term nature of the JPDO development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) implies that the changing nature of the business strategies of NAS users will require continued adjustment in the ATM/aircraft operational activities, perhaps in a tactical fashion.  This will provide commercial opportunities for firms able to rapidly ingest large amounts of complex demand, capacity, and weather information, analyze this information, and produce optimal operational-activity plans.",Human-Computer Interfaces; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Development Environments

A contributor to these costs is that controllers' and dispatchers' current tactical knowledge of turbulence hazards relies heavily on verbal pilot reports of turbulence, which are often inconsistent, late, and subjective.  AeroTech will develop a turbulence hazard decision support tool (TurbDST) that will enhance controllers' and dispatchers' situational awareness of the location and severity of turbulence; by providing real-time quantitative turbulence information down-linked from aircraft.  TurbDST will enhance tactical and strategic decision making with regard to airspace usage and aircraft routing by enabling users to predict the effect of the reported/detected turbulence on aircraft whose route may take them through that location.  With enhanced turbulence knowledge, collaboration with pilots regarding route changes can be improved and cost savings to the airlines can be gained through more efficient and safer aircraft routing.  Phase I will prove technical feasibility of integrating the turbulence information and will develop, using controller and dispatcher inputs, CONOPS and requirements for the TurbDST.  By Phase III, a meaningful controller/dispatcher TurbDST will be developed, tested, and evaluated.","When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, this turbulence hazard decision support tool will be supportive of NASA's Airspace Systems program's goal to ""improve throughput, predictability, flexibility, collaboration, and efficiency of the National Airspace System"" and the Efficient Flight Path Management's (EFPM) goal to develop ""integrated air traffic management decision support tools and advanced traffic management concepts to facilitate modernization of the NAS.""  The TurbDST has direct applications to the EFPM's Advanced Routing technical area and the Direct-To (D2) tool, specifically with assisting in the visualization and notification of routing conflicts due to hazardous weather (turbulence).  The Strategic Airspace Usage project's Collaborative Traffic Management portion would also benefit from the tool.  TurbDST will also directly contribute to NASA's Aviation Safety & Security Program's stated national goal of a 50% reduction in aviation accidents by 2007 and benefit the efforts of the Turbulence Prediction and Warning System (TPAWS) program.","AeroTech's TurbDST will provide controllers and dispatchers with improved situational awareness and information concerning turbulence location and severity that will both enhance decision-making and enable more efficient collaboration with pilots concerning flight path changes to avoid hazardous turbulence.  Use of the TurbDST can result in more efficient routing of aircraft around turbulence, reductions in enroute delays due to weather/turbulence, and reductions in injuries due to turbulence, which all translate into cost savings for aircraft operators.  The TurbDST also has potential as a preflight planning tool for both dispatchers and pilots.  The tool will be software that can be used as a standalone system or integrated into current controller or dispatcher flight following and routing displays.  Air Traffic Control Centers and Part 121 carriers (both domestic and international) will be the primary markets for the TurbDST.

These requirements differ from standard computer image processing requirements since storage space, processing speed, and power constraints differ between PCs and satellites. To facilitate use of satellite images in other applications such as data dissemination, image analysis, image storage and retrieval, etc., a method is needed to convert satellite images to a more widely supported format. However, since many formats lose information (""lossy"" compression), too many transcodings, poorly performed transcodings, or transcodings between poorly chosen formats will degrade image quality, sometimes making them useless. Images such as military photos and deep space objects require high quality, so it is desirable to avoid or minimize loss during transcodings. NASA has requested software transcoding from the CSSDS Image Data Compression recommendation to JPEG2000 with minimal image degradation. This proposal shows how Cybernet will approach this conversion, obtaining a minimal or zero loss in image fidelity, through mathematical analysis and careful software construction. This will be shown to be possible due to the specific wavelet compression techniques used in the two formats.","The technology developed, a CCSDS Image Data Compression to JPEG2000 conversion tool, would be useful throughout NASA for converting space images to a more widely supported format, while still retaining as much of the image quality as possible. This PC based tool could be incorporated into any ground location that needs to receive satellite and probe images in the CCSDS and send them to other agencies, news outlets, and scientists in a format more suitable for use.","Cybernet has a range of image based products, from gesture guided weather software used on television networks to graphics toolkits for terrain visualization, and the competency we gain from work on the JPEG2000 format would benefit our core products. Furthermore, given time to develop a comprehensive JPEG2000 code base, we would market this library to other developers without the people or resources to develop it on their own.",Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Software Development Environments

The new approach not only is capable of reaching the Shannon limit capacity, but it can also reduce the peak to envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of the OFDM symbols. This approach is unique since the design of high performance capacity achieving codes where all the OFDM signals produced by the codewords with low peak to average power ratio remains an extremely important, albeit a very difficult problem to solve, because a physical layer based on such codes can significantly reduce the cost of base stations. Typically, about 45% of the total cost of OFDM base stations corresponds to that of power amplifiers. This is due to the large linear region requirement of power amplifiers in these systems. OFDM transmission requires a large power amplifier linear region because of its relatively high peak to average power ratio signals. Thus OFDM power amplifiers are particularly expensive.   Furthermore, reduction of PMEPR will reduce cost and power consumption for mobile units, enabling wider deployments and longer battery life.","Future space operations require reliable modulation and transmission schemes that are capable of supporting 3 bits or even higher spectral efficiencies. Furthermore, future NASA space operations include LEO/MEO satellites along with high altitude airborne platforms such as drones and aircrafts. Such mobile devices require design of robust and reliable modulation schemes with high spectral efficiencies. Since many of these devices are moving at high speed, the channel condition can change rapidly and an adaptive coding and modulation scheme is very appropriate to design power efficient techniques that can adapt to channel variations. OFDM is a bandwidth efficient scheme capable of transmission of hundreds of Mbps. However, there are many practical issues related to the implementation of this multicarrier modulation scheme such as PMEPR. We will address all these issues in this proposal.","Common obstacles to wide acceptance of a given application three-folds as: 1) Cost, 2) power consumption, and 3) performance.  OFDM systems have already demonstrated a higher performance through efficient utilization of the spectrum.  Enabling solutions at lower cost and power consumption will further this acceptance and will enable applications which would have not been realizable otherwise.  For example, higher data rate mobile systems where without reduction in power consumption are not deployable. Another example is automation applications similar to 802.15 where cost and power are obstacles to acceptance, and higher performance will enable a new dimension of applications such as multimedia exchange.",Architectures and Networks; RF

Detailed designs will be created, performance simulations developed, utility assessed, a technology roadmap developed, and a mission planning guide developed.","This technology is principally applicable to NASA lunar and interplanetary missions ?regions beyond the range of GPS which rely on the DSN for navigation.  It can provide autonomous navigation throughout the solar system, greatly reducing demands on the DSN.  It can also augment the DSN by providing accurate time synchronization, and position and velocity components normal to the line-of-sight to Earth, both of which will enable faster and more accurate navigation solutions.  There are typically one or two missions each year that will benefit from the technology.  It could enable accurate, autonomous ""GPS"" for surface and spacecraft navigation at Mars or other planets.  Additionally, it can enable spatially and temporally coordinated measurements over solar system scale distances.  This could enable or enhance future space interferometer missions.  The reduced demands on the DSN combined with the potential for improved navigation accuracy would yield both cost savings and mission enhancements to NASA.","The primary non-NASA applications are likely to be for DoD missions.

The research outlined in this project will develop a hardware/software design environment that will allow NASA engineers to automatically develop flexible, reconfigurable communications systems.   We will develop automated compiler algorithms to translate software code available in a variety of high level languages (C/C++/SIMULINK) and assembly of various general purpose processors into Register Transfer Level VHDL code to be mapped onto FPGA-based hardware.  We further plan to study techniques for performing hardware/software co-design on integrated systems-on-a-chip platforms consisting of embedded processors, memories and FPGAs.   We will demonstrate our concepts using a prototype compiler that will translate software implementations of communications applications into a hardware/software implementation on a Xilinx Virtex II Pro Platform FPGA and a DINI DN2000k10 board. The proposed work is revolutionary and addresses NASA's Space Exploration needs as follows: (1) it will develop a system level tool for designing hardware systems which will reduce design times from months to days (2) it will enable the use of cost-efficient, high-performance FPGAs (3) it will allow engineers to reuse of millions of lines of software developed in the past for general purpose processors, and migrate them painlessly to newer SOC platforms.","NASA's missions are quite diverse ranging from (1) Satellite imaging to study Global Climate Modeling (2) Scanning Deep Space using the Hubble Space Telescope (3) Building the International Space Station to perform various experiments in space (4) Using the Space Shuttle to carry payloads to the ISS and carry on various space experiments (5) Exploring the Solar System in projects such as the Mars Exploration Rover, and the VAULT telescope to take pictures of the Sun.  (6) Searching for extra-solar planets using transit photometry in the VULCAN Camera Project.  All these projects have one thing in common; they require a lot of sophisticated image processing operations on images captured by various cameras.  FPGAs are being used for a variety of image processing tasks in numerous NASA applications.

This radio is innovative in several aspects: in its size and power, in its modularity that allows the ability to handle different bands, in its use of software radio technologies, in its automatic adaptability to varying transmission environments, and in its reliability and fault-tolerant performance.  This technology is paramount to the safety and success of manned missions in space, where unpredictable environments are present and where reliability is absolutely critical.","Any of the NASA's planned manned space missions would benefit from the advantages offered by the radio AeroAstro is proposing to design, whether it's an orbiting space station, a short-range mission, a lunar or planetary mission, or any number of EVA applications for which it is ultimately intended.  In particular, EVA spacesuits require a radio that is small, lightweight, and requires minimal power.  AeroAstro's design offers a solution that will allow astronauts to safely and easily maneuver during EVA activities and maintain reliable communications with other EVA astronauts and those on the planetary surface even in harsh and unpredictable environments.","This radio is very universal and applicable almost anywhere that radio communications are needed, although it is particularly targeted to those applications where ultra-high reliability is required.

SOFAR is compact, low-power, configurable, and frequency agile, requiring only one major integrated circuit for the FR front-end while maintaining waveform flexibility and reconfigurability.  It is based on three innovations, a novel six-port direct conversion receiver (6DCR), a novel fractal antenna, and cognitive signal processing algorithms.  SOFAR will intelligently and optimally adapt its communication functionalities (including frequency and modulation) to the harsh environment of the Martian atmosphere and avoid disruptions in the communications.  Therefore, SOFAR will enable NASA to communicate in extreme environmental conditions with multiple bandwidths of data transmission to support telemetry, voice, and video with the capability to handle changing propagation and interference.  In Phase I, POC will define EVA radio requirements and develop an initial radio design and testing methods involving both ground testing and space testing.

It will also be useful for NASA to communicate with astronauts in orbit or for communications in general via wireless network.","In addition to NASA's needs, other potential government and commercial applications include: wireless networks, cellular communication, and emergency radios. Fire, police, and other civil and law enforcement agencies would benefit from radios that could be reconfigured on-the-fly to interoperate with each other. Currently, police and fire officials must usually be routed through a central hub, and precious time is lost in the attempt to communicate among agencies.

Carbon nanotubes (CNT's) have material properties and dimensions that allow it to operate in the optical, and IR regimes.  Ion flux molding (IFM) fabrication techniques enable assembly of conductive CNT structures with tunable EM response. The CNT structures are designed specifically to test the performance potential of nanoscale ""thin-wire"" antenna applications.

This system is the first of its class to implement multiple frequency filtering and clock functions on the same silicon die.  The AlN MEMS piezoelectric resonators proposed in this work have their fundamental frequency defined by the lateral, in-plane dimensions of the structure and therefore can be fabricated at the same time.  This feature enables the definition of different frequencies directly at the CAD-layout level without the need of any extra etching or deposition steps as required by commercially available thickness-mode resonators such as thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBARs) or quartz crystals.  MEMS AlN piezoelectric resonators characterized by low motional resistance and high quality factors in ambient conditions constitute the most economical and sole solution for reconfigurable, multi-band and multi-functional wireless networks.  This RF multiple-frequency (100 MHz to 3 GHz) platform will provide new levels of component miniaturization, integration and performance for wireless communication devices, enabling smaller form factors and lower costs while opening the door for longer battery life.","Space-based communication:   Miniaturized, inexpensive, continuous-time, high-Q filter or resonator banks composed of contour-mode AlN devices present opportunities for novel transceiver, data conversion, and clock synthesis architectures.  Target systems could include short-range radio modules for miniature satellites, communication networks for planetary exploration, radio astronomy, and GPS.  Active microwave / synthetic aperture radar (SAR):  Active microwave sensors require radiation-hardened, low-loss RF filters for T/R modules.  The proposed AlN passives satisfy these requirements and span portions of the SAR spectrum including the UHF, VHF, P- and L-bands.  The AlN resonators are manufactured with a low thermal budget (< 450 C) and are thus potentially thin-film membrane compatible.  Harsh environment operation:  AlN is a robust, low-loss material traditionally employed for passivation and for microwave substrates.  Because of its inert physico-chemical properties the AlN resonators function over a wide-range of harsh temperature, radiation, power, and pressure conditions.  Novel acoustic wave sensors:  Using a similar principle of operation as surface acoustic wave devices and quartz crystal microbalances, the AlN resonators also function as a sensor for chemical vapors, particles, and others measurands.  Lightweight, low power sensor nodes could be used for health monitoring or in-situ atmospheric and planetary exploration.","The integrated chip proposed by Harmonic Devices will provide a compelling value proposition to mobile phone OEMs by reducing component count and freeing up valuable board space so designers can continue to add new features, reduce costs and shrink form factors.  The current directly addressable market size is estimated at approximately $1.7B per year.  Since these AlN resonators are fabricated with standard CMOS semiconductor processing steps on silicon substrates, they could ultimately become less expensive than legacy surface acoustic wave (SAW) and quartz crystal passives.  There is an extensive market for filters and resonators outside of the wireless handset market.  Other applications include military communications systems, RFID tags, sensor networks, automotive sensors and control, wireline frequency references and filters (e.g. fiber optic, cable modems), base-stations, and others.  In the low-IF range contour-mode AlN filters and resonators can be orders of magnitude smaller   than their SAW competitor.","Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Biochemical; Biomolecular Sensors; Ceramics; Gravitational; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Highly-Reconfigurable; Large Antennas and Telescopes; Microwave/Submillimeter; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Particle and Fields; RF; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Ultra-High Density/Low Power"

Besides enabling the technique to be applied to a rocket engine, the required modifications should also lead to potential opportunities to measure temperature and additional species, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace metals introduced into the exhaust through wear, such as Ni, Fe and Cr. A multi-parameter sensor is envisioned that combines four techniques, all using the same hardware: LII to measure soot mass concentration, laser-induced fluorescence to measure PAHs, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to measure trace metals, and passive emission to measure temperature. The sensor will employ a line-imaging near-backscatter design, used successfully in our previous work, that allows spatially-resolved measurements of all parameters along a path through the plume from a single vantage point, located a safe distance from the plume.

The survey mission will use radio interferometry techniques to create RF ""images"" of the surveyed area.  These images will show the locations of all RF activity within an area.  While an area is secure, a set of images will be captured and averaged to establish the nominal RF baseline for that area.  Once the baseline is established, real-time RF surveys will be instantly compared to the nominal baseline to detect the existence of RF spectral anomalies.  The TDOA and RI techniques used to establish the RF images will determine the precise location of any spectral anomaly source so that it can be quickly and cost effectively identified and mitigated.",Range Surveillance would be a primary use for the RI/TDOA system.  It greatly increases the speed and efficiency of insuring a clear and safe range by quickly identifying and locating any sources of radio emissions.  The system will identify inadvertent emissions such as a boater who has wondered into a secure area as well as intentional hostile threats like someone attempting to Jam or intercept communications.  Personnel Tracking RI/TDOA system could be used to locate or identify NASA personnel during operations.  If personnel were given a small RF beacon the RI/TDOA system could track personnel whereabouts during critical operations or improve security by identifying people in areas who do not have proper access.  Asset Tracking- the RI/TDOA system could be employed to track certain assets as described above or it can be used as a kind of passive radar to track and locate objects (equipped with a small RF beacon) like the solid rock boosters during reentry and recovery.,Interference mitigation around commercial airports is a problem that the RI/TDOA system could help resolve and locate sources of interference that are a potential threat to safe commercial flight operations.

Launch delays are expensive, so any incremental increase in efficiency of launch range surveillance should produce large cost savings. To meet this requirement, Broadata Communications, Inc. (BCI) proposes to develop a new combined hardware and software sensor package for early intrusion detection called Multi-Sensor Aerial Intrusion Identifier that will be suitable for mounting in small UAVs of 10 feet wing span or less.  The proposed intrusion detection system will be based on combining the output from three separate sensor systems: IR, Doppler Motion, and Stereo Video, to increase the reliability and sensor detection range compared to using any of these sensor systems on its own. The combined systems will have a 3-5 nautical mile forward detection range, compared to 1 nautical mile detection range for each individual sensor.  It will produce a reduction of at least a factor of 3 in the number of small UAVs needed for launch range surveillance, and consequently, a dramatic reduction in the cost of surveillance.  The UAVs will be equipped with warning sirens and warning lights to issue warnings to intruders, further automating launch range safety operations.","The proposed technology will provide an intrusion detection system suitable for protecting a wide variety of NASA assets, including launch ranges, future space ports, DSN radio installations, and very large array astronomical radio observatories. A non-AUV version of the intrusion detection system could efficiently monitor the perimeters of any NASA facilities engaged in sensitive non-exportable research. The underlying sensor fusion technologies used in the proposed system could have a wide variety of NASA applications such as improved processing of hyperspectral imagery for environmental studies, and more reliable fusion of sensor readings on board space craft for diagnostic assessments.","The proposed technology is generic and can be easily adapted to match the needs of many related government and commercial applications.  In addition to NASA's Range Surveillance applications, this technology also applies to applications where surveillance of large geographically diverse areas is required, including military base perimeter defense, energy pipeline protection, critical infrastructure protection, border patrol, mountain area search and rescue, and coast guard search and rescue.",Intelligence; Optical; Perception/Sensing; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

However, launch delays, due to the difficulty of verifying a cleared range, are common and will increase as spaceports are developed in new areas.   In order to expedite range clearance, it is vital to see ""through"" the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the quality of the images taken with long-range optical systems is severely degraded by atmospheric movements in the path between the region under observation and the imaging system.  We therefore propose the use of custom hardware, specifically designed to compensate for atmospheric disturbances in long range imaging.  Furthermore, we propose the use of a reconfigurable hardware platform, specifically field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), to reduce costs and development time, as well as increase flexibility and reusability.  Alternative hardware platforms are not well suited for this particular application.  Our unique approach would allow a single device, with the computational power of a computer cluster, to be used for not only atmospheric compensation, but also encrypted communications, audio and video encoding/decoding and transmission, neural network implementations, etc.  The applications of such a technology are virtually limitless!","Because atmospheric disturbances become the dominating source of noise in long-range imaging, technology that compensates for such phenomena has far-reaching applications.  There are numerous uses for this technology within NASA.  Such applications include range surveillance, air traffic monitoring, earth-based astronomical measurements, atmospheric compensation in extra-planetary missions, and high-altitude mission optical monitoring.","Many government and commercial groups will benefit from this technology, from law enforcement to the study of natural phenomena.

Missions are planned to obtain samples from Mars and return them to earth for studies and to other planets to gather evidence for the existence of life. An important goal of NASA in these missions is to ensure that technologies are in place to safeguard against terrestrial microbial contaminations of the planets from robotic space vehicles and also to prevent nonterrestrial microbial or other foreign compound contaminations of the Earth from collected samples and returned space vehicles.  Thus, each mission will require that space vehicles (landers and orbiters) be sterilized and sanitized for microbial and organic contaminations before launching to space and when returned to Earth.  Sensitive detection techniques are thus needed to validate the effectiveness of the sterilization process.  We propose to develop a handheld surface-monitoring instrument based on constant-energy synchronous fluorescence (CESF) spectroscopy.

ATA has patented an advanced inertial sensing technology based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).  Numerous researchers have patented and developed micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS) that measures inertial angular motions.  We believe that a composite sensor based on the best characteristics of both of these technologies is a promising new advancement.  Our innovation is denoted the Hybrid Sensor (HYSENS) owing to its origins in two distinct inertial angle rate sensing principles.   The MHD technology offers wide bandwidth, high sensitivity, with reasonable size and power.  The MEMS offers small size and power.   Initial analysis done by ATA and our MEMS technology partners indicates that it is possible to achieve performance goals that are at or near the state-of-the-art for inertial reference sensors.  The proposed composite sensor fulfills the need for lightweight, compact, high-precision, high-bandwidth (0-2KHz) inertial reference sensors for use onboard spacecraft with optical communications payloads.  The predicted noise performance for HYSENS is less than 0.1 microrad.  Volume for this advanced sensor is expected to be under 2 cubic in; its weight under 150 grams; and its power draw under 200 mW.","The immediate NASA application for which the HYSENS is proposed is in the context of an inertial reference sensor for long range optical telecommunication.  In this application, the inertial reference sensor is used as a feedback sensor to guide the telecommunications receiver or transmitter to the correct orientation that allows a small laser beam to be received at the opposite terminal of the link.  There are many other NASA applications in which a precise, small, and low-cost inertial attitude sensor is a requirement.  Ones that come immediately to mind are precise pointing and stabilization of large aperture imaging telescopes.  Spacecraft attitude determination and control is another area of widespread application.","The Department of Defense (DoD) also has many applications in which HYSENS will fit a broad range of applications.  DoD is actively pursuing transformational communication technologies that need space, airborne, and ground nodes (transmitter/receiver sets) to acquire and stabilize laser communication links.  A small, low-cost, but accurate inertial reference is a priority technology for these systems.  High energy laser (HEL) systems for military missions in a number of categories are being actively pursued, many of which require a high quality inertial reference sensor.  Defense technology for protecting aircraft against man portable air defense missiles (manpads), for instance, is benefited by precise, low-cost inertial reference sensors.  More mundane applications such as stabilization of video cameras on helicopter or ground vehicles are also a user of inertial reference sensors.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Large Antennas and Telescopes; Laser; Perception/Sensing; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

Crystal Research, Inc. proposes to develop a new type miniaturized adaptive optic device that is capable of removing all significant atmospheric turbulence distortions.  The proposed device is based on electro-optic phase modulation in a single crystal substrate through electro-optic effect.

However, these advances have not been paralleled in the performance and availability of single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on similar design and materials platforms.  Moreover, the vast majority of the activity in this field has been focused on optimizing devices for telecommunications wavelengths in the vicinity of 1550 nm, and there has been very little work on devices for use at 1064 nm.  For this SBIR program, we propose to apply innovative design concepts for the development of high performance SPADs optimized for 1064 nm applications.  In particular, we will implement a novel bandgap engineering approach to tailor the SPAD avalanche gain properties to realize higher single photon detection efficiency while maintaining the very low dark count rates that are made possible by optimizing the absorption region design for the detection of 1064 nm photons.  We will also apply design concepts that we have innovated during the course of developing state-of-the-art 1550 nm SPADs that involve optimization of the device electric profile for photon counting as well as epitaxial layer compositions.  These efforts will culminate in 1064 nm large area detectors (with active area diameters up to 500 um) that demonstrate feasibility in meeting SPAD performance targets including 50% detection efficiency, bandwidth of 500 MHz, saturation levels of 50 Mcounts/s, and non-gated operation.","There are two primary NASA applications for the high performance InP-based 1064 nm SPADs to be developed during this proposed SBIR program.  First, free-space optical communications to support space missions requires receivers based on single photon detection, and improved SPADs developed in the context of this program will benefit NASA efforts to demonstrate and deploy high-speed laser communication links between spacecraft and earth terminals. Second, active remote sensing optical instruments require higher performance SPADs to improve the performance of existing direct detection doppler lidar systems that make use of aerosol backscattering at 1064 nm.","There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications that will benefit from the development of high-performance large-area 1064 nm SPADs.  Range-finding and ladar applications present opportunities that encompass both single element detectors for remote sensing and ranging and high performance photon counting detector arrays to obtain three-dimensional imaging.  Just as NASA is pursuing free space optical links at 1064 nm, commercial FSO systems will be able to leverage improvements realized from the development of large area 1064 nm SPADs for photon-starved free space links such as those required in satellite communcations.  As with NASA remote sensing applications, there are commercial applications for improved SPADs in various types of lidar systems for measuring atmospheric properties such as wind and weather patterns, air pollution, and general trace gas analysis.  Finally, high-performance photon counting capability in the near-infrared is desirable for the detection of low light output fluorescence, photoluminescence and photoemission processes.

These specifications are critical to the NASA search for an extremely rugged power efficient pressure sensor less than 5 cu. cm operating from -70 deg. C to +20 deg. C.  The proposed MEMIUS thus solves the problems of weight, size, power efficiency, shielding, and electro-magnetic interference.  The Phase I effort will demonstrate MEMIUS feasibility, and confirm its ruggedness and sensitivity.  In Phase II POC will develop an advanced MEMIUS prototype.","Potential applications of the MEMIUS wireless sensor system for NASA will be in situ monitoring of spacecraft structure and integrity, and gas monitoring of in-flight and on-the-ground systems.

Existing LIBS instruments are not compact enough for space applications. Major obstructs for miniaturization are from: high voltage Q-switch based pulse laser, inefficient light collection system and bulky high sensitive array-detection. Based on a revolutionary low-voltage Q-switch technology and high efficient laser delivery and light collection scheme, Boston Applied Technologies proposes to develop an ultra-compact high sensitive LIBS instrument for NASA application. The laser featured fast and dual-pulse Q-switch with low switching voltage, ultra reliable fiber-ring cavity design, and high efficient laser-diode pumping. The low switching voltage also brings the advantage of reducing the complexity of the electronic driver design, which is a big chunk in existing electro-optical or acoustic-optic Q-switching lasers. The required ablation energy can be significantly reduced due to high efficiency of the proposed system. The resultant LIBS instrument will be compact, cost-effective and reliable. It will be capable of withstanding operation in space and planetary environmental extremes, which include temperature, pressure, radiation, and impact stresses.","This very compact LIBS instrument can be space qualified for versatile in situ substance characterization at key places in the solar system, and the return of materials from them for later study on the Earth. It is well suited for many NASA's planned and potential solar system exploration missions, especially for life (water)-finding on other planets and mineralogy analysis of surface and subsurface materials.","This versatile instrument has wide range applications such as environmental hazards analysis, explosive material identification for security, and geochemistry characterization on the Earth etc.",Ablatives; Optical; Photonics

This addresses a key technology gap for planetary studies, mainly how to acquire and prepare complex cryogenic samples of astrobiology interest for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints. Although miniaturized mass spectrometers and other low power instruments are under development by NASA for in situ measurements, the great potential of such instrumentation for exploration of the Solar System will not be realized without complementary developments in the technology for collecting and preparing samples for analysis.  Our proposed approach is designed to collect surface samples at Titan's 94K (-179C) cryogenic temperatures using probe designs both for surface penetration and for collecting dust or particles.  The samples, which are presumed to include hydrocarbons, nitriles, tholins and other materials, can then be pyrolysed or otherwise thermally processed to prepare them for chemical analysis by GC/MS, GC/IMS or other techniques. The goal of our proposed SBIR Phase I effort is to demonstrate feasibility for a miniature, low power cryogenic inlet system with sampling probes, and to develop a detailed design for fabricating prototype instrumentation in Phase II.","Future missions to the surface of Titan are likely to depend on Aerorover platforms for mobility. Since aerorover exploration vehicles depend on buoyancy in the atmosphere, this will severely limit payload and stresses the importance of developing new miniaturized, very low mass and power technology for future Titan missions.  Thorleaf Research believes it will be possible to develop the proposed cryogenic inlet system with pyrolyser probe at a mass of about 100g, only a few percent of the mass of the Aerosol Collector Pyrolyser system of the Huygens probe. This will provide key enabling technology to help meet needs for future NASA New Frontiers (or other) missions to Titan. Our sampling inlet system will be especially useful when coupled to miniature GC/MS and GC/IMS technology, currently under development at NASA/JPL and NASA/ARC.  The modular design also ensures it can be used with other detectors of interest to NASA.","Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%. Our modular design approach for the low power cryogenic inlet system with sampling probes will help it be adapted for measurement needs in scientific, energy exploration and environmental monitoring applications.

The proposed analyzer will address these objectives by measuring the CO2 isotope ratio to help develop atmospheric mixing models, while searching for short-lived, biogenic species (e.g. CH4 and NH3).  Recent observations have led researchers to speculate that biogenic or thermogenic CH4 seeps must be present on Mars, and their source can be convincingly determined by measuring the CH4 isotope ratio.  Similarly, since NH3 is an indicator of life, there also is substantial value in its measurement.","Besides its application to NASA, a compact, ultrasensitive gas isotopes analyzer also has significant commercial application.

Spectrum management and enhanced shielding can be particularly applicable to planetary missions.  For Mars missions, solar arrays are more useful if they can efficiently convert the large and changing red spectral component of diffused and filtered sunlight. The shielding approaches available with the Quantum Dot Luminescent Concentrator and the Quantum Dot Enhanced Thermophotovoltaics would assist in inner-planet missions, where thermal shielding is a significant problem, and outer planet missions, where trapped particulates play a significant role in radiation dosages. Improving the practicality of  thermophotovoltaics and infra-red photovoltaic conversion also allows broader application of nuclear power and direct thermal conversion and storage","The potential to commercialize a Quantum Dot Luminescent Concentrator (QDLC) for residential and industrial use on earth will be large once the technology is proven to be both efficient and durable. Since the QDLC is a non-tracking plastic concentrator, it can be a very low cost, efficient sunlight collection means. The absorbed and re-emitted sunlight can be used in a commercial application for day-lighting purposes, or to power miniaturized, high efficiency solar cells.  Either way, the high intensity ""business end"" of the QDLC is fed by a low cost, large area component. The economics of solar energy utilization becomes much more favorable if the large area collection components are made inexpensively; this is the fundamental idea behind concentrators, except that high-concentration ratio systems suffer from the need to accurately track the sun, forcing large apertures to be titled around on ungainly pointing and tracking systems.  For commercial spacecraft, solar arrays with minimum area, mass and cost are needed for direct broadcast, cell phone and broadband spacecraft which have increasingly high power needs. The enhancements provided by the Quantum Dot Spectrum Converter (QDSC), and the QDLC could meet this critical need in the near-term and remain within the acceptable risk of new technologies adapted for commercial spacecraft use.",Optical & Photonic Materials; Photovoltaic Conversion; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Thermoelectric Conversion

The displacer function will be performed by a thermal buffer tube and supporting thermoacoustic components containing no moving mechanical parts. Sunpower's linear alternator will be retained, except re-sized to accommodate the power of the TASHE.  TASHE technology has evolved independently, spearheaded by efforts at Los Alamos National Laboratory and typically packages components (heat exchangers, thermal buffer tube) in a physically different layout than typical Stirling convertor technology.  The innovation here is to recognize the similarity between components and repackage the thermoacoustic components as closely as possible to the proven layout used for Sunpower's engines. In this way it will be possible to make direct comparisons of size, weight and efficiency between thermoacoustic and displacer-type Stirling convertors.  The research will help NASA assess the relative benefits of thermoacoustic and displacer-type Stirling convertors for space power applications and may lead to technology uniquely suited to some missions where displacer-type technology is unacceptable for whatever reason.  In Phase 1 we will optimize the concentric TASHE design to provide as much electrical output as possible from a single GPHS (nominally 220 W of heat delivered to the convertor).  This design will use the same temperature levels currently used for the ASC convertor of 850 C hot end and 90 C reject.  This will provide a direct comparison of size, mass, and efficiency differences between TASHE and displacer type convertors designed for the same application and using the same temperature levels.  During Phase 1 we will also scale up this basic TASHE to a higher output power (~400W), and higher temperature levels, to provide a conceptual design of a high efficiency TASHE suited for Venus exploration.",The resulting TASHE convertor will give NASA mission planners the option of utilizing a very high reliability convertor of reasonable efficiency which may be well suited to severe environments or where reliability is of primary concern.,"In addition to the space applications which this proposal directly addresses, there is a significant potential market for commercial small-scale power generation, particularly in light of increasing attention to the environmental cost of fuel consumption and the new stringency of fuel emissions regulations in some areas of the world.

Only certain enantiomers are useful as drugs for the human body.  Raman Optical Activity (ROA) and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) provide stereochemical information down to bond levels.  Many biomolecules like proteins and DNA can be studied for understanding their structural chemistry and structure related dynamics.  These methods do not require material in the crystalline form and hence can be very useful tools. However, ROA signals are even weaker than the Raman signals.  Phase I and Phase II work will focus on enhancing Raman optical Activity (ROA) signals in amino acids and biomolecules, which includes measurement of vibrational circular dichroism by using surface enhanced process involving nanoclusters.  The use of nanoparticles is known to enhance Raman signals by several orders of magnitude.  Our goal is to achieve similar gains in ROA signals.  To achieve it, we will use a sensitive detection system in combination with improved surface enhanced chemistry and microfluidics-based single-molecule detection techniques.  This will result in improved precision of measurement and shorten measurement time, which currently takes several hours to days.","NASA's main interest in determining helicity of biomolecules is for their extra-terrestrial life search programs.  Indication of prevalence of Laevo or Dextro type biomolecules, their structure and isotope identification can lead to useful clues whether life existed elsewhere in the outer space.

Moreover, trace identification to the order of parts-per-trillion, or structure identification when crystalline structure is non-existent are also some of the important issues which ROA can address.","Research can lead to better methods to measure and quantify ROA.  Many chemical and drug industries employ spectrometer systems to measure circular dichroism.  So far, the focus was on measuring electronic or linear dichroism on large number of molecules due to ease of measurement.  However, with ROA, a single molecule can be studied.  Other benefits include not having to rely of phase separation techniques, which are not easily available for every molecule.

Risk often increases so gradually that no one notices, as safeguards and constraints are relaxed due to conflicting goals.  When a mishap occurs, it is almost inevitable that some event will trigger an accident.  A comprehensive risk analysis method must include organizational decision-making, system complexity, technical innovation, evolution over time, and non-linear, indirect, and feedback relationships.  A new risk analysis approach addressing these issues has been developed at MIT.  This approach asserts that organizational structure and behavior can be modeled, analyzed, and engineered.  It is based on the STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Modeling and Processes), STAMP-based hazard analysis (STPA), and system dynamics modeling.

The Hyperspectral Polarimeter (HP) will generate real-time strain maps of the balloon by monitoring the birefringence of the gore material, which is linearly proportional to the film strain.  An interference spectrum is measured for each pixel of a detection CCD array, enabling the construction of a two-dimensional map of the overall balloon strain.

The Zeeko Precessions polishing is a sub-aperture process that has been developed for the control of form and texture in the production of aspheric and other optical surfaces.  The Precessions process is deterministic and provides dramatic reductions in production time due to its high removal rate and repeatability.  Similar to other processes, the Precessions process can produce an edge effect due to the polishing spot changing when in extends beyond the edge of a part.  Currently, the control software assumes no change in the spot size or shape when it moves beyond the edge.

PSS meets this capability for solar sails by integrating sail shape models for disturbance computation with attitude and orbit dynamics, first in MATLAB and then in the proposed C++ real-time simulation. The real-time simulation will provide users the ability to duplicate their MATLAB models in an environment to which they can attach hardware and flight software. This innovative package will support mission development from the earliest stages of analysis through flight operations. The same solar sail simulation will be used for mission planning and operator training. ATK Space Systems will consult on the project and develop refined models of propulsive performance of real sails, considering wrinkles, crinkles, billow, and manufacturing-induced asymmetries.","The future roadmap of solar sails includes flight validation, Geostorm, Solar Polar Imager, L1 Diamond, Particle Acceleration Solar Observatory, Mercury sample return, and eventually an interstellar probe. The proposed simulation, with its basis in MATLAB, can grow with these missions for years and be used in all stages of mission analysis, development, and operation. Once a successful validation mission has flown, the market for solar sails could expand considerably, encompassing space weather stations, observatories, and low and high-AU interplanetary science missions. The trajectory optimization portions of the simulation apply to broad classes of missions and are not limited to sail applications.","Solar sails are of interest to numerous parties, including private organizations such as the Planetary Society. The European Space Agency has already expressed interest in the MATLAB tools, which will not require an export license for overseas sale. There is also a general lack of reliable, repeatable trajectory optimization tools on the market, which are needed for low-thrust missions in addition to solar sailing.","Attitude Determination and Control; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Simulation Modeling Environment; Solar; Structural Modeling and Tools; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Training Concepts and Architectures"

The HPMTC utilizes a unique propellant injector to generate a coaxial vortex flow field in the combustion chamber.  Propellant mixing and burning are confined to the core vortex, while the cool outer vortex provides convective cooling to counter the effects of thermal radiation. The HPMTC will utilize an optimized combustion chamber geometry and propellant injectors to maximize performance and minimize wall heating. Avoiding severe thermal cycling of the chamber will provide very long engine lifetime and allow for simple, lightweight chamber designs. The coaxial vortices also provide an extended flow path longer than the geometric length of the chamber. The enhanced shear mixing can produce high combustion efficiencies.  Phase I tasks include propulsion system analysis, thrust chamber fabrication, hot-fire testing with methane using both GOX and LOX, data analysis, scaling effects analysis, and development of plans for Phase II activities.","Propulsion systems using the HPMTC chambers will exhibit lower initial cost, longer service life, and lower life cycle cost than any existing known or projected competing technologies for the same thrust level.  In addition to deep space chemical propulsion applications, which demand very high reliability and long life, NASA applications include the current propulsion systems for ELV's, service life extension versions for the SSME, and application to CEV system development programs. The HPMTC is well-suited to RCS, OMS, and upper stage needs.  Throttling technologies can be applied to mature versions of the HPMTC.","The HPMTC chambers are ideal for commercial applications where economics are more stringent in justifying pursuit of TC technology. For such cases, the low initial cost of the HPMTC main chamber, and the low cost of qualifying such hardware in a new size can be key. New commercial users seeking to develop reusable launch systems will be prime candidates to seek this new, higher-performance low cost approach to reliable, long life, low cost liquid rocket engines.

Because of recent theoretical and observational advancements within the field of radar meteors, we believe that existing models for the interplanetary meteor environment that are based upon or validated with radar meteor observations (Such as the NASA Meteoroid Enviornment Model MEM) lack important theoretically underpinning, and can be improved. Specifically, we now understand that the plasma generated during meteor entry is highly unstable and turbulent, and the evolution of this plasma, is at all stages largely influenced by plasma processes such as wave and ambipolar electric fields. Yet this has not been taken into account in any detailed radar meteor scattering theory. We propose to use our existing and on-going plasma simulations and models to provide the input profiles of conductivity and permittivity for finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations which can then interrogate the structure using plane waves that replicate radar pulses over the range of used frequencies from HF to L-Band. Using this approach together with our models for how the meteor plasma varies as a function of both meteor parameters such as size, composition, and velocity, and, atmospheric parameters such as winds/electric fields, density, temperature and altitude, will allow us to understand and characterize the full range of radar derivable information from meteors.   Achieving these proposed goals will close the existing information gap and resolve the conflicting observations we have on the interplanetary meteor flux. Our results will provide a revised model for the interplanetary meteoroid environment that will strongly support NASA's planned manned and un-manned missions near Earth and to the Moon and Mars.","The potential NASA applications are clear, that is we plan to provide and updated and more accurate model of the interpalterary meteoroid environment that is based upon state of the art meteor plasma and radar scattering simulations.  These simulations will allow the conversion of radar meteor observations into an accurate model of the incoming meteor flux, which will then lead to an improved specification.   A new meteoroids environment model will help NASA mitigate the meteor threat for manned and un-manned space applications.  Additionally, such a model will also support NASA's scientific mission including understanding solar system evolution and meteor effects to atmospheric science both on Earth and throughout the solar system.","An accurate and user friendly model of the interplanetary meteor flux will have potential applications among commercial space and satellite companies. Further, this model could be directly used to support meteor input for radar clutter, and meteor trail communication applications, as well as the companies that produce scientific meteor radars.

These oscillators have been typically based on the Gunn Diode.  Due to reliability issues and high DC power requirements, they are prone to  failures.  These failures could result in an unsuccessful space mission, a life-threatening situation and/or loss of invaluable data.  An alternative to this technology is highly desirable.  MMW Design Services is proposing to develop an alternative oscillator to the Gunn Diode using a Dielectric Puck operating in the Whispering Gallery Mode.  This innovation has the potential to produce compact, low noise oscillators operating with a frequency from 20GHZ to 120GHz.  Traditional Dielectric Resonating Oscillators operating in a fundamental mode are limited to 30GHz.  A Whispering Gallery Mode DRO uses a similar puck but in a much higher order mode, thus extending the resonant frequency.  The significance of this innovation is the improved performance of the oscillation at millimeter wave frequencies.  Space exploration will reach new heights. Satellites will operate longer and more efficiently resulting in cost effective missions that extends beyond our current mission life capability.","Developing a technology that is extremely reliable in order to replace a technology that is unreliable, results in endless economic and technical possibilities.  NASA applications include replacement of the traditional, (but less than ideal) Gunn Diode Oscillators currently used in spacecraft, radiometers and data links.  These oscillators could be fabricated with higher reliability by using the less expensive, technologically superior Whispering Gallery Mode DROs, thus extending the mission life, reducing power consumption and producing a higher  system performance.  NASA missions of earth studies and interplanetary exploration could receive very significant benefits from the development of this technology.","Non-NASA applications would greatly benefit from the lower costs and higher performance of the Whispering Gallery Mode oscillators.  Examples include 77 GHz Auto Radars, the developing 60 GHz point-to-point radios and the emerging 93GHz communications band.  WGM Oscillators can be used to research and instrumentation in the generation of electrical energy from fusion and plasma stabilization, a possible substitute for fossil and nuclear-based  energy sources.  Benefits to the military include higher precision radar systems for armed force surveillance, weapon guidance and safeguarding American soldiers.

The design and optimization of individual multipliers is fairly well understood. However, the complex interactions within a chain of nonlinear multipliers often limit the system performance. Specific manifestations of these interactions include rapid variations in power as the frequency or input power are tuned, including nulls and power surges that can damage individual components. These effects limit the useful bandwidth of terahertz sources, degrade system reliability and greatly increase the time and cost of developing systems for a particular application. Today, these problems are mitigated through the use of mechanical tuning or bias adjustments at each frequency, the laborious tweaking of each component in the chain until acceptable system performance is achieved, or reduction of the system bandwidth and/or power specifications. This proposal concerns the first systematic study of the complex interactions between cascaded nonlinear multiplier stages, with the goal of developing new multiplier and system designs that reduce these unwanted effects. The resulting terahertz sources will achieve greater efficiency, bandwidth, reliability and ease-of-use, as well as shortened system design cycles and greatly enhanced manufacturability.","This technology will enable the development of more powerful and frequency agile terahertz sources to be used as local oscillators for heterodyne receivers.

(VLS) will develop a novel hyperspectral plug-in toolkit for its award winning Feature AnalystREG software that will (a) leverage VLS' proven algorithms to provide a new, simple, and long-awaited approach to materials classification from hyperspectral imagery (HSI), and (b) improve state-of-the-art Feature Analyst's automated feature extraction (AFE) capabilities by effectively incorporating detailed spectral information into its extraction process.  HSI techniques, such as spectral end-member classification, can provide effective materials classification; however, current methods are slow (or manual), cumbersome, complex for analysts, and are limited to materials classification only. Feature Analyst, on the other hand has a simple workflow of (a) an analyst providing a few examples (e.g., pixels of a certain material) and (b) an advanced software agent classifying the rest of the imagery based on the examples.  This simple yet powerful approach will be used as a new paradigm for materials classification.  In addition, Feature Analyst uses, along with spectral information, feature characteristics such as spatial association, size, shape, texture, pattern, and shadow in its generic AFE process.   Incorporating the best spectral classifier techniques with the best AFE approach promises to greatly increase the usefulness and applicability of HSI","The proposed technology will greatly simplify the application of hyperspectral image processing and feature extraction for a wide variety of NASA related earth imagery applications including:  1.  Forestry and Environmental solutions to support timber management applications, wildfire modeling, and land-use analysis. The US Forest Service has already purchased a site license of Feature Analyst and their use of hyperspectral data increases.   2.  Civil Government applications for such activities as pervious-impervious surface mapping, creation and maintenance of GIS data layers for roads and structures, identification of urban green space.  3.  Homeland Security solutions for the creation and maintenance of GIS data layers. The newly created Department of Homeland Security has a budget of over $30 billion. Identification and mapping of high-value assets (pipelines, power plants, etc), monitoring of borders, and development of 3D urban models for preparing disaster and emergency services.",In addition to NASA based mapping applications from imagery the proposed technology will also potentially support the following non-NASA uses:  1.

This in turn requires guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) technology such as systems that determine spacecraft relative range and attitude. The proposed Hybrid Guidance System (HGS) will be such a system, providing increased relative navigation accuracy and robustness while reducing mass, volume, and power consumption by a factor of 2 to 4. The HGS's key innovation is integration of three proven and developed sensor technologies (laser-based retro-image pattern matching, laser range-finding, and correlation) into a low-power package. We will develop non-linear navigation estimation algorithms to fuse the sensor outputs together as well as to integrate the system output with other on-board navigation systems. The state estimate generation using three different techniques will increase the system's robustness through the ability to reject faulty measurements from one component of the system. Phase I of the SBIR will verify feasibility of the HGS design and the navigation algorithms and will culminate in a realistic mission simulation of vehicles using the HGS as part of an integrated GN&C system. The results of this simulation will serve as an excellent springboard to Phase II HGS prototype hardware and embedded software development.","There are numerous potential applications for the HGS both for formation flying and for advanced rendezvous and docking within NASA. Formation flying?the synergistic, coordinated use of multiple spacecraft to achieve scientific or exploration objectives?is an important enabling technology to conduct next-generation scientific and surveillance missions for both NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD). The robust relative position, velocity, and attitude measurements achieved by the HGS would be a critical component for future formation flying missions that will have increasingly tight requirements for relative state accuracy. The HGS would be an excellent complement for the relative/differential GPS and radio frequency (RF) cross-link systems currently in-use. Advanced rendezvous and docking?including both crew-assisted rendezvous and docking operations and autonomous missions?is a vital technology area that requires maturation if the United States is to implement the president's Vision for Space Exploration. The HGS could provide highly-accurate relative measurements using three distinct, proven sensing techniques that would provide a significant increase in accuracy and fault isolation capabilities relative to today's sensors in a significantly smaller integrated package.","Formation flying is important for the Department of Defense (DoD) as well as NASA. The HGS measurements would enable next-generation surveillance missions involving formation flying with tight tolerances. For rendezvous and docking missions, the integration of these sensor technologies into a single sensor unit could enable advances in in-flight aerial refueling for DoD aircraft, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where mass and power constraints are acutely present. Enhancing UAV capabilities is one of the major focus areas of DoD research and development funding.

The catalysts will possess intrinsic activity for ignition and will also possess requisite thermal stability and erosion resistance.  Minimal delay times will be achieved by the catalyst composition and enhanced surface area, which will accelerate rate limiting steps of ignition.  Phase I will consist of the synthesis and physical characterization of catalysts, evaluation of catalyst activity, initial optimization of composition and preparation of catalysts, and testing in a combustion chamber.  In Phase II, the preferred catalyst(s) will be optimized, synthesized in larger quantities, and subjected to more rigorous and extensive testing in a device.  The goal of the proposed program will be to develop a catalyst exhibiting a low ignition temperature, but also possessing the favorable attributes described above.  Successful development of such catalyst technology will lead to applications in a number of propulsion-related devices.","Successful completion of the proposed program will result in the availability of rugged catalysts for ignition of HAN/fuel mixtures and other monopropellants.  Such materials will find application in thrusters, as well as in other devices, such as as liquid gas generators, emergency power units (EPUs), auxiliary power units (APUs), and thrusters.","Potential non-NASA applications include use as an ignition catalyst in thrusters, liquid gas generators, emergency power units (EPUs), and auxiliary power units (APUs).

However S/C power system constraints on electric propulsion systems often force a choice of maximum power operation over a narrow range of specific impulse and thrust.  Most spacecraft users would desire a continuous selection of thrust and specific impulse at maximum power when possible, but power supply systems currently do not exist with this level of functionality. To provide continuous Hall thruster adjustment, a power supply must be wide ranging in voltage, current, and power.  In addition, the power supply system must be lightweight and efficient. The proposed work addresses these needs through a three-phase resonant power conversion strategy combined with novel frequency selective output-stage circuitry that will allow greater than 8:1 output voltage adjustment at power levels up to and beyond 100-kW.  Three-phase resonant power converters utilize filter components with lower mass and size relative to single-phase converters, and demonstrated efficiencies are greater than 97%.  Additionally, resonant converters operate at higher frequency, which results in extended stability when used in dynamic load situations imposed by Hall thrusters. The proposed Phase I program will develop a prototype power supply and demonstrate its functionality.","The primary market for this technology is for space power conversion were low cost power processing is required. Present technology includes PPU designs with real costs that are much greater than $200k per kilo watt of power.  The previous designs show poor reuse of modules and power hardware. Additionally the present PPU designs fail to provide a base structure that can accommodate growth and change in module power. The new design will use lower loss elements to simplify fabrication and reduce cost. The proposed ""next generation design"" will accommodate the addition and subtraction of modules while conserving PPU mass. The extraordinary wide output impedance range of the converter will increase utility by allowing one PPU design to power several different thruster types.  A successfully completed Phase II program will result in Phase III programs where brass-board PPUs will be provided for NASA missions utilizing NSTAR and possibly NEXT thrusters.  A Phase III brass-board program will be used to flush out all remaining issues related to 3PRC flight use.  Once complete, CPE and its sub-contractor Aerojet will be set to fabricate high quality flight hardware at the minimum cost.",Non-NASA uses for the proposed idea are commercial applications for space power where low cost and high efficiency are desired. Again the same advantages apply here. The most notable being the wide utility and range. This wide range converter will reduce the number of different model types required to satisfy current and future EP thruster needs.  One immediate non-NASA application is for Aerojet thrusters that are being developed for geosynchronous satellite use.  Commercial non-flight applications include laboratory bench power supplies.

Nanohmics proposes to fabricate a heterojunction solar cell composite consisting of high weight fraction titanium dioxide nanoparticles blended with amphiphilic, regioregular conducting polythiophene that are highly organized at an air-water interface. Furthermore, Nanohmics is proposing to prepare a novel device geometry that involves a low-cost, co-axial deposition process of all the cell layers onto core metal (e.g. copper, aluminum) or metal-coated fibers.

For electrostatic cleanliness, our innovation is to use large flat sheets of specially processed environmentally durable, ITO-coated DC93-500 transparent silicone material to replace the multitude of coverglasses and grounding components on a solar panel. For magnetic environments, we propose the use of a Kapton layer with a printed wiring pattern that mirrors the solar cell string to cancel magnetic moments. This metallized Kapton layer would replace the bare Kapton normally used as the solar panel substrate insulating front surface. A key innovation is to reduce the cost of solar panels by adapting the transparent shielding layer and the printed circuit layer with features to assemble solar cells into completely connected and wired panels using lamination. Features built into the layers position the Cell-Interconnect (CI) assemblies, solder pre-forms and wiring connections, allowing a one step process for ""glassing,"" stringing, laydown and wiring. This eliminates the most costly labor and schedule intensive elements of conventional solar panel assembly. This research directly addresses the topic needs of providing electrostatic and magnetic cleanliness and affordability for flight proven solar panel technology.","Electromagnetic cleanliness is needed for missions that use sensitive instruments, including magnetometers and electric field instruments. Current and future missions such as NASA's THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) and MMS (Magnetosphere Multi-Scale) spacecraft, have instruments so sensitive that the electric and magnetic fields generated by the solar array can overwhelm the instruments' measurements. This research promises significant improvement in electrostatic and magnetic noise signatures in solar arrays, which could enable more sensitive measurements than are currently possible. The need for lower cost methods for assembling solar arrays, which is a by-product of this research, has applicability across nearly all of NASA's missions, since solar array costs contribute significantly to total mission cost, and the ability to currently reduce these costs is limited by the ""standard way of doing business.""  Schedule reduction has been identified by NASA as a need for spacecraft bus power systems, and the proposed modular approach together with other schedule reduction features, will allow a significant reduction in turn-around time from mission conception to solar array delivery.","The same features that provide electromagnetic cleanliness will increase durability of commercial solar arrays in space against radiation, debris, ion thruster plumes and other degradation factors. This improved durability, together with the cost and schedule reductions being developed by this SBIR will lead to opportunities with commercial spacecraft power systems. Communications spacecraft need higher and higher power arrays as the number of transponders and communication traffic grows. The spacecraft providers for these missions are driven primarily by cost, durability and tight schedules, although state-of-the-art performance is important as well. For a typical 20kW spacecraft, the solar arrays can comprise 20% of the total spacecraft cost. A modular panel that reduces piecepart count and assembly costs by 1/3 would provide the spacecraft integrator with a significant competitive advantage.

The multifunctional panels significantly reduce parasitic mass and volume thereby significantly increasing mission capability for future space missions.  In its on-going pursuit of lightweight, low-cost systems, the space industry has made significant investments in ""high payoff"" technologies such as composite structures and high energy-density batteries.  These individual technologies are now ""mature"", and are ""standard"" for most new space designs.  Additional investment in these areas would yield only a few percent improvements over current performance.  Faced with these ""diminishing returns"", it is clear that future progress demands revolutionary new concepts for space subsystems.  ITN believes that this challenge can best be met using Multifunctional Structures (MFS). Structure and electrical power are the two heaviest subsystems on space platforms.  In addition, batteries often represent the most voluminous component of the spacecraft bus.  Therefore, structure and batteries have been the subject of intense R&D in efforts to reduce mass and improve performance.","The need for mass/volume efficient energy storage materials is prevalent throughout NASA missions including space exploration, space habitats, earth observing satellites, etc. As power and structure are two of the largest components of most space systems, significant savings can be realized with multifunctional panels. The cost and logistics of providing current heavy energy/power and structural components into space are a major limitation for current mission capabilities.  Mission capabilities could be significantly extended with the proposed multifunctional panels. The proposed structure-energy panels have several attractive features for space systems ● High cycle life (>10,000 cycles with minimal loss of capacity?less than 5%)that allows battery life commensurate with structural lifetimes ● One hundred percent depth of discharge that eliminates oversizing of battery packs  ● Very long shelf-life with limited self-discharge to make it attractive for emergency back-up power systems","A significant advantage of the proposed approach is that it employs mass and volume efficient energy storage systems that are needed for wide ranging applications from consumer electronics to military space systems.

Recent studies predicted that the volume of a power converter system could be reduced five times through the utilization of SiC power devices.   Despite this potential promise and encouraging results, more studies are needed to address the design and fabrication of SiC-based PCMs before their full potential can be realized. This project will develop an ultrahigh-efficiency, light and compact power converter system based on emerging SiC semiconductor technologies, quantifying the system benefits and addressing the related technical issues.

P&S systems are used in many areas of spacecraft operations including science planning, flight dynamics operations, and space and ground network scheduling.  Typically, different tools are used by different users, possibly in different locations, for each of these functions because current tools are not suited to addressing all of a mission's P&S needs.  There is thus an additional need to integrate the results of all these scheduling efforts, which increases mission cost, complexity, and risk.  To address these issues, Emergent Space Technologies (Emergent) is proposing to develop a prototype plug-and-play P&S system that allows for heterogeneous, distributed scheduling of activities to occur simultaneously without conflict.  The unique qualities of the proposed P&S system that will make it an innovative solution are the nature of how newly developed resources, tasks, and scheduling algorithms can easily be added to the system, how it will have an openly available and well-defined application programming interface (API) for developers to use, and how it will operate in a distributed environment as a resilient peer-to-peer architecture with no single points of failure.  With these innovations in place, P&S implementations for flight dynamics, automation and autonomy, system monitoring, science planning, or any other activity can be developed and operated in remote locations and still be a fully-integrated solution.","There are many potential NASA applications in the spacecraft and exploration systems domains.  Upcoming satellite missions and current re-engineering efforts that could take advantage of such a P&S system include LRO, ST-9, MMS, SDO, GLAST, WIND, POLAR, ACE, EOS (Terra, Aqua, and Aura), and SMEX (SAMPEX, SWAS, TRACE, and WIRE).  Some of these satellites host six or more science instruments, including LRO and the EOS missions, which introduces a certain level of complexity that can be reduced by the proposed P&S system.  The system would also be applicable to the GMSEC ground system architecture project.  This product could be a GMSEC-compliant component that communicates on the middleware-based ground system to easily integrate with other ground system components.  The Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) project at NASA GSFC has a need for more robust and tightly integrated P&S systems.  The ESDIS project requires a vast amount of science data planning activities among multiple satellites.  The upcoming crew exploration vehicle (CEV) project could also benefit greatly from the proposed P&S system.","The proposed P&S system can be applied to commercial and other government space industries directly.  Sample commercial applications could include the OrbImage satellites or the replenished Iridium satellites.  DoD and NOAA are government agencies that operate many satellites as well.  An upcoming development effort that could take advantage of the new P&S system is the GOES-R weather satellite that will be operated by NOAA.  P&S is not a need that is unique to the space industry and could be applied to almost any industry.  However, to implement the P&S system to another domain a new series of resources, tasks, and scheduling algorithms will need to be developed.  Since the API will be well-defined and simple to use, the turn-around time to adopt the P&S system to another domain will be relatively small.  Example non-space implementations could include manufacturing automation or appointment scheduling for medical offices, customer service agencies, or hotels.

Large scale simulations may be employed in a coupled manner, with the output of one simulation providing input data to another. Simulation execution may require significant 'wall clock' time to complete, resources such as memory and CPU, and may involve components that are networked and the need for resources such as input data files or temporary local storage of intermediate data products. With collaboratories and the increase in interdisciplinary and multi-investigator scientific projects, there is an increase in distributed, networked, and coupled scientific simulations. Moreover, problem complexity may require that multiple sets of parameters in the problem space be investigated, thus necessitating multiple simulation runs. With simulation runs extending in time, involving networked components, and networked resource usage, setting-up and monitoring these runs is non-trivial and increasingly time intensive. Such activity can waste a researcher's time; yet the simulation runs must be set-up and then monitored, as crashes, missing components, permission problems, network problems, etc., do occur.

Electrical measurements of these films demonstrated a relatively low dielectric constant (~20), an inherent ability to form a native buffer layer when deposited directly on silicon, and a strong polarization hysteresis effect. These results indicate that this film may be used to replace the two n-channel and two p-channel transistors in a traditional 4-T SRAM latch cell with two n-channel and two p-channel non-linear dielectric field effect transistors (NLDFETs). The threshold voltage hysteresis effect of the NLDFET should achieve full SEU immunity to at least 80MeV-cm2/mg of ionizing radiation, when used in a standard 6-transistor SRAM cell structure, thus have ultra-fast access times (like commercial SRAMs) while offering full non-volatility.  In Phase I we will provide the device proof of concept, then in Phase II build a prototype memory.  Phase III will see commercialization by licensing and sales.

In response to the described needs, we propose to develop a novel, radiation-tolerant, SF with a user-selectable standard SW interface or our patent-pending multi-level (ML) interface that features a high frequency range, low power consumption, and advanced functionality. Our ML interconnect technique eliminates the need for the second information channel utilized in the SW data-strobe encoding scheme. Instead the channel can be used as a redundant link for improving the system's fault tolerance specification. Radiation tolerance of the proposed system is achieved through the combination of the state-of-the-art and proprietary hardening-by-technology, hardening-by-design, and hardening-by-architecture techniques.","The successful accomplishment of this project will result in the development of a compact Application Specific Integrated Circuit or Multi-Chip-Module, which has the potential to revolutionize intra-space craft system development. The universal software-reconfigurable interface will not only speed-up the system's design and assembly process, but will open the way for the implementation of a true Plug and Play architecture and in-situ hardware adaptation. This is extremely important for the realization of future innovative concepts for space exploration over the next decade.","The novel space wire protocol based switching fabric approach that will be developed during Phase I will be implemented as a low power, open architecture, radiation hardened, application specific integrated circuit. The developed technology will mitigate new mission risks and minimize system cost and development time. This communication technology will also help computer and system designers to increase the processing power of future large computer systems in the movie industry and in a variety of military and industrial applications.",Highly-Reconfigurable

Our technology allows MESFETs to be fabricated using commercial SOI CMOS foundries with no expensive changes to the process flow. The MESFETs are radiation tolerant and the use of SOI substrates makes them SEU immune. They offer unique advantages compared to equivalent geometry MOSFETs including: i) higher operating frequencies in the ultra-low power regime; (ii) 10 ? 100X lower 1/f noise; (iii) high voltage operation (>20V). The MESFETs show excellent performance up to 200C, as do simulations down to ? 185C. The low-noise, high-speed (GHz) and ultra-low power capability of the SOI MESFETs makes them ideally suited for a variety of EEE mixed-signal circuits including analog-to-digital converters, low-noise amplifiers and voltage/current references for advanced sensor applications. The high voltage capability also suggests MESFET applications in power amplifier communication modules, as well as DC-DC converters in power management systems.   During Phase 1 we shall develop device models that describe MESFET operation over the temperature range ?180 to + 130C. The models will be calibrated against data taken from our existing MESFETs, and will operate within industry standard CAD tools. The models will be used to design and simulate an operational amplifier, a voltage controlled oscillator, a power amplifier and a low noise amplifier. The layout of the simulated designs will be completed during Phase 1, for fabrication during Phase 2 in partnership with a commercial foundry.","A low power, mixed-signal MESFET technology will be valuable to NASA wherever extreme environment electronics are required. This will include missions to the moon and Mars, where wide temperature swings will be experienced. Missions to Jupiter will benefit from the high radiation tolerance of the MESFETs. The low-power capability of the MESFETs will reduce the overall power consumption of spacecraft communication and sensing systems. The high voltage capability will be of use for advanced power management systems. The development of MESFETs for medical implants will benefit NASA through improved astronaut health monitoring. Because the MESFETs can be manufactured using commercial SOI CMOS processes, our technology is extremely affordable, and is compatible with the future scaling of SOI CMOS.","The MESFET technology we are developing will have widespread applications in commercial electronics, wherever low-power, mixed-signal circuits are required.

The benefit is to identify suitable sites for future landings of human or robotic missions and to aid in pinpoint landings.  High resolution millimeter wave radar sensors provide a low cost, reliable way for a Moon or Mars Rover to detect hazards and negative obstacles (i.e. holes and drop-offs) while moving or stationary.  A radar sensor is effective as a stand-alone sensor, or as a complement to the stereo vision based and laser line systems used on previous successful rover missions.  The low computer overhead and inherently rapid response of a radar sensor enables a rover to rapidly traverse extremely rugged terrain without risk of falling into a hole or being otherwise trapped.  The rapid traverse speed provides a wider area for collection of science data, and reduces the fraction of limited mission time spent on moving, as opposed to measurement.

Low-noise, high-bandwidth amplification and pulse detection circuits will be fabricated in the silicon layer of the wafer stack, using mature complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.  The proposed design is optimized to be both low power and radiation tolerance. The SOI architecture is inherently tolerant of radiation, as the small volumes of device material involved have a correspondingly smaller scattering cross section. Moreover, isolation of the thin device layer from the substrate means that CMOS receiver circuits fabricated on such a wafer will benefit from increased speed, reduced power consumption, and lower noise. Finally, as the proposed design can be manufactured using commercial CMOS foundry lines, no additional cost, development time, or quality control measures relative to a standard CMOS process will be incurred, once the hybrid wafers are procured.

The proposed fuel is a Cer-Cer made of mixed uranium-refractory carbide particles such as (U, Zr)C or (U, Zr, Nb)C dispersed in a refractory carbide matrix such as ZrC. For efficient operation in NTR applications for Isp of 1000 sec. or more, a fuel temperature of 3000 K or greater is necessary.  Various fuel materials have been tested for NTR applications with most based on carbide fuel technology because of their improved thermal properties enabling the design of very small, high power density cores.  Fuel designs from dispersed microspheres in graphite, to composite mixed carbides with graphite, to solid solution mixed carbides have been tested.  Fuels bearing graphite are not tenable because of the high reactivity of free carbon with the hot hydrogen propellant.  Solid solution, mixed carbides are most often brittle but otherwise perform well under the high temperature flowing hot hydrogen environment.  The life limiting phenomenon for their use in NTR applications is the loss of uranium due to vaporization from the fuel surface at temperatures in excess of 2800 K.  Though the proposed Cer-Cer fuel is relatively at lower level of technology maturity, its unique potential for elimination of uranium loss and retention of fission fragments at very high operational temperatures would amply justify the proposed research program.","The success of the proposed research program will bring about a nuclear fuel with optimum performance characteristics for use in NTP and Bimodal Propulsion systems. Results of more than 50 years of research including more than 20 years of research by the group headed by Professor Samim Anghaie at University of Florida have culminated to the development of the uranium-carbide Cer-Cer fuel concept that is described in this proposal. The main idea behind the development of the proposed uranium-carbide Cer-Cer design is to come up with an NTP fuel that features the highest performance potential in the areas including operational temperature margin, stability in hot hydrogen, retention of fission products, and mechanical properties. The proposed Cer-Cer fuel possess fundamental physical and chemical properties comfortably above the best carbon based fuels such as (U, Zr, Nb)C and (U ,Zr, Ta)C, and the best cermet fuels such as (U, Zr)CN or stabilized UO2 coated with tungsten in W/Re matrix/clad.  With the renewed interest in the development of the NTP and Bimodal propulsion systems, it is time to reevaluate the fundamental properties of materials with highest performance potential as we know them in 2005. Considering fundamental materials properties as we have known them, the proposed uranium-carbide Cer-Cer uniquely combines all the right properties to make the best and most robust fuel for the NTP and Bimodal Propulsion applications.","For terrestrial ultra-high temperature gas-cooled GEN IV and advanced light-water reactors, uranium-refractory carbide Cer-Cer fuels offer a revolutionary improvement in core safety performance, increased efficiency and reduced cost.  The proposed Cer-Cer fuels with high enrichments can be used in space based reactors and in terrestrial reactors permitted to burn stockpiled highly enriched uranium (HEU) from as a means of HEU disposal.Using uranium-refractory carbide Cer-Cer fuels in commercial nuclear power plant could potentially result in greater efficiency, reduced cost, and increased safety margin through: ? Higher burnup possible leading to fewer outages and associated costs for fuel replacement. ? Less thermal energy is stored in the core as a result of the higher fuel thermal conductivity. ? Reduced probability of fuel melt or fuel pellet and clad mechanical interaction in an accident scenario ? the higher thermal conductivity reduces the fuel centerline temperature and the higher fuel melting point both give an increased margin to fuel melting. Lower coefficient of thermal expansion reduces the probability of partial or full fuel pellet contact with clad. ? Eliminated or at least significantly reduced core melt probability that is identified as the potential maximum public health risk for light water reactors.","Nuclear (Adv Fission, Fusion, Anti-Matter, Exotic Nuclear)"

One design that is being examined uses a Brayton cycle to generate electricity.  The radiator could operate in the intermediate temperature range of 450 K to 750 K, where there are currently no commonly used working fluids for loop heat pipes and heat pipes.  The proposed program would develop fluid/wick/envelope systems for these temperatures, and validate them with long-term life tests.","Electronics cooling is a second application, for both NASA and commercial electronics, particularly for SiC devices.  The benefits of SiC over silicon include its wide bandgap energy, high breakdown electric field, and high thermal conductivity.  Some of these SiC devices operate in the range of 450 K to 750 K.

(ACT) has completed a radiator trade study that showed that radiators with titanium LHPs have the highest specific power in the temperature range from 300 to 550 K, increasing the specific power over heat pipe radiators by more than 1/3.  The Phase I program will develop titanium/water LHPs that can operate in the low to intermediate temperature range (300 to 500K), as well as the lower portion of the intermediate temperature range (450 to 550 K).  The Phase II program will develop alkali metal LHPs that can operate in the intermediate to high temperature ranges (700 to 1000 K and higher).","LHPs for space nuclear radiators are the immediate NASA application.  With Project Prometheus, NASA is examining space nuclear power systems for a number of missions.  Other potential applications include power systems on the Moon and Mars.  One possible design that is being examined in Project Prometheus uses a Brayton cycle to generate electricity.  The radiator could operate in the intermediate temperature range of 350 K to 550 K.  With water as the working fluid, titanium LHPs would reduce the radiator mass when compared with the alternate known compatible material, which is Monel.  Other proposed systems operate at higher temperatures, and required alkali metal LHPs.  An advantage of titanium is that its CTE is suitable for attachment to carbon-carbon or GFRC radiator fins.","Titanium is an ideal LHP material where low mass and high strength are important.  An additional benefit of titanium is that it is compatible with heat pipe and LHP working fluids over the broadest possible temperature range.   Titanium components have been used with working fluids that include sodium, potassium, cesium, water, ammonia and nitrogen.  ACT plans to use the technology developed in this program to provide commercial LHPs at higher and lower temperatures, when low mass and high strength are important.","Cooling; Nuclear (Adv Fission, Fusion, Anti-Matter, Exotic Nuclear); Nuclear Conversion"

The CEV application also needs it to withstand typical launch environments. None of the state-of-an-art material systems that are currently in use are designed for the needs of the space environment stable operation at elevated temperatures, and hence, can not meet the same. This proposal identifies the next generation solid state chemistries and processing requirements that can provide the multifunctional space stable performance at higher temperatures and also provide the required unique ESD performance when these very large thermal control areas get exposed to very low temperatures. The proposed efforts will synthesize the candidate new nano engineered passivated pigments and evaluate its space environment stability with use of recently developed next generation dielectrically engineered binders that can employ nano-cluster chemistry to cure into interconnecting percolation paths along with abilities to tailor CTE, thermal shock and thermal cycling performance. Based on results in the phase I study, the candidate solid-state chemistries based products and their processing will be scaled up in Phase II efforts to provide the next generation ""robust"" validated TCMS products. The primary aim of this SBIR will focus on evaluating the feasibility of new solid state chemistries that can deliver space environment stable (αs/εT) while being exposed to the elevated temperatures of the order of 600 C.","The suggested and developed new generic solid state chemistries for the TCMS through this SBIR can also benefit the current state-of-the-art TCMS to enhance their multifunctionality. The use of such in envisioned materials can uniquely and timely help CEV radiator which is also expected to operate at high temperatures. These efforts can also enhance NASA's ability to carry out earth science, and space science missions in all earth orbits and in the planetary orbits as well as in the several sun earth connection study orbits, where the exposure to high temperatures can be one of the main degrading species.  The motivation to use the new material technology will be high because of increased survivability in the space environments, along with the increased life due to the designed temperature insensitive degradation. This would translate in the increased durability for these missions.  Above all, we shall provide designers with new TCMS options as a tool to build more reliable and survivable hardware for NASA exploration missions. The technology of high temperature survivable TCMS materials is generic and will diffuse itself in many other NASA applications that thrive for the long life due to its increased durability.","Like NASA, the commercial industry has planned several satellites for the broad band communication activities.

The overall objective of the proposed study is to provide NASA with a simulation tool that can be used to improve the performance of current available refractory alloys and accelerate the development of new refractory alloys with desired properties for space nuclear applications.

The application of the software package developed in the project is not limited to refractory alloys. Instead it can be used to calculate phase equilibrium and microstructural evolution for other alloys if thermodynamic and mobility databases are available for the alloys. This provides NASA a facility to work on other alloy systems beyond RM-TM-IE refractory alloys.","The computational tool developed in this project has many potential non-NASA applications. It can be used by researchers at universities and research institutes who work on high temperature materials. Companies work on the development of structural materials for high temperature applications, such as engine materials will also find this tool useful. The software package with a user-friendly graphic interface is an easy-to-use tool. It will allow users to perform calculations with a few clicks of the mouse, without requiring extensive experience or knowledge of thermodynamics and kinetics. This will make thermodynamic calculations and kinetic simulations of refractory alloys available to a wide range of users.

Materials currently used are heavy, bulky, and ineffective in shielding humans against cosmic radiation, especially over long periods (months or years). One means of solving the problem of heavy radiation shields is to use lightweight polymeric shields that do not produce dangerous secondary radiation when irradiated, but these are typically not mechanically sound in structural applications. Ultramet has developed a versatile method for producing metal and ceramic foams that would function well as reinforcement phases in polymeric shields. This material is amenable to complexly shaped and large components and has been demonstrated under other programs to provide good particle trap capacity and exhibit no damage under extreme variations of temperature, high porosity, and low density. Ultramet proposes to fabricate high-efficiency polymer matrix composite radiation shields that will withstand repeated exposure to cosmic radiation. Initial shielding performance will be demonstrated through simulated cosmic radiation testing at Eril Research, and the program will benefit from collaboration with Northrop Grumman, a potential end user of the technology.","Radiation shielding for astronauts and the communications electronics, sensitive instruments, and life-support systems upon which they rely is the primary application.

Additionally, this concept ?shown in figure 1?is modular and multifunctional by design.  So, with minimal changes, we envision being able to use same device for the controlled release of other medicines and nutrients, in space as well as on Earth.  For space-travel, a variety of countermeasures must be developed to oppose the harmful effects of longterm flights and exposures to other gravitational fields.  Furthermore, each astronaut responds to a certain medicine or combination of medicines in a unique manner.  Circadian disruption, or acute (chronic) degradation of sleep quality or quantity, is a known risk during space-flight.  Techova will develop a unique device for the responsive delivery of melatonin, integrating (i) inherently conductive polymer-based valves, (ii) nano- and micro-structured sensors and (iii) non-invasive virtually pain-free micro-needle arrays.  Our team builds upon previous research critically needed to develop this novel transdermal release device.  The ability to monitor the progression of circadian (sleep) disruption and respond to the unique changes in the body chemistry of each individual (patient) offers an unprecedented opportunity to deliver specific, personalized medical care during space flight.","The chronic reduction of sleep duration in space result in fatigue and jeopardize astronaut performance.  American, Russian and European studies of sleep in space found that daily sleep is reduced to an average of 6 hours, or more during critical operations.  Astronaut sleep in space is also physiologically altered (Anon., 2004).   During Phase 1, we will establish the merit, feasibility and fabrication of a working prototype of a new transcutaneous device for controlled release of melatonin circadian (sleep) therapy.  During Phase 2? we will prepare an integrated  electrochemical sensor to monitor the level of melatonin in the interstitial fluid (ISF) and thus guide the individualized regimen in a closed loop control with personalized algorithm.  At same time, a NASA-associated collaborator will be recruited to test this responsive device on small animals.  A simple model, like glucose closed loop (responsive) control for diabetic rats, will be used both in Earth gravity and in simulated microgravity.   Professor Mark Prausnitz (Georgia Tech) and Professor Moshen Shahinpoor (University of New Mexico) will assist to ensure a smooth transition to Phase 2.","Back on Earth, a major technological limitation of all commercially available controlled release systems, including the transdermal wearable patches, is that they are not responsive to an individual's need for drug therapy.  Rather, these systems operate with a predetermined regimen, based on population averages.  However, every individual has unique needs for therapy and develops a unique reaction to a particular regimen.  Thus, drug administration based on averages often results in over- or under-dosing, outside of the optimal therapeutic window.  An additional challenge for current drug delivery systems is that of compliance.  Over 2/3 of patients are ""non-compliant"" ? they do not take medication on time and in the correct dose.  This lack of compliance leads to an estimated 125,000 deaths annually, in the U.S. alone.  It is expected that the responsive therapeutic systems developed with our technology will overcome these issues with its capability to provide reliable, accurate, smart dosing.   Integrated Sensing Systems Inc. and Environmetal Robots, Inc. have shown an interest in our technology and are ready to partner with us to refine, optimize and commercialize the prototype.

Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (RMD) proposes an instrument to monitor astronauts' physiological responses to stress, microgravity, radiation, infection, and pharmaceutical agents through detection of multiple biological markers.  This will be accomplished under conditions of microgravity, within the weight, size and power requirements of space missions, and with minimal human intervention.  One representative biomarker of interest is 8-oxo-dG that serves as an indicator of oxidative DNA damage from radiation, chemicals, inflammation, and by-products of metabolism.  Upon repair of the damaged DNA, 8-oxo-dG is excreted into the urine where it may be conveniently monitored.  However, serious obstacles to detection and quantification arise due to the low amounts present and the complex chemical composition of urine.  Current techniques suffer from at least one of the following shortcomings: they are slow and labor-intensive, require complex instrumentation and a highly-trained operator, cannot be easily multiplexed to monitor many analytes, consume large amounts of reagents, and are not compatible for use under microgravity.  We will overcome these limitations by incorporating all analytical steps into a single microfluidic chip. Our system will utilize affinity purification and electrochemical detection.","This proposal focuses on biological markers of oxidative stress such as are formed upon exposure to radiation.  Our goal is to produce an instrument that can monitor the daily biological effects of radiation on astronauts as a function of changes in exposure due to solar flares or extravehicular activity, for example.  In addition, the amount of protection afforded by antioxidants present in the diet or given as nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals can be monitored.  The operating principles of our instrument are general and will be applicable to a wide variety of biological markers and pharmaceutical agents of interest to NASA","Measurement of  biological markers of oxidation is important because they have been linked to many degenerative conditions such as smoking, aging, cancer, atherosclerosis, and other diseases.  The use of antioxidants to counter these conditions has been widely proposed but clinical data demonstrating their effectiveness is limited and often contradictory.  Our instrument would be useful for these studies because it could provide sufficient throughput for the large number of subjects necessary at reasonable cost, superior accuracy compared to the standard ELISA assay, and convenient analysis of multiple biomarkers and antioxidants.",Biochemical; Biomedical and Life Support; Biomolecular Sensors

The blood analyzer will utilize innovative optical and fluidic designs on a modular platform that enable compactness, high sensitivity and cell discrimination, combined with robust service.  No operator intervention is required.  Modules that require direct contact with blood will be economical and disposable.  These fluidic designs will be fabricated by microstereolithography and initially tested as two separate components.  A first component will constitute a hydrodynamic focusing injector and cell impedance meter.  A second component will monitor forward and side scattered light from hydrodynamically focused cells using novel signal collection designs and micrometer scale, Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes.  New, custom formulated photopolymers will be evaluated for microstereolithography use and electroless deposition of metals will form the basis for fabricating microelectrodes.  During Phase II, the cell impedance transducer and microoptic modules will be integrated into one credit card size package that plugs into a handheld microelectronics board containing detectors, pump, microprocessors, and an automated cell lysing stage.","The ability to monitor physiological changes of astronauts during space flight requires portable, low power and light-weight instrumentation.  Inexpensive, point of treatment instruments are needed to monitor astronauts health and to gauge the effectiveness of countermeasures to oppose deleterious physiological responses due to microgravity, exposure to ionizing radiation, and a reduced exercise regimen.  A critical and time sensitive measurement for the assessment of hemostasis is the complete blood count (CBC).  The MEMS-based blood analyzer will provide the same information as a CBC.","A MEMS-based CBC analyzer will find many point-of-care applications where economy, speed, and minimal user intervention are required.  Such uses include: blood hemoglobin and reticulocyte analysis for directing transfusion therapy in patients suffering major blood loss, monitoring anemia in surgical patients; screening platelets in patients with clotting disease; monitoring WBC in outpatients undergoing blood replacement therapy.

Identifying and monitoring the microbial population in the spacecraft environment has therefore been identified as a key maintaining crew health on extended missions.  While molecular methods are rapidly supplanting phenotypic identification of micro-organisms, the most successful rapid approaches have employed organism-specific nucleic acid ""probes"" or primers for PCR amplification.  Identification by nucleic acid hybridization therefore implies a priori knowledge (or at least suspicion) of a putative organism.  Such assays (including DNA microarrays) are therefore limited in generality by the number of probes or primers on hand.  Sequencing of DNA is more general but time consuming and problematic in microgravity.  This project describes an ""open"" or exploratory system with no such limitation which is also superior in speed to DNA sequencing.  By leveraging the wealth of publicly available ribosomal RNA sequences for thousands of bacterial strains, and rapid mass spectrometry of novel, mass-modified RNA fragments, the system can identify bacterial species in complex organism mixtures and report their relative abundances.  The technology is amenable to high-throughput automated analysis of over 200 samples in less than 2 hours and is compatible with any sample type from which total DNA can be isolated.","Development of the technology will allow NASA to achieve its goals of successful human space exploration and characterize the microbial population in spacecraft as it changes over time.  The technology can be readily expanded to identification of viruses and eukaryotes as increasing sequence information on these organisms becomes available.   In addition to maintaining crew health, development of the technology will also further NASA's exobiology goals.  Because the technology is ""exploratory"", the genetic affinity of organisms never encountered before can be rapidly determined.  In Phase II, collaboration with developers of miniaturized biological mass spectrometers and a novel, convection-based PCR device will allow development of a prototype system of reasonable size for spaceflight.","In addition to NASA's unique goals, the development of new microbial diagnostics has broad overlap and technology transfer implications for other applications.  The method will find application in a variety of markets including clinical diagnostics, biodefense and monitoring of large populated facilities such as airports and government buildings, municipal water supplies, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.  Nucleic acid diagnostics sales are currently estimated at over $2 billion annually and projected to increase 10-fold in the next 5 to 10 years.

Conventional method to produce medical grade water is either energy inefficient or too complex, requiring high pressure and using considerable consumables. We propose a novel foul-resistant nano-pervaporation (NVP) membrane with minimized mass, volume, consumables, and power consumption for producing medical grade water in both micro-g and sub-g environments. Our proposed concept is based on a near-room-temperature pervaporation process. The nano-pore selectively adsorbs liquid water and excludes other undesirable constituents in the portable water, such as particles, microbes, virus, and volatile organic compounds. The permeated water vapor is subsequently condensed allowing the heat of evaporation to be recovered. This smart system uses space vacuum to obtain low vapor pressure, together with a build-in heat recovery, aims at minimizing the required power. This membrane is foul-resistant.  It only requires a low pressure gradient to achieve high water flow rate, minimizing the driving force for fouling. Also, without any moving part, the system enjoys low maintenance. The NPV process shows potentially the lowest amount of power consumption, mass/volume, and consumables among possible technologies for producing medical grade water.","Potential NASA applications for the proposed nano-pervaporation (NPV) membrane and process include medical water generation and water recovery applications.  This proposed NPV membrane could be an enabling technology for NASA manned space program, allowing potential extended mission duration with less consumables compared to the base-line technologies, such as distillation and reverse osmosis.","Potential non-NASA applications for the proposed nano-pervaporation membrane and process include dehydration of esterification reaction (e.g. biodiesel production), dehydration of azeotropic mixtures (e.g. ethanol/water), and dehydration of heat sensitive compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals).",Biomedical and Life Support; Sterilization/Pathogen and Microbial Control; Waste Processing and Reclamation

Thus data communications are increasingly using wireless optical systems at higher speeds. These systems are being used as an alternative to cabled media, mainly due to their simpler deployment and reconfiguration. The high data rate and large information throughput available with laser communication are many times greater than in RF systems, furthermore WDM technology can also be used in free space laser communication system. To provide optical wireless communication between crew and the base of NASA advanced extravehicular activity (EVA) systems, Boston Applied Technologies Incorporated (BATI) proposes an innovative laser communication system based on our recent breakthrough of high performance light intensity and polarization management devices. The laser communication devices developed at BATI have the advantage of significantly reduced size and complexity, small power consumption, high extinction ratio, and solid-state ruggedness. Rather than using two laser transmitters, the proposed laser communication system can establish a two-way optical link using a single conventional laser transmitter.","The goal of this program is to develop an advanced laser communication system using electro-optic light modulation for optical wireless communication between crew and the base with the capability to integrate audio, video, and data on the same data stream. This system has many critical advantages in term of weight, power, platform stability and the number of laser source. This proposed system can also provide a communication link between an earth observing balloon or airplane and the ground.","A similar system can provide a communication link between a satellite and the ground. The success of this program will have great impacts in military, space, industrial, and consumer sectors.

Next generation spacesuit concepts, such as the Chameleon Suit , offer the ability to dramatically extend extravehicular activity (EVA) mission time and space beyond anything currently available today. Revolutionary advances in technologies, including energy generation and storage as well as climate controls, are required to eliminate the reliance on expendables that currently limit missions with today's EVA.","The MFF technologies are well suited for next generation EMU concepts, such as the Chameleon Suit. The integration of advanced technology components has the ability to drastically increase mission time and space by enabling the space suit to become an active part of a system that interacts with the local environment rather than acting as a passive barrier. This transition, however, requires the complete removal of reliance on expendable technologies for power, thermal control, life support systems, etc.   ITN's MFF are an ideal solution to many of these challenges. The integration of these functions directly into the suit enables greater responsiveness in the suit. For instance, current suits only allow the body to interact with the environment aver about 1/2 to 1/3 of the roughly 2 square meters of available surface area. MFF offer greater potential to increase suit capability with minimal impact on the mass and volume, flexibility, and other desirable functions.","The desire to create clothing that increases the user's ability to interact with the environment without sacrificing comfort, style, or functionality also has many applications in commercial markets. The growth of wearable electronics for health monitoring, communications, or entertainment functions also require power and comfort control that could benefit from the proposed technologies.

Current inertial navigation systems are too bulky, fragile, and expensive for this purpose and therefore cannot meet NASA requirements.  To address these requirements, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a novel Time and Relative Distance Inertial Navigation System (TARDIS), a compact, cost-effective solution providing EVA crewmembers and monitoring personnel with location and orientation to home base. With this information, TARDIS will generate a 3D navigation track of the astronaut's movement, which the astronaut can compare to a preplanned path, as well as key reference points, such as the base camp, rover, and destination.  TARDIS builds on POC's smart inertial sensor cluster technology, integrating compact dedicated microprocessors with inertial microelectromechanical systems in a purely digital six-degree-of-freedom inertial navigation system in an extremely small volume.  This is coupled with a Kalman filter for optimal position estimation.  Spatial operator analysis (SOA) derives the relative orientation of an EVA crewmember's arms and legs to specify current activity (bending, walking, sitting, climbing). In Phase I POC will prove the concept by demonstrating a scaled-down working model with a limited number of sensors.  In Phase II POC will demonstrate a complete working prototype.","Not only is TARDIS ideal for monitoring the overall position and orientation of EVA crewmembers during Moon and Mars exploration, it could also be adapted for use within low Earth orbit to provide specific real-time kinematic information to ground controllers over the existing RTDS.  This would greatly enhance the efficiency and after-action review data of EVA repair and deployment missions and be a major advancement in EVA safety technology.  Furthermore, since TARDIS would be integrated into the existing spacesuit, it could also be used during water tank training missions to provide optimal ergonomic data.","The small size and low cost of the TARDIS system make it an ideal navigation module for the automotive and general aviation markets.  The self-contained inertial system will provide location data without GPS coverage, which is essential when cars travel outside of GPS coverage zones such as in mountainous areas, forests, and tunnels.  The small size and low cost of TARDIS mean that it could also be integrated into firefighter or search-and-rescue uniforms to provide precise overall location and arm and leg kinematic models under hazardous conditions, which could then be transmitted to monitoring personnel outside the hazard zone.",Suits

The transition away from halon-based systems has presented an opportunity for efficient and cost-effective alternative approaches. ADA Technologies proposes to develop a fine-water-mist fire suppression system suitable for use in microgravity. The ADA design features a single pressure tank with a patented effervescent-gas spray nozzle to generate droplets of a size that is optimum for fire suppression. The proposed work will modify ADA's current fine-water-mist device to allow for operation in reduced and micro-gravity environments. Design modifications will focus on providing a uniform mixture of water and atomization gas to the effervescent nozzle. The resulting extinguisher will be compact, simple, and rugged, with pound-per-pound better suppression capability than carbon dioxide fire extinguishers. ADA is teaming with the Colorado School of Mines to employ their expertise in micro-gravity combustion and related fire suppression test facilities. In Phase II, the designs will be refined and upgraded to improve their manufacturability, reduce weight and volume, and lower unit costs. The project team is collaborating with an aviation safety hardware supplier to market the systems to the commercial aircraft industry and is exploring industrial applications.","This novel fire suppression technology has applications to manned spacecraft as well as commercial aircraft, both areas of NASA responsibility. Since the ADA fine-water-mist system is modular, it can be installed in a wide range of aircraft types and sizes, and should be useful in private aircraft as well. Fine-water-mist fire suppression technology has been shown to be effective against a wide range of fire classifications, so that continued development will also offer cost and performance benefits to NASA ground facilities and test operations across the US. In earlier projects at ADA, this technology has proven effective in specialized applications, including extinguishing oxidizer fires and suppression of hydrogen deflagrations, both of which are of interest to NASA.","The loss of halon as a major resource in fire suppression has lead to the development of a number of alternative technologies. Fine-water-mist has been applied to flammable liquid storage, shipboard magazines, and combustion turbine installations in recent years. A modular system such as the ADA design has the potential to fill many niches in fire suppression with an alternative that is cost-effective, efficient, and rugged. Testing at ADA has shown that fine water mist has unique properties that make it ideal for many fire threat scenarios. Under a STTR project, ADA is partnering with the Colorado School of Mines and a supplier of aircraft fire suppression systems to provide protection to the US Air Force for a specialized aircraft.

This novel GLS consists of an ordered array of variable sized water repellant granular particles that result in a spatial surface energy density gradient within the GLS.  The resultant capillary pressure causes gas and water to flow toward different outlet GLS positions.  The device contains no moving parts and is compatible with deployment in a variety of NASA ALS and ECLSS applications.  Preliminary experiments, conducted in a vertically oriented quasi two-dimensional system, separated an air-water mixture using the proposed technology.  The capillary pressure gradient within the GLS caused a flowing gas-water mixture to separate into a gas-enriched stream and a water stream.  The gas-enriched stream exited at the bottom of the GLS, counter to the buoyancy force, and the water stream exited at the top of the GLS.  This flow response clearly demonstrates microgravity compatibility. The Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of this innovative GLS technology. The Phase II program will deliver to NASA a full-scale GLS with test documentation that will allow evaluation of the technology for specific ALS or ECLSS applications.  This technology demonstrator will also form the basis for multiple commercial applications.","The NASA application is as Flight Hardware for an ISS retrofit or future long duration missions.  The GLS technology has potential applications wherever two-phase gas-liquid flows occur, such as in physico-chemical or biological water treatment systems; water production via the Sabatier, Bosch, or Reverse Water Gas Shift reactors; oxygen generation assemblies; condensing heat exchangers; input streams to chemical sensors; and internal and external thermal control coolant loops.  In addition to these ECLSS and ALS applications, the technology may also be employed to perform gas-liquid separations for In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems where water is produced from Martian atmospheric CO2.","Gas-Liquid Separation systems for use with microfluidic devices may be incorporated into a variety of Microelectromechanical (MEMS) and Microelectrochemical (MECS) systems. In microscale systems, capillary forces predominate, and buoyancy, which can be used for gas-liquid separations in larger scale systems, is often not effective.  Potential MEMS and MECS devices incorporating the novel GLS technology include fuel cells, microreactors, and microscale sensors. Macro-scale applications include GLS systems for the removal of extremely small bubbles from turbulent two-phase flow regimes, and for phase separation in textile and chemical production industries where foaming is often a serious problem.",Biomedical and Life Support; Waste Processing and Reclamation

Evaluation of water contaminated with bacteria and plasma-treated indicates that, prior to any optimization of the DMP reactor, contamination levels can be reduced by up to 99.9%. Organic contaminant concentrations (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene) can be reduced below the detectable range. The DMP reactor is more energy efficient than other Advanced Oxidation Techniques and does not contain expendable materials or produce toxic side products. The atmospheric-pressure plasma is initiated and sustained through a large number of micro-discharges between a rotating pin-array electrode and a stationary electrode. The plasma breaks down organic compounds via the generation of OH? and H? free radicals through interaction at the gas-liquid boundary. The DMP reactor uses non-equilibrium, low temperature, atmospheric-pressure plasmas for the volume-plasma-processing of liquid-phase compounds (water-based solutions). This Partial Discharge (PD) plasma is considered a highly localized electrical discharge produced across an insulating medium, typically between two electrodes. Characteristics of a PD are highly dependent upon electrode geometry and operational parameters and, therefore, require significant research for optimization into a NASA ALS setting.","The DMP WaPR has direct applicability to NASA ALS needs including substitution for the current Catalytic Reactor. This substitution would eliminate the need for high pressure and temperature controls within the Water Processor Assembly (WPA) and, therefore, should decrease system mass, volume and power, and increase system reliability. Such a technology and capability substitution would be applicable to the crew exploration vehicle (CEV) and other early exploration developments. Additionally, the DMP WaPR is a highly efficient and scaleable technology for scale-up to Lunar and Mars long duration missions with no expendable materials. Its scalability also makes it an excellent candidate for a wide range of life support applications from temporary habitats and small payloads to large-scale habitats.","The scalability of the DMP WaPR allows for easy use for household, office, industrial, laboratory or hospital, and food processing industries' Point-Of-Entry (POE) or Point-Of-Use (POU) water purification at relatively low energy expenditure with high purification results. Additionally, this technology could be used for medium and large scale applications such as municipal water treatment systems and portable to semi-portable water purification systems for the military (e.g., field use by the Army, Navy and Marines for hospitals), Homeland Security, and disaster relief, and submarine, ship, and aircraft potable supplies.",Sterilization/Pathogen and Microbial Control; Waste Processing and Reclamation

Many materials fail space qualification due to the catalytic nature of their rigidization method.  However, by layering thin low-density polyethylene with virtually any composite weave, a pliable composite is created.  When inflation pressure and heat are applied, the low density polyethylene melts into the composite weave and causes the entire matrix to harden.  The proposed composite would consist of Vectran with a low-density polyethylene laminate.  Because our composite is stable at nearly cryogenic temperatures through around 100 C, it outperforms most other rigidizing materials currently being studied.

All these hollow components are vulnerable in space because of the debris and meteorites that can strike them.  They will lose their functions if hit and damaged by foreign objects. These structures typically rely upon electro-mechanical mechanisms and devices for deployment and maintaining them in space for operation, which occupy over 90% of the total mass budget in many cases.

Such a structural module can be compacted into a very small volume to facilitate launching.   The deployment energy is the heat from the sun.  This concept greatly simplifies the entire operation, reduction in weight and cost, and improves reliability.  They also feature great impact resistant.  Foams processed by the conventional chemical-blowing agent have toxicity problems. Our microcellular SMP foamed sandwich structures do not involve any toxicity and will have higher mechanical properties than those processed by the conventional techniques.

Working in collaboration with a leading developer of Li-ion batteries in Phase I, our low temperature electrolyte formulations will be evaluated in Li test cells containing anodes and cathodes used in commercial scale battery manufacture. In Phase II, electrolyte composition  will be further optimized and prototype batteries will be fabricated and tested for performance.","Robotic landers, rovers and penetrators play an important role in modern planetary explorations enabling mission of enormous scientific value without risking the lives of astronauts.   Rechargeable Li-ion batteries in these spacecrafts are required to perform efficiently over a broad temperature range extending close to ?60oC. The electrolytes being developed will find exclusive use in these batteries.  They will also be useful for batteries employed in cold-climate terrestrial applications, high altitude balloons, and applications where non flammability of electrolytes is essential for safety of Li-ion rechargeable batteries.","We anticipate that flame retardant character of the proposed electrolytes will improve the safety of all Li-ion cells by reducing the reactivity between electrolyte and the electrode materials in the ""charged"" state. This may allow relaxation of stringent and costly safety related controls without increasing risk and, greatly reduce damage from cell venting by preventing flames, which could lead to injuries or collateral damage. Particularly sensitive applications include portable telephones, laptop computers, video cameras, and heads up displays, night vision equipment and batteries used in enclosed spaces e.g. underwater vehicles or underground bunkers.",Energy Storage

Due to inherent fundamental performance, safety and reliability, NASA is interested in replacing the present alkaline fuel cell system with PEM systems. However, the conventional use by PEM systems of O2 reactant gas recirculation to remove product water, enhance cell uniformity, and control humidity could pose a serious safety concern.  A fundamentally new PEM fuel cell design concept is proposed that removes liquid product water by controlled convection and wicking through layered porous structures that are integrated into each cell separator plate. This unique integrated flow field (IFF) concept also automatically and passively clears channels blocked by droplets.  Furthermore, the same design includes transport of product water back to the entire flow field for humidification and greater cell performance. The IFF design enables high pressure and high voltage operation resulting in higher efficiency.  For removal of product water vapor from the cell, the design concept includes ejectors to passively generate a modest gas circulation.In conclusion, this design innovation will significantly simplify the PEM operating system while generating higher performance and foster greater long-term safety in zero-g as well as ordinary gravity applications.","Applications range from EVA (extravehicular activity) life support systems, to regenerative fuel cells for surface electrical energy storage, to on-board power for reusable launch vehicles such as the current and future versions of the Space Shuttle.  The technology will be readily scalable across a range of power capacities and fuel cell system sizes.  Applications will also include high altitude flight systems that are based on regenerative operation and need high efficiency.  Our innovative PEM fuel cell concept promises to support the performance, reliability, and safety requirements of these applications.","Commercial applications include both primary and regenerative (RFC) fuel cell power systems. Specifically, the RFC systems would be used for backup power, remote power, and residential off-grid electrical power.  In addition to many of the above, primary PEM fuel cell applications include aircraft power. Specific market groups would be the telecommunications industry, electric power industry, business computer networks, airplane manufacturers, and homeowners.  This same approach could be applied in all PEM fuel cell designs.  This would a) simplify flowfield design, b) reduce blower pressure requirements, c) reduce system operation complexity, and d) provide a fail-safe means to prevent gas-channel blockage.",Energy Storage; Renewable Energy; Wireless Distribution

At temperatures as low as -100oC, our new electrolyte demonstrates superior transport properties due to minimal triple ion formation.  Accelerated storage tests revealed no voltage delay indicative of a stable passive film formed on the lithium anode. When coupled with a high energy density cathode material such as carbon monofluoride (CFx), our new electrolyte formulations will enable primary lithium primary performance over a broad spectrum of ultra low temperature applications.

The MLS can also indicate the presence of contaminants such as nitrogen used to purge the system. The current methods use either wire resistance measurements, capacitance or point sensors, combined with pressure and temperature measurements.  The MLS will be lighter, require less energy to operate, and provide less heat leak than existing technologies.

Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) is a passive two-phase heat transport device that utilizes solely capillary action to circulate the working fluid in a closed loop to transfer heat from one location to another.  LHPs do not contain mechanical moving parts and therefore are highly reliable and durable for space applications.  A novel cryogenic LHP system is proposed for the ZBO cryocooling.  It is capable of acquiring heat from a large area of the cryo-tank wall, transporting it to a cryocooler for heat rejection, and meeting other design requirements of cryogen storage systems for space missions.","Cryogenic cooling has become increasingly important not only for the cryogen storage technology but the thermal management of IR sensors/detectors and high temperature superconductors.  Spaceport operations, both on Earth as well as extraterrestrial, are heavily dependent upon a wide range of cryogenic storage systems such as liquid Oxygen and liquid Nitrogen.

Mainstream has experimentally demonstrated a new wick configuration that has been shown to more than  triple the heat transport capacity of  an otherwise identical copper water heat pipe(this proposal contains the experimental data).  This Phase I will seek to extend these heat pipe experiments.  Improved heat pipe technology is relevant and important to meeting thermal technology needs; it is well known that any means to improve heat pipe capacity widens the potential applications for their use. Extending the capability of a simple, highly reliable passive system means more applications where this passive heat pipe approach can be used instead of the more complex, and potentially less-reliable, active systems.This Phase I includes heat pipe experiments and limited performance optimization.  Mainstream has already performed the marketing and commercialization studies, and we have secured a commercial aerospace partner (with funding) for a follow-on commercialization effort.  Phase III commercialization would parallel our other SBIR commercialization efforts. Mainstream's prior record of accomplishment has demonstrated that we are very serious about commercialization and our DoD commercialization index is 90%.","The proposed improvement to conventional heat pipe wick structures would be useful wherever heat pipes are currently used and increased heat flux capability would be desirable; i.e., thermal control systems of small satellites with variable duty cycles, spacecraft radiators, high-power electronic cooling, and avionics cooling.  Also, when thermal control systems are needed at temperatures above the optimum for an Ammonia Heat Pipe (above about 30?C) and below the optimum for a Water Heat Pipe (about  150?C),  the current heat pipe working fluids that can be used have very low liquid transport factors. Methanol--about the best working fluid in this range--has a heat transport factor that is at least half that of ammonia, and even less when compared to water.  Since this is an area where considerable electronics cooling could be operating, the use of a higher heat transport configuration could improve the performance of these alternative working fluids as well as extending the operating range of water and ammonia working fluids; this would have a tremendous effect on future cooling system designs.  Improved heat pipe wick technology represents a major advancement in the technology and would have far-reaching applications in both manned and unmanned NASA applications.","Heat pipes are not in general a low cost solution to the cooling problem, but they are very reliable and effective and they have tremendous potential as power levels and volume requirements of commercial electronics increase. Until recently, heat pipes have been used mainly in difficult thermal control applications, such as: aircraft electronics, traction drives, portable computers, audio amplifiers and cooling of closed cabinets operating in harsh environments. The most versatile feature of using heat pipes is the wide variety of geometries that can be constructed to take advantage of the available space around the electronics to be cooled. In many applications, the available heat sink volume above the electronics is limited by the board-to-board spacing. In these situations, heat pipes are used in a low profile design that transports the heat to a large fin stack.

The most important contribution is an improved communication of the concept of operation between prospective customers and system developers.  It addresses the difficulty of communicating highly technical information among specialized engineering groups so that the concept of operations illustrated by the storyboard accommodates the consideration of context of use, user task performance, effective application of new technologies, safety, and reliability.  This difficulty is especially pronounced when the user's tasks are unusual (space operations) and the technology to support the task is novel (autonomous software with which humans interact and monitor).  Communication is enhanced by focusing on the common language of storyboard information.  The storyboard tool will help authors manage versions of storyboards to track alternate approaches for human task support and to maintain libraries of storyboards from previous systems.  After assisting with the creation of storyboards and refining them in concurrent engineering sessions, the tool will assist in translating the storyboard information into data forms importable by analysis tools used by NASA systems engineers.","Since most new NASA systems can benefit from storyboards and prototypes, the storyboard tool can provide valuable assistance to a large number of NASA system acquisition projects.  Particular attention will be paid to Exploration Systems projects because of the principal investigator's association with an ongoing NASA study of tools to support human factors engineering participation in the early systems analysis for Exploration Systems. Consequently, the storyboarding tool should be particularly applicable to Exploration Systems early analysis activities. However, it is also expected to generalize quite well to a wide span of NASA analyses to support system acquisition.","Non-NASA applications that could benefit from using the storyboard tool include military system acquisitions and early systems analysis for commercial applications.  S&K Technologies has number of projects associated with military system acquisition, and the principal investigator has a background involving system acquisition for the Army, including some MANPRINT and human factors engineering experience.  Consequently, S&K Technologies has experience marketing software and analysis services to military customers.  For commercial customers, our marketing strategy includes: ?

Spacecraft surface attachments, such as handholds, foot-restraints or tether points are often installed prior to flight, to aid planned EVA (Extravehicular Activity) operations. However, such aids are precluded where their pre-installation could compromise aerodynamic, or other important functions, of certain surfaces. Furthermore, unplanned EVA tasks are, at times, required to address in-flight emergencies or other unanticipated circumstances. For these situations, a versatile means of securing essential EVA assist attachments is needed. This study proposes to research and develop an electrostatic attachment system for rapid surface attachment of portable EVA assist devices, almost anywhere on the exterior (or interior) of a space-borne platform. The system will enhance the addressable scope and efficiency of EVA task performance and aid in astronaut (or material) maneuvering and transit, worksite restraint, and tool or equipment tie-down.  The attachment system will incorporate a self-contained power source, capable of operating in a vacuum environment, to produce and maintain a surface conforming electrostatic charge of sufficient magnitude to induce a useful attractive Coulomb holding force between the device and the surface to which it is contacted, without damage or permanent alteration to the surface.","The electrostatic attachment system envisioned by this proposal is applicable to a wide range of EVA and IVA tasks. The versatility and adaptability afforded by an electrostatic attachment system, as proposed herein, to rapidly and strategically position assistive surface attachments, and reposition them as needed, to best suit the specific and evolving maneuvering, transit, positioning and mechanical leverage requirements of each EVA/IVA task, without damage or permanent alteration of the surface, will both improve the efficiency with which such work tasks can be performed and expand the range of tasks that can be effectively addressed.

These include robotics and automated parts and material handling applications. It offers potential advantages of size, cost and reliability over current equipment as well as advantages in the handling of small, fragile or highly flexible materials.

In the N2OP engine, the combination of liquid nitrous oxide on solid paraffin as a rocket propellant allows for the development of compact lightweight high performance stages using densely packed propellant tankage. This is because N2O/paraffin hybrids have a very high oxidizer/fuel mixture ratio and because paraffin has a much higher regression rate than typical hybrid hydrocarbon fuels. Propellant slumping can be prevented by molding the paraffin into a 3% by volume graphite sponge matrix. Currently, space launch missions require cryogenic or extremely toxic propellants which are limited in their storage times, reducing their capability for rapid response launch. The much more storable solid propellants have higher cost, and lower performance while still being a large explosive hazard. The N2OP propulsion system also is compatible with ocean temperatures, allowing launch by floating in water. The achievable Isp for this propellant combination using autogenous pressurization is about 235 seconds at sea level and over 310 s in vacuum, making its performance fully adequate to support operation of a safe, fully storable, highly-responsive multi-stage launch vehicle.","The N2OP is an extremely attractive technology for enabling fast response space launch missions, it would have many other applications as well. Commercial applications would include the delivery of small geostationary, medium, and low altitude satellites into orbit, apogee kick, and also for high efficiency re-assignment maneuvers and end of life superboosting for geostationary satellites. The N2OP engine could be used for onboard spacecraft propulsion or for dedicated upper and transfer stages. As an additional advantage, the same N2O that powers the N2OP can be used in N2O monopropellant thrusters for spacecraft RCS, thereby eliminating hydrazine and reducing costs.","A high specific impulse safe, nontoxic long term storable stage would find many customers among commercial, military, and scientific satellites, launch vehicles, or sounding rockets who would value it as a very cost-effective alternative to the current choices of low performance toxic hypergols, cryogenic LOX, or solid propulsion. Smaller N2OP propulsion systems could meet the needs of the amateur experimental rocketry market.

Decomposing N2O can be used as either a high Isp, hot-gas monopropellant or as a low Isp, cold gas for ACS thrusters.  AeroAstro further proposes to use an innovative technique to achieve N2O decomposition: gasdynamic resonance.  Gasdynamic resonance will elevate the N2O to the activation temperatures required for exothermic decomposition, allowing monopropellant operation without the difficulties of a catalyst.  One of the challenges of long-duration space exploration systems is finding a propellant for microspacecraft that is safe, reliable, robust, and performs better than current propulsion systems.  N2O can replace both hot-gas propellants such as hydrazine and cold-gas ACS systems such as nitrogen or isobutane.  N2O is non-toxic, has a low freezing point (-91oC), and stores as a liquid.  N2O is also a byproduct of the catalysis of ammonia, a main effluent of waste-water recycling systems for long-duration manned space missions.  The anticipated results of this effort are data demonstrating the operating parameters of resonating N2O, and a dual-mode thruster design capable of both hot-gas and cold-gas operation.  Phase II activity will evolve the design of the dual-mode thruster and demonstrate operation over a range of conditions.","A microspacecraft propulsion system based on decomposing nitrous oxide (N2O) could support long-duration, manned space exploration by providing inspection and diagnostic services to the space station, crew exploration vehicle and other long-duration space transportation systems.  The storable, non-toxic, stable nature of the propellant and its exhaust products reduce risk to crew and hardware and allow for easy handling and transfer.  N2O has potential as a pseudo-ISRU propellant because it is the byproduct of the catalysis of ammonia, which is isolated during wastewater recycling.  N2O can operate as either a hot-gas or cold-gas propellant, expanding system capability while reducing mass.","AeroAstro expects that decomposing nitrous oxide (N2O) thrusters can replace hydrazine monopropellant thrusters and several types of traditional cold gas thrusters.  Such N2O systems would drive down propulsion system costs and reduce overall system mass by removing the need for tank/line heaters and separate systems for cold and hot propellants.  This could enable a new class of microspacecraft that can afford the propellant to perform a variety of missions, such as monitoring high-value geosynchronous communications satellites for anomalies, assist in on-orbit testing of communications payloads, imagery for marketing purposes, docking and refueling, responsive rendezvous, etc.",Chemical; Micro Thrusters; Mobility; Monopropellants

Current Mars in-situ propellant production (ISPP) technologies produce methane and carbon monoxide in various combinations, but with neither generally produced in pure form. While separation and purification of methane fuel is possible, it adds complexity to the propellant production process and discards an otherwise useful fuel product. The MCLOX makes such complex and wasteful processes unnecessary by burning the methane/CO mixtures produced by Mars ISPP systems without further refinement. Despite the decrease in rocket specific impulse caused by CO admixture, the improvement offered by concomitant increased propellant density provides a net improvement in stage performance, and this mission advantage is amplified further by the increase of the total amount of propellant produced and the decrease in mass and complexity of the required ISPP plant. For these reasons the development of the MCLOX rocket is important to achieve maximum benefit from Mars ISPP systems.","MCLOX propulsion would be uniquely suitable for a Mars sample return or a manned Mars mission using indigenous propellant. Because it can use the mixtures of methane and CO that are produced by the most readily available ISPP systems without further distillation, it minimizes the mass and complexity of such systems and maximizes their useful propellant leverage. MCLOX engines could also be used to take off from the Moon or asteroids, and can be used to fulfill any function required for high-energy space storable propulsion.","The MCLOX has many commercial applications, since it can also work with pure methane fuel. An upper stage driven by such LOX/methane propulsion would be non-toxic, space storable, and offer the highest specific impulse of any chemical stage other than the much more expensive and bulkier LOX/H2 systems. As such, the MCLOX upper stage would find many customers among commercial, military, and scientific satellites, upper stages, and launch vehicles who would value it as a cost-effective alternative to the current choice of toxic hypergol, lower performing LOX/RP, or cryogenic LOX/H2 propulsion.",Chemical; Fluid Storage and Handling; In-situ Resource Utilization

Whereas it is almost impossible to correctly set up boundary condition for the Burnett equations, this can be easily done in the proposed BGK-Burnett solver with the Maxwell boundary condition, re-emitting the particles from the boundary according to the accommodation coefficient. More importantly, this BGK-Burnett solver not only allows a single algorithm for both continuum and transitional flow regimes but also is more suitable for integration with either DSMC or direct Boltzmann solver in the rarefied flow regime.

Phase I will build an architecture that best leverages a distributed network of Pucks, such as a solution of computationally-intensive kinematics equations (e.g. Jacobian matrix), and local tasks, such as estimating precise realtime velocities and supporting series-elastic-actuator (SEA) strain-gages.","The proposed architecture for modular, scalable, distributed servomotor electronics designed for use in multi-axis and wheeled robots presents a significant opportunity to address important orbital, interplanetary, and moon/Mars robotics applications involving integrated systems for mobility and manual dexterity.  The construction of mining facilities and habitat on the moon and Mars and the servicing of orbiting spacecraft without excessive exposure to human astronauts are two immediate areas that are directly impacted by this proposed research and development.  The SBIR supports the increasing importance of complex machines requiring articulated servo-driven machines for all aspects of NASA exploration.","As the military and commercial sectors continue to ramp up the use of robotics, especially lightweight mobile platforms, the proposed distributed network of motor-controller modules would reduce system weight and control complexity of robotic systems including search & rescue robots, scout robots, advanced wheelchairs, and in-house robotic assistants. Furthermore, brushless DC servomotors are rapidly replacing brushed motors as the technology of choice as both the cost decreases and power increases of Neodymium-Iron magnets over Samarium-Cobalt.  The torque density and reliability of permanent-magnet motors have always exceeded those of brushed motors, but the large size and poor power efficiency of the support electronics generally outweigh the benefits except where power conservation is not important and when the controllers can be located off the machine.  Providing a power-efficient module that integrates all of the electronic and optical functions into a volume smaller than most motor position sensors suddenly alters the decision point in favor of brushless motors. Most servo-driven machines use multiple servomotors in concert.  Each of these systems would benefit from an intelligent means to distribute motion-control intelligence as described in this proposal.",Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Database Development and Interfacing; Highly-Reconfigurable; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Intelligence; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Ultra-High Density/Low Power

In-space assembly permits staged deployment on an as-needed, as-afforded basis.  It also decouples stowed launch geometry from deployed operational geometry.  The SWARM concept uses formation flown spacecraft, containing multiple universal docking ports, to dock with modular elements and maneuver them to dock with other, similar elements.  In the process, systems can be assembled that are much larger than what can be fit or folded into a launch vehicle fairing, or what can be launched on a single vehicle.  Furthermore, such modularity will allow jettison of failed components, upgrade of obsolete technology, and amortization of design costs across multiple missions.","Clearly the prime commercial application for the SWARM system is for modular spacecraft system development within NASA's scope of activity.  The SWARM system is wholly novel in its capabilities and flexibility for multiple operational regimes, including terrestrial laboratory testing, parabolic flight aircraft, and spaceflight, making it a relevant development product for the evaluation of operational strategies and design of modular spacecraft and self-assembling systems capable of on-orbit servicing, maintenance and reconfiguration.","This product would have immediate relevance to developers of intelligent modular spacecraft systems, who could purchase a series of modules to assemble a complete spacecraft bus model or, at a lesser scale, component elements (e.g., docking ports).

This concept of operation offers a specific advantage in the capability of continuous power growth by addition of solar cells, manufactured in situ, to an expanding power grid.  Such an effective power system on the Moon would lower operational risks of future robotic and manned missions through higher reliability.

The CO2 electrolysis process will produce O2 and CO.  The O2 may be used for life support and as an oxidant (for a fuel cell power system), and CO may be collected and used directly as fuel (or converted to methane for use as a fuel).  The electrolysis system is based on the Tubular Monolithic Ceramic Oxygen Generator (TM-COG) platform, whereby multiple oxygen separation cells are connected in series across both faces of a porous, flat-tube support. The design allows for simplified gas manifolding, sealing, and current collection and permits a high degree of cell stacking efficiency.

Proposed herein is an innovative hydrogen plasma reduction technique for the production of nanosize metal powders and water from lunar regolith. This technique is characterized by its high temperatures and rapid quenching. Due to the extremely high temperatures involved, material injected into the plasma flame can be vaporized and dissociated very rapidly into elemental form. Rapid quenching of the vapor prevents the growth of nucleated products while providing insufficient time for them to recombine with the oxygen. This allows the possibility of producing nanosize metal powders and the generation of water vapor.

The oxygen produced can be used as breathable oxygen, as a source of fuel for Moon or Mars based vehicles (for either return to Earth or as a basis for further space exploration), or as a source of oxygen for fuel cell or other power generating devices.  Lynntech proposes to use plasma technology to liberate the oxygen bound in the oxides of regolith to produce oxygen in situ on either the moon or Mars.  Lynntech's innovative solid feedstock plasma reformer is simple, robust and unaffected by variations in the composition or particle size of the regolith.  Lynntech has previously demonstrated the principle of plasma reformation on a variety of projects and has preliminary results demonstrating the technology proposed here.  Lynntech is currently developing plasma reformers for the US Air Force capable of producing several SCFM of hydrogen from JP-8 as well as multi-fuel (gas/liquid) capable reformers.  A small (< 10W) plasma reformer has also been demonstrated for the production of hydrogen on Titan for NASA.","With little or no modification, Lynntech's plasma-based oxygen generation system could be used to produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere.  The atmosphere on Mars consists largely of CO2 (~95%) and is saturated with dust.  Preliminary experiments with a Lynntech reformer indicate that CO2 can be reformed to solid carbon and gaseous O2.  The dust in the atmosphere does not harm our system; rather it contributes to the oxygen content of the product stream, as it is broken down into constituents, similar to the CO2.  Another NASA application for a space-bound plasma system is in the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbon rich atmospheres (such as the methane saturated Saturn moon, Titan), either for buoyancy, power or propulsion.  Lynntech has already successfully demonstrated a 10-Watt methane reformer that produces hydrogen from 100K to 300K and weighs less than 500g for the production of make-up hydrogen for a balloon operating on Titan.","The plasma-based system can also be used in several ground-based, non-NASA commercial applications as well.  One of these is solid waste processing.  With only small modifications, the plasma system proposed could be used to reform solid waste into high value components (i.e. hydrogen and carbon for most hydrocarbon chains, such as plastics and organics).  The high value constituents are contingent upon the feedstock, and thus are as diverse.  Alternatively, the plasma system could be used to process liquid or gaseous waste streams also.  One particularly attractive area is the reformation of used and dirty hydrocarbon wastes from automobiles.  These wastes include motor oil, greases, transmission and brake fluids, which can be reformed into products such as hydrogen and nano-structured carbon materials.  The process is immune to changes in the feedstock, and mixtures of hydrocarbons can be fed directly to produce a 90+% hydrogen stream prior to clean-up.",In-situ Resource Utilization

The LMHS conveys solids to the ISRU vessel, provides a gas-tight pressure/vacuum seal, and minimizes wear related to abrasive particles. Lunar and Mars ISRU scenarios require that equipment be operated over many cycles with minimal consumption of expendables and with minimal leakage in order to maintain high overall process leverage. ISRU processes can be demonstrated in the laboratory to establish basic feasibility with respect to reagent leverage. Reagent leverage is defined as the mass of commodity produced divided by the mass of reagents consumed. However, the process leverage component related to equipment wear and loss of gasses, reagents, or product through seals and valves is more difficult to establish from laboratory testing. The LMHS increases equipment life and minimizes process losses, thereby increasing overall leverage and reducing uncertainties in ISRU process evaluation. The LMHS is based on a seal arrangement by which lunar regolith can be introduced into and removed from reaction chambers operating under a wide range of batch operating conditions.","The primary application of the Lunar Materials Handling System is to advance in situ resource utilization on the Moon and then Mars.

The Puck was recently developed by Barrett for terrestrial mobile-manipulation uses where efficiency, low mass, and robustness are critical factors.  While quite small (<50 grams), the controller can pump from milliamps to several amps continuous.  Several features of this controller make it a candidate for NASA's wide range of needs for servomotor control in the demanding environments of extra-terrestrial and interplanetary exploration.  One of the key enabling design strategies that led to the Puck is elimination of transmission lines through total integration of power conditioning, rotor-position optics, and commutation into a single tiny module.  The module is small and energy efficient enough to make casting within high-heat-conduction plastic feasible.  Pure conduction cooling, a distinct advantage for NASA applications, is unusual for motor amplifiers which are generally cooled by natural convection or forced air.  The hermetically-sealed packaging also excludes lunar or Martian dust from affecting robustness.

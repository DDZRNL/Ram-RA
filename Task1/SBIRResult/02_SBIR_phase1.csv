Grecu,dgrecu@cra.com,"625 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge , MA02138 - 4555",(617 ) 491 - 3474,,,,,,,"Advanced technologies for on-board data recording allow the collection of increasingly sophisticated information during aircraft operation, reflecting decisions and actions taken by the crew, external flight conditions, and the behavior of flight systems. Such data, when subjected to a systematic and focused methodology of analysis, offers a tremendous opportunity for analyzing overall crew behavior, action patterns, and responses. To do this, we propose a novel analysis framework centered on the use of constraint-based safety models.  In contrast to data-driven analysis techniques, we propose an approach in which aviation safety experts would define constraint-based models of aircraft operational safety, and then apply these models against recorded data logs to detect and analyze exceedances. Data segments that reveal deviations from the model are then submitted to specialized analysis components that attempt to infer general behaviors across aircraft crews, or across individuals, to assess correlations with the detected deviations. The resulting recommendations can be incorporated in training sessions, simulated flight experiments, and actual test flights, to improve overall safety of maneuvers and performance of crew actions.","The full-scope environment for Constraint-based Analysis of Aircraft Operations will have immediate benefit in supporting the Aviation Performance Measurement System (APMS). The proposed capability provides a mixed initiative approach to analyzing vast amounts of data collected during routine flights, by detecting and facilitating the analysis of behaviors that are transient, and may potentially remain undetected. The proposed effort has also integration potential with components of NASA?s Aviation Safety Program by capitalizing on the results of the Aviation System Monitoring and Modeling effort, and on the data sources it provides. The proposed approach can complement the Single Aircraft Prevention Program by integrating the results into a capability that can predict safety hazards due to technical problems, aircraft operation issues, and adverse conditions. Finally, the Constraint-based Analysis of Aircraft Operations can provide valuable input to the System-Wide Accident Prevention Program that looks into aviation safety issues associated with human error and non-procedural compliance.","Potential commercial applications of the proposed effort include safety critical environments, where operational data is available for processing and analysis. Immediate application areas include railway safety, control rooms for nuclear plants, and for other complex high-value ecologically-sensitive industrial processes. The proposed approach also has immediate application for aircraft safety applications in the military domain."

The human performance modeling environment of IMPRINT combined with the cognitive modeling tool ACT-R will provide a powerful tool for the designers of cockpit systems.  IMPRINT can already be used to predict pilot workload and assess the effects of performance shaping factors on pilot tasks.  The use of ACT-R to add the SA prediction capability will dramatically increase the usefulness of the tool.  The capability of predicting pilot SA will allow design concepts to be assessed early in the design process and supplement data collected through comparatively more expensive pilot in-the-loop experiments.  NASA is continuing to play an important role in the development of new operational concepts for the National Airspace System (NAS) as they explore the feasibility of transferring separation responsibility from the ground-based air traffic control system to the flight deck.  The impact on the pilot?s SA of new tools designed to support these efforts must be understood to ensure that safety and efficiency of the NAS is maintained.  Likewise any commercial developer of cockpit systems will benefit from the use of this tool.,"NASA often includes SA in the standard data collection process during simulator experiments and flight tests of new systems.  The ability to predict pilot SA during the design of a new system will greatly improve the efficiency of the design process while reducing the costs.  In addition, the required investigation to support the modeling effort will lead to a greater understanding of SA in aviation safety from a basic research perspective.","The Cockpit System Situational Awareness Modeling Tool could assist air transport cockpit designers with developing decision aids and displays that would provide new levels of pilot SA needed to support the Free Flight concept of transferring separation responsibility from the ground-based air traffic control system to the flight deck.  In addition, a general aviation derivative of the tool could be used for designing cockpit systems for general aviation pilots whose wider range of experience and skills require displays and instrumentation that must be robust to situational awareness needs while inhibiting information overload."

One particular emphasis is on fire. The prevention, detection, and suppression of fires are critical goals of accident mitigation. Aircraft fires represent a small number of actual accident causes, but the number of fatalities due to in-flight, post-crash and on-ground fires is large. The proposed oxygen concentration sensor provides a key element for an inerting system for the prevention of fires in fuel tanks.","There are many commercial and military applications for an accurate and rugged fuel tank oxygen concentration sensor. The fuel tank oxygen sensor could be used in both new and retrofit commercial aircraft as a control sensor for fuel tank protection systems. The reliable and precise instrument can be used to control onboard inert gas generation systems (OBIGGS) for cargo compartment fire suppression, fuel tank inerting, and emergency breathing oxygen systems (OBOGS) for passengers and crew. The key to the commercial viability of this product is the accuracy of the sensor, its ability to handle harsh environments including highly variable temperatures and pressures, and its reliability and lifetime, which we propose to engineer into the system.

With the predicted increase in air traffic these numbers are likely to increase. With reduction of fatal accidents as motivation, the proposal plans to investigate design of fault tolerant control system for aircrafts undergoing actuator failures. The feasible approach for such a control scheme is to predesign various controllers anticipating these failures and switching to appropriate controller when the failure occurs. It is found that use of nominal controller when actuators fail may lead to catastrophic accidents. Switching to an appropriate controller enabled by the available redundancy in actuation allows the system to perform adequately even when these failures occur. However, the predesign for actuator failures is not trivial as the position at which the actuators fail is not known a priori. For linear systems the problem has been solved in recent literature; however failures when they occur can cause excursions into nonlinear regimes. The primary thrust of this research would be to extend the results in nonlinear control theory to accommodate actuator failures in aircraft.","Several design techniques to be developed in the proposed work are directly applicable to improve the safety and performance of aerospace vehicles in case of components failures involving the actuators. Since NASA has a great interest in developing autonomous systems, the work will provide a means to synthesize fault tolerant systems which can continue to perform under adverse operating circumstances even after failures. These techniques prove to be invaluable when especially when the system is deployed in a remote location or when continued safety and performance are desired features of the system.","Actuator failures such as stuck control surfaces when they occur in commercial aircraft can cause catastrophic accidents and fatal loss of life.

This algorithm can be embedded into low cost electronics. First, two independent residual vectors (RVs) for detection and isolation of the sensor and process faults are built. This is in sharp contrast to conventional methods, which can deal with either sensor failures or process failures but never both. Second, to isolate faults, the RV is transformed into a set of structured residual vectors (SRVs), where one SRV is made insensitive to a specified subset of faults, while remaining sensitive to other faults. The proposed technology is relevant to this subtopic because we will develop an electronic module that can be embedded in low cost sensor electronics to quickly identify both sensor and process faults.","Health monitoring technology has many applications such as health monitoring for engines, helicopter gearbox systems, jet and automotive engine diagnostics, and commercial and military aircraft.

Hypersonic flight vehicles are typically designed with a high expansion ratio single expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) with a design point at high Mach number flight conditions. However, at low Mach number flight, lower nozzle expansion ratios are required for optimum performance. Thus, these vehicles suffer from poor performance throughout much of the low-speed flight regime. In addition, the long SERN ramp creates a significant off-axis thrust at off-design, which must be overcome by shifting the vehicle center-of-gravity or by using the vehicle?s control surfaces.

Binaural or 3D-simulated audio has been identified as a useful method for analyzing acoustic and vibro-acoustic data.  The highest quality audio simulation requires the processing of HRTF data to create the most accurate 3D audio rendering; however, such processing requires an extensive amount of CPU cycles and is one of the biggest limiting factors of the complexity of the audio simulation.  By significantly improving the efficiency of HRTF processing, through such techniques as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Equivalent Source Reduction (ESR), the complexity of the structure being acoustically modeled can be increased.  In fact, the capacity of the audio rendering engine can be increased to the point where not only single point audio sources can be modeled, but surface-defined audio sources can be defined, using an array of single-point sources. Such surface-defined audio sources make the audio simulation of vibro-acoustic systems feasible. Such a system will act as an effective tool for assessing the noise characteristics and ?sound quality? of structural acoustic prototypes.","When designers are given the ability to simulate the expected noise generated from an object or structure with a force applied which induces vibration, this noise can be characterized by examining its volume and tonal qualities and determinations can be made regarding how perceptually problematic the projected noise might be in field conditions.  This capability will allow more accurate analysis of and experimentation with the acoustics of designs for aircraft and International Space Station structural components.","Commercial applications of this technology would be in the automobile industry, where millions of dollars are spent every year in order to find ways to make new vehicles operate more quietly.  The acoustics analysis capabilities that would be enabled with the development of the SVD/ESR-enhanced 3D audio simulation software could be applied widely throughout the automobile business by licensing it to be integrated with existing and broadly used industrial acoustics analysis packages such as the Virtual Acoustics Sciences product line.

High frequency excitation (wavelengths much shorter that amplified instabilities) of jet flows is a new technology that has the potential to reduce acoustic levels significantly in addition to lowering turbulence levels.  In application, forcing is applied at frequencies that are much higher than ones associated with the large-scale, two-dimensional structures associated with the jet, but much lower than the Kolmogorov scale.  The development of the jet is substantially altered through two mechanisms.  First, the high-frequency forcing increases the turbulent dissipation rate.  Second, it reduces the turbulent production.  These two mechanisms together lead to a significant decrease in the energy in the large-scale two-dimensional motion and subsequently lowering turbulent and noise levels. One benefit of the control is that the forcing needs only to possess frequencies that are above a certain range.  This single frequency requirement encompasses a wide array of potentially suitable devices.",The proposed technology development could open the door to further understanding and breakthroughs (beyond the proposed SBIR program) by NASA researchers.

We have shown in other NASA projects how our associate systems can provide Distributed Air-Ground  (DAG) decision aiding to pilots, air traffic controllers, and airline dispatchers within the ATM system of a UAV free NAS.  Our existing C2IT software provides decision aiding to UAV operators in combat environments in such a manner that the UAV looks much like a normal aircraft to external observers.  We propose to refine our existing UAV decision aiding system so that UAV operators can collaborate effectively with the actors of the ATM system of the NAS.  In particular, we shall identify the new ATM message signals and data objects required, synthesize new collaboration diagrams, and refine the finite state machine (FSM) of a UAV associate system.  The associate will further the UAV?s similarities to a piloted aircraft in order to accommodate the existing decision support systems of air traffic controllers and pilots.","The results of this project will enable UAVs to smoothly interact with the NAS ATM system when they need to.  They will enable the ATM system to maintain a high level of performance even during UAV operations.  NASA will be able to take advantage of this capability during their UAV research and testing operations, which will make them far easier to execute than UAV operations today.","Future UAV systems will be able to operate on a routine basis with other aircraft in the NAS.  This capability will allow them to be used everyday without special clearances or airspace being set aside for their operation.  This will make UAV?s commercially viable for missions such as atmospheric radiation measurement, pipeline monitoring, homeland security, search & rescue, intelligence gathering, surveillance, fire fighting, agricultural and environmental monitoring, aerial photography and mapping, law enforcement, and telecommunication relay to name a few."

In Phase I, computationally efficient blast wave effect models will be integrated to simulate launch vehicle propellant explosion effects.  Analytical models and available explosion test data will be combined into reduced mechanism blast wave models simulating the explosion event.  The value of the improved coupled simulation capability will be demonstrated through sample computations, with and without blast wave effects, for individual and simultaneous crew member ejection, and for the escape separation of a crew vehicle.The newly developed physical and dynamic simulation models will be further refined and validated in Phase II.  In particular, the speed and accuracy of staging and escape simulations using the new blast wave models will be improved.

Significant amounts of the cost associated with operation of the current Shuttle involves manual inspections.  The challenge is to determine a means of more cost effective inspections.  Proposed herein is a means for reducing the need for manual inspections while improving the quality of ?flight readiness status? information.  The proposed approach also insures that this reduction in operations costs could be achieved for a minimum cost. A miniature device is proposed that can measure and compile the exact stress life in mechanical parts on a constant basis and report this information to a gathering facility via wireless radio communications.  The device would be so small that one or more of them could be included on every critical life limited part designed for a particular application.  The inclusion of the device on the critical part would make the part a ?smart part? that would continually measure its own health relative to stress life and would report that information when commanded.  Thus maintenance personnel would only need to watch for data processing alarms to determine the replacement time.,"This device is applicable to both retrofit and new system NASA applications.  Specifically, IVC has raw data collection hardware flying on the Shuttle for purposes of measuring the exact strain loads imparted on the engine steering arms.  IVC has pushed size and cost reduction of this device to the limits of conventional components.  In this form, the device has a large potential market and can contribute to the optimization of replacement schedules for many ?life limited? parts.  This effort has resulted in a device that measures 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm by 1.5 cm.   The proposed device (measuring 5 mm by 5 mm by 2 mm ) would bond to the part or structure.  Properly packaged, the device could be imbedded into composite construction to detect changes in the statistical stress life that would signal structural failure.","Commercial air service organizations all deal with life limited parts.  Parts must be replaced within a specific number of operational hours.  The number of hours are estimates by the builder and the controlling government safety authority.  A technique that could total the exact number of stress cycles and their magnitude could allow life limited parts to be changed out only when service life has been reached.  Example:  PA 38 Piper aircraft.  The wings have a service life of 11,000 hours.  This assumes that the plane was used to the limits of the Utility Category (more stressful than Normal Category).  These aircraft are being scrapped every year due to this limitation in spite of the fact that many have not even come close to their service life.  Commercial operations can save money precise measurements and lives could be saved as exemplified by the recent Slurry Tanker crashes if total service life was easily available."

Box 97, Madison , AL35758 - 0097",(256 ) 461 - 8006,,,,,,,"Determining an effective structural design of a launch vehicle is critical to both mission success and crew safety.  In order to evaluate the adequacy of a launch vehicle?s structural design, the ascent loads experienced by the vehicle must be determined.  Computation of the ascent loads is a complex, multi-disciplined undertaking that involves an assessment of both natural and induced environments.  Currently, ascent loads are calculated primarily using a somewhat restrictive constant Mach number squatcheloid approach.  A method to compute the ascent loads of a launch vehicle through a direct coupling of the six-degree-of-freedom trajectory simulation with a time correlated flexible body simulation of the structure is proposed.  Load dispersions due to the statistical uncertainties associated with both environmental effects (e.g., winds) as well as vehicle uncertainties (e.g., thrust misalignment) may be assessed directly from a set of Monte Carlo runs of the synchronized trajectory and loads simulations.  The Phase I research is directed at developing the necessary algorithms and providing a proof-of-concept simulation.  During Phase II, a complete modular computational framework will be developed that will integrate the 6DOF trajectory tools with the loads prediction software, allowing for a more accurate and unified loads analysis of the vehicle.","If the proposed computational approach for ascent loads is fully developed, NASA will gain an important tool for the accurate prediction of launch vehicle loads.  Clearly, NASA?s 2nd Generation RLV design must be structurally efficient in order to meet program goals.  This will require accurate knowledge of vehicle loads in order to eliminate excess conservatism without jeopardizing safety.  Similarly, if the Shuttle is to continue flying for many years into the future, more precise knowledge of the dynamic loads which occur during ascent may be required for future fracture and reliability analyses of the vehicle.","The most obvious non-NASA application for this technology is the commercial satellite launch industry.  Proposed commercial reusable launch vehicles have the potential to dramatically lower payload-to-orbit costs.  This proposed analytical process could enhance such vehicles by producing more optimal structural designs and reducing the potential for launch failure.  The proposed technology could also be adapted to augment existing simulations of various mobile military assets such as a planes, tanks, or guided missiles, thus increasing the fidelity of the computed loads for these systems as well."

The goal of this research is to fill this void.  An innovative experimental technique is proposed where by a cavitating inducer's dynamic transfer function is quantified by mapping the flow and pressure fluctuations at the inducer exit as a function of harmonic perturbations at the inlet.  A cavitating inducer can be a source of instability in a rocket engine.  Due to cavitation dynamics, inlet flow perturbations maybe amplified by the inducer resulting in very large flow and pressure fluctuations in the fuel system.  The resulting dynamic couplings can lead to vehicle instability (POGO) as well as generate intense dynamic loadings on the turbopump.  The feasibility of implementing the technique on the Concepts NREC water flow test rig will be demonstrated in Phase I of the project.  Implementation of the technique and inducer transfer function identification will occur in Phase II.  The proposed dynamic transfer function characterization methodology is applicable to any high energy density turbomachine subject to impeller induced flow instabilities, such as boiler feed pumps or re-injection pumps and compressors.","As mission requirements lead to higher power density turbopumps with lower specific weights and higher suction specific speed requirements the potential for flow-induced dynamic instabilities, both at the turbopump level and at the system level, increase.  Rocket vehicle dynamic models require an accurate dynamic characterization for the inducer.  The proposed experimentally measured dynamic transfer functions will provide accurate and reliable pump dynamic attributes which are necessary to assess the probability of destructive flow instabilities, such as cavitation surge and rotating cavitation, and their effect on engine component or integrated vehicle system instability.","High energy density turbomachines such as gas re-injection pumps and compressors, and high-energy industrial pumps, are a source of instability.  Accurate dynamic characterizations of these machines are required to ensure safe and reliable operation of the systems into which they are installed.  In addition to understanding the dynamic attributes of these machines under cavitation or stalled conditions, the dynamic transfer function under normal operating conditions are also required.  The methodology proposed to measure the dynamic transfer function of a cavitating inducer is transferable.

This material shows potential to be a coating that meets all of NASA?s requirements for TPS protection in a single material system. The basic technical requirements for a coating to protect metal TPS are a) total hemispherical emittance >0.8 to maximize re-radiation b) low catalytic efficiency (<0.3) for recombination of atomic N and O species, and c) protection against oxidation of the underlying metal substrate at temperatures up to 2000oF (1093oC) for approximately 15 minutes during each reentry.  The coating material is also lightweight, low cost, and easily repairable.  The proposed coating material is easily applicable by painting, and is amenable to quick field repair.  Phase I work will focus on optimizing emissivity of the material and developing coatings. Phase II will focus on further developing coating for metallic TPS panels and further testing for emissivity and catalytic efficiency.","Metallic TPS are being pursued by NASA for next-generation RLVs to replace the currently-used ceramic TPS which requires extensive maintenance and water-proofing after each launch cycle.  NASA?s long term goal is to implement multiple missions to space with rapid turnaround times which demands a robust TPS that requires minimum maintenance after each cycle.  Metallic TPS systems hold great promise to meet the need, but require a robust coating that provides high emissivity, low catalytic activity, and oxidation protection of the substrate.  The proposed technology offers many benefits and can be easily implemented into production.","There is a growing interest in commercial RLVs, which will require TPS systems that require minimal maintenance. Low cost, field repairable high emissivity protective coatings for TPS will be especially critical for commercial systems.   High emissivity coatings are also needed in the glass industry and other processing industries."

The structural dynamic behavior of the combined system is expected to display a significant nonlinearity arising not only from the combination of the acoustic and thermal effects but also from the yielding character of the TPS. A methodology for the fast and accurate prediction of the fatigue life of such nonlinear structures, involving full finite element solutions, reduced order modeling, and random response and fatigue life prediction, is rapidly maturing. The focus of the present effort is then to take these important analysis capabilities to the next level, i.e. to an efficient design tool. This task will be accomplished through the formulation and implementation of the sensitivities of the fatigue life of the panels to their geometric/material properties, boundary conditions, TPS characteristics, etc. The Phase I effort will represent a proof-of-concept on panels without TPS. The Phase II will then proceed with the structural modeling/reduced order modeling of TPS and a complete validation of the proposed design sensitivity methodology.","The Design/Analysis FRANVAL software will occupy a unique niche as there is currently no software to predict the response/fatigue life of panels subjected to thermo-acoustic loads nor evaluate the response/life design sensitivities. It will play an important role in the design of many flight vehicles including supersonic transports, reusable launch vehicles, RLV/TAV and other projects of NASA?s space initiative that are experiencing severe thermal, acoustic, or both types of excitations. The inclusion of the TPS modeling and of its interaction with the panel will provide a common platform for the development of these components and will help transition from component design to system design. Further, the reduced order modeling core of FRANVAL will lead to expedient sensitivity computations. Thus, Design/Analysis FRANVAL will also naturally support the NASA multidisciplinary optimization efforts.","The proposed design-oriented software (FRANVAL) will become the only available tool for the prediction of the response, fatigue life, and their design sensitivities of panels subjected to thermo-acoustic loads. Additionally, it will include the TPS structural modeling and its interaction with the panel. Thus, FRANVAL will cover two separate markets (panels and TPS) thereby increasing its distribution potential. ZONA intends to market FRANVAL as a standalone package. It can be adopted by structural engineers for a wide class of aerospace vehicles ranging from JSF, UAV/UCAV, supersonic transports, reusable launch vehicles, RLV/TAV and other new hypersonic aerospace vehicles.  It will be an ideal design tool for the current NASA projects under its space initiative.  Other than NASA, potential customers include R&D and design arms of DoD Government and private industry such as ZONA?s ZAERO software users in the structures community.

MXER tether systems will require several innovations, including survivable tether structures with both high-strength and conducting materials, methods for controlling electrodynamic spin-up and reboost while maintaining dynamic stability, and an architecture that can enable capabilities to be increased and qualified in a modular, incremental manner.

Second, our model encapsulates a holistic view of organizational risk management, where organizations are not depicted solely as a source of errors but also as a means for detecting and responding to system failures. Finally, in contrast to conventional methods that focus on analyzing technical failures in the system, our model incorporates explicit measures of organizational phenomena such as goals, decisions, authority, communication, and informal social networks.

Failures such as the Challenger launch and the Mars rover illustrate the need for tools to design organizations that minimize rather than induce errors, and to identify latent errors introduced during design and construction before they manifest themselves as operational failures providing little opportunity for recovery. The challenges of constructing, maintaining, and continually expanding the ISS demand cost-effective methods for predicting the impact of new technologies on system safety prior to installation.","The capabilities of NORM are most likely to appeal to customers who have the need to analyze and improve organizational safety or design organizations for safe operations. Examples of potential applications include air traffic control, supervisory control systems, command and control systems, ground and maritime transportation, hospital administration, construction, and manufacturing.

Specifically, with a magnet and a set of electrodes at or near the surface, a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation would be possible. The generated power, estimated to be on a multi-megawatt scale for the future Mars mission, can be useful during the mission. Additionally, asymmetric MHD configuration can provide   body forces for aerodynamic maneuvering and stabilization.  A successful development of this technology must be based on a comprehensive and reliable set of theoretical and computational models. Although extensive CFD codes for planetary entry exist in NASA and academia, for the planetary-entry MHD application those codes and models must be improved and enhanced, especially with regard to ionization mechanism, ionization enhancement, MHD coupling with the flow, and low-density phenomena such as ion slip. We propose to develop models that would incorporate the relevant physics, and to predict potential performance of the planetary-entry MHD power generators and aerodynamic control devices.","The effort will create a foundation for a breakthrough technology to help future NASA Mars and other planetary missions, and will potentially create a new power technology for Earth satellites and Trans-Atmospheric Vehicles.  The tools developed in this program would be used to assess power generation performance of MHD system mounted on a Mars entry ballute, and to study force moments that can be created by an asymmetric placement of the MHD device.  The results will be applicable to new NASA aerospace vehicles, and will redefine the possible mission profiles in future space endeavors","While the eventual goal of understanding MHD effects in re-entry environments would be applicable to an aerospace vehicle and redefine the possible mission profiles in future space endeavors, RSI will pursue more near-term commercialization efforts.

The algorithms developed in this program will find application in design efforts in next-generation re-entry vehicles (without MHD effects), in new hypersonic vehicles involving MHD power generation or control, and in terrestrial MHD power generation.  Existing codes can cover the areas of MHD effects, hypersonic flow, and partially ionized flow, but they do not consider MHD effects coupled with aerothermochemically nonequilibrium flow and Hall and ion-slip effects."

ISSYS will take advantage of state-of-the-art Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to develop a highly stable device for real-time, noninvasive collection of fluid pressure data.  Once implanted, the device requires no additional maintenance or calibration.  This space-worthy system provides sensing technology that is miniature, requires minimal power, and is tolerant of vibration and acceleration.  It will facilitate our understanding of gravitational effects by supporting animal studies of fundamental biological processes in the cardiovascular, neurological, urological, and gastroenterological systems, in space and on the ground.  Phase I of this project will develop a prototype implantable sensor and demonstrate basic functionality using ISSYS' existing readout technology.  A subsequent Phase II effort would customize the implant for specific in vivo applications (per NASA specifications), develop implantation methods as appropriate, and refine the readout to add user-friendliness.  A complete system would then be validated in an animal model.","? Implantable sensors for measuring biological pressures in animals, both in space and terrestrial ?

Aptamers are short (40?60 base) DNA or RNA chains selected from a randomized library for their affinity to a given immobilized target molecule (e.g., glucose).  After several iterations of affinity selection followed by PCR amplification, rare high affinity oligonucleotides from the original random library emerge and dominate the nucleic acid population.  If DNA aptamers are raised against glucose and then cloned and sequenced, they can be engineered with an intrachain fluorophore and quencher pair to fluoresce upon binding of glucose, because the fluorophore would be released from its quenched state (released from fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRET).  The fluorescence intensity would be proportional to the amount of glucose bound to the aptamers, thus enabling construction of a quantitative glucose sensor.  Because DNA can be heated to release any bound target molecules, the sensor could be heat and flushed to make it reusable (a desirable feature for the space bioreactor to obviate frequent sensor maintenance).  The entire sensor could eventually be constructed at the end of a fiber optic cable making it miniature and implantable in the bioreactor or in human subjects.","The proposed DNA Aptamer-FRET system would serve as a robust,reusable, and accurate glucose sensor for NASA's rotating space bioreactor.

On long-term space missions, on board the International Space Station, or on future lunar or planetary facilities, a biodegradable food packaging plastic could be disposed of in composting environments that support agricultural production.  Several biodegradable polymers are commercially available, but they lack the barrier properties needed for food preservation.  TDA proposes to improve the barrier properties of biodegradable plastics with our proprietary nanocomposites.  Much of TDA?s nanocomposite research has focused on the careful design of surface treatments to produce nanocomposites compatible with and dispersible in targeted host polymers.  We have shown that we can form well-dispersed nanocomposites with several biodegradable plastics and, in one example, have demonstrated improved barrier properties without a loss in biodegradation rates.  In this project we will apply this technology to poly(lactic acid) (PLA) ? a biodegradable plastic with polystyrene-type polymer properties.  PLA is an excellent packaging material, and its improved barrier properties resulting from TDA?s nanoparticles would produce a biodegradable food packaging material capable of storing foods from extended missions.","Extended duration space missions require packaged, shelf-stable food sent from earth.  In a closed system such as a spacecraft, waste disposal of these packaging materials must be disposed of in a cost effective way consistent with a dynamic life support system.  Biodegradable food packaging materials could be recycled in-flight in hydroponic baths or to supplement the growing medium for wheat, potatoes, or other crops that can be grown inside a spacecraft.","As a biodegradable bio-based polymer, PLA can be produced domestically at low cost, eliminating dependence on foreign petroleum supplies with their corresponding demand and price fluctuations.  PLA is also biodegradable - an additional important feature that realistically addresses the problems of plastic waste generation. Successful development of high barrier PLA would find application in a variety of areas including consumer packaging applications, packaging for food and food service applications, and medical packaging.

Experiments will be conducted in existent prototype food products developed previously for NASA?s food program. Selected antioxidants from the following categories:  Phenolic Compounds, Vitamins, and Carotenoids will be incorporated in the food products during the pre-preparation/mixing phase of production.  Products will be sealed and thermally processed to achieve commercial sterility.  All pre-processing and thermal processing parameters will be optimized to aid in retaining appropriate levels of residual antioxidants.

This concept is highly supportive to the NASA food program due to its directed dual benefit to aid in extending the shelf life of the formulated foods, and in aiding in the protection of astronaut?s health by counter balancing some of the effects of long term exposure to low dose radiation, which can cause free radical formation in biological tissue.  The formation of free radicals may compromise the quality and nutrition of the food supply during extended storage.","Market data indicates that the Healthy Food Market represents a substantial segment in the commercial food industry.

To this end, while this proposal involves continuing to work with the physics of the program, the main focus is on developing the tools to match the representation systems intrinsic to Geant4 to those used by other tools which generate geometries.

The prototype instrument will combine fluorescence discrimination with aerosol counting techniques to provide a reliable warning of potential increase in biological particles inside spacecraft or space station crew environment.  The proposed instrument is based on an innovative measurement strategy where all aerosol particles would be sampled but only suspicious particles interrogated by a UV/blue laser to measure fluorescence.  An advantage of this conditional sampling strategy is that NASA personnel will be able to make measurements on a particle-by-particle basis to determine whether aerosols contain biological material.  The result is that a small concentration of biological aerosols mixed with an abundance of non-biological particles can be detected.  The instrument will exploit the autofluorescence of certain molecules contained in biological material and the size of particles to distinguish potentially harmful airborne bacteria from background aerosols.  Particles detected as potential biological particles can then be collected in reagent buffer for further processing in analytical instruments for positive identification. The instrument developed in the Phase II program will support NASA's goal of developing an instrument to monitor the air quality of the spacecraft environment.",A real-time method for characterizing bioaerosols does not presently exist.  The instrument would support NASA's Earth Science Enterprise program by developing an instrument for characterizing bioaerosols in the earth's atmosphere.  This instrument would also support NASA's mission for a permanent presence of man in space by continuously monitoring air quality to protect crew health.  Aspects of this instrument would be utilized on space probes to assess acceptability of unknown environments for human habitation.,The instrument developed in this program will identify and monitor the amount of airborne contaminants around municipal solid waste recycling and composting plants; monitor and track bioaerosols in health care facilities; monitor and evaluate the bioaerosol content in structures that have little recirculation with outdoor air; monitor the concentration and source of bioaerosols in a variety of indoor industrial environments; determine the amount of bio-pesticide that is outside of crop areas; and monitor the effluents from suspect biological warfare agent production facilities for treaty verification and compliance.

In partnership with BioServe Space Technologies, we ultimately seek to offer an efficient, long-duration, EXPRESS-rackcompatible microgravity mouse habitat that will address BioServe?s growing demands from commercial affiliates expressing an interest in conducting research with mice aboard the International Space Station. Our focus on mice stems from the facts that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies perform most pre-clinical examinations (80%) with mice, transgenic laboratory animals are nearly exclusively available in mice, and mice require fewer ISS resources (crew time, mass, volume, etc.) than rats. However, odors from mouse urine are considerably more odiferous than the urine from rats, the traditional animal used in microgravity biology studies. Therefore, this research addresses odor control and sanitation technologies for mouse waste, specifically the examination of various adsorption materials (e.g. carbon, zeolite, and bedding), separating humidity and odor control, and efficacy of a catalytic scrubber.",Identifying effective waste and odor technologies that can operate within the constraints of a spaceflight payload could allow the use of the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) for extended durations aboard ISS. Increasing the duration capabilities of the AEM would allow a broader range of investigations from both the commercial and science communities. It would also relieve the current cost and schedule pressure in developing the next generation animal habitat. This work will also assist the commercial programs in supporting their customers to conducting leading edge research on near term flight opportunities.,"The primary commercial application of this hardware is to enable the marketing of microgravity research and development to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, our subcontractor, BioServe has a strong track record of promoting spaceflight pre-clinical research on the Space Shuttle with three flight investigations sponsored by Chiron Corp. (STS-60, 63 and 77) and a recently completed spaceflight investigation sponsored by Amgen Inc. (STS-108). Amgen has expressed a strong interest in flying mice on the Space Station. They are particularly interested in flying skeletally aged mice for 4-6 weeks to explore long-duration spaceflight as a model for Type II (senile) osteoporosis (as described in Part 5: Related R/R&D). If the described combination of age related bone loss in C57BL/6J mice and spaceflight were to become a validating step before proceeding to human clinical trials for senile osteoporosis, it would be worth millions of dollars to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry."

With regards to space communications antenna array systems are regularly installed with spacecrafts and satellites to transmit electromagnetic signals at high power. As such, circulators/isolators are needed to separate signal paths in T/R modules, providing protection over the receiver circuitries avoiding high-power incidence. When applied at high power, nonlinearity sets in at the ferrite junction area causing communication channels to couple with each other. This is called intermodulation which ultimately limits the usefulness of a ferrite junction to be applicable at excessive power levels. In the past we have analyzed this nonlinear problem and have identified the origin for intermodulation. We envision two techniques to be effective. The first technique is based on the DC consideration ensuring circulation action to occur without activating the adverse terms in the equations of motion responsible for intermodulation. The second technique is AC in nature, demanding the circulator operation to induce minimum excursion in the transverse component of the magnetization vector. Temperature compensated ferrites will be considered in Phase II, giving rise to stabilized operation of the circulator applied at high power.","This proposal addresses the NASA's needs in using space for commercial products and services. More specifically, this proposal addresses the NASA's goals in Space Commercialization Infrastructure for which high-quality communications are pursued to enhance commercial operation in space or commercial satellites. Antenna systems are regularly deployed with spacecrafts and satellites to allow communications with radio stations on earth. Circulators and isolators are thus needed in the T/R modules to protect the receiver circuits from high power incidence. Due to the large distances involved in space communications, the transmitters allocated in space or satellites are required to operate at high power. However, the performance of a ferrite device degrades as power increases, resulting in considerably amount of noise in communications. The proposed SBIR research is to improve circulator/isolator performance at high power, thereby enhancing the quality of communications in space or commercial satellites.","The Phase I research admits immediate and unique applications of power circulators/isolators to be applied for communications over distances, for example, a relay station in the continent, a ship in the ocean, an airline jet in the sky, a satellite outside the earth?s atmosphere, and a spacecraft in space. To ensure high-quality communication intermodulation interference has to be immune from a circulator/isolator junction, and to our knowledge there is no such device existent in the current market. The success of this proposed SBIR research will no doubt fulfill the need of the market, and hence its commercial potential is tremendous"

The proposed DIAL transmitter would enable high-resolution, high-accuracy remote sensing of atmospheric molecular species of interest to NASA including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide as well as many others. To date there have been no sources in this region suitable for NASA DIAL missions. The proposed source is comprised of a diode-laser-pumped, Q-switched, 2-?Ym laser, which pumps a middle-wave-infrared (MWIR) optical parametric oscillator (OPO), that is injection-seeded with a quantum cascade laser (QCL) to provide a narrow linewidth. The primary innovation is the use of recently developed distributed feedback (DFB) QCLs to injection-seed a MWIR OPO for the purpose of obtaining narrow linewidth, high-pulse-energy operation in a compact, simple configuration. A secondary innovation is the specific selection of other critical system components that make the overall system suitable for airborne and space-based instrumentation. These include the all-solid-state 2-?n?Ym pump laser and the MWIR OPO, which can be constructed with either zinc germanium phosphide (ZGP) or cadmium selenide (CdSe) depending on the wavelength coverage desired.","The primary NASA application for the technology proposed is in airborne and space-based DIAL systems. As note in the Related R&D section, NASA has already applied QC lasers to point-sensing instrumentation with success. This technology would allow DIAL to be extended into the MWIR region of the spectrum, which allows a very broad range of molecular species to be studied via remote-sensing as opposed to point-sensing techniques. This opens up the possibility of profiling the atmosphere more thoroughly and with high accuracy.","In addition to the NASA DIAL application there are a number of commercial and military applications for this technology. Commercial applications include pollution monitoring using the same DIAL technique and non-destructive analysis of composite materials in high-value structures such as aircraft. Military applications include IR countermearsures, 3-D imaging for target identification and ordinance guidance, multi-spectral imaging for surveillance and targeting."

Lidar measurements from low earth orbit can provide a global survey of tropospheric ozone and aerosol layers with high vertical resolution.  These observations can be complemented by regional measurements with lidars on small aircraft at higher spatial and temporal resolution.  This synergistic approach can determine the global chemical and radiative consequences of tropospheric ozone and aerosols. We propose to develop and demonstrate a key component of a laser transmitter that can meet the performance requirements of both systems. In contrast to solid state, diode-pumped, high-energy, low-pulse-rate transmitters that have been considered for ozone lidar systems, our innovative approach is to use a high-pulse-rate (1 kHz) source with similar average powers to low-pulse-rate systems, but greatly reduced energies per pulse. The resultant reduction in the number of diodes and the size of the beam-handling optics leads to a lower-cost, lighter weight system, advantages for both the satellite- and aircraft-based systems.","The work proposed here has direct application to the development of aircraft and satellite-based ozone DIAL systems. The pump source would drive a nonlinear conversion system to generate UV wavelengths suited for ozone sensing from different platforms. Other NASA applications for the pump source would be in precision altimetry for earth and other planetary investigations. The source, combined with other nonlinear optics, could also serve as the DIAL transmitter for probing of other species than ozone. In particular, combined with optical parametric oscillators, the source we develop could provide broadly tunable infrared for sensing of a wide variety of molecular species.","The proposed high-energy MPS technology would be an extension of our existing diode-pumped product line and would offer a step-up in power and energy  from our existing products, into the 100-W range now served by more conventional lamp-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. A MPS Nd:YLF laser with 100 mJ/pulse energy, 1-kHz rate and high beam quality could provide a relatively low-cost solution for precision machining applications such as marking, cutting, welding and drilling, of interest to the electronics, automotive and medical-device industry. Q-Peak, as it is now doing with the MPS product line, would strive to establish OEM relationships with systems integrators who supply machining and processing tools to end customers."

Because Nd:Y2O3 can generate output on both the 915 nm transition and the 947 nm transition, the desired ozone UV DIAL wavelengths of 305 nm and 315 nm can be generated using a SINGLE laser device that incorporates 3rd harmonic conversion.  The current laser transmitter for UV DIAL monitoring of ozone from satellite platforms is relatively large and requires 2 DPSS laser sources in addition to 5 non-linear conversion steps, whereas the Nd:Y2O3 based system may require as few as 1 DPSS laser source and 2 non-linear conversion steps. The minimal component count, small size and weight, and reduced power requirement makes a DIAL laser transmitter based on Nd:Y2O3 a very attractive choice for space based remote sensing.

The goal of this proposal is to develop a  whole class of truly stand-alone, large-area, distributed sensor systems on a flexible substrate ? a MEMS skin.   We propose to use a two-layer flexible substrate.  The first would be a copper-on-flex substrate that acts as the interconnect layer for power distribution.  The second is a Si-on-flex substrate that contains the power, sensor and circuit systems.  This layer would utilize a thin film amorphous Si solar cell, integrated with Anvik?s technology to integrate MEMS and IC devices.  The two substrate layers would be connected using micro-via patterns in the Si-on-flex layer that can be generated using Anvik?s photo-ablation systems.

The use of a chemical sensor will allow applications in hazardous gas monitoring over large-areas.  The integration of MEMS and the associated circuitry in a single unit is a giant step forward in improving the sensitivity and performance of these sensors.

The best solution for attenuating these dynamic loads is to incorporate vibration isolation either at the launch vehicle-to-satellite interface or at the satellite-to-component interface.  Conventional passive vibration isolation systems have been successfully flown at both of these interfaces.  It is believed, however, that much greater isolation performance is achievable with a new type of isolation system.  The innovation is to develop a passive vibration isolator that provides low-frequency axial isolation without the attendant low-frequency ?rocking? or lateral modes.  In other words, the ratio of axial stiffness to rocking stiffness would be very high compared to that of a conventional isolation system.  This is desirable because for whole-satellite isolation, very low rocking modes can cause guidance instabilities and for component isolation, the rocking modes can increase optical jitter.  This isolation technology will be of great use in future NASA Earth Science platforms because it will provide dynamically stable structures utilizing integral vibration control.  Earth-sensing instruments will perform better with significant reduction in jitter due to the non-rocking isolation systems.  Similarly, NASA satellites will be better protected from launch loads with lower frequency whole-satellite non-rocking isolation systems.","Passive non-rocking vibration isolation systems have many potential NASA applications.  Similar to the potential commercial applications, these all have a common need for low-frequency axial vibration isolation systems that do not also produce low-frequency rocking modes.  A primary NASA application of this technology is the large assortment of sensors to be deployed on future satellites for either Earth Science or other space missions.  Most of these sensors will greatly benefit from operating in a reduced-jitter environment enabled by the use of passive non-rocking vibration isolation systems.  NASA satellite missions that mount their sensors using this new isolation technology will produce better scientific data.  Another large application area for NASA is to mount the entire satellite to the launch vehicle using a passive non-rocking whole-satellite vibration isolation system.  This will protect the entire satellite from launch loads and add margin to ensure mission success.","Passive non-rocking vibration isolation systems have many potential commercial applications.

This approach is well suited for any of the inter-spacecraft network configurations (star, ad hoc, or cluster).  HoIST is low-cost, lightweight, and fully field-corrected, and supports dynamic communications between orbiting spacecraft with data rates in excess of gigabits per second.  In Phase I, POC will develop a preliminary HoIST model to demonstrate its feasibility.  In Phase II, an advanced optimized prototype for point-to-multi-point communications will be developed.","POC's proposed HoIST will benefit many NASA applications that require secure high-speed transmission, high optical performance, low weight, compactness, simplicity, low cost, durability, environmental stability, and narrowband operation.  Immediate NASA applications include inter-spacecraft network communication configurations (star, ad-hoc, and cluster), and networks that connect systems monitoring weather patterns, climatic variation, evolution of the Earth and its atmosphere, measurements of dynamic scenes and natural hazards (tornados, lightning, etc.), lidar, and some airborne imaging and sensing applications.","Commercial applications include connection over the ""last mile,"" where fiber optic infrastructure is unavailable.  HoIST will securely and redundantly connect businesses to intranets, the Internet, and phone company carriers.  Other applications include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs).  Many benefits of HoIST will be in the medical field, for hospital-to-hospital communications, real-time patient monitoring, remote operations, surgical procedures and patient care, especially in developing countries with limited infrastructure and little access to health and medical practitioners."

The VACCO Micro Propulsion System (MPS) represents a leap forward in the application of ChEMS? (metal MEMS) propulsion technology for nanosat and picosat missions, however its capability is limited by reliance on low-Isp, low-density butane propellant. AeroAstro proposes to more than triple the performance of MPS by upgrading it to incorporate decomposing nitrous oxide (N2O) technology. This increase in total impulse of MPS from 33 N-s to over 100 N-s is made possible by a combination of factors including, the liquid density of N2O being approximately double that of butane, allowing twice as much propellant to be stored within the MPS volume, and the exothermal decomposition of N2O produces a hot gas with an Isp that is over two times that of cold butane. By applying AeroAstro?s nitrous oxide technology to VACCO?s MPS, it is possible to triple its performance (200% increase in delivered ∆V/unit mass) providing an enabling technology for nano-spacecraft by allowing them to perform orbit modification and formation flying that is far beyond the current norm.","A high-performance and modular small-scale propulsion system can be very effectively incorporated on NASA science missions. Examples of this might include distributed constellation of magnetospheric sensing satellites, such as MagCon, formation flying missions, such as a distributed synthetic aperture interferometer, and as a platform for any instrument package that requires precise pointing requirements (such as PIMI, TechSat-21, and ST-5).","Both AFRL and DARPA have identified applications for small, highly maneuverable spacecraft that fit with AeroAstro?s Escort mission framework. Escort is a small maneuverable satellite that can be used to monitor, inspect, or service a larger host satellite.  Typical DoD Escort missions applications include the ability to monitor a friendly target satellite?s environment in order to detect attacks, to actively defend a friendly target satellite against attacks by enemy satellites, to inspect a friendly target satellite in order to aid its deployment, monitor its performance and investigate any anomalies it may experience and to attack an enemy target satellite in order to temporarily or permanently disable it, possibly in a stealthy fashion. Commercial versions of the ESCORT satellite can be used to monitor high-value geosynchronous communications satellites for anomalies, assist in on-orbit testing of the communications payload, with the assistance of a tunable RF-probe, and provide imagery for marketing purposes."

As the platform undergoes attitude changes in flight (yaw, pitch, roll), the line of sight moves around and the collected imagery suffers from geometrical distortions.  This affects every instrument built and operated that is subject to atmospheric disturbances.  The distorted images can not be well geo-registered for incorporation into a GIS data base.  Available solutions are (i) software correction to the images based on flight attitude data collected using a strap down gyro system, or (ii) mounting the sensor on a stabilized platform.  The former is a difficult and unreliable process, while the latter is a very expensive solution, impractical with many small air crafts.  Examples for the former include the AVIRIS low altitude flights that require a significant effort after which the data are still not completely registered.OKSI proposes a much less expensive solution in which the sensor is strapped to the aircraft but to compensate for the aircraft motion the sensor line of sight is continuously stirred, using a closed loop control system.  Since the mass to be controlled is very low, the actuation and control system will be simple and relatively inexpensive.  Such line of sight stabilizer can be adapted to other hyperspectral sensors with a relative small effort.","With the proposed solution, NASA's airborne instruments can be better stabilized at a lower cost to improve overall image quality and eliminate complex data processing steps.","To fulfill the promise of hyperspectral imaging in various remote sensing applications, data must be compatible with GIS applications.

The spaceport of the future may resemble, from an operational perspective, our current airports and seaports of today and will need to resolve many similar issues to these transportation hubs. These issues include (1) safe and secure spaceport operations, (2) efficient movement of machinery and people through the spaceport, and (3) cost-efficient, affordable, and timely spaceport operations.  Discrete event simulation has been used to assess detailed processes at modern day seaports. Like seaports, spaceport operations are labor intensive and require extensive use of personnel and machinery. The ability to conduct seaport operations efficiently has been improved significantly through proper utilization of seaport assets. This foundation provides a solid footing from which research for efficient spaceport operations can be based. An object-oriented discrete event simulation system is proposed that will address spaceport operations in the context of aerospace safety, mobility, and efficiency. The simulation system will be built upon the Java programming language to provide for maximum portability and will utilize XML for standards-based data interchange. Development of the simulation model will provide the underlying basis for follow-on activities such as 2D and 3D animation and visualization capabilities. Technology transfer of lessons learned in the development of seaport simulation models will be utilized. The overall goal of the spaceport simulation model is to maximize throughput, operational safety, and resource utilization and minimize overall cost of operations.","The results of the Phase I and Phase II research activities will be a powerful, flexible, object-oriented discrete event simulation system for spaceport operations. The simulation model will provide spaceport planners with the necessary tools to conduct ?what-if? scenarios to facilitate decision-making and to improve throughput, minimize operational bottlenecks and delays, and maximize resource utilization.","The potential commercial applications for the SPACESIM model are limitless. As the spaceport industry is commercialized and our society accepts space transportation as a common mode of transportation, SPACESIM will be able to be used at spaceports worldwide to ensure that operations are conducted in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, the SPACESIM model has potential integration possibilities with other transportation simulations to provide macro level ?end-to-end? simulations of an entire transportation grid including all modes of transportation. The benefits to society are that cost will be driven down over time to the point that space transportation is affordable to the overall at-large population."

One example of this necessary tradeoff is the design of the rectangular cold volume enclosures. The solution will have to be thin walled to maximize usable volume, an excellent thermal insulator, low density, and low cost. An effective and lightweight approach has been developed using Aspen Aerogels, Inc?s nanostructured aerogel materials. AAI?s patent pending, composite aerogels are a new class of extremely low density materials that offer highly unusual design, mechanical and thermal properties. The combination of nanometer scale pore structure and very low density appear be ideally suited for thermal insulation in weight sensitive applications such as spacecraft. The flexibility of the materials will enable enclosure designers to minimize and in some cases eliminate seam leakage. The resulting AAI aerogel product would have a lower density, cost, thermal conductivity, and therefore energy usage compared to current SOA solutions. Other design possibilities are discussed that may further minimize the energy usage of the cold volume enclosure.","In addition to the benefits to NASA, thermal insulation data for aerogel materials will have been developed to better characterize how these unique materials perform to mitigate thermal exposure. This information will lead to a better understanding of aerogels and how to optimize thermal enclosures for optimum protection, versatility, energy usage, and weight. Large commercial markets for these intelligent designs and materials are waiting to be served. This includes military and civilian aircraft, water heaters, commercial and residential white goods (refrigerators, dish washers, freezers, etc.), and piping insulation.","Practical and effective design concepts suitable for insulation of spacecraft cold volume enclosures will have been developed and documented. Such thermal insulation designs shall be suitable not only for next generation space structures, but also for other existing space vehicles where cold storage is needed ? anywhere where cold (or warm) storage is needed. This system is relevant for NASA research aircraft, spacecraft like the Shuttle, and space structures like the International Space Station. The developed materials could be used in terrestrial applications such as large cold rooms, cryogenic pipe overwrap, and Dewar insulation."

Recently, Aspen Aerogels developed a new class of flexible aerogels called ""Ultra-lightweight &hard cellulose aerogel"". The new aerogel is 100 times stronger and harder than regular aerogel and has density and thermal characteristics as silica aerogel (low thermal conductivity ~ 12.8 mW/m.K  and low density ~ 0.04 - 0.09 g/cc). The originality of this concept is based on the low cost fabrication, the lightweight, the flexibility, and the high thermal performance of the innovative material. Moreover, our new high temperature insulation version based carbide aerogels demonstrated unparalleled high temperature oxidation resistance under oxyacelylene torch test. Aspen proposes to use these two classes of aerogels in a multilayered sandwich configuration to insulate cryogenic tanks and protect the spacecraft structure. We believe that the application of the proposed integrated TPS/Cryogenic insulation concept will satisfy all requirements to be used in cryogenic tanks and will greatly reduce the weight of the propellant tanks and the boil-off rate of the propellant (thus reduce the size of the tanks).","Successful completion of this project will lead to widespread use of cellulose aerogel insulation in cryogenic and medium temperature applications: cryogenic storage, refrigeration/freezer/cryogenic preservation systems,  feedlines and space suits.  Aspen Aerogels strongly believe that this new aerogel material, which has a very low cost of fabrication compare to silica aerogel, is one of the promising insulation materials for the next generation of spacecraft. Also, NASA has shown a particular interest in Aspen's carbide aerogels. The carbide aerogels are considered to be a good candidate for TPS application.","Ultra-lightweight cellulose and carbide aerogels will find a large number of commercial applications from the aerospace industry, military applications to high energy physics and power generation. We also anticipate considerable interest for high temperature furnace and incinerator application.

The closed-cycle cooling alternatives currently available for such applications are not well suited to their requirements. In many cases reliability is low and vibration high. In other cases coolers are too massive and inefficient. This proposal describes a two-stage pulse tube cooler (PTC) that combines a bootstrap staging configuration with an innovative second-stage regenerator design and a unique load-interface. The proposed cooler contains three innovative concepts that together will overcome the limitations of current cryocooler technologies: (1) the matrix for the second stage regenerator will be made from a newly-patented material having a heat capacity in excess of all other known materials, including lead (Pb), over a wide range of low temperatures (85K down to 15K), (2) the material for the second-stage regenerator will be formed into a novel matrix geometry, and (3) a unique load-interface will be an integral part of the cooler giving it the capability to cool distributed loads efficiently.  The proposed pulse tube will be lightweight, efficient, reliable, vibration free, and easy to integrate into cryogenic dewars.","Missions to Mars that involve the in-situ manufacture of propellant which will require the capability to store seed hydrogen for long periods of time. To accomplish this, a small lightweight cryocooler mounted on the storage vessel that is capable of sub-cooling the liquid, intercepting parasitic heat leaks, and re-liquefying hydrogen vapor will be required. The proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is ideally suited to such applications. For missions that will involve transportation or in-situ liquefaction of liquid cryogens such as hydrogen, neon, and oxygen, the proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is again ideally suited. The presence of two stages allows cooling at two temperatures. The proposed cooler is easily modified to liquefy both hydrogen and neon at the low temperature stage, and oxygen, for example, at the higher temperature stage. To improve the ultimate signal to noise ratio obtainable from cryogenic IR focal plane arrays (FPA), it is desirable to have on-focal plane, high-resolution, analog-to-digital (A/D) data converters. Such A/D converters, based on the Josephson effect, together with supporting technology, are currently in various stages of development. The proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is ideally suited to these applications as well.","There are a number of commercial applications. A partial list includes:  ?Superconducting electronics ?Superconducting magnets for MRI systems ?Superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage ?SQUID magnetometers for heart and brain studies ?HTS filters for the communication industry  ?Liquefaction of industrial gases ?Cryopumps for semiconductor manufacturing  ?Radio astronomy  As an example, a market of about $100 million/year currently exists for G-M cooler-based cryopumps for sputtering systems used in the semiconductor industry.  Sputtering systems normally have several cryopumps per unit with each cryopump costing $20-25,000.  The more reliable PTC package will cost about the same as current G-M units and will be less expensive to maintain due to the lack of oil and rubbing surfaces."

Due to seal problems with the current LOX loading pumps, the main focus of the Phase I effort will involve design and development of an innovative sealing solution that does not use a failure prone mechanical seal.  The seal solution proposed is a combination of a labyrinth seal with N2 buffer gas and pump out vanes on the backside of the pump impeller. This will provide a positive seal with no oxygen leak and have no wearing parts.  In addition to this simple and reliable sealing arrangement, other crucial components will be designed for the pump to have the highest reliability and performance.  One specific area will be minimization of heat leak from the motor and bearings to the LOX.  This will reduce the LOX boil-off that must be vented during loading.  Finally, a redundant parallel pumping system will be developed to ensure the highest reliability during vehicle loading at NASA","The new seal design can be immediately applied to retrofit existing LOX loading pumps.  The new pump design concept can fill new requirements for all NASA LOX pumping applications for ground use.  In addition to the LOX loading applications, the proposed pump with innovative seal could be used for the hydrogen loading pumps as well.  The buffer gas will need to be changed to helium since it will not liquefy at liquid hydrogen temperatures and will vent off as the nitrogen gas does with oxygen.  The only down side here is that helium is more expensive than nitrogen, but the flow will be small and pales in comparison to the boiled-off hydrogen that is vented during loading.","Outside of NASA, a big market would exist in LNG transfer and ship offloading.  Some of these LNG pumps can be very large.  Many of these large pumps are typically submersible pumps, which have a large amount of power lost as windage in the motor (due to presence of liquid).   This overhung pump with non-contacting seal would not have LNG in the motor and bearings and thus would not have these losses.  The bearings could also be lubricated with grease and thus would last longer.  Nitrogen could be used as a buffer gas for this application as it will remain a gas at LNG temperatures.  The LNG pump market is already big and is growing.  This pump would compete well against the alternatives and have great opportunities in this market."

These waste gas streams are typically generated from operations where helium purging of hydrogen storage or propellant equipment is performed.  As a result of these operations, helium contaminated with hydrogen, nitrogen, and small amounts of air is vented to the atmosphere where it is not recoverable in a practical or economic manner.  The system proposed in this investigation will recover helium and possibly hydrogen from these waste gas streams and purify it to a level where it can be recycled for practical usage.  Cryogenic processes as well as other gas separation techniques will be incorporated into a complete integrated system to accomplish this gas recovery.  The Phase I effort is intended to define and analyze a gas recovery system that will be practical for helium recovery in both commercial and NASA related programs where helium is routinely used and vented in significant quantities.  The purpose of the investigation is to provide sufficient process information for the design of large scale hydrogen and helium recovery system.","Since almost all of NASA?s launch and other propellant related test operations use helium and hydrogen, this system would be capable of recovering these valuable gases to the point that they could be separated and recycled for the next operation.  Since some propellant densification operations will exhaust waste streams comprised of helium and hydrogen, this gas separation system would be a major economic benefit in these operations.  The use of this gas recovery system operating in conjunction with the NASA?s gas usage operations could result in substantial cost savings that is realized over a relatively short period of time.",Companies that develop and test hydrogen fueled rocket engines at large testing complexes have large quantities of cryogenic storage and other volumes that require helium as a purge gas or pressurizing gas for the high pressure liquid hydrogen propellant supply vessels.  The helium gas used in these applications becomes mixed with hydrogen and possibly other gases and is typically expelled as waste gas to atmosphere after use.  The proposed system would be capable of capturing and separating the helium and hydrogen from waste gas streams instead of venting these two gases to atmosphere.  Substantial cost saving could be realized by recycling these expensive gases in the test facility instead of buying additional helium.

Microspheres perform over 1.6 times better than perlite, approach multilayer insulation (MLI) performance under proper vacuum, and limit heat leak to the level of foam insulation if vacuum is completely lost. They perform as well or better than any of the above insulation materials in a soft vacuum condition. This means less vacuum maintenance to be performed. Transfer line and dewar test articles will be manufactured to address microsphere containment and compaction issues. Microspheres can be used to insulate areas that have complicated geometry; require intermittent access, such as around instrumentation and piping components; or for applications that require formability and minimal weight. The innovations are applicable for high efficiency storage, handling, and distribution systems for spaceport cryogenic facilities, reusable launch vehicles, and the transport and storage of cryogenic propellants on Mars.","NASA/KSC has identified several insulation applications that are directly related to efficient storage and transfer of cryogenic propellants on earth and in space. Thermally-efficient, low-cost improvements are needed for the existing LC-39 cryogenic loading systems.

Vacuum-jacketing does not exist on many liquid transfer and vent lines. Even liquid hydrogen lines are unjacketed in localized areas. Vent lines are frequently bare, which presents safety hazards including the formation of enriched oxygen. Other lines are foam-insulated, which degrades starting with the first thermal cycle and is lost after 3-5 years of operation. In addition to safety issues, the poor or non-existing insulation presents substantial economic losses from both the steady state heat load and cool-down losses.","The transport, distribution, and storage of liquefied gases requires an effective insulation system to minimize boil-off rates and the energy required for the reliquefying plants as low as possible. New insulation options are needed that are durable, efficient, and low cost. The primary commercial applications include transfer lines and storage vessels for medical, industrial gas air separation, liquefied natural gas, semi-conductor, and food-freezing industries.  The aerospace instry utilizes commercial insulated systems for aircraft and space applications, which need advanced insulations in some cases that are capable of covering the temperature range from helium storage to space reentry temperatures.

The sensitivity and utility of the TOF is now principally limited by the saturation of the Micro-channel-plate detector, which can handle only a few million counts per second. An approach to overcome this limitation using a new type of data system in conjunction with a combined microchannelplate/discreet ion multiplier is the subject of this phase I.

Performance would be improved by increasing measurement dynamic range. The operating life of the instrument would be increased through simplification of the ion detector; and operational simplification would be achieved by reducing the amount of control electronics needed.  The smaller form-factor of the data system would simplify mass-spectrometer use in a non-laboratory environment.","The proposed hybrid data system and ion detector would be well suited for commercial mass-spectrometry instruments requiring both sensitivity to single ions and wide dynamic range for processing high ion flux mass peaks without distortion.

A key requirement for these challenging missions will be the development of high efficiency power conversion systems with increased power density. Ecotera Energy proposes an innovative gas turbine improvement, the Thermochemical Energy Conversion (TEC) engine, which has important advantages for space missions over alternatives. TEC engines use a closed?cycle gas turbine and the unique feature of an active working fluid that reversibly dissociates creating greater expansion through the turbine and recombining prior to compression during each cycle. This results in a reduction in the fraction of turbine power required to turn the compressor and an increase in the heat transfer coefficient compared to recuperators with non-dissociating working fluids. For NASA, these features mean increased energy efficiency (over 45%) and higher power density (500 w/Kg) than existing systems in the same power range, which will reduce mass allocations for electricity generation on space missions. Other advantages of TEC include: easy scaling from a few kWe to MWe; operation with any thermal energy source including methane, hydrogen, solar thermal, and reactor waste heat; enhanced heat rejection; and quiet, hermetically sealed operation.","Systems incorporating the TEC engine would support advancements in NASA?s Space Solar Power and Dynamic Solar Power Programs, and Brayton and Stirling Space Nuclear Power Systems.  The advanced heat rejection design, high power density, and quiet operation are additional benefits of TEC power supplies on spacecraft as well as for satellite and science station power sources and space auxiliary power systems.  TEC technology could also be configured to provide power for aircraft propulsion.   A complete TEC system could integrate multiple technologies such as oil-free turbomachinery, high speed turbo alternators, and Brayton and Stirling power conversion systems.","Engines based on the TEC concept will have superior thermal efficiency and power density to alternative energy converters in the range of a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts. The TEC engine is suitable for use as a solar thermal energy converter, biofuel/biomass converter, industrial waste heat recovery systems, and remote power services using indigenous fuels. Cross-cutting applications include commercial aircraft auxiliary power units, turbofan engines, combined cooling, heat and power systems, hybrid electric vehicle power systems, distributed generation, village power and man-portable power units.

Liquid monopropellants are often used in propulsion systems where simplicity of design, restartable/control on demand, and repeatability is desired.  Unfortunately, many monopropellants are toxic and dangerous, ruling them out for EMU thruster application. Thus, EMU thrusters have relied upon cold gaseous nitrogen, which offers very low specific impulse and propellant mass fraction. A NOPS, however, uses nitrous oxide, a readily available safe and storable propellant which is not toxic, has performance comparable to hydrazine, and does not decompose spontaneously like hydrogen peroxide.  Furthermore, Pioneer Astronautics has demonstrated a system that decomposes N2O into a breathable mix of oxygen and nitrogen.  Thus, for example, an EMU propelled by a NOPS would provide an astronaut with a large emergency backup supply of oxygen.  Such a dual use system could also have great utility as the propulsion system for manned spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle, where safety is paramount and breathing gas reserves are desired.  Replacing current liquid monopropellant thrusters with NOPS would greatly reduce ground processing time and costs, while providing comparable performance.","The NOPS propulsion system concept, due to its inherent safety, is an attractive propulsion system for a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) or SAFER system, as the N2O monopropellant greatly out performs cold N2 thrusters used on current MMUs in both specific impulse and propellant storability, because its 5 times as dense at ? the pressure as compressed N2.  In addition, Pioneer Astronautics has also demonstrated that N2O can be decomposed into a breathable mixture of N2 and O2, offering the potential for a combined spacesuit breathing/MMU propulsion system, with greatly increased endurance and mobility compared to current systems.  If manned spacecraft were to use a NOPS it would allow the propellant aboard the Space Station or interplanetary spacecraft to be used as a backup to the life support system. Transporting air reserves to the Space Station as N2O would significantly reduce logistics costs by drastically cutting transport tankage mass.","The Nitrous Oxide Propulsion System has the potential of promoting use of liquid monopropellant rockets.  Currently, the difficulty and cost in safely handling and storing conventional liquid monopropellants has hindered their use.  The NOPS would not have these limitations. Hydrazine is commonly used as a monopropellant in attitude control thrusters in spacecraft.  Unfortunately, hydrazine is extremely toxic.  NOPSs, however, use a benign monopropellant, and so much less care and expense is necessary. NOPSs would be much more profitable and attractive to use than current common monopropellant rockets systems, and should be able to dominate the market for liquid monopropellant propulsion systems, such as are used in attitude control of spacecraft.  Currently, some 1000 satellites are planned for launch in the next 10 years, and all will need attitude control systems. These satellites and their necessary replacements thus guarantee the NOPS a large and highly lucrative commercial market."

The components of a hybrid power system can be made lightweight at low cost, making it ideally suited for NASA and other aerospace applications.","Lynntech is heavily committed to developing hybrid power supplies utilizing Monopolar? fuel cells for portable electronics for both the government and commercially. With worldwide sales of portable electronics power packs at 620 million units in 2002 and projections approaching 1 billion units by 2007, Lynntech is receiving interest from industry and will pursue licensing opportunities in this market. With the move to wireless capability, portable electronics have dramatically increased power consumption and reduced battery operation time. Rechargeable batteries such as lithium ion can not keep up with the power demands of mobile phones, PDAs, or notebook computers."

This capability directly supports automated rendezvous and docking missions in Earth orbit as well as at other solar system bodies, such as Mars.  The navigation solution depends only on measurements of the distance to the center of the central body, determined by measuring its angular diameter, and the direction to the center of the body in inertial space.  These measurements are made by imaging the planetary disk, determining its centroid and angular diameter, and simultaneously imaging the star background.  Relative navigation between chaser and target spacecraft is achieved via intersatellite communication of each individual vehicle?s absolute navigation solution. Microcosm offers substantial experience in autonomous space navigation, including our development of an optical autonomous navigation system for the Air Force, which was flown on the TAOS spacecraft in 1994.  Microcosm is also involved in ongoing work through the USAF to develop an autonomous rendezvous and docking capability for on-orbit servicing of Earth orbiters.","This technology is applicable for autonomous spacecraft navigation for Earth orbiters or orbiters about any other solar system body.  Mars mission orbiters would be direct beneficiaries of such a technology.  Rendezvous and docking applications in Earth orbit or in orbit about other planets would also benefit.  Relative navigation could be achieved with communication of the real-time absolute navigation information between two vehicles.  Close formations could also make use of the relative navigation information.  Distributed constellations of satellites could save on operations costs substantially, eliminating the need for ground-based orbit determination for all satellites in the constellation.","Non-NASA applications for this autonomous navigation system would be communications satellites, like GEO satellites.  They could reduce ground operations costs substantially by eliminating the need for ground tracking.  Implementing autonomous navigation on GEO satellites would also enable the application of autonomous stationkeeping maneuvers as well, since the spacecraft would now be able to determine its own drift, it could also enact autonomous orbit control to maintain the desired orbital position.  Ground commanding would not be necessary to stationkeep the satellite."

The control system will use different algorithms at different ranges from the rendezvous target. Rendezvous maneuvers are achieved using a Lambert planner with genetic algorithm optimization for large orbit changes and using a Simplex planner with path constraints for maneuvers at close range to the target. Orbit determination is achieved using a continuous discrete Kalman filter which uses different sensors depending on their availability. For relative sensing, these are: radar for long range; vision for intermediate and close range; intersatellite-link (ISL) when available. For absolute sensing, these are GPS and ground ranging. The vision system, a single camera system developed by PSS or a selected existing system, will provide relative attitude in addition to relative position at intermediate range. PSS has the capability to perform high-fidelity simulations using MultiSatSim, allowing this project to move quickly into software testing. ObjectAgent is an inherently modular software architecture, allowing the resulting control system to be easily adapted, even on-orbit.","NASA spacecraft, being very valuable, are particularly suited to autnomous rendezvous applications. Expensive spacecraft such as Hubble could prolong their useful life with on-orbit refueling. Inspection capability can help diagnose problems with malfunctioning spacecraft. In general, autonomous maneuver planning such as used in PSS' rendezvous control system saves money by reducing operations costs.","Autonomous rendezvous capability is required for satellite inspection and servicing. PSS has previously conducted economical analysis which indicates refueling satellites can be profitable in some cases. Additionally, elements of the rendezvous control system may be applied to more general problems in formation flying. An autonomous systems are key to keeping the costs of such complex systems in check. Commercial interest in these applications is widespread internationally judging from interest in PSS' new autonomous guidance, navigation and control toolbox module for MATLAB."

The combination of these technologies will provide SiC optics with state-of-the-art surface figures (low frequency and mid-frequency errors will both be addressed) and low-scatter surface finishes.  SiC optics offer a number of critical advantages for space-based optical systems.  The superior material properties of SiC provide a high degree of lightweighting (70% - 90% of beryllium) and a superior thermal stability (1.5x ? 2.5x better than ULE).  The manufacturing process proposed will allow the technical advantages associated with SiC materials to be realized, providing the capability to produce imaging mirrors which are capable of providing excellent accuracies (<0.01 waves RMS), low micro-roughness (< 10 Angstroms RMS), and very low areal densities (~10 kg/m2 at an aperture of 1 meter) while maintaining the thermal stability required for space-based imaging applications.  The quality and micro-roughness of these optics will be good enough to address the stressing needs associated with visible, UV and EUV wavebands.  In our Phase I work the process development proposed will be verified by the production of a lightweighted SiC aspheric mirror to a set of stressing figure and finish requirements.","The proposed optical manufacturing process will address high precision, low-scatter, state-of-theart optical system requirements for NASA.

The LGC produces a lift gas from the cracking of methanol, an easily obtained, easily stored liquid, to make either the hydrogen/carbon monoxide cracking product or a hydrogen-enriched product by using membrane separation.  Combustion of about 10% of the methanol provides sufficient energy to crack the remainder.  The LGC product gas can be converted back into methanol, allowing a balloon to maintain altitude during the daytime without having to vent lift gas.  The methanol can then be converted back into lift gas at night to maintain altitude without dropping ballast.

The collecting mirrors for the proposed FIR/SMM missions are large.  The most difficult challenge will be the ~4K cryocooling of the entire telescope structure.  Given long duration of the missions, stored cryogens do not present an attractive option.  Hence, an active cryocooling system capable of removing 10-100mW at ~4K is absolutely essential for the mission success.  The cryocooling system must provide continuous operation and not cause significant vibrations of the optical components.  In addition, the cooling power will have to be distributed over large mirror surfaces.

The entire telescope including the mirrors need to be cooled to ~4K to minimize background noise.  The cryocooling system must be light in weight, integrate easily into the telescope, and not cause significant vibrations to the optical components.  Furthermore, it will likely have to be flexible and deployable.  The He-LHP will meet all aforementioned requirements offering a robust passive ~4K cryocooling transport over large areas.","With a simple design and proven fabrication techniques, the large area LHP cooling loop is probably more adapted to the electronic cooling applications.  In this case, it uses working fluids like water, methanol, or butane to transport and spread out the electronics waste heat over a larger area.  Small diameter transport lines can be embedded in or even etched onto a Silicon wafer to form an integrated micro-chip and cooling system.  A few examples of its potential usage are: heat spreaders for solid state transistors with medium to moderately high heat fluxes (20-50W/cm2) and heat transport devices embedded in printed circuit boards."

To achieve the large apertures, standard telescope designs containing heavy optical components that are time consuming and expensive to fabricate are obsolete.  The current thrust is the use of polymer membranes and PVDF piezoelectric films that offer the potential to build mirrors in excess of 10m with areal densities below 1-kg/m2. However, these programs offer a challenge to design, materials and optical engineers to achieve a mirror that holds the optical surface within the required tolerances.  The membrane approach is subject to thermally induced distortions, does not provide the necessary in-plane stiffness to mitigate distortions, and still requires wires/cables for actuator addressing.  Xinetics proposes the Lightweight Active Nanolaminate Mirror with E-beam Shape Control.  The thick-film nanolaminate has a greater in-plane stiffness than the polymer membranes and thus can maintain greater optical tolerances.  The active discrete actuator laminate will be driven by an e-beam flux; thus making it wireless.  This technology will enable a new class of optical structures for space that are lightweight, dimensionally stable, resistant to space environmental effects, inexpensive and rapidly manufactured.","The proposed large active mirror technology is potentially the most innovative single advance that the space telescope community has seen since its inception in the early seventies.

This technology will reduce the mirror weight while still providing low scatter, diffraction limited imaging in a space environment.","From the proposed technology, two routes to commercialization will be pursued.  The first is the wireless micropositioners and the second is light weight optical systems.  The wireless micropositioners can be used when lightweight or restricted spaces are necessary.  Since the wires and power electronic are unnecessary, no space is required to house them.  The wireless actuators can be also used to control the optical surface on large aperture lightweight mirrors for surveillance telescopes enabling large diameter apertures reaching 100m.

Gossamer optics can meet this challenge of affordable, large, lightweight optics.  However, due to the difficulties inherent in deploying large scale, thin optics, Gossamer optical systems will require significant technological advances in active wavefront correction.  A breakthrough in density, complexity reduction, reliability, and reduced cost per actuator is required for Gossamer systems corrected with adaptive optics.  The revolutionary Adaptive Tertiary concept proposed here involves the use of modules, single units of active ceramic with integral electrodes that contain an array of actuator posts with spacings ranging from 1mm to 5mm.  The segmented deformable mirror, with up to 349 mirror actuators at 2.5mm spacing in each hexagonal segment, will allow not only the individual correction of errors in any section of the primary optic, but potentially allows a simpler, lighter and less expensive primary to be employed.","The Adaptive Tertiary mirror would allow the correction of wavefront errors in Gossamer optics, which are critical to the development of 100 meter and larger diameter telescopes in space.  The adaptive tertiary potentially alleviates some of the tight manufacturing, assembly, and deployment tolerances that are anticipated in working with ultralightweight optics, reducing the complexity of the system and therefore the risk and cost.  The adaptive tertiary concept can be applied whether the primary mirror is segmented, as in the case with NGST, or the more typical vision of a continuous gossamer membrane.  Each segment of the adaptive tertiary, with independent tip-tilt functionality, can correct both the large errors anticipated during deployment, or the higher spatial frequency errors compensated in a conventional deformable mirror.","In addition to the benefits of hexagonal modules for Gossamer optic system wavefront correction, a segmented deformable mirror would have applications in high energy laser beam cleanup and propagation.  The hexagonal array spacing also offers several advantages in conventional adaptive optics applications.  The hexagonal packing provides a higher actuator density in a given aperture size and access to influence functions that are not possible with square arrays.  Other applications would be in the ophthalmic area.  High density mirror arrays could be installed on Fundus cameras to aid ophthalmologists in diagnosing retinal disease and other problems which can be diagnosed through the study of the capillary structure in the eye.

In addition, by altering the composition of the materials, the wavelength regime can be tuned. The bandwidth can be increased by introducing a pitch gradient throughout the film thickness.  The proposed technology will directly address NASA's requirement for novel optical coatings for use in the EUV, UV, visible, IR and far IR for filters, beamsplitters, polarizers and reflectors. Subtopic S2.05 calls for broadband polarizing beamsplitters, which this proposal specifically addresses.","The primary application for the chiral liquid crystal polymer films discussed in this proposal is broadband beamsplitting. The ability to split an incident beam into right- and left-circularly polarized beams (or S-and P-polarized beams) could, therefore, be utilized anywhere where polarization preservation is needed or desired, such as polarizing beamsplitters for shared-aperture laser radar applications. The unique ability to make CLCP membranes opens up the possibility of utilizing such reflectors for lightweight, space-based mirrors. By integrating two membranes of opposite handedness, a high-performance reflector can be fabricated that reflects in excess of 95% of the incident light. Because the materials are polymerized, they possess an inherent structural integrity and a slight degree of shape memory characteristic of polymeric materials. Additionally, with such high reflectivities over a broad wavelength range, it is conceivable that the reflectors could utilized as a lightweight propulsion sail.","The technology presented in this proposal has many applications in the field of optics. The reflective films could be utilized as reflectors for imaging applications, such as HMD visor coatings. The films also have applications in such areas as communications systems and liquid crystal projectors. By integrating two films integrated together, high-performance filters could be fabricated for laser eye protection as well as filters for delicate, high-cost optical devices, such as infrared detectors. In addition, the films are conformable to complex surfaces. Therefore, they could be laminated onto optical surfaces and used as polarized coatings or filters."

The concept for EXIST relies on an X-ray telescope imaging the entire sky each 95 min orbit.  The core of the X-ray imaging telescope comprises approximately 8 square meters of pixilated Cd-Zn-Te (CZT) detectors, a technical feat never before attempted. This enormous array requires development of a new packaging technology for CZT detector arrays, one that allows detectors to be abutted together into large arrays of CZT tiles, with minimal dead space in between detectors.  Also required is a technology that can produce these detectors with a high interconnection yield, not currently achieved with indium bump technologies. We propose an innovative technique to assemble CZT X-ray sensors avoiding conventional direct indium bump hybridization used today.  The novel scheme incorporates commercial off-the-shelf flip-chip and multichip module technologies, combined with new flip-chip bonding materials and proprietary processes developed at Aguila under previous NASA sponsorship.  This will result in novel detector modules containing fully-integrated readout electronics that can be implemented into a large-array motherboard.","Lack of access to good packaging technology is hindering NASA's ability to develop large area CZT focal plane detectors for hard x-ray missions on balloons and in space such as InFOCuS, Constellation-X, EXIST and HSI. The ideas presented here may also be solutions to the array hybridization challenges for cryogenic arrays with calorimeters and bolometers which have been proposed for Constellation-X and various sub-mm and IR instruments.","The commercial market for CZT pixel detectors is in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, anti-terrorism and industrial processing. Once the CZT material technology improves to where large area arrays are readily producible, the market for using this technology will offer many opportunities. Furthermore, there is a great need for high interconnect densities in flip chip electronic assemblies with many applications in automotive products and wireless communications."

This method employs a microwave source, in the range of 90 to 120 GHz, to assist the photoionization process by pumping the infrared-generated electrons from the excited states to the continuum.  Since the microwave photons are low in energy, they are not available to directly ionize the ground state of the shallow donors.  Therefore, the microwave pumping process is not expected to generate additional leakage current and the associated noise.  This will allow us to cool the detector as low as necessary to reduce the thermal leakage current and improve the detector's noise performance.  The proposed concept is not limited to GaAs and may be applied in a broader scope.  Since the excited state response of a photoconductor lies at lower frequencies (longer wavelengths), an important use of this method would be to extend the detector's long-wavelength response.

This instrument will incorporate a number of novel features that advance the current technology.  The modifications and improvements to the former design will provide the required analytical and space-flight capabilities to serve as the basis for a miniature space-capable instrument.  Phase II will entail the evaluation of the Mini-Cell IMS in conjunction with MEMS GC and the possible further miniaturization and production engineering of delivered instrumentation.  Potential commercial applications are for the manufacture of hand-held detectors for explosives or illegal narcotics.","NASA applications are as described in this proposal for a chemical detector which, when mated to a miniature GC, can provide the detection and confirmation of identity of chemicals eluting from the GC.  The low weight and consumables usage of the Mini-Cell IMS make the use of this instrument practicable for the contemplated future missions to explore the atmospheres and gaseous contents of moons, comets, and planets including the proposed balloon rover missions. Another potential NASA application is for an IMS to replace the IMS currently used to monitor the crew environment on the space shuttle.  The current system is bulky, and the replacement of it with something smaller sized is being investigated.  The americium source could also be an advantage here because the device could be advertised as no more hazardous than a common commercial smoke detector.","The greatest potential commercial application for the Mini-Cell IMS is for the manufacture of hand-held detectors for explosives or illegal narcotics.  The Mini-Cell design concept should be scalable to mass production techniques which will drastically lower the cost of production versus the standard IMS while still providing the high sensitivity required for the demanding explosives or drugs detection applications,  Using a non-regulated ionization source, such as the Am-241, makes the Mini-Cell IMS much more widely available.  Other commercial applications would be in the detection of trace chemicals in the semiconductor industry.  Here there also exists a need for sophisticated instrumentation with very low, and always becoming lower, detection limits for a variety of chemicals deleterious for the production environment.  Having a non-regulated source would also be very well received in this application."

The intent is to keep the design SIMPLE. It is the express intent of the design process for this program to focus on maintaining a minimum number of moving parts.  The core barrel is specially designed to cut the core hole, transmit fines to a compartment in its topmost section, capture the core and serve as a bailing bucket for removal to the surface. A cam based anchor system is used to maintain reaction force down-hole, and a screw ram is used for creating weight on bit. Total system mass for a 200 m depth system is expected to be on the order of  40 kg, requiring 200-300 watt-hrs of power per meter advance in most rock formations.","The search for water on Mars is a high priority for NASA.  Spacecraft weight would be excessive to practically take all of the fuel necessary for a round trip manned mission to Mars, but indigenous water can make manned missions to mars feasible as a key ingredient in the production of fuel for return flights. The discovery of water in quantity on Mars can make habitation of Mars for extended scientific missions feasible and potentially provide a remote launching point for exploration further from earth.  Finally, the discovery of water can have tremendous input to the scientific understanding of our solar system. Deep drilling may be the only practical way of taping significant reservoirs of water.","UTD Incorporated is a known corporate innovator in the world of drilling technology. Any sustained research conducted by UTD in the drilling arena ultimately serves to increase our commercial value in this arena. Products typically spin off or suggest alternative ways to solve old problems. Examples in our corporate history abound, specialized position location tools developed by UTD have found their way out of a specialized field and into several commercial markets as one example. While tethered drilling on earth offers only small benefits at this time, such as reduced footprint for deep core drilling that may need to be conducted in a congested urban environment, new requirements are constantly being generated and a healthy balance of basic and applied research ultimately provides benefit."

Stereo vision is a critical component for these rovers and is such a computationally intensive task that it places a severe computational burden on the system processor -  severely limiting the rover?s overall traverse speed. Mosaix proposes to develop low-power, compact, high resolution, and high performance hardware to handle all stereo vision related tasks -  thereby and enabling the robotic vehicle to simultaneously move across the terrain whilst at the same time computing disparity information in real-time and updating trajectory maps.","It is widely accepted that stereo vision will play an important role in the automotive industry?s plans for ?intelligent? highways and ?smart? cars. Driven by the ever increasing vehicular congestion and consumer demand for safer vehicles, there is a growing consensus that collision avoidance systems are only a short way off. For robustness, these systems will be based on fusing stereo vision and laser range finder modalities to create a safe envelope around the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to safely and autonomously extricate itself from a potential crash. As such, there will soon exist a mass market for a high resolution, extremely fast, and cost effective stereo vision systems in the automotive industry."

NASA does not possess an analytical method that performs real-time, rapid, highly sensitive analysis of biological contamination on flight hardware. Currently, a majority of the microbiological contaminants identified as a concern in space are not easily monitored because of the need to perform time consuming, laboratory-based analysis.

Carbon fiber will be subjected to mild oxidation under oxygen so as to generate nano pores that will be subsequently filled by intermetallic materials SnSb using a sol-gel approach. The SnSb alloy in the porous carbon matrix is expected to be in the form of a nanofiber which is desirable for high rate capability and extended cycling. The carbon fiber will act not only as an electronic conductor but also as a cushion that will accommodate the volume changes during lithium intercalation and deintercalation. This composite anode when combined with a higher capacity cathode material LiCoxNiyAlzO2 should lead to energy density in excess of 230 Wh/Kg. These attributes of this proposed technology will definitely fulfill the battery requirements for space applications where cycle life of more than 30000 cycles for low earth orbit (LEO), high rate applications (> 4 kW/kg) and rapid charge/discharging (ten of seconds) and calendar life of more than 10 years for geosynchronous orbits (GEO) are needed.","NASA's applications extend to future Mars exploration missions, missions to outer planets such as Jupiter, Pluto (e.g. Europa Orbiter and Pluto Fly-by), planetary orbiters and the earth satellites, e.g LEO and GEO, and for on-board storage power sources of spacecrafts.","The markedly higher performance values (energy density, reliability, weight, power, safety) combined with a markedly lower cost per unit of performance will energize a commercial market to drive these batteries into every civiil use where batteries goes today. Commercial markets extend to portable electronics, power tools, electric vehicles, and wearable computers, among others. We have also identified markets in the medical sector such as coclear implants and spinal cord stimulators."

However, the performance of the current batteries including power/energy density and cycle life have fallen well below the theoretical marks mostly due to the poor electrochemical stability and low electrical and ionic conductivity of the current sulfur electrode materials.  TPL proposes to develop a novel S/polymer nanocomposite cathode material (NCM) that will significantly improve the performance of Li/S batteries in terms of power/energy density and cycle life. The superior properties of the proposed NCMs will be achieved via formation of the nanophases that facilitate interfacial contacts and improve electrochemical stabilities.  In Phase I, TPL will prepare the novel S/polymer nanocomposite electrodes via a solution approach. The NCMs will be structurally characterized and the nanocomposite electrodes will be electrochemically evaluated. The concept of the NCMs for S/Li batteries will be demonstrated.  TPL proposes to team with Sandia National Laboratories to demonstrate fabrication of the proposed nanocomposite cathodes. TPL and SNL have extensive experience in nanocomposite, and lithium battery chemistries. TPL's technical and management teams are well positioned to move this technology into the market.","Lithium batteries have applications for the Federal Government such as NASA  for the power systems in satellites, spacecraft, and probes.","Lithium batteries have extensive applications in commercial products including electric vehicles, radios, telephones, televisions, video cameras, computers, tools, and other consumer products."

Of the hypothesized solutions for these missions, thin-film solar cells are among those showing the most promise for attaining the required specific power rating  (> 1000 W/kg) and efficiency (> 20 percent).  Recent research has focused on the use of polymeric substrates such as polyimides due to their low density and availability in thin layers.  However, due to the thermal limitations of these materials, the desired specific power ratings and efficiencies have not been attained.  In response to this limitation Foster-Miller proposes to develop a specifically tailored high-temperature, high-mechanical strength polymeric substrate that can provide the required radiation resistance, low temperature/low intensity, and high temperature/high intensity performance. The Foster-Miller innovation will provide a thin polymeric substrate with high temperature capabilities suitable for fabricating high efficiency solar cells that can survive the rigorous demands of a space environment.  Our proposed thin film solar cell will be lightweight and flexible, and be tailored to provide the UV irradiation and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance, and emissivity to operate in a space environment.

Applications such as very large satellites and deep space craft will depend highly upon the availability of high-density lightweight power sources capable of surviving in a space environment.","Potential commercial systems that could benefit from this lightweight, compact and high density power source include solar power satellites, remote power generation and other terrestrial applications."

The NASA Ames Astrobiology Group is interested in studying these vents for the possible existence of a subsurface microbiological ecosystem, whose occurrence may be partially detected by measuring such isotope ratios.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate the ability to make all three of these ratio measurements in a single, multiplexed instrument using both simulated and actual hydrothermal gas samples.  Preliminary results suggest that our system can determine isotope ratios to better than 0.1%, which is sufficient to determine the presence of biological activity.  The Phase II effort will consist primarily of packaging the instrument for deep-sea environments and subsequent testing in conjunction with NASA.  The final Phase II prototype will be delivered to the NASA Ames Astrobiology Group.  This instrument will be the first remotely operable sensor capable of measuring isotope ratios with sufficient precision to indicate the presence of biological activity in deep-sea environments.","The characterization of deep-sea hydrothermal vents is of primary importance to the NASA Ames Astrobiology Group, because they provide a mechanism to sample the contents of the subsurface biosphere.  This biosphere represents one of the few anaerobic environments that is devoid of photosynthesis and may emulate the conditions beneath ice crusts on Europa, Callisto, and Mars.  One of the key indicators of such a Subsurface Lithotrophic Microbiological Ecosystem (SLiME) is a change in the carbon dioxide and methane isotope ratios.  Our instrument will permit in situ measurements of such ratios in deep-sea environments.","An accurate determination of isotope ratios in an inexpensive, portable device has significant commercial impact in medical diagnostics, the petroleum industry, and environmental monitoring.  Projected sales of the ratiometer in the former two areas alone are expected to exceed $65M over the next five years.  Moreover, the proposed prototype can be readily modified to monitor various industrial gases, further increasing its commercial impact.  Los Gatos Research is actively pursuing such commercial ventures and support through the SBIR Program would greatly bolster our efforts."

14-2 H13.02-9598,NNX14CL35P,Advanced Structural Health Monitoring,Passive Wireless Sensor System for Structural Health Monitoring,Albido Corporation,"19 Leaming Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80906 - 4209",(719) 502-1348,Alfred Gnadinger,alfred@albido.com,"19 Leaming Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80906 - 4209",(719) 337-4318,Viorel Olariu,volariu@gmail.com,"19 Leaming Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80906 - 4209",(719) 502-1348,3,6,"Albido proposes to develop a Passive Wireless Sensor System for Structural Health Monitoring capable of measuring high-bandwidth temperature and strain of space and aerospace vehicle components operating in extreme environments. The proposed system uses a network of true passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) temperature/strain sensors that can be interrogated wirelessly from a distance of several meters. SAW sensors are lightweight, passive (battery-less), simple, reliable, scalable, sensitive, do not disturb the operating environment, can be permanently placed on the critical components, allow quick and inexpensive acquisition of data to diagnose structure performance or failures, and transmit the relevant data to a remote data processing center wirelessly. A low cost software radio approach will be developed to overcome a strategic bottleneck in SAW sensor system development. In Phase I Albido demonstrated the proof-of-concept of the proposed sensor and the transmission capability in an adequate laboratory environment (TRL 3). Based on the successful results of Phase I, we will develop a product prototype in Phase II that will be validated in a relevant environment by comparison testing against conventional instrumentation on a test article indicated by NASA. At the end of Phase II, the sensor system will be at TRL 6.","The proposed technology allows sensors to be placed on critical aerospace and other components without disturbing the aerodynamic flow. That means they can be left in place and be used for monitoring the health and usage of the components in actual operation of the aerospace vehicles. The sensors are relatively inexpensive and a multitude of them can be used and monitored simultaneously. The technology is ubiquitous, that means it is applicable to a wide variety of components such as space launch vehicles, gas turbine and piston engine components, transmission parts, etc. The proposed wireless technology is easy to install and reconfigure, which makes it very adaptive to any specific application. Passive wireless SAW sensors have many Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) applications within NASA such as: continuous assessment, life of vehicle, thermal protection systems, accelerometers, harsh environment operation, radiation hard operation, ground and in-flight testing, space applications, structural health monitoring (SHM) of spacecraft and launch vehicles, aircrafts, Orbiter Wing Leading Edge Impact Detection System, impact sensors, NASA's ATP facilities, and many others. Of particular importance is to Maintain Vehicle Safety (MVS) between major inspections.","There are two major market segments for non-NASA applications: military and commercial. Since the proposed sensors are small, wireless, conformal, lightweight and suited for harsh environments, the main military application is for structural health monitoring in harsh environments such as measuring strain and temperature on turbine blades inside a jet engine in operation and also for other military systems such as helicopter blades, Army tanks (e.g. M1). In the commercial field Albido's sensors are attractive for structural health monitoring of commercial jet engines, power plant turbo generators, wind turbines and more. However, since Albido's sensors are also low cost, many consumer applications are attractive. For example, they can be placed on critical sections of fragile objects transported by truck. The truck driver can monitor in real time the structural health of his/her cargo. Parameters to be measured are, for example, temperature, strain, pressure, humidity, and location (identity) of the sensors. Automotive and construction industries can also benefit from this type of sensors. Such system can be also used to drastically reduce the cost of vehicle maintenance by performing Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). The estimated size of the combined military and commercial market available for Albido's products is about $4 billion per year.","Air Transportation & Safety; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Thermal",Advanced Structural Health Monitoring   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The loss of reliable information for even a single state feedback signal can initiate a chain of events that leads to an accident. On small aircraft, hardware redundancy is often impractical and the failure of a single physical sensor could be the triggering event that leads to an accident. On commercial transport aircraft sensor hardware redundancy is common, but the potential for common-mode failures means sensor failures are still an important consideration.  In many cases, there is adequate information available to accurately estimate the true value of a parameter even if the sensor or sensors that directly measure the parameter have failed.  In the best case, a human pilot can exploit the available information to successfully fly the vehicle after a sensor failure, but it is a high workload task.  In many cases, lack of situational awareness and poor manual piloting skills create a situation in which the human pilot cannot safely handle the failure.  Similarly, many automation systems are unable to safely cope with failures.  The proposed research will build on the successful phase one proof-of-concept demonstration to develop a virtual sensor redundancy system that identifies and isolates faulted sensors, and fuses information from healthy sensors and vehicle dynamics models (including arbitrary nonlinear models) to estimate correct outputs for faulted sensors.  The research will also develop the Virtual Sensor Toolkit, a software tool that supports the entire lifecycle of virtual sensor development and deployment from requirements development to testing and design updates.  Barron Associates has partnered with commercial unmanned air system producers to advance the TRL of the technology through an aggressive Phase II development and testing effort that prepares the team for flight tests immediately following Phase II.","The proposed research is closely aligned with the goals of the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP).  The loss of accurate sensor data presents significant hazards to both air vehicles being manually piloted and those using high levels of automation.  The virtual sensor redundancy technology effectively mitigates failures of physical sensors, including common-mode failures that may affect multiple redundant physical sensors, and provides a continuous stream of accurate sensor data.  The reliable input data provided by the virtual sensor system will enhance the robustness of vehicle automation systems, directly supporting the goals of the Safe Autonomous Systems Operations (SASO) project within AOSP.  Onboard system failures including sensor failures are an important class of precursor events to vehicle upsets.  By mitigating these failures, virtual sensor systems reduce the likelihood of automation failures and provide accurate information for manual piloting, thereby reducing the likelihood of an upset event.  This capability directly supports work in the area of Technologies for Assuring Safe Aircraft Energy and Attitude State (TASEAS) within the Airspace Technology Demonstrations (ATD) project of AOSP.","The proposed technology is applicable to a wide range of air vehicles, both manned and unmanned.  Ultimately, Barron Associates seeks to apply the technology to commercial transport aircraft, and the Air France 447 crash, for which a common-mode failure of multiple pitot tubes has been identified as a key initiating event, demonstrates the need for the technology.  In the near term, small unmanned air systems represent a large potential market. Size weight and power constraints severely limit hardware redundancy on these platforms, and small low cost sensors are often less reliable than those used on larger more expensive platforms, creating a significant need for the proposed technology.  Small general aviation vehicles also typically have very limited hardware redundancy, and with glass cockpit technology becoming increasingly common in even the small vehicles, Barron Associates sees significant market potential here as well.  Beyond air vehicles, autonomous ground and marine vehicles represent significant potential markets.  Many automobiles already offer limited automation capabilities to enhance safety, and fully autonomous vehicles may become commonplace in the foreseeable future.  Automation systems on these vehicles have the same need for reliable input data as those on air vehicles and, especially on roadways, safety will be paramount.  The virtual sensor technology is thus expected to have significant market appeal in this sector.",Air Transportation & Safety; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Data Fusion; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems),Real-Time Safety Assurance under Unanticipated and Hazardous Conditions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In Phase 1, both equation-based and data-driven PV ROM technologies were developed and proof-of-principle was successfully demonstrated. A set of carefully selected ROM algorithms and model coupling schemes were developed in an integrated architecture to generate PV ASE ROMs. Critical evidence was established in NASA relevant case studies that ROMs enable unprecedented speedup and accuracy for aircraft ASE analysis. PV ASE ROMs for X-56A MUTT models in the current mission were developed, which demonstrated >10X reduction in the number of states and precise capture of vehicle dynamics at various flight conditions. In Phase 2, software will be expanded and refined for enhanced performance and functionality. ROM algorithms will be optimized in terms of efficiency for MIMO systems, consistent state representation, PV capabilities in a broad flight envelope. PV structural ROM will also be developed to consider changes in modal parameters at various flight conditions. The strategies for integrating ROMs, sensors and actuators with control design for ASE studies will be tailored to meet various needs in NASA. A modular software environment will be developed with facile interfacing to NASA tools for technology insertion and transition. ROM software will be extensively validated and demonstrated for ASE and flight control analysis of the current X-56A MUTT model, its future release, and other relevant aircrafts.","The proposed technology will provide a fast and accurate analysis tool for ASE simulations of aerospace vehicles and aircrafts. NASA applications of the technology include: (1) rapid and computationally affordable analysis for optimal aerodynamic and structural design of aerospace vehicles; (2) development of advanced, reliable ASE control strategies (such as controlled maneuver, and aeroelastic instability control, e.g., buffet, flutter, buzz, and control reversal); and (3) arrangement of test procedures for rational use of instruments and facilities. The success in the proposed research will markedly reduce the development cycles of aerospace vehicles and aircrafts at reduced costs. NASA programs like aerostructures test wing, active AeroElastic Wing (AEW) and active twist rotors, Multi-Use Technology Testbed (MUTT) will also stand to benefit from the technology.","The non-NASA markets and customers of the proposed software include various aerospace, aircraft, and watercraft engineering sectors (involving fluid-structure-control interaction). Potential end-users and customers include various government agencies such as US Air Force, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), US Army, Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), US Navy, etc. In addition, the proposed technology will also find broad markets in industries such as aircraft and aerospace, automobile, combustion, power, propulsion, chemical processing, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The proposed research would directly contribute to these vital areas by providing a powerful tool to generate fast ROMs, which can be extensively used to (1) analyze the operating processes for fault diagnostics and optimized design (e.g., structure and fatigue analysis, real-time flow control and optimization, hardware-in-loop simulation); and (2) develop advanced strategies for on-line process monitoring and control.","Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Structural Efficiency-Aeroservoelasticity   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

High thrust engines could revolutionize space exploration. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (""NTP"") is a high thrust/high Isp propulsion technology. Reduced or Zero Boil Off of LH2 propellant for long duration missions is among the critical technology advancements needed for cryogenic propellant storage for both NTP and chemical propulsion. Quest proposes to continue development of Cellular Load Responsive MLI (CLRMLI), an innovative, high performance thermal insulation system.  CLRMLI is a novel technology with a cryopumping cellular core containing Load Responsive MLI layers. This new form of insulation uses cryosorption cryopumping to self-evacuate when in contact with cryogenic propellant tanks, allowing high thermal performance in-air and in-space. The Phase I program successfully demonstrated CLRMLI is a feasible and attractive insulation for new launch vehicle platforms and LH2 or LNG powered aircraft.CLRMLI has a measured heat flux of 11.4W/m2, 25X lower than SOFI (vacuum).NASA's Technology Roadmaps call ""Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions"" and ""Nuclear Thermal Propulsion components and systems"" the","CLRMLI is a novel high performance thermal insulation offering dramatically better thermal performance than SOFI both in-air and in-space.  CLRMLI could be a good SOFI replacement for launch vehicle platforms, such as SLS, where it could help solve cryogenic propellant boiloff concerns. SLS is baselining using SOFI at 1.2"", nearly double the usual thickness, to reduce boiloff. CLRMLI, with a measured heat flux of 46 W/m2 in-air and 11 W/m2, offers much lower heat leak than SOFI (289 W/m2). Boeing has indicated strong interest in CLRMLI (and the companion VCMLI concept), and will support this Phase II work with engineering support.CLRMLI could benefit NASA for LH2 storage for long duration nuclear thermal propelled vehicles for deep space exploration, as well as cryogenic propellant storage for conventional LH2/LOX chemical propulsion systems.NASA's Technology Roadmaps call ""Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions"" and ""Nuclear Thermal Propulsion components and systems"" the #2 and #7 ranked technical challenge for future NASA missions.  CLRMLI could provide 92% lower heat flux than current SOFI insulation for in-air use and 97% lower heat flux in-space. CLRMLI might be a preferred thermal insulation for future NASA mission use, with a combination of high thermal performance, good structural strength, operable in both in-air and in-space environments, and it can be engineered for specific mission requirements.","Several aerospace prime contractors have interest in Quest/Ball IMLI and related insulation systems. CLRMLI could significantly improve launch vehicle insulation, reduce cryopropellant boiloff and increase mission capabilities.  High performance CLRMLI system can replace SOFI in cryogenic upper stages such as AC, ACES and SLS.CLRMLI is ideal insulation for LH2 powered aircraft such as Boeing's Phantom Eye, and for LNG fueled aircraft.Advances in thermal insulation developed for space cryogenics thermal control have relevance to terrestrial industrial applications. Reducing thermal conductivity and heat leak could have significant impact on Earth-based heating and cooling industrial processes and needs, for green energy and high energy efficiency.IMLI and derivatives might be able to provide improved thermal insulation for storage and preservation of cryogens for a variety of industrial uses. LNG tanks could benefit from improved thermal insulation, and CLRMLI might benefit LH2 storage for hydrogen fueled aircraft and ground vehicles.","Active Systems; Composites; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fuels/Propellants; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Passive Systems; Smart/Multifunctional Materials",Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The system can be used for both flight test andin ground test facilities.  The proposed system uses a very robust and proven sensor technology combined with a novel mounting and manufacturing technique.  The sensor array is reusable and requires no calibration, external power source or acquisition system. The system combines an array of small, surface flush, sensors embedded in an extremely thin, flexible polyimide strip coupled with a self-contained, battery powered acquisition, reduction, and storage system.  The system operates by sensing changes in local heat transfer within the boundary-layer.  Variations in heat transfer due to the state of the boundary layer (laminar, transitional, turbulent, separated regions) produce changes in the sensor output.  Other flowfield features where heat transfer is affected will also be discernable, such as shock waves.  The flush mounted sensors, embedded in a smooth, thin polyimide sheet, conform to the local surface contour and produce minimal aerodynamic interference, allowing non-intrusive measurements.  The system will be quantitatively accurate across the low-speed through supersonic flow regime.  No external power or control is required for operation.  After testing, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  Compared to current systems designed for similar measurements, the proposed system promises to provide a significantly more robust and efficient system in a relatively simple, cost effective package.","A robust measurement system capable of determining transition location, separation, and shock locations for both flight and ground test facilities has significant potential application at several NASA centers, and across a wide range of NASA facilities.  The accurate determination of boundary-layer transition and separation locations can be used to validate computational fluid dynamics models, transition prediction, and multidisciplinary analysis and optimization tools.  The system could be used in boundary-layer ingestion and optimization efforts.  In a more permanent set-up, the robust measurement system could be used as input for vehicle adaptive control in uncertain environments or adverse conditions, or for closed loop flow control for aircraft, rotorcraft, or high lift technologies.  The measurement system's relatively simple, robust technology, coupled with its reusable nature make it a very attractive, cost effective system.  With the significant push for increased efficiency and reduced fuel consumption, laminar flow, and increasing its extent on aircraft surfaces is a fundamental aerodynamic goal.  The proposed measurement system will help NASA meet both the Environmentally Responsible Aircraft (ERA) and Subsonic Fixed Wing Project goals.","Advanced sensing technology for both flight and ground test facilities that can determine transition location, regions of separated flow, and the locations of shock waves will provide RHRC with a unique and highly marketable product.  The ability to measure laminar/turbulent transition and separation locations will be of significant importance to both test engineers and researchers.

The major limitation of PSP for pressure mapping is its dependence on an oxygen-containing flow, since those paints are actually oxygen sensors. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) is developing a unique coating in which fluorescence quenching can form high resolution images of the true pressure distribution on surfaces in transonic flow in oxygen-free atmospheres. The fluorescence in these unique coatings depends directly on absolute pressure, and oxygen permeation into the coatings is not required. The new coating, however, is completely compatible with the ""legacy"" (oxygen sensing) visualization equipment used in current transonic test facilities. With this novel pressure sensing technology, coating materials can be used that are not useful for oxygen-based PSPs, and coatings that can meet requirements not achievable with classical paints, like operation at extremely low temperature or in highly contaminated environments. In Phase I, IOS has created the oxygen-insensitive pressure-sensitive coating materials, and applied them to glass and stainless steel test coupons. The fluorescence emission lifetime and intensity of these test samples were measured at varying static pressures under pure nitrogen, showing significant correlation with pressure in the range studied (from 0.05 to 14.7 psi), and excellent repeatability. This sets the stage for Phase II development and delivery of a complete temperature-compensated true ambient pressure sensitive paint system that can be used to characterize flow around structures in hypersonic wind tunnels. At the end of Phase II, the coatings will have been tested at relevant environments (TRL5), and will be available for NASA to begin testing in a high-fidelity laboratory environment (TRL6).","True ambient pressure sensitive (TAPS) paint will be immediately useful in wind-tunnel studies of hypersonic flow, where working fluids other than oxygen are often used to achieve Reynolds numbers characteristic of air flow at higher speeds, particularly in the study of real gas aerodynamic effects, including the world's largest pressurized cryogenic wind tunnel, the National Transonic Facility (NTF), the 0.3-Meter Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel and the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT). Advanced pressure sensitive coatings will be adopted rapidly by other aerodynamic test facilities where oxygen-independent pressure mapping is needed; for example, in the study of combustion-related phenomena (where the partial pressure of oxygen clearly does not depend exclusively on the local ambient pressure). Once the advantages of oxygen-free pressure mapping are demonstrated in these applications, TAPS-based PSPs will rapidly displace the conventional oxygen-sensitive paints in lower speed wind tunnels as well.","One very obvious advantage of TAPS PSPs is that they can be used in ""water tunnels"" for testing hydrodynamic structures. Thus, ship designers (including both the U.S. Navy and commercial naval architects) will be able to use the whole-surface image-based pressure mapping techniques now available to aerospace engineers. A large class of industrial and commercial structures that emit oxygen-reactive species – from tailpipes to smokestacks – that has hitherto been unaddressable by PSPs can be studied with TAPS paints. Pressure mapping of other non-aerodynamic structures (e.g., automobiles, trains, buildings) can be accomplished with conventional PSPs, but the increased shelf-life and stability of TAPS paints will make them attractive for these applications as well. Finally, the true-pressure-sensitive pigments developed in this project will also be useful in a host of spinoff applications, from ""point sensors"" (e.g., on the tips of optical fibers) to optical pressure switches.",Aerodynamics; Characterization; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation),Ground Test Techniques and Measurement Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Our Airborne MUlti-Gas Sensor (AMUGS) technology is based upon two-tone frequency-modulated spectroscopy (TT-FMS). TT-FMS retains the advantages of near-infrared diode lasers while pushing detection sensitivity more than two orders of magnitude closer to the theoretical limit. Phase I results demonstrated that lightweight, low-power near-infrared systems can deliver sensitivity competitive with mid-infrared gas analyzers. This factor is important for UAV deployment because near-infrared systems that use fiber optic telecommunications components are robust, versatile, and cost-effective. AMUGS uses an open path optical cell that is lighter and more robust than instruments based on cavity-enhanced spectroscopy methods. In, Sensitivity demonstrated in Phase I was a factor of 5-10x better than its nearest competing techniques. Benchtop TT-FMS delivered sensitivities at 10 Hz of 5 ppm for CO2 and 12 ppb for CH4. Precision improved to 1.5 ppm for CO2 and 3.3 ppb for CH4 with 1 sec of signal averaging. The Phase II target is to design and build a flight-ready TT-FMS prototype that maintains or exceeds this benchtop detection precision. The AMUGS prototype will meet 5 kg and 50 W targets and will be flown on an all-electric model aircraft at the University of Texas at Dallas. This airborne testing will provide critical information that will help further development and commercialization of the AMUGS technology.","AMUGS meets NASA's needs for airborne measurements of carbon dioxide and methane. Work proposed in Phase II will focus on design and engineering to produce a field-testable, UAV-compatible prototype. The AMUGS concept builds upon existing high-performance spectroscopy and has demonstrated the simultaneous, real-time detection of multiple gases. The common optical path and detector of the system not only reduce sources of noise and error but also decrease device complexity, mass and footprint. The AMUGS design is based upon robust, mature telecom technologies: fiber- coupled diode lasers and WiFi electronics. AMUGS provides a sensitive gas sensor in a compact, light and low power package that is directly compatible with unattended, remote sensing upon a UAV platform.","Numerous investigators are conducting research on anthropogenic methane and other gases. AMUGS could provide a valuable tool to groups seeking to gather high-resolution spatial and temporal data of gas concentrations aloft.

This sensor module would identify changes in the unintended Radio Frequency (RF) emissions of various flight-system electronic components to determine the current health state and predict the future reliability of the scanned system.

AFFMAD will assist early evaluation of FM strategies and improve the efficiency of implementing and testing those strategies much earlier in the design process than today. With AFFMAD, FM engineers will be able systematically generate, analyze, and trade-off FM strategies at the system-level within a multi-discipline modeling framework. Focusing on the early design phases will reduce the technical, schedule, and cost risk of Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions. A key innovation of the AFFMAD approach is to represent the FM models in a form that supports iteration over alternative FM strategies in order to optimize overall mission success. We accomplish this by building abstract FM cyber-physical models, annotating them with both FM characteristics and mission costs (e.g., Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP), latency, throughput), and using external tools to iteratively explore the state space of feasible FM strategies. At each iteration, AFFMAD collects performance and cost information about each alternative in the context of each mission phases as well as the entire mission.","The initial target application for this work is to support NASA missions that involve Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (ARD), and specifically the systems engineers who design the FM aspects of the system. However AFFMAD is a FM design tool, and as such, it can be adapted to address any whole system (aircraft, spacecraft, or surface exploration vehicle) or sub-system thereof.","FM is a key strategy used by many industries to increase system dependability, and FM failures are concerns for any organization designing or building life- or mission-critical systems.

Howard St., Niles, IL 60714 - 3301",(847) 588-3001,3,6,"To continue the trend towards ever more efficient photovoltaic devices, next-generation multi-junction cells will be based on increasingly complex structures.  These structures will require the ability to join two or more independently grown epitaxial structures together via wafer bonding which is a complicated process to include in a high-volume manufacturing environment using conventional wafer fusion techniques.  Additionally, metamorphic material is very difficult to bond due to the inherent roughness of the surface.  We propose the development of a bonding process based on an epoxy interface with an embedded metallic grid to provide electrical conductivity across the bonded interface.  This process is expected to be low-cost, compatible with metamorphic material and high-volume manufacturing, and readily scalable to 6-inch or larger substrates.  It will be an enabling technology for next-generation, five- and six-junction solar cells with 1-sun AM0 efficiency exceeding 37% in high volume production.An example device structure that can benefit from the proposed wafer bonding technique is a six-junction solar cell.  This six-junction device is composed of two triple-junction stacks, one of which is grown on a GaAs substrate while the other is grown on an InP substrate.  The two triple-junction stacks must be bonded together to form the final six-junction device.  The epoxy-bonding process proposed here will allow this bonding to be accomplished reliably on large-area substrates.  This is essential for turning this structure into a practical, manufacturable, commercial product.  When coupled with MicroLink Device's proprietary epitaxial lift-off (ELO) technology which allows for reuse of both the GaAs and InP substrates, devices based on this six-junction architecture could potentially be manufactured for less than $170/W in sufficient volume to serve near-term applications.  This structure is expected to yield 40% efficiency under AM0 illumination.","The ultra-high-efficiency, extremely lightweight cells that can be created using this technology are potentially beneficial to NASA for any space-based application in which weight, efficiency, and reliability are of the utmost importance.  In particular, next-generation solar electric propulsion (SEP) systems which rely on extremely large arrays of powerful solar cells stand to benefit substantially from the improvements offered by this technology.","The proposed technology will allow next-generation solar cells exceeding 40% AM0 efficiency to be made commercially available.  This process is compatible with MicroLink's existing epitaxial lift-off (ELO) technology which means they can also be made exceptionally light-weight.  Non-NASA potential customers include makers of UAVs, such as Aerovironment, Aurora Flight Sciences, and EADS-Astrium, who could use the cells to substantially increase the endurance of the UAV.  High-efficiency is particularly critical to UAV applications as the are available for solar cells is limited to the wing surface of the vehicle.  Weight is another critical consideration for UAVs as the additional weight of the solar cells limits the advantage gained by using them.  Another category of potential customers includes companies such as Power Film who make solar sheets and solar blankets for collection of solar energy for high value terrestrial applications.","Generation; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)",Advanced Photovoltaic Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

By combining Ultramet's experience in refractory metal fabrication by CVD with computer control of directed laser energy, nearly unlimited expression of part shape and metal composition can be realized for component fabrication. 3D additive manufacturing is revolutionizing many industries by offering unconstrained complex build geometries and reduced cost, lead time, and material usage compared with conventional manufacturing techniques. By developing laser-directed CVD technology for refractory metals, Ultramet will bring these inherent benefits to a class of materials that are notoriously difficult to form and thus are expensive to implement. By depositing successive layers of metal directly from reactive precursor gases, the system will be able to build components from rhenium, tungsten, tantalum, niobium, and their alloys with complex internal features and reduced assembly part count. In Phase I, Ultramet designed and built a laser-directed CVD reactor, successfully deposited both rhenium and tungsten in a controlled fashion, and achieved well-defined two-dimensional spatial control and layering as a strong demonstration of process feasibility. In Phase II, Ultramet will design and build a new high-power, high-speed reactor with optical z-axis control to enable layering for 3D geometries at high deposition rates. Software and hardware integration will provide automated layering control to enable fully automatic additive manufacturing from 3D models. The deposited rhenium and its layering will be characterized and optimized by direct printing of mechanical test specimens and small demonstrator articles. This phase of the research will mature the system and technology to a level where automated fabrication of small 3D components is possible.","The proposed manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize the fabrication of engine and hot gas path components for liquid and solid rocket propulsion.

Spacesuit development and ground-based testing require sensing and analytical instrumentation for characterizing and validating prototypes. While miniature thermosensors measure reliably at low cost, and can be incorporated all around spacesuit prototypes, incorporating gas sensors at locations of interest inside a spacesuit has been a significant challenge – in particular for human subject tests – because of the size and cost of available instrumentation. The sensor probes and cables must not restrict the suit or human subjects' mobility, and must not disturb the gas flow. Intelligent Optical System is developing luminescence-based sensing patches for non-intrusive monitoring of critical life support gas constituents and potential trace contaminants in spacesuits. Flexible sensitive patches inside prototype spacesuits are interrogated via optical fibers, and do not disturb the gas flow or the human subject. This will give suit engineers great flexibility for choosing multiple sensing points, fitting the sensor elements into the spacesuit, and cost effectively relocating the sensor elements as desired. In Phase I, a first demonstrator was validated at Johnson Space Center by comparison with current instrumentation used in the Suited Manikin Test Apparatus. Phase II will produce an advanced system ready for integration into NASA programs, and for commercialization (TRL9).","The proposed technology will apply directly to accomplishing the objectives of the NASA Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program, contributing to the rapid and effective development of novel EVA systems, and the demonstration of key capabilities for future human missions beyond Earth orbit. Exhaustive testing of prototype systems reduces risk and improves the affordability of exploration missions. The proposed technology will significantly enhance current capabilities for demonstrating, in ground-based testbeds and in flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), the prototype EVA systems developed in the AES program. In addition, sensor materials developed in this project will find direct application for life support system monitoring. Luminescence sensors for pO2, pCO2 and pH2O have significant advantages over competing technology for the Portable Life Support system, including reduced size, low power and operation under wet conditions. Today IR technology remains the most accurate and stable CO2 means of monitoring for the PLSS, but it is highly sensitive to free water that can condense or accumulate in the gas sampling area, particularly on optical windows. When NASA astronauts work hard in spacesuits, they sweat, creating moisture that has historically caused IR sensors to fail or give inaccurate readings. Luminescent sensors capable of operating while wet offer an alternative to overcome this limitation.","The potential market for noninvasive sensor patches includes the industries that apply protective packaging to moisture- or oxygen-sensitive goods. Incorporating patches inside packages will enable the users to check gas composition nondestructively throughout the life of the packaged product, assuring the integrity of the envelope. Packaging with gas barrier properties and/or modified atmospheres is used extensively for electronic components, hygroscopic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, animal feed, and surgical and dental instruments.

These GAFs can lead to a state-space equation representing the plant model for rapid aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic (ASE) design and analysis.  The overall technical objective of Phase II is to develop and validate a production-ready FunZEUS that will be developed by enhancing the prototypical FunZEUS (1) to drastically improve its computational efficiency; (2) to expand its commercialization potential by interfacing with other commercial CFD codes; (3) to include the static aeroelastic effects in the GAF generation; (4) to demonstrate its applicability to complex configurations; (5) to showcase its plant model generation capability using spoilers and other control surfaces; and (6) to improve its maintainability and modularity by integrating all modules in a ZONA's database and dynamic memory management system.","The proposed effort is highly relevant to NASA's on-going and future projects within NASA's fixed wing project under the Fundamental Aeronautics Program.  NASA's fixed wing project involves several non-conventional design concepts such as the Truss-Braced Wing (TBW), the Blended Wing Body (BWB) and the Supersonic Business Jet (SBJ).  Because of the BWB's flying-wing-type and the SBJ's slender fuselage designs, these designs are prone to the BFF (Body Freedom Flutter) problem.  In addition, it is expected that the gust loads on the high aspect ratio wing of the TBW configuration will be one of the critical design loads.  The proposed work will offer a computational tool to the NASA designers for early exploration of technologies and design concepts that exploit the trade-off between the passive and active approaches for mitigating the potential aeroelastic problems associated with those non-conventional configurations. It thus can be seen that through the research planned to be conducted during Phase I and II of this effort, NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program will benefit significantly.

Arcjet testing was performed at NASA ARC to heat flux levels exceeding 1000 W/cm2, with the results showing a significantly reduced ablation rate compared to conventional chopped fiber ablators, and ablation behavior comparable to FM5055 at just one-third the density. In 2008, NASA ARC contracted ARA to develop a new heat shield design involving integration of fully cured mid-density ablator blocks within a structural honeycomb reinforcement. The block ablator-in-honeycomb heat shield is envisioned to provide high atmospheric entry reliability due to the structural attachment integrity provided by the honeycomb lattice in the ablative material layer. In Phase I, the Ultramet-ARA team demonstrated the initial feasibility of using ablator/aerogel-filled foam within honeycomb cells through fabrication of a 16-cell panel in which foam blocks were literally pressed to shape using a die and then snug-fit into carbon/phenolic honeycomb cells. The 16-cell panel was infiltrated with ablator to a controlled depth on the front face, which simultaneously bonded the foam blocks to the honeycomb, and the remaining foam void space on the back face was filled with aerogel. In Phase II, block ablator-in-honeycomb structures will be optimized through flat and curved panel fabrication, properties testing, and high heat flux testing at NASA ARC and the Air Force LHMEL facility.

Due to the small physical size and high frequency response of the sensors (resulting in excellent spatial and temporal resolution), the technique has been widely used for studies of turbulent flows. Even with the advent of nonintrusive techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), hot wire anemometry is uniquely capable of extremely high frequency response and fine spatial resolution measurements. ViGYAN has demonstrated a fundamental change to the anemometer configuration, with two related aspects. First, the circuitry to power the sensor and establish its operating point is packaged immediately adjacent to the sensor, i.e. in the typical probe holder, removing the effect of the cable connecting the sensor to an external anemometer. Second, modern analog-digital conversion hardware has been employed to the maximum extent possible,  including directly driving the sensor. Data transmission is fully digital, immune to environmental variations or electrical noise. Based on these results, the Phase II work will deploy this ""Digital Bridge"" system using a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) device connected via fiber-optic cable the miniaturized ""probe holder"" electronics. The DSP will be controlled by a generic PC with software to control the system and acquire/store data. A production-ready version will be developed and delivered; facilities, expertise, and resources are available to fabricate and deliver production units at the conclusion of Phase II. Production designs for ruggedized units will also be done for use in wind tunnels that operate at higher dynamic pressures and extreme temperatures.","A primary objective of the Digital Bridge design is, of course, to improve the performance of thermal anemometry in demanding aerospace applications, particularly wind tunnels. Any NASA wind tunnel, from small low-speed facilities to highly complex installations such as the National Transonic Facility (NTF) at NASA LaRC are candidates for this technology. The miniaturized, localized, and substantially digitized electronics package could be used for acquisition and processing of signals from hot film arrays, often used for boundary layer studies in both wind tunnel and flight environments. Other potential research applications could include planetary atmosphere measurements.One of the key issues here has been the large number of sensors, but the digital bridge approach lends itself to effective multiplexing of a large number of sensors across a smaller number of anemometers. Such an approach would allow for the use of hot wire sensors analogous to the shift to electronically scanned pressure (ESP) transducers widely used in wind tunnels.","There are many commercial and educational wind tunnels in the U.S. and around the world that could use the Digital Bridge. Looking to broader markets, the majority of air mass flow sensors for automotive applications rely on thermal anemometry in one way or another. The monitoring and control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is also done with thermal anemometry systems.  A digital bridge approach will offer improved environmental tolerance and greater reliability for both applications, with its digital outputs being easily integrated into the overall automotive or industrial control systems used.There are a number of applications for hot wire sensors in medical instrumentation . It should be noted that a requirement in many of these systems is electrical isolation; our use of fiber optic instrumentation cables would be very useful in such environments.","Aerodynamics; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Medical; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Thermal",Ground Test Techniques and Measurement Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies such as Pyrolysis–GCMS to analyze planetary samples. These instruments require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples.  It is critical to develop an effective instrument with extended and enhanced capabilities to enable future planetary multiple-mission needs. We propose to develop a novel nonlinear Raman spectral sensing instrument for trace organic detection at the sub ppm level based on fluoresence-free surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).  The proposed instrument will be capable of detecting the molecular signatures in Martian samples in the field with significantly improved sensitivity (>100,000,000) and reduced noise (>100).  It will offer NASA a ultra sensitive deployable instrument suitable for robotic missions in terms of in situ measurements, resolution, bandwidth, compact size, low cost, and ruggedness.  The detection of organics at the sub ppm level in Martian-like soils will be applicable to several future NASA missions, in particular future rovers for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission.   These mobile, fast and agile rovers are focused on collection for sample return and require non-sampling analytical instruments.","The successful development of the proposed ultra sensitive SERS sensor instrument will have extensive NASA's applications. The proposed system will create an opportunity to extend and enhance the capability of traditional NASA Earth and Planetary detection efforts in current platforms. It meets NASA's multiple-mission requirements for the best use of limited resources by reducing the risk, cost, size, weight as well as power consumption. It will also enable new measurements with greatly enhanced sensitivity for the planetary study. This technology will be useful for a broad range of in situ measurements for: space science and terrestrial geochemical, geophysical and geobiological studies; planetary protection applications.","Ultra sensitive spectral sensors have wide applications to include homeland security, life science, and matter physics and chemistry. It offers a fast, sensitive and accurate method of analysis suitable for both laboratory-based and plant based applications.  In addition, a broad range of non-government commercial and industrial applications include environmental testing of water, soil and air; municipal and industrial water and waste-water quality testing; commercial product quality control testing of manufactured food, chemical, semiconductor, and other commercial products.  Furthermore, laser spectral sensors have potential to provide the unique sensitive fluorescence-free and real-time analysis for biofuel production and oil exploration in energy industry.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Detectors (see also Sensors); Filtering; Gratings; Image Analysis; In Situ Manufacturing; Infrared; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

SIFT will demonstrate Marshal by developing it as a plugin for the TRACLabs PRIDE procedure authoring system.  A Marshal-enabled PRIDE will learn and maintain task models so that it can improve the consistency and correctness of PRL-based procedures.  Marshal will monitor procedures as they are authored in PRIDE, learning organizational conventions and commonly applied constraints.  Marshal will enhance the PRIDE interface with dialogue elements that highlight potential errors and unconventional elements in the current procedure.  Marshal will allow model drift by adapting its model of procedures over time and it will accommodate incomplete and inconsistent feedback from procedure authors.Marshal's capabilities will stem from how it represents and reasons with a family of possible procedure model interpretations. As authors use different procedure constructs, Marshal will create interpretations of constraints that match the constructs. With author feedback, Marshal will update the interpretations to more closely match the corpus of procedures authored by the organization.  With a family of model interpretations, Marshal can compute the expectation that user procedures are correct and consistent. Marshal also computes diagnoses explaining which assumptions about the user's intended model lead to inconsistency. From the diagnoses, Marshal populates a queue of potential plan flaws that the author can address at their convenience through natural and informative dialogues. As users interact with Marshal, it automatically maintains procedure models so that they can better serve procedure authors as missions evolve.","We will target Marshal as a key technology for handling evolving and changing task models for all NASA missions.  Many NASA missions evolve and grow as they are occurring. For instance, the Mars Exploration Rover mission has expanded greatly beyond its original mission parameters.  As a general-purpose model evolution tool, Marshal will be capable of handling complex domain constraints in such domains. Marshal has high applicability to analog missions where operations methodologies are evolved (i.e., Desert RATS and NEEMO).  Further, any mission for geologic centric (i.e., planetary surface or asteroid) exploration and ISS crew planning will require occasional on-the-fly modification of procedures and tasks. Finally, as the possibility of long distance spaceflights draws ever closer, NASA will require technologies capable of duplicating or replacing current ground control tasks.  We will work toward making Marshal a viable candidate for increasing the autonomy of astronauts during these flights.","We will develop Marshal technologies to be applicable across a variety of domains, beyond those at NASA.  At SIFT, we have extensive knowledge in planning and scheduling for in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellites, and ground troop movements.  These domains touch on a range of organizations, including the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), the Office of Navel Research (ONR) and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL).",Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction,Spacecraft Autonomy and Space Mission Automation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The ADC does not employ time-interleaving and provides a very wide spur free input bandwidth making it more suitable to NASA's remote sensing missions and a variety of radio astronomy applications than any other ADC available.In addition, the ADC will be radiation hard (>300krad) and thus suitable for use on-board space missions. A key innovation in Alphacore's approach to the ADC design is that we have considered how the ADC will be used in a system;  a custom designed digital back-end implements digital data de-multiplexing and signal conditioning to allow seamless integration with commercially available, high-end, field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) that are the main building blocks of modern scientific spectrometers and interferometers. Alphacore's ADC provides these improvements at much lower power and lower cost than existing commercial ADCs that use off-chip components to provide these features. Alphacore's design takes advantage of the latest low-power, high-speed digital CMOS processes, resulting in ADC power consumption that is less than 1/8 of the power consumption of competitor ADCs.The proposed ADC employs an innovative topology with high-bandwidth front-end sampling circuit combined with an interpolated flash-type ADC and encoder circuitry that simplifies FPGA interfacing.   All the needed clock signals are generated from a low-cost 100MHz crystal clock reference  with a low-jitter (<200fs), radiation-tolerant on-chip PLL.","Some of the currently planned missions that benefit from Alphacore's ADC are listed below.The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a 2.7 meter airborne telescope that includes multiple spectrometers covering a broad range of wavelengths. Its Heterodyne Instrument requires 64 high-bandwidth ADCs, similar to the Alphacore ADC.Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM) has  passive and active remote sensing instruments in low Earth orbit (LEO) including a UV spectrometer, an IR spectrometer, and a scanning Microwave limb sounder (SMLS).  Alphacore's ADC that has 24GSps sampling rate, 40Ghz bandwidth and is radiation hard meets the requirements of these instruments. Compact Adaptable Microwave Limb Sounder (CAMLS) is a collection of instruments, scalable for use in balloons, aircraft and eventually in space.  It is a follow-on mission  for  GACM, and  requires digital spectrometers to cover 40 GHz of bandwidth. Six high-bandwidth (and rad-hard) ADCs are needed. Alphacore's ADC is an excellent match to this application.Airborne Scanning Microwave Limb Sounder (A-SMLS) instrument requires seven high bandwidth ADCs for analysis over the spectral range from 225 to 234 GHz.Other NASA missions that can benefit from  Alphacore's ADC  are TSSM, CCAT, JUICE, MARVEL and VESPER.","In addition to NASA's remote sensing applications Alphacore's ADC is a perfect match to a wide range of radio astronomy applications. Alphacore received several letters of support form the international radio astronomy community to go with this application. The features that make it an exceptional match to the requirements of international large-scale radio astronomy experiments are: seamless interfacing to FPGAs, single core design instead of time-interleaved one, very high sampling rate and bandwidth, easy clocking with an on-chip PLL, low power dissipation and low cost. The ADC also has wide commercial applicability in  networking (coherent receivers, network modules), communications (software-defined radio), test equipment (high-speed digital oscilloscopes), radar and electronic warfare (EW) devices. The radiation hardness makes it suitable for commercial and defense sector space applications.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Microwave",Microwave Technologies for Remote Sensing   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The UAS Demand Generator for Discrete Airspace Density (UAXPAN) is a cloud-based application producing UA demand forecasts from user defined scenarios consisting of: UAS, industry, missions, and forecast elements. In Phase I, UAXPAN was developed as a prototype to demonstrate Government and commercial UAS operations.  In Phase II, the overall project objective is to enhance the UAXPAN system to allow users and governance groups to start actively adding UAS missions, forecasting UAS growth, and assessing the impact of UAS operations in different areas.  The collected data can then be shared with other users seeking to perform assessments of impact or demand and to optimize the crowd sourced input in a cloud-based hosting approach to receive feedback.  This will be accomplish by developing UAXPAN as a full system and testing this system as a Beta Operation, designing and developing a user friendly wizard forecast system, and conducting research and analysis on communications and spectrum planning, ATC loading, and environmental impacts of noise and atmospheric emissions.","UAXPAN is an innovative concept for a UAS Demand Generator that is directly related to fostering NASA's achieving results in driving UAS integration in the NAS. Our UAS demand forecast system will provide valuable input to the R&D being performed by the NASA UAS Program. The Control & Communications Project (NASA GRC) and the Certification & Safety Project (NASA LaRC) will directly benefit by having the number of UAS forecasted operations soundly based upon real world constraint knowledge and industry SMEs – and based upon industry markets, UAS types, use by mission, and discrete airspace classes associated with geographical location and time. This forecast data is needed to validate the communication systems engineering work on channel bandwidth sizing, signal-in-space specification (especially for shared channel access techniques) and for planning of spectrum reuse.  Without this UAS demand data the selection of differing approaches to form consensus on standards for civil aviation will be delayed. The UAXPAN project will also be essential in the development of another NASA emerging project for the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) System which is targeted to enable low-altitude civilian applications of UAS. The UTM will greatly benefit from accurate forecast of planned UAS use in low altitudes as input data to traffic flow and control simulations.","The UAS demand tool, UAXPAN, will provide valuable forecast data to non-NASA users in the Federal Government (FAA, DHS, DOT, EPA, DoA, DoI), Armed Services, state and local governments, universities, standards organizations (RTCA, ICAO, AEEC, AUVSI, JARUS) and defense and commercial business.  All these organizations need to support investment planning, perform engineering, determine market needs, or establish international standards and agreements based upon the projected use of UAS which goes beyond just having aggregated U.S. totals. The U.S Congress is driving the introduction of UAS through the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2012 and their staff would be able to benefit from UAS projections by industry and governing domains.  UAXPAN will also be the source of analytics and projection data that can be offered to users through the emerging ""big data"" businesses.

The Airborne Chemical Microsensor System (AMS) instrument package being developed adapts low cost and low power chemical microsensor technology which has been demonstrated for fire detection and exhaust emission monitoring to airborne measurements.  The fast time response and miniaturized system will provide a lightweight, low cost instrument for package for a wide range of deployments including aerostats (balloons and kites) to UAV such as Dragon Eye and SIERRA. Chemical species mapping using UAVs enables model validation and attaining new data that complements and augments traditional aerial and satellite data.  However, there currently are limited options adapting commercial chemical sensors for detecting all species of interest at the levels required, and with fast response time.  Wet electrochemical cells, which provide accurate measurement for some species, are typically slow (30-60 sec), sensitive to pressure changes, and are a potential hazard from leakage.  Most commercial environmental carbon dioxide monitors are based on NDIR, with response time in the order of minutes.  Hydrocarbons are monitored by generic combustible gas sensors.  Instruments need to be low cost, compact and robust enough for incorporation in UAV systems, capable of surviving hard landings and sufficiently low cost that damage to the instrument and or loss of the UAV is not a major setback for the mission.  The proposed solid-state, microsensor technology is well suited for this application, because of the low production cost and robust packaging.  The proposed program provides a low cost instrument (less than $1000 in limited quantities) for real-time carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and methane detection.",UAVs will see an expanded role in support NASA science missions.  Recent applications for the UAV based chemical sensing currently include the study of volcanoes to validate atmospheric models and to gain new insight into mechanisms. Near term application of the Airborne Chemical Microsensor System (AMS) would be to assist NASA's work studying volcanic activity such as tracking volcano emissions.,There is a large commercial market for low cost deployable atmospheric monitoring systems. Air quality management districts could use the instrument for air quality monitoring.  The ability to potentially deploy monitoring equipment on aerostats or UAV could provide means to improve air quality forecasts and to monitor for out of compliance emissions.,Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support),Airborne Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The new lens enables a blanket-level specific power > 1,000 W/kg, including lenses, PV cell circuit (including cells, encapsulation, high-voltage insulation, and heavy radiation shielding), and waste heat rejection radiator. The new SLA array is cost-effective, with the most expensive array cost element, the IMM solar cell, contributing only $50/W to the array cost. The new lens is novel in configuration, enabling single-axis tracking for the array even in the presence of large beta angles (e.g., 50 degrees) between the array and the sun. For future high-power arrays (e.g., > 100 kW), including Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions, the new SLA will offer a unique combination of high efficiency (e.g., >35%), ultra-low mass, high-operating voltage (e.g., >300 V), and low cost. SLA technology is a direct descendant of the SCARLET array used to power NASA's Deep Space 1 SEP mission in 1998-2001. SLA recently completed a flight test on TacSat 4 in a very high radiation orbit, and the lessons learned from TacSat 4 led to the new SLA, the subject of this proposal. The new SLA is scalable to multi-hundred-kW array sizes using blanket deployment and support platforms such as DSS's Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA). The new SLA will typically operate at 4X concentration, saving substantially on solar cell area, cost, radiation shielding mass, and dielectric isolation mass. The new SLA will enable the early use of state-of-the-art cells, such as inverted metamorphic (IMM) cells with 4 or 6 junctions, and will enhance the production capacity of cell vendors (e.g., 100 kW per year of 1 sun cells = 400 kW per year of 4X cells). The feasibility of the new SLA was firmly established in Phase I, and fully functional prototype hardware will be developed and tested by MOLLC, DSS, SolAero-Emcore, and CFE in Phase II.","The new SLA will apply to a wide range of NASA missions, most of which use solar power. The new SLA's superior attributes include scalability to high power, radiation hardness at low mass penalty, reliable high-voltage operation, outstanding power metrics (specific power, areal power density, and stowed power volume), high beta-angle tolerance, and low cost per Watt. These attributes will be especially important for high-power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions. The high unit cost (e.g., >$10/sq.cm.) of advanced multi-junction solar cells (e.g., IMM cells), may make conventional one-sun solar arrays too expensive for very high-power NASA missions, such as, for example, 300-600 kW SEP tugs to carry large amounts of cargo from low earth orbit (LEO) to GEO, the Earth-Moon Lagrange Points, lunar orbit, Mars orbit, or beyond. For such high-power missions, the new SLA could be mission-enabling because of its much lower cost per Watt, combined with its superior performance attributes, compared to one-sun arrays. Because of its typical 4X concentration, the new SLA also offers much better low-intensity, low-temperature (LILT) performance than one-sun arrays for outer planet missions. The new SLA is also high-temperature-capable, allowing inner planet missions or slingshot trajectories to the outer planets. Potential NASA customers of the new SLA therefore include the Space Technology Directorate, the Science Directorate, and the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate.","The new SLA will apply to a wide range of non-NASA space missions, most of which use solar power. The new SLA's superior attributes include specific power (W/kg), stowed power density (kW/cu.m.), areal power density (W/sq.m.), high-voltage operation, radiation hardness, high sun-pointing tolerance, and low cost per Watt, all critical to non-NASA customers including established space companies (e.g., Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Space Systems Loral, Orbital Sciences, et al.), the U.S. DOD (USAF, MDA, et al.), and newer entries into the space business (e.g., Planetary Resources, Bigelow, Ad Astra Rocket Company, SpaceX, et al.). The U.S. DOD is particularly interested in rad-hard arrays, which led them to fund the SCARLET array that flew on Deep Space 1 in 1998-2001 and the Stretched Lens Array Technology Experiment (SLATE) which flew on TacSat 4. The new SLA will offer excellent rad-hardness as well as hardness against other potential threats (e.g., ground-based lasers), and will be more widely applicable to more DOD missions with its new high-beta-angle-tolerance. The new SLA will also be ideally suited to Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions, including orbit-raising (e.g., LEO-to-GEO for communication satellites), asteroid mining (as planned by Planetary Resources), drag compensation (for inflated space stations in LEO as planned by Bigelow), and multi-hundred-kW spacecraft (as planned by Ad Astra).

At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with a hybrid wick, which has a sintered evaporator wick, and a conventional grooved adiabatic and condenser wick.  These hybrid wicks can operate at higher heat fluxes, allowing the use of higher power laser diodes.  They also allow the use of Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) in Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, which must operate at tilts up to 45?.  Conventional aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can only operate with a 0.1 inch tilt, so they are unsuitable.  Loop Heat Pipes can also operate with tilting, but they are two orders of magnitude more expensive.  A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.","Hybrid wick CCHPs for high power electronics on spacecraft, and NASA landers and rovers is the immediate NASA application. Conventional grooved aluminum/ammonia CCHPs are heat flux limited and are only suitable for operation in space, or when they can be engineered to operate on a planetary surface in a gravity aided mode. The hybrid wicks developed on this program will remove this design constraint, and expand the design space to include higher heat flux operation and operation against gravity on future missions. Wicks developed on this program will enable the use of 3-D CCHPs for some NASA applications: with a hybrid wick, 3-D pipes can be fabricated and ground tested. Additional applications for the hybrid wick were identified, such as heat collecting and spreading for space based and planetary applications. Heat generating electronics are typically buried within an enclosure: the electronics will be mounted in various configurations on circuit cards and aluminum mounting planes. The goal is to accept and isothermalize the thermal load within the enclosure from the individual electronics components and transfer the energy to a location for heat.  Strategically embedding heat pipes with hybrid wicks within these planes relevant to the high power components can increase the effective thermal conductivity by 2 to 4 times. These high conductivity plates are essential in the overall Thermal Management System for NASA electronics enclosures applications.","The maximum allowable evaporator heat flux in a grooved pipe is relatively low, typically 10-15 W/cm^2. As spacecraft electronics increase in power and packing density, this can present a thermal control problem.  Sintered wicks have much higher evaporator heat flux limits, typically four times higher than grooved wicks. The main non-NASA application will be for CCHPs that remove waste heat from high power components on commercial and military spacecraft. Several interested commercial customers in this technology development have been identified, for cooling of laser based components to high heat flux components on-board commercial satellites. Due to the intensive requirements on Military systems for electronics, there are also severe high heat flux cooling requirements. A hybrid wick CCHP with high heat flux capabilities would be highly beneficial. There are cost and mass penalties to competing technologies, such as Loop Heat Pipes and thermal spreaders.",Heat Exchange; Passive Systems,Thermal Control Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

NASA and Boeing have been studying the suitability of this concept to address the drag reduction problem in aircraft with reduced-stiffness wings. However, reduced stiffness may lead to wing flutter. In addition, displacements of VCCTEF control surfaces are limited and subject to highly nonlinear and time-varying constraints. Hence control design needs to solve a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. To address these challenges, in Phase I SSCI carried out initial development and testing of the Drag Identification and Reduction Technology (DIRECT). The DIRECT software estimates wing structural modes on-line and uses that information in a robust predictive controller design. Based on using Evolutionary Optimization and off-line analysis, DIRECT estimates wind disturbances on-line and selects optimal controller parameters from a table lookup to achieve on-line drag minimization. Building upon the successful Phase I development, in Phase II we propose to extend the DIRECT approach and evaluate its performance through high-fidelity simulations and wind-tunnel testing. Specific Phase II tasks include: (i) Test Phase I flutter suppression algorithms and PSC algorithms in a GTM simulation with flexible modes and VCCTEF control surfaces; (ii) Extend and enhance the drag minimization approach by developing innovative Performance Seeking Control (PSC) algorithms; and (iii) Compare the features of PSC and other available performance seeking control algorithms through wind-tunnel testing at the University of Washington Aerodynamics Laboratory (UWAL). Professor Eli Livne of University of Washington and Mr. James Urnes, Sr. will provide technical support under the project. Phase III will focus on commercialization of SYMPTOM software to manned aircraft and UAS.","The proposed DIRECT system is consistent with the main objectives of the NASA N+3 Concept Aircraft Project. In particular, it addresses the problem of flutter identification and suppression, while simultaneously achieving drag reduction using performance-seeking control algorithm. Hence the proposed DIRECT system can be used in future designs of HALE UAVs with flexible wings. The use of the DIRECT technology in this context would help in lowering the costs of NASA scientific research by reducing fuel consumption, and in contributing to environmental protection by lowering emissions and noise.",The proposed DIRECT system is applicable to future flexible-wing commercial vehicle concepts where the main objective is to enhance fuel efficiency while reducing noise and emissions.

The resulting framework is applicable across different Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D) domains, and enables further development and testing of reusable GN&C software for such applications. GUARD is based on the key functional requirements for GN&C software for AR&D, with special emphasis on the commonality across different domains of operation and unique implementation requirements for GN&C algorithms in such domains. Phase I accomplishments include: (i) Augmented the flight-test proven on-line trajectory optimization and control algorithm with a Fault Detection, Identification and Accommodation (FDIA) capability, (ii) Extended SSCI's Vision Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms, recently demonstrated for shipboard landing flight experiments, to achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy for the AR&D implementations, and demonstrated its robustness to docking pattern variations; (iii) Carried out a detailed study of common GN&C functions for AR&D, and developed a conceptual solution for a user interface enabling  agile reconfiguration of domain-specific information; and (iv) Carried out initial analysis of System-level Performance Metrics for AR&D missions to facilitate V&V of the overall integrated GN&C system. Phase II will demonstrate an enhanced prototype of the GUARD with integrated GNC/FDIA/VBN software that will make it reusable in three disparate AR&D system domains.  Demonstrations will be in simulation and hardware tests as follows: orbital AR&D (in simulation), planetary rover docking with a habitat (evaluations at Olin College on R-Gator platform), and a quadrotor close-proximity operation mission (evaluations at UT Austin on quadrotor platform). Phase III will focus on commercialization of the GUARD software and its implementation to future NASA Space Exploration missions.","Immediate applications of GUARD are envisioned in the NASA Space Exploration Programs and future missions whose important components are AR&D tasks and close-proximity operations. GUARD technology has a potential to supersede point design methodologies and result in substantial cost savings in the development of GN&C software. Another family of missions that will benefit from the GUARD technology are space landing missions on planets, asteroids and other celestial bodies. The MICP-based optimal trajectory planning and control software, originally developed by our team member Prof. Behcet Acikmese, is becoming the standard for next generation Mars missions and has been funded by NASA Flight Opportunities program for maturation and test validation. Augmenting the MICP algorithm with FDIA and VBN capabilities under the GUARD framework will be a major thrust for our future research in this area.","Another important application area for the GUARD technology is autonomous UAV/UAS markets. GUARD will be particularly well suited for the delivering a GN&C software toolkit that has been designed and evaluated for UAV teams for missions such as autonomous formation flying and aerial refueling. From the GN&C system design and functionality perspective, such missions have many commonalities with AR&D space missions and missions involving close proximity operations.","Attitude Determination & Control; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Spacecraft Autonomy and Space Mission Automation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Qualified autoclave or OoA prepreg tapes can be applied simultaneously with dry unidirectional (UD) tapes in an automated process. The presence of dry fibers throughout the layup before infusion allows improved breathing, removal of volatiles from prepreg, and improved compaction with only atmospheric pressure, mimicking the double vacuum debulk (DVD) process without the equipment. NONA resin is then introduced at ambient temperature to wet out all available contact surfaces and cure itself and the prepreg. The NONA epoxy resin uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure with no external heat required. The baseline NONA resin provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350F. Pairing NONA resin with a compatible prepreg a cure of both systems is achieved at room temperature. Because the cure occurs at room temperature, the NONA resin locks in its shape near room temperature, thus allowing the use of low-cost tooling materials, typically avoided because of high CTE.","Supporting NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, this project's technologies directly address requirements for new manufacturing processes and advanced materials for creating lightweight structures for heavy lift launch vehicles.

This innovation is relevant to NASA's need for compact, quiet, efficient, and long-lived sources of pressurized oxygen for atmosphere revitalization (AR) and EVA oxygen storage recharge.  Present AR equipment aboard International Space Station (ISS) consists of power-intensive, noisy compressors that have service lives less than 2 years.  Proton's proposed electrolyzer stack will eliminate the need for these compressors, by developing a cell stack that can produce 3600 psia oxygen via electrochemical compression.  This innovation results in a quiet, efficient, solid state device with no internal moving parts to service or fail.","Based on Proton's unique experience in commercializing PEM electrolyzers, transitioning to NASA, DOD, and developing commercial applications are important outcomes of this technology development effort.  The NASA applications for this technology are several:  providing pressurized oxygen refill capability to a number of scenarios including ISS, EMU, and future lunar surface systems.  Civilian commercial derivatives of this technology would enable a variety of energy storage applications.  High pressure electrolysis provides the key capability for volumetrically dense hydrogen and oxygen storage.  Impacts of this technology on military operations include enabling high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle operations and a variety of underwater vehicle operations, most notably UUV's.  The similarity between the high altitude and undersea applications is that both require the storage of oxidant, in addition to the storage of fuel.  High altitude UAV's can be used for missile defense, surveillance, and communications.  Undersea applications include long-term distributed data gathering with long endurance buoys, transport of special forces personnel, and mine neutralization among others.  In short, the proposed effort will support the development of an enabling technology for a variety of applications that require high pressure hydrogen and/or oxygen for energy storage and life support.","The proposed technology will also enable commercial regenerative fuel cell (RFC) systems, which will benefit from high pressure electrolysis for compact reactant storage.  Proton is working to commercialize RFC systems for a variety of terrestrial energy storage applications. In particular, Proton's RFC technology has been demonstrated as a replacement for lead acid batteries in telecom backup power systems.

Inappropriate pilot action for healthy aircraft, control failures, and vehicle impairment are frequent contributors to LOC accidents. These accidents could be reduced if an on-board system was available to immediately guide the pilot to a safe flight condition (including cases of control failure or vehicle impairment). Barron Associates previously developed and demonstrated (in pilot-in-the-loop simulations) a system for finding appropriate control input sequences for upset recovery, and for cueing pilots to follow these sequences.The proposed work adds several innovative capabilities to the existing architecture and includes flight test verification of the efficacy.  One of the most significant current enhancements is the addition of adaptation to address off-nominal vehicle responses.  Off-nominal vehicle responses can occur for a number of reasons including adverse onboard conditions (e.g., actuator failures, engine failures, or airframe damage) and external hazards, especially icing.  The addition of adaptation capabilities enables the system to provide appropriate upset recovery guidance in cases of off-nominal vehicle response. The recovery guidance system is also specifically designed to be robust to variations in pilot dynamic behavior as well as to provide robustness to pilot deviations from the recommended recovery strategies.","One of the overarching goals of the NASA Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) is to improve aircraft safety as the NextGen Air Transportation System matures. As loss of control accounts for a significant percentage of the fatal accident rate, developing systems that improve the response to upset conditions in flight are critical to achieving this goal. This research addresses three of the top challenges for the AOSP including: (1) the Airspace Technology Demonstrations (ATD) Project area of Technologies for Assuring Safe Aircraft Energy and Attitude State (TASEAS), (2) the Real-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance (RSSA) area of ""reducing flight risk in areas of attitude and energy aircraft state awareness"", and (3), with direct application to autonomous recovery, the Safe Autonomous Systems Operation (SASO) Project. The DAGUR system provides robust recoveries for nominal and impaired aircraft as well as robust performance in the face of variations in pilot behavior (Challenges 1 and 2). The provided closed-loop guidance is equally applicable to autonomous vehicle upset recovery (Challenge 3).","The immediate application for the proposed technology is in the civilian aerospace sector to improve aviation safety and security. However, the technology will readily extend to military aviation and space exploration. The increasing prevalence of autonomous and remotely-piloted UAVs for military and homeland security applications, their consideration for terrestrial science missions and planetary exploration in the near-to-mid term, and the likely ubiquitous commercial roles of these vehicles in the longer-term, provide numerous opportunities for the transition of the proposed SBIR technologies. Application potential is not limited to the aerospace industry, but is extensible to all systems where a human operator can be assisted by an automated agent or where an autonomous system could benefit from an on-board upset recovery solution.",Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Man-Machine Interaction; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Simulation & Modeling,Real-Time Safety Assurance under Unanticipated and Hazardous Conditions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Historical databases work reasonably well when applied to existing or conventional designs, however, they fail to predict accurately the weights and loads associated with unconventional designs (like the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator).  There exists a need to augment existing historical databases with a physics-based methodology/capability for predicting the weights and loads of unconventional designs. In the current proposal, M4 Engineering will continue to streamline the structural layout process, improve the overall user experience, and develop a comprehensive suite of capabilities in an effort to build a complete weight statement for unconventional (and conventional) conceptual wing and fuselage designs.  The main goal for this effort will be to develop a software tool capable of generating weight and load responses for unconventional designs from physics-based structural analysis simulations.","The first NASA application occurred during the Phase I effort when the proposed methodology was applied to the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator.  The next NASA application will be performed as a demonstration example during the Phase II development.  It is also expected that this technology will be directly applicable to other research projects planned at LaRC and GRC.  Examples of potential application include any future unconventional configuration or next generation system requiring accurate and rapid weight prediction.

Current methods to mitigate the hazard are short-term, and there is a need for an insulative and durable coating on the metallic components. In Phase I, working with a supplier of space suits to NASA, we demonstrated proof-of-concept of a novel Self-Healing Coating (SHC) system which is highly insulative and is capable of healing surface damages at ambient conditions. The three-layered self-healing coating was applied on flat panels of stainless steel, titanium and aluminum. In addition to self-healing, the ability of the coating to resist impact damage was demonstrated. Building upon the successful Phase I demonstration, the focus of the Phase II effort will be to further test and optimize the SHC system and implement on a prototype metallic bearing. The Phase II objectives include: (i) ensuring that the self-healing coating system can be used in space environment; (ii) determining the least coating thickness that will provide both self-healing and electrical resistance; (iii) developing a suitable process for depositing the coating on components of different geometries; and (iv) developing a property and performance data set that best predicts useful life of the coating. Successful development will culminate in applying the SHC system on a prototype component and performing the needed qualification testing. We anticipate achieving a TRL of 6 by the end of the Phase II program. The work plan includes preparing coating solutions and coating flat test panels; conducting performance tests and optimizing coating thickness using coated plates; qualifying the SHC system for use in a space environment; developing a property and performance data set that best predicts useful life of the coating; applying SHC system to a prototype hardware; and evaluating performance of coating on prototype hardware.","A host of metallic bearings on different components of the SSA such as helmet, neck, wrist, arm, waist, leg, and boot can benefit from the developed self-healing insulative coating. A SHC system on metallic substrates which exhibits self-healing at room temperature, provides electrical insulation, and mitigates shock hazard, is a unique NASA application. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there is no commercially available coating solution to meet NASA's requirement. As the proposed SHC system is meant to satisfy a specific NASA need for a durable and insulative coating on the metallic components of a space suit, the technology is applicable for present and future NASA missions, such as spacesuits for Extravehicular Activities (EVA), Portable Life Support System (PLSS), Mars 2020 Rover Mission, Asteroid Redirect Mission 2020s and Human Exploration of Mars. The focus of the current effort is on applying the coating on stainless steel, titanium and aluminum.","Potential commercial applications for a self-healing, electrically-insulating coating system include uses where protection is needed against either shock hazards or corrosion, or even physical damage. The coating technology is a potential solution for being used as a chromate-free coating system that is capable of self-healing cuts and scratches at ambient temperatures without any external heat or stimulus, thereby limiting corrosion. A SHC system on aluminum is particularly relevant as it is the structural material in the aviation industry where presently hexavalent chromium – based coatings are used, despite significant risk to human health. Currently, there are no qualified complete non-chrome coating systems, thus presenting an unmet need and an opportunity for the coating system being developed in this program. Introduction of a barrier coating with room temperature self-healing function will facilitate establishing a chromate-free system with performance equivalent to that of a chromate-containing coating. Accordingly, the SHC system would not only be an environmentally-friendly alternative to current coating systems that contain hexavalent chromium, but it would also result in significant cost savings as fewer aircraft would be forced out of operation for maintenance and repairs due to the coating system's self-healing capabilities.",Coatings/Surface Treatments; Polymers; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Smart/Multifunctional Materials,Space Suit Pressure Garment and Airlock Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The higher the temperature and pressure, the higher the thrust and specific impulse. For ground test facilities that will be heating the gas to temperatures up to 4400F (2425C), the number of materials that can be used is severely limited. The need for compatibility with hot hydrogen limits the field even further. In Phase I, Ultramet designed, fabricated, and tested a system for heating high-pressure hydrogen to temperatures approaching 2400C. The system included a foam-based heating element, an insulation package, and a carefully designed multiwalled pressure vessel that could contain the hot gas at pressures up to 2000 psig. The Phase I effort demonstrated the suitability of the selected materials and the overall design approach. Phase II will focus on scaling up the system, fabricating and testing hardware, and laying out a clear path to a system that can deliver hot hydrogen at flow rates up to 40 lbm/sec (the highest flow rate currently of interest to NASA) at pressures up to 2000 psig. The overall system will be composed of multiple modules, and each module will be comprised of multiple heating elements. Because the design is modular, flows higher than 40 lbm/sec can be achieved. The modular design also minimizes programmatic risk because it will allow the use of materials at higher technology readiness levels and subsystems that do not have to be scaled up.","As a source of high temperature, high-pressure hydrogen, the primary NASA application for this technology is ground test equipment for testing nuclear-thermal and solar-thermal propulsion systems. High-power NTP systems will benefit a variety of NASA missions that involve long transit times and/or the need to enter orbit at the destination. High-power NTP systems will also benefit crewed missions beyond the Moon because they will result in shorter trip times, reducing the consumables load and reducing exposure to cosmic radiation. As a system for heating flowing propellants, the technology can be used as an igniter for monopropellant and non-hypergolic bipropellant engines. Such engines can be used for booster-class engines, reaction control engines on launch vehicles, and main and attitude control engines on satellites and interplanetary spacecraft. As a system for heating gases and liquids in general, the technology can be used in hypersonic wind tunnels.","Military applications mirror many of the NASA applications, especially in terms of igniters for engines on launch vehicles and satellite propulsion systems.

To meet this need, we propose to develop a reconfigurable two-phase pumped loop that can accommodate a complex network of evaporators and multiple radiators.  The pumped loop has two performance features: (1) reliable refrigerant circulation with a mechanical pump even when the refrigerant flow exiting the radiators is a two-phase flow with significant vapor quality, and (2) reliable flow distribution among evaporators to minimize flow maldistribution due to heat load variation.  These features are achieved by a combination of an innovative loop configuration and Creare's proven enabling components.  In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of reliable refrigerant circulation through building and testing a proof-of-concept two-phase pumped loop with key features, optimizing the pumped loop design, and predicting its performance.  In Phase II, we will build and test an integrated pumped loop with multiple evaporators and heat sinks, optimize the pumped loop components and operating parameters, demonstrate its steady state and transient performance in representative thermal environments, and deliver it to NASA JPL for further performance evaluation.","The proposed thermal control technology will be ideal for remote sensing science instruments in future missions. It will maintain a constant instrument temperature under widely varied heat loads and environmental temperatures. More specifically, the technology will be uniquely suitable for a Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission that aims to survey Earth's surface water and map ocean surface height with greater detail than previously recorded.  The two-phase pumped loop is also ideal for maintaining a uniform temperature in waveguide manifold and its temperature stability.  The thermal control technology can also be used in future spacecraft with applications that include space telescopes, satellites, and exploration vehicles on Mars, the Moon, asteroid exploration, and high-altitude air balloons. The Phase II pumped loop prototype will be delivered to NASA JPL to allow NASA engineers to assess the unique capability of Creare's robust pumped loop and its potential for further science mission.","The reliable pumped loop technology also has applications to advance two-phase thermal control systems in commercial and military satellites and aircraft, as well as high power electronics systems.",Passive Systems,Thermal Control Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Guided wave techniques offer a viable means for composite NDE to identify foreign body impact leading to hidden damage in the form of delaminations, disbonds, crushed core, kissing bonds, matrix cracking or for incipient micro-crack accumulation due to fatigue or thermal damage. In addition to corrosion and fatigue cracking in metals, guided wave inspection is also being actively investigated to meet the urgent NDE demands arising from the increasing deployment of titanium diffusion bonds and bonded joints in metal composite hybrids employed in spaceflight vehicle construction.

The OCM will be capable of self-regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses tissue oxygenation level. We will evaluate the sorbent performance in a breadboard bench-scale prototype under simulated microgravity/partial gravity exploration atmospheres and carry out a 1,500 hr longevity test (at a minimum) to determine its mechanical durability.

(SMI) and partners are developing ultraviolet (UV) photodetection devices with high sensitivity, low noise and fast response time.  The technical approach is based on nanowires of the wide bandgap semiconductor ZnMgO.  The resulting devices will be blind to solar radiation, and have a tunable cut-off frequency which can be adjusted by the Mg content.  The resulting photodetection devices will also be low-cost, and compatible with a wide range of device materials, including silicon substrates and silicon integrated circuitry.  During Phase I, the SBIR team demonstrated technical feasibility of a simple process for fabricating the photodetectors from vertically aligned arrays of nanowires.  These Phase I achievements enable low cost production of nanowire based photodetection devices, using standard microelectronic techniques.  The Phase I results will ultimately enable high volume production of nanowire devices, on large area substrates, and enable integration with other microelectronic circuitry.","NASA's interest in UV photodetectors includes spectroscopic analysis for planetary and atmospheric studies; temperature and composition analysis of young stars; and composition, density and temperature measurements of the interstellar medium.  These missions require UV detectors and detector arrays with high sensitivity, low noise, fast response time and high spectral selectivity.  Since these observations are frequently made from platforms operating above Earth's atmosphere (which absorbs UV), the photodetectors must also be small size, low mass, low power, and low cost to make the best use of limited payloads and NASA resources.  Extended operation in space also requires the devices to be radiation resistance, temperature resistance, highly reliable and have long lifetime.","Photodetectors are used in a wide range of applications for commercial, industrial, scientific and military markets.  Photodetectors based on wide bandgap semiconductor materials operate in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral range.  UV photodetectors can be used in spectroscopy, optical communications and optical data storage.  Because of their large bandgap, these detectors are blind to visible and solar radiation.  Visible/solar blind UV photodetectors are useful for monitoring and detection of high temperature heat sources in ambient light, such as for flame detectors or for detecting the exhaust signatures of hostile aircraft and missiles.","Detectors (see also Sensors); Manufacturing Methods; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ultraviolet","Detector Technologies for UV, X-Ray, Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Instruments   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Specifically, engine developers are in need of a manufacturing technology that is capable of generating cooling channels in liquid rocket nozzles and combustion chambers at low cost, while supporting increasingly complex designs (see appended letter of support from Aerojet Rocketdyne).This Phase II project will result in a reduced cost flexible technology that is ready to support the development and fabrication of advanced channel wall rocket liners and combustors.This will be achieved by adapting a novel manufacturing technology that can machine delicate and complex features in metals and ceramics.  This technology was demonstrated to be feasible to support the advancement of channel rocket design by making more complex designs manufacturable while reducing lead time and manufacturing cost.It was shown to reduce machine time by 90% when compared to milling the same cooling channels in stainless steel.  Advancing engine performance can be achieved through more optimal combustor and liner cooling, however engine designers are currently limited in what can be designed due to current technology slitting saw or end mill capabilities.  The proposed technology overcomes this limitation and supports the design and fabrication of highly complex and delicate features.  It can easily be scaled up to support SSME class engines. At the end of Phase II, this technology will be ready to support the development of and production of channel wall rockets that incorporate more complex cooling features than are currently feasible to manufacture.  The technology will made more user friendly and efficient to implement, and a manufacturing workstation layout and cost will be developed to support both small and SSME class engines.","There are several NASA applications that may benefit from the proposed technology development.

The prototype not only proved the initial concept but significantly reduced risk and dramatically increases our ability to deliver a fully functional ssLAPSS in Phase II.  The proposed innovation simulates AM0 response of single, dual, 3, 4, 5 and 6 junction solar cells by using an array of different wavelength LEDs in close proximity to the solar panel string under test.  The ssLAPSS is adjustable in spectrum for selected wavelengths and Class A, the highest standard, for spatial uniformity and temporal stability.  The ssLAPSS consists of LED modules that are repositioned in a mounting frame to test many strings on a panel in sequence.

This improved system performance is due primarily to the narrow transmit signal beamwidth at the optical wavelength, which allows for more efficient delivery of the transmit signal to the receiver.  The problem of pointing a laser signal can in general be decomposed into the problems of (i) stabilizing the optical line of sight and (ii) providing the appropriate pointing reference to the receiver location.  Optical Physics Company (OPC) has adapted the precision interferometric star tracker it is currently developing under several DoD contracts for deep space lasercom beam pointing applications.   The OPC interferometric star tracker can also be used to provide precise attitude measurements to the spacecraft for navigation and orbit determination purposes.  The current concept for the beam pointing is for a star tracker to be mounted opposite to the downlink beam boresight.  This configuration has the advantage that, for outer planet missions, the sun will almost always be away from the tracker, thus allowing the tracker to have a direct view of the sky.","Application most relevant to this project is the use of star trackers for spacecraft. OPC is building a cubesat star tracker at this time to deliver to a DOD customer. The performance is power dependent - ranging from sub arcsecond to 2 arcsecond accuracy. The package is small - 250 cc in volume. Another visible band star tracker application was proposed to the Navy recently under the SBIR program. This proposal has been selected for award. The application involves space situational awareness, specifically to develop, build and deliver a version of the interferometric tracker capable of detecting and tracking dim objects. Another application is GPS denied navigation which has increasingly become a more acute need in the past few years. Customers are GPS denied navigation systems include virtually the whole armed forces. Our approach is primarily tailored to airborne platforms such as fighter aircraft, ground attack aircraft, next generation bomber, Tier II and Tier II+ UAVs, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ICBMs, and missiles including hypersonic missiles. OPC is currently funded under Navy RIF to build and flight test a stellar inertial navigation system prototype.","The most immediate application of this technology is in deep space optical communications with the main customer in this area being NASA. NASA Draft Communication and Navigation Systems Roadmap Technology Area 05 dated November 2010 states in reference to optical communications that ""longer term, reliance on beacons should be eliminated."" Our technology offers the ability to communicate from a near Earth or deep space (up to 40 AU) spacecraft platform using a narrow beam aimed precisely at a beaconless receiver. We can consider both near Earth and deep space applications for the proposed technology. For applications in deep space ranges (up to 40 AU- which is the radius of the solar system), we can name the JPL project called deep-space optical terminals (DOT) as our primary customer at this time. This project was initiated in 2009. DOT involves concept and design of terminals that can handle higher data rates with lower mass and power than the Mars Laser Communication Demonstration (MLCD). OPC has also been funded recently for a study by JPL to investigate if its interferometric star tracker can be used for a spinning spacecraft. The study findings have shown the feasibility of adapting the interferometric tracker to provide accurate attitude information for a rapidly spinning spacecraft.","Navigation & Guidance; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Advanced Celestial Navigation Techniques and Systems for Deep-Space Applications   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Non-nuclear generation of the desired hydrogen flowrates and temperatures for ground test of NTP components and subsystems is problematic. ACENT Laboratories is developing a Hydrogen Wave Heater (HWH) for this application. The HWH is an innovative embodiment of a wave rotor. Wave rotors can be used as a primary compressor/heater or as a topping compressor/heater to multiply the temperature and pressure of an existing compression or heating process.

In addition to the new modules and architecture built by Illinois Rocstar, we have identified a number of available tools that fit well with our vision of the final ICED product. Open-source tools from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory CAEBAT project and proprietary, but government-funded tools from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) will be modularized and brought into the ICED system, ensuring that the Phase II value we bring to NASA is focused on developing new capabilities such as predictive tortuosity modeling, while assembling a tool that contains the most advanced battery modeling capabilities available.Advanced science and modeling tools are rarely accepted by industry without (i) support behind them and (ii) ease of installation and use. Thus, we are focusing on bringing scientific software to industry in forms where commercial-quality, easily installed, and graphically-interfaced tools are needed by those who have no interest in developing software, and providing open-source source code to those that want it. We focus on generating predictive, advanced scientific tools to bear on problems of national interest. We bring a commercially-supported environment to the table for them, which is a service that the national laboratories cannot provide themselves. In the end, we will produce a significant advance in areas of battery modeling, while integrating multiple tools across other sources using our open-source Illinois Rocstar Multiphysics Application Coupling Toolkit (IMPACT). Our business model for providing this software to industry, government, and academia is significantly different than how most larger simulation software companies operate, and we believe has a significant value proposition to all parties that can benefit from advanced battery modeling and simulation.","Advancing power and energy storage systems for space technology cross-cutting applications has been an active area of research for NASA for the past several years. This broad area encompasses a number of subareas addressing the generation of power and/or storage of energy within the space environment. Such subareas include high energy density batteries, advanced photovoltaics, nuclear power systems, and modeling and simulation. Of particular interest are electrochemical systems, such as batteries, fuel cells, and electrolyzers, to which ICED is directly applicable. ICED supports design decisions and focuses on improving the correlation between experiments and predictions by developing and validating multiscale, physics-based models. The end goal of the ICED simulation suite is to reduce the development time of future systems and be applicable to the demands of battery R&D and space exploration. Inherent in the base system is the ability to perform simple simulations, akin to those currently available in commercial software packages, but at no cost to the user (any user, since the base system will be open-source). This Phase II project will add more advanced simulation techniques and target applications will be licensed for a fee to interested parties (all modules will be available to NASA under SBIR rules). The infrastructure is built in such a way as to integrate a wide range of applications, both currently available and yet-to-be developed.","Energy storage technologies are ubiquitous today. Cell phones, laptop computers, electric cars, alternative energy (wind, solar, etc), and many other consumer, business, and defense applications of advanced batteries exist. There are thousands of individual companies and academic institutions performing research in support of better, safer, longer lasting batteries for these applications, and ICED can assist design engineers in their quest for better batteries and shorter time-to-market. The ICED framework will not be specific to any NASA code, computing environment, or battery. We will address the general battery device design community, offering the system to industry and other government environments (DoD, DOE, etc.). The battery market is ripe with opportunity. It is permeated with small businesses that could benefit from a low-cost solution to their simulations needs, and they are growing at a rate of approximately 10% per year. Our partnership with Xerion Advanced Battery Corp will provide us insights into the battery industry not otherwise available to us.

Preliminary fatigue results generated in Phase I look promising and analytical results indicate a fatigue life improvement of over 100% may be possible. Cavitation peening uses ultra-high pressure water jets to generate intense clouds of cavitation bubbles that collapse on the work piece generating shock waves that cold work the material. No particles are use, the process produces no waste and adds no weight to the part and is very inexpensive. The new technology is currently being evaluated by Boeing, Sikorsky, Bell and Rolls-Royce for aerospace applications and is proving particularly effective for gears. The company is also working with major bearing manufacturers Timken and SKF to investigate the value of the technology for bearing applications. The proposed Phase II work would refine the process, address readiness level issues and generate the fatigue data that is critical to wide spread acceptance of the cavitation peening technology.","The target application for NASA programs is primarily aircraft gas turbines, particularly high performance engines where the added bearing rating could be utilized to increase engine output, reduce fuel consumption and maintenance costs and increase safety and reliability.  Other NASA applications could be any rotating components where weight or power consumption is an issue, such as motors, rotors, pumps and wheels. The process would also be applicable to new bearing materials and non-bearing applications such as airframe structures, gears, drivetrain components and any component where fatigue and flaw tolerance are issues of concern.","Bearings are a fundamental mechanical component used throughout transportation, energy generation and manufacturing. Improving bearing load ratings in a cost effective manner could have a significant impact on automobile fuel economy, wind turbine power generation, aircraft engine efficiency and reliability, manufacturing machinery reliability, and just about any other rotating component. With all these applications, the global bearing market is a worth $42B/year, with more than 75 bearing manufacturers. The cavitation peening technology is also widely applicable to other materials and components, such aluminum airframes, carburized gears, titanium rotors and disks, steel structures and just about any place where fatigue is a concern.",Actuators & Motors; Air Transportation & Safety; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Generation; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Metallics; Processing Methods; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine; Structures,Propulsion Efficiency-Propulsion Materials and Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Namely, smoothly deployed from compact stowage with one single, continuous sweep of motion, a total PV surface area up to and beyond 4000~m2 (the area associated with 1~MW power) is provided by two wings, with mechanical performance objectives also met.  The PV cells are mounted on flexible strups that, assembled, constitute array disk pie segments between straight ribs and smoothly wrap between the latter on the central hub for stowage.  The surface shears in stowage effected by this kinematics are absorbed by shear compliant hinge strips between the strips, and the PV cells are mounted on the latter ro precisely align in the roll.  Deployed, the surface segments between the ribs are pretensioned with catenaries on the outer perimeter, supported by the rib tips which extend outward.  A full mechanical design is developed to complete concept validation for a pair of wings 2000 m2 each, fabrication and operational issues are explored and addressed, and a working prototype wing is built to complete concept validation.","NASA has been spearheading the strategy to develop a robust and advanced space infrastructure that, in the foreseeable future, could support the extensive exploration of the solar system and render human presence in space sustainable and affordable. One of the key technologies in this drive is solar electric propulsion (SEP), a technology with a mass efficiency an order of magnitude higher than conventional chemical engines. SEP which has already supported some missions (e.g., Deep Space 1 in 1998 and Dawn in 2007) will revolutionize navigation (i.e., velocity change, orbit revision) capabilities for spacecraft of traditional architectures. However, to be powerful enough to support equipment on a scale necessary for the infrastructure behind human presence is space, SEP has to be scaled up which directly requires solar arrays capable of producing up to 1~MW of power, the long term goal targeted by this NASA solicitation. It is this future market (currently) driven by NASA for large solar arrays that the product developed by the presently proposed effort targets.","For the large solar array structure here proposed, markets other than what has just been outlined will also arise. Some non-scientific space applications such as defense (the military use of space) and planetary defense (defending Earth against impact by space objects such as asteroids) have traditionally time and again entertained power-hungry mission scenarios. With the actual availability of a light weight, reliable, and easily scalable truly large solar array such as the one herein proposed, actual needs for this product in these additional markets will certainly arise.","Deployment; Generation; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

(ACT) proposes to develop titanium/water heat pipes suitable for Spacecraft Fission Power applications.  NASA is currently examining small fission power reactors design, such as the Kilopower, which aims to provide roughly 1 kW of electric power. Kilopower plans to use titanium/water heat pipes to remove the waste heat from the cold end of the convertors.  Previous water heat pipe designs for space fission power are not suitable, since they cannot operated in a vertical orientation, which is necessary for ground testing of Kilopower.  The overall objective of the Phase I and II programs is to develop a titanium/water heat pipe radiator suitable for Spacecraft Fission Power, such as Kilopower. To meet this objective, the following items must be achieved: demonstrate the ability to transport heat over a long distance from the Stirling cold end to the radiator, design and fabricate a heat pipe radiator for integration into the Kilopower system and identify the best wick design for the varied operating conditions of the Kilopower system. The principle objective of the Phase II project will be to develop full-scale titanium water heat pipes that will be suitable for testing in the Kilopower demonstration unit.","The immediate NASA application is for space fission nuclear reactors that utilize Stirling converters or thermoelectrics for power conversion.  NASA Glenn Research Center is currently developing a  1kWe Fission Power System with a 15 year design life that could be available for a 2020.  An electrically heated test of the complete reactor/energy conversion system (except for the titanium/water heat pipes) is planned for in the next few years test.  This test will use an electrically heated depleted uranium core, and will help validate the overall system design. The next step will be to life test the complete system, from the electrically heated uranium core to the titanium/water heat pipes.  ACT will design, fabricate, and test the titanium/water heat pipes for the Kilopower life test on the proposed program.  At the end of the Phase II program, these heat pipes will be delivered to NASA Glenn Research Center.  Assuming that the Phase II program is successful, ACT then plans to assist in the Kilopower life test on a Phase III program.","One application is for satellite thermal control for military and commercial customers.  As satellite powers continue to increase, the required radiator panel size and mass must also increase.  Since the radiator size scales with T^4, switching from ammonia to water heat pipes would increase the allowable temperature, and significantly reduce the radiator size.  In addition to large (communications) satellites, SmallSats and CubeSats could also benefit from scaled down heat pipes developed on the proposed program.  CubeSats are made up of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm units, and titanium/water heat pipes can simplify ground testing. There are three disadvantages of CCHPs for CubeSats: (1) They are relatively expensive,  (2) They are relatively massive, and designed to carry heat over several meters, (3) Orientations during Thermal Vacuum testing are constrained by the heat pipes. In contrast, the titanium water heat pipes developed on the current program can be scaled down so that they are small, low mass, and relatively cheap.  They can also be tested in any orientation, and can be embedded in High Conductivity (HiK™) aluminum plates, to give a high conductivity baseplate that is extremely inexpensive compared to pyrolytic graphite.",Conversion; Passive Systems,Space Nuclear Power Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

For high precision attitude determination system, one of the identified needs is to provide milli-arcsecond class pointing for large space telescopes.  Optical Physics Company (OPC) has developed a novel interferometric star tracker than can provide milli-arcsecond class accuracy for future NASA space missions.  The interferometric is similar to a standard star tracker, but with the addition of the interferometer subassembly in front of the imaging lens. This subassembly converts incoming starlight into a set of quadrature signals with sinusoidal dependence on the starlight incident angle.  These quadrature signals are used to determine star position, rather than the centroiding used in standard start trackers which enables the high accuracy.  OPC has designed and is presently manufacturing a compact (0.35U), lightweight (0.35 kg) and low power (<4W) interferometric star tracker for the Air Force.","Application most relevant to this project is the use of star trackers for spacecraft. OPC is building a cubesat star tracker at this time to deliver to a DOD customer. The performance is power dependent - ranging from sub arcsecond to 2 arcsecond accuracy. The package is small - 250 cc in volume. Another visible band star tracker application was proposed to the Navy recently under the SBIR program. This proposal has been selected for award. The application involves space situational awareness, specifically to develop, build and deliver a version of the interferometric tracker capable of detecting and tracking dim objects. Another application is GPS denied navigation which has increasingly become a more acute need in the past few years. Customers are GPS denied navigation systems include virtually the whole armed forces. Our approach is primarily tailored to airborne platforms such as fighter aircraft, ground attack aircraft, next generation bomber, Tier II and Tier II UAVs, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ICBMs, and missiles including hypersonic missiles. OPC is currently funded under Navy RIF to build and flight test a stellar inertial navigation system prototype.","This high accuracy tracker can be used for precision pointing of the large telescope. Its field of view is much wider than the fine guidance sensors (FGS) currently employed by HST and JWST. The JWST FGS, for example, has a field of view of only 0.04 x 0.04 degrees. With such a small field, fainter guide stars need to be used which then drives the sensor sensitivity and noise requirements. For the interferometric star tracker proposed, the angular sensitivity is defined by the angular period of the grating LSI, which can be independent of the field of view. This allows a wide field sensor to achieve similar level (milliarcsecond) of pointing performance, which then allows the use of brighter guide stars reduce the demand on sensor sensitivity. Another application is as reference sensor for laser beam pointing: A celestial reference based beam pointing eliminates the need for having a ground based beacon for return beam pointing which significantly reduces the operational complexity (power, pointing, regulatory compliance) and improves link performance (no round trip delay). OPC has also been funded recently for a study by JPL to investigate if its interferometric star tracker can be used for a spinning spacecraft. The study findings have shown the feasibility of adapting the interferometric tracker to provide accurate attitude information for a rapidly spinning spacecraft.",GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring),"Guidance, Navigation and Control   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Digital Solid State Propulsion (DSSP) is developing propulsion for CubeSats and will leverage existing research efforts into a new system for NASA. A key technology identified in the phase I solicitation is a Cubesat propulsion system that will enable deep-space CubeSats, which operate outside of Earth's magnetic field, to desaturate reaction wheels. These types of missions cannot use the magnetorquers that are common on the Earth orbiting CubeSats that are popular today. DSSP proposes continued development of a multi-pulse solid rocket motor (MPM), which uses green, safe Electric Solid Propellants (ESPs).  This MPM for CubeSats will enable desaturation of reaction wheels on 6U and 12U interplanetary missions with lower mass systems than conventional cold gas based solutions. The baseline performance requirement for this application is estimated to be 0.3 N*sec of impulse per pulse of the thruster in a short time and with low power impact on the satellite. This value is determined from a reaction wheel that has a 30 mN*m*s maximum momentum and a maximum thruster moment arm of 10 cm. DSSP already has a CubeSat Agile Propulsion System (CAPS) at TRL8, a close relative of which deployed safely on SpinSat from the ISS in November 2014, and DSSP's experience at qualifying and delivering flight hardware for that program can be leveraged for NASA. The SpinSat mission has already demonstrated that ESPs are so insensitive to accidental ignition that they can be launched as soft stow cargo to the pressurized section of the ISS and that the new MPM for CubeSats could even potentially be brought aboard the ISS also for later deployment.","Potential NASA applications include deep space missions (beyond LEO) that utilize 6U CubeSats and larger. Though none have yet flown, many missions of this type are proposed. These include iiSat of MSFC, LWADI of Goddard, and Biosentinel of Ames just to name a few.","We have already teamed with the standard CubeSat bus manufacturer, Pumpkin Inc., and in-space propulsion manufacturer, Moog-ISP, for commercial introduction of our thrusters into the small satellite community.

Together, these technologies will boost ion thruster performance and life beyond current art.  Reservoir cathodes have demonstrated, in microwave tube environments, lifetimes beyond 100,000 hours with no drop in output.  Scandate impregnated cathodes have demonstrated emission beyond 10 amps/cm2 at 800 degrees Cb(W) and emission levels over 100 amps/cm2 at under 1000 degrees Cb(W).  This is over 200 degrees below comparable all-tungsten impregnated cathodes, the cathode normally used for space propulsion.  High temperature is the great enemy of long cathode life.  Longer-life cathodes are needed for interplanetary and lunar missions, as well as earth-escape and near-earth maneuvers.  In Phase II, we shall continue developing the hybrid scandate reservoir cathode and perfect our stand-alone scandium-doped tungsten cathodes.  We shall continue to improve our hollow reservoir technology.  Then we will combine the two technologies into an integrated module.","Mars and lunar cargo missions would benefit, as would the upcoming JUNO mission to Jupiter.  Also, piloted interplanetary mission become feasible with sufficient cathode output and life.  Earth transfer, station-keeping and earth-escape should occur by all-electric means.  It would lower cost, size, mass, and complexity.  This technology would also help NASA's conventional cathode applications.  Improved cathodes are needed for microwave amplifiers for space communications.  The cathode is the performance-limiting component in these devices.  A higher output cathode is especially needed for terahertz amplifiers and sources.  The so-called ""terahertz gap"" is a vast region of frequency space that is unutilized, largely because of cathode technology limitations.  Scandate cathodes are the key to accessing that space.  In short, NASA needs higher bit rates, more power, and higher frequency for space communications and a host of other applications, and these are largely limited by the cathode.","All the applications described in NASA commercial applications apply to non-NASA markets except interplanetary space travel.  More powerful thrusters are needed in commercial satellites for orbital transfer.  These would allow all-electric propulsion for larger, heavier satellites operating in geo-synchronous orbits.  All-electric propulsion lowers mass and size and raises efficiency.Other areas include Department of Defense radars and communications.  This is the largest market for high-performance cathodes.  The cathodes proposed here would increase life, performance, frequency data rates and resolution in these systems.  Nongovernmental applications lie in high-speed x-ray tomography, electron beam-stimulated lasers, especially at UV, and commercial geo-synchronous satellite downlinks and propulsion.  Hollow cathodes can be used as a source of high current density electrons for applications such as electron beam welding or as a source of electrons in corrosive environments.  The cathodes proposed here are capable of creating electron beams of 1000 amps/cm2 or more.  Even though the energy spread is high, the extraordinary current densities make for an extremely bright beam.","Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Lifetime Testing; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Metallics; Nanomaterials; Spacecraft Main Engine",High Power Electric Propulsion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Specifically, we propose to develop a 20 W power amplifier with an associated PAE of 60% operating over the 31.5 to 34 GHz band. This will be accomplished by employing two major innovations. First, we plan to utilize wide bandgap Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) device technology to fabricate our high-efficiency MMICs. Operating at a higher voltage (typically 20-28 V versus 4-5 V for GaAs), GaN permits power densities which are 5-10 times higher than GaAs or InP. In addition to a higher power density, high-voltage operation results in lower matching and cell combining losses, making these MMICs more efficient. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a switching mode of operation (Class-F) to enhance the device efficiency. While this method has demonstrated PAE levels of >80% at 2 GHz, these levels have not yet been realized at Ka-band frequencies. Computer simulations, contained in this proposal, indicate that by using this method, device PAE levels ranging up to 73% are possible at 32 GHz. Furthermore, this was verified by benchmark data from at least one GaN foundry showing a device, operating in Class-F, with a PAE of 80% at 3 GHz. Finally, simulations at Ka-band frequencies indicate that even with circuit losses, we can still maintain the efficiency (PAE) at or very close to 60%. The layout and performance of a multistage MMIC is included in this proposal, together with the overall SSPA configuration and performance.","Future NASA robotic and manned space exploration missions require high-efficiency power amplifiers, operating at Ka-band, for high data rate, long range space communications. Ka-band is the frequency of choice since it 1) provides more available bandwidth for higher data rates and 2) offers a theoretical benefit of 12 dB in EIRP compared with X-band (8.41 GHz) for the same antenna aperture size. Current technology can provide efficiency levels typically in the 20-25% range, and with packaging, combining networks and power conditioning, the efficiency rarely exceeds 15%. Employing GaN device technology together with switching mode (Class-F) device operation, our approach shows the potential to achieve PAE levels of 60%. Since the transmitter SSPA is usually the largest consumer of spacecraft DC power, our high-efficiency approach potentially represents a high-value proposition for NASA. In addition to this telecommunications application, NASA employs active Ka-band sensors (radars) for planetary landings and for a wide variety of Earth science missions, including Ka-band radar for cloud measurements, weather and climate variability studies. Since these sensors are airborne or satellite based, they would also benefit from this high-efficiency SSPA.","Applications for high-efficiency Ka-band amplifiers abound in the commercial segment as well as DoD.  These include SATCOM applications for the Army in the 29.5 to 31 GHz band to radar applications for all military services in the radar bands (33 to 38 GHz). For radar, high efficiency is particularly important for airborne applications, such as UAVs and fire control radars, where the prime power is limited. In the commercial segment, a massive market exists for high-efficiency SSPA to replace tubes in SatCom terminals. Additional markets include airborne terminals for commercial airlines using SatCom (27 to 31 GHz), emerging communications applications in the 38-39 GHz range, weather and environmental monitoring radars operating in the 34 to 36 GHz band, aircraft landing systems to enhance or replace Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) with EVFS at 35 GHz, Security and Surveillance radars for commercial, industrial and municipal applications and helicopter collision avoidance radars for brown-out and obstacle avoidance.  Further, this technology is scalable. By using power combining technology, we can provide high-efficiency amplifiers with output power levels well beyond the current goals of this program. For example, with the current 5 W chip and a 16-way combiner, power levels approaching 80 W are readily attainable.","Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Power Combiners/Splitters; Transmitters/Receivers",Long Range Space RF Telecommunications   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

T/EBCs are envisioned to protect the surface of Si-based ceramics against moisture-assisted, oxidation-induced ceramic recession. Current T/EBC systems have been demonstrated in long time exposures at ~2400 F substrate temperatures. However, their use at elevated temperatures (i.e., 2700 F substrate temperatures) is limited by the low temperature stability and high diffusion activity of current T/EBC materials. One approach to increase the temperature capability of these systems is the incorporation of multilayered T/EBC designs. In this effort, enhanced processing techniques will be employed to demonstrate the manufacture of robust T/EBC systems using a physical vapor deposition based processing approach which enables improved coating adhesion and advanced coating architectural, compositional, and microstructural control, as well as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) deposition. During this proposed Phase II effort, processing/property/performance relationships for the manufacture of the novel coating architectures will be determined. Optimized processing approaches will then be used to demonstrate the deposition of high temperature capable T/EBC systems coating onto components of interest to gas turbine engine manufacturers.","The development of high temperature T/EBC systems using DVTI's advanced coatings processing techniques will enable not only new T/EBC systems for use in future military and commercial aircraft platforms, but also new deposition processes to enable affordable coating application onto engine components. DVD coaters are envisioned to be small with low capital costs and tailorable volumes so that small volumes of parts can be deposited at low cost. The soft vacuum required and the high deposition rates also have the potential to facilitate assembly line like part coating for some geometries. The non-line-of-sight capabilities of this approach enable coatings to be applied onto complex components, thus expanding their use. The compositional and morphological flexibility of this approach would also enable other advanced functional coating systems to be applied such as thermal barrier coatings, wear and corrosion resistant coatings, thin film batteries, and damping coatings.","This research is anticipated to the development of result in robust processing approaches for environmental barrier coating systems that enable higher temperature capability and improved durability than current EBCs.

Additionally, CRG also sees a future for resulting commercialization of the adaptive liner technologies with commercial turbine generators, marine turbine systems, and the rail industry.","Acoustic/Vibration; Air Transportation & Safety; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Smart/Multifunctional Materials",Quiet Performance   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

David Green,green@psicorp.com,"20 New England Business Center, Andover, MA 01810 - 1077",(978) 689-0003,4,6,"Virtually all optical information gathering instruments benefit from greater aperture. For space-based instruments whose geometries are constrained by the launch vehicle, increasing the aperture requires deployment of some aspect of the optical train and then the precise and dynamically stable latching of the deployed components into defined positions. Existing latching technology is either too inaccurate, unstable, or expensive for use in many NASA small satellite missions.Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) has developed a simple, scalable latching technology by applying precision engineering approaches from previous developments that carefully manages the friction and strain energy stored internal to the latching mechanism. This latch was shown to have better than 350 nm repeatability and stability. During the Phase I activities, PSI has also shown that an alternative locking flexure approach could meet the needs of certain deployable optics applications. Both approaches provide a small, low-cost latching system with sub-micron positional repeatability and dynamic stability.During the Phase II efforts, PSI will further explore the performance of the mechanism and flexure approaches and then down-select to one approach for complete development. PSI will integrate the precision deployment lock into a complete set of flexures and mechanisms to provide NASA and other customers with a complete deployment system for a 6U cubesat. In addition to the precision latching components, the team will also address launch restraint, deployment actuation & rate control, and the associated deployment of the sun shade and light baffles that are critical to the operation of any high performance optical spacecraft instrument.The results of the Phase II will be an integrated system that will provide all of the deployable aspects needed for NASA and others to launch, deploy, and operate high performance optical instruments from cubesats, ESPA-sats, and other small spacecraft platforms.","Precision latching of deployed, robotically-emplaced, or astronaut-assembled optical components has long been a challenge for NASA observatories ranging in size from cubesat to Terrestrial Planet Imager. A family of low-cost but precise latch systems would have application to stellar and planetary observatories as well as atmospheric transmission measurement systems. In addition to data gathering, optical systems are also used for high bandwidth communications. Deployed, large area laser communications optics would increase data throughput from interplanetary missions as well as earth orbiting systems.A ready-to-go, integrated deployable cubesat telescope system would provide a capability available to many NASA scientists, enabling them to fly a wide range of planetary and stellar science instruments using a common, low-cost front end.","There are many Department of Defense and Intelligence Community applications of earth observing telescopes. The quality and quantiy of information gathered by these instruments would be greatly increased by larger, deployed apertures. As with the NASA instruments, these deployed telescope components must be precisely and stably locked into place when deployment is complete.The ground military also uses optical devices both for observation and communications. The proposed latch technology would also apply to rapidly erected telescope systems for ground soldiers, either for observations or for secure laser communications.In addition to government users, there are a wide range of commercial applications for precision restraint of optical components. As one example, PSI fabricates and sells ophthalmological diagnostic tools for retinal imaging. As different patients use the device, different headsets must be fitted to the front end of the device. A low cost means of precisely securing the different headsets would reduce the blurring of the retinal image and improve clinical outcomes.",Characterization; Deployment; Fasteners/Decouplers; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Structures; Telescope Arrays; Tribology,Precision Deployable Optical Structures and Metrology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The Phase I program results also surpassed the Phase I goals allowing the proposed Phase II program to further push the capabilities and design of the approach.  The main objective of the Phase II program is to further quantify the performance of the Attitude Control Piezo Adaptor (ACPA) and to expand it beyond the single axis Phase I testbed into a fully characterized three-axes prototype.  In addition, the Phase I analytical models will be enhanced into the three-axes system and utilized in the modeling, design, and testing of the control algorithms.  QorTek plans to team with Boeing Huntington Beach to fully test and quantify the performance of the three axis prototype.","Investment by NASA/NSF in SmallSats programs and projects is rapidly increasing.  As already identified in previous studies, as the scope of these missions increase there will be a corresponding increase in demand for high accuracy ACS capability.  This is especially true for cross formation flying, cross-link communications, and proximity, rendezvous operations, observational data, and onboard experiments.  Our goal will be to make available a near-universal low cost enhancement add-on that NASA users from academia to NASA Centers can purchase and easily install between the RWA bracket and a common attachment plate that can easily be linked into legacy, or to be developed, ACS controller design to substantially increase pointing accuracy of the SmallSat/CubeSat platform","QorTek is working closely with Boeing on the proposed technology and Boeing is among the single largest developers and suppliers of such SmallSats to the US military (ranging from 3U to 12U).

As has been demonstrated by several NASA interplanetary missions, there is no replacement for in-situ observations, like spectral imaging, that prove critical for understanding the context of solar system bodies. There is, however, a conflict between more capability at the target and the desire for minimizing mission cost. Minimizing the mass and power of an instrument reduce the size, complexity and therefore the mission cost. To enable more capable missions without high cost we propose to develop a hyperspectral/multispectral imager designed for a microsatellite platform that will function in a reduced light environment while minimizing the mass and power consumption. This type of instrument is crucial to the study of small bodies such as near earth asteroids and for missions further afield by maximizing capability while minimizing the instrumental cost and complexity. The Compact Hyperspectral Aberration-corrected Platform (CHAP) is proposed as a new, innovative instrument using an aberration-correcting holographic grating to make maximal use of two optical components, allowing for functionality over an optical bandpass (400-800 nm) with <100 microradian spatial resolution and 1.44 nm spectral resolution. The optical design of CHAP produces a white light zeroth order image from undiffracted light to be formed at the telescope focus, enabling the co-registration of spatial and spectral information, providing unprecedented context never before seen in an instrument for planetary and lunar science low-light observation. The CHAP spectrograph will be demonstrated in a 3U CubeSat-compatible form factor. Phase I activities will produce a proof-of-concept demonstration on an optical bench-top to a TRL 4 level. Follow on Phase II efforts will produce a CHAP with full capabilities for space environment qualification.","CHAP can benefit NASA's objectives in these specific implementations: - A low-cost next-generation mission within NASA's EOS program, such as follow-on to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi NPP mission. - A space-based complement to NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) mission - Follow-ons to in-situ deep-space science missions including: OSIRIS-REx, Cassini, and DAWN, and Curiosity - Integration into robotic precursor and manned science and exploration missions to small-bodies, Europa, and other highly mass-constrained opportunities. CHAP's designs allows for use at far-ultraviolet (90 – 140 nm) wavelengths which could enable future missions that use ultraviolet imaging spectrographs like ALICE on Rosetta or UVS on New Horizons current enroute to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.  As CHAP has the capability to be used in the visible, near-infrared, and infrared, the US Departments of Agriculture and Homeland Security would find interest in utilization of its low-cost ability to support the following applications: - Agricultural crop health and moisture content monitoring, particularly in drought-susceptible regions - Identification, measurement, and monitoring of oil spill rates and concentrations - Monitoring of pollutants and hazardous trace surface and atmospheric constituents.","The multi-Billion dollar mineral exploration and agricultural monitoring industries utilize remote sensing data derived from government and commercial platforms: - Government platforms: U.S. LANDSAT 7 and Japanese ASTER on board NASA's Terra - Commercial platforms: Worldview, GeoEye, RapidEye and adhoc airborne capability CHAP improves on the following limitations of currently available platforms: Government Platforms: Aging LANDSAT and ASTER platforms provide seven and fourteen spectral bands respectively within the near infrared, short wave infrared and visible spectrums. In comparison, CHAP can provide 400 discrete color bands at comparable spatial resolutions, enabling more refined observation Commercial Platforms: Utility of high spatial resolution commercial space platforms (Worldview, GeoEye) tends to be cost-limited with single imagery products costing upwards of USD $5,000. As a result, the ability to perform hyperspectral measurements with a simple, low-cost package will be a disruptive innovation of high interest to several large and mature industries. More specifically, CHAP's 3U form factor allows the instrument to be integrated onto standardized 27U, 12U, and potentially 6U cube-sat bus structures. This enables more sophisticated Earth observation missions within a small form factor and budget that were previously unreachable","Filtering; Gratings; Lenses; Mirrors; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Prototyping; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Visible",In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Based upon our successful Phase I results, hese signals have the potential to be used for many forms of both metrology and process control. While many material properties might be studied by using this interaction, our initial focus is an investigation into beam and sensor characteristics for geometric analysis of the deposition. Signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material, as it is being deposited. This is important, as the ability to monitor a parameter during deposition creates the possibility of controlling that parameter during the deposition process. As a further refinement, the ability to collect and store a spatially resolved pass-by-pass map of the deposition path geometry may have value in on-the-fly adjustments to subsequent build passes. Such mapping would allow working with the layer-by-layer nature of the deposition process to fine tune the deposition geometry. Such spatially resolved, layer-by-layer deposition mapping could also be stored, giving a three dimensional mapping of the as-built deposition path geometry. This could prove valuable for component quality assurance.","The commercial application for NASA will be demonstrable on the deliverable EBF3 POC system currently on loan to COSM under our Research License as detailed in this submission and upgraded with work proposed in this submission. That development could also result in a standalone metrology sub-system package that would be made available to upgrade the EBF3 systems at Langley Research Center currently in use on program development work. Those upgrades will necessitate further system level integration engineering and hardware build. This in situ metrology package would have the ability to collect and process signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction that could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material and the possibility of a second tier of control over the fabrication process wherein process parameters are adjusted to achieve target deposition dimensions. The functional deliverable package would consist of detector(s) to be place in the EBF3 chamber, a set of detection electronics, power supplies, hardware controls interface, cables and module and system level software necessary for integration to the EBF3.","The Non-NASA commercial applications for this submission will also require the successful follow on development of the concepts proposed.

The results of the Phase I electron beam modeling and experimental work that will fold into an optics design specific to the AM task. These systems will be made available as a commercial turnkey product for a broad range of markets and applications.

QuinStar Technology proposes novel approach for a family of solid state power amplifiers (SSPA) that will exceed the performance and operational requirements for measurement instruments and monitoring equipment of the future. Proposed approach is based on optimal combination of unique techniques for highly efficient and yet robust power combining, circuit integration and innovative packaging methods. This also leads to affordable products suitable for space, airborne as well as terrestrial applications. Key features of the proposed implementation are: scalability of power output, compact, lightweight, flexible architecture and high reliability with very significant potential for performance improvement and price reduction as MMIC device technology matures further. Initial objective of proposed effort is to achieve greater than 50 Watts of power output at 94 GHz at greater than 20% duty cycle and with 40 dB or more gain. Phase II work will focus on innovative robust designs for power combining, packaging and select device/material s. Phase II effort will lead to a producible and scalable design baseline that will be used in Phase III for manufacturing deployable products.","High power SSPAs operating at 94 GHz are needed for a wide range of radars and sensors for atmospheric measurements or environmental monitoring, specifically clouds profiling, mapping light precipitation and snow. Many of these radars are airborne, often on high altitude UAVs. Another application is for mapping super-cooled moist air and wind shear. Dual-frequency cloud-profiling radar is being planned for deployment on the International Space Station. Other ground-based radars for research also utilize high power SSPA. Long-term objective is to completely eliminate the need for any tube-based power amplifiers from the transmitter of these instruments. A very significant application of the W-band SSPA is for the advanced 94 GHz cloud profiling radar in the future Aerosol/Cloud Ecosystem Mission (ACE) to study and measure aerosols, clouds, air quality and ocean ecosystem beyond the scope of prior missions such as CloudSat and EarthCARE. Instrumentation radars which aid in the development of tactical radars in the W-band is yet another application of the proposed high power SSPAs.","Many diverse applications of high power SSPA for W-band transmitters are found in the non-NASA environment, ranging from Helicopter Collision Warning and Brownout Degraded Vision sensor to industrial and military surveillance and security sensors. In addition, airborne and ground-based environmental monitoring instruments would greatly benefit from affordable, light-weight compact power amplifiers at 94 GHz. Some of the governmental agencies involved in this work are: Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, Federal Aviation Administration, NOAA, Department of Defense, to name a few. Measurement and monitoring of clear air turbulence (CAT), severe weather and clouds would significantly gain from the development of a cost effective high power SSPA. Future aircraft landing systems (electronic enhanced vision systems) envision the use of SSPA in their transmitters. Space-based cloud profiling radars are envisaged for deployment in low-earth orbits by many space agencies world-wide. A space-qualified W-band SSPA will significantly increase the economic viability and mission success of these future programs.

Also, with the help of our subcontractor, High Strain Dynamics, L.Garde plans to study the integration of U-FAST into a 300 kW solar array system. These goals will allow the success of NEO NASA mission in ~10 years. Therefore, we will update of the U-FAST design in order to obtain a 0.08g bending strength parameter for a 300kW solar array system. This will be possible by increasing (10-20) the number of longerons in the truss and having a 80% slenderness reduction in the longerons. Also, finite element analyses will be executed to study integration of U-FAST into a 300 kW solar array system. Including dynamic analysis for truss deployment reability and integrity; and truss static analysis for stiffness and strength in bending. Finally, fabrication and testing of three prototypes will be done to validate the finite element solution.","L.Garde's deployable solar array will offer a novel strategy to package and deploy a solar array, demonstrate scalability, and meet NASA's requirements and desired size goals in the next 20 years.

Thus, our primary customer will be NASA or its prime aerospace contractors: Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop-Grumman, Ball Aerospace, ATK, etc.  Although the number of truss structures that might be purchased from LGarde is not large, there are numerous space applications that could broaden this market.  In addition to providing a deployable support structure for large solar arrays to power space electric propulsion, other applications exist.  These include support structures for large-area solar sails to provide propulsion for deep space missions, such as space weather advanced warning, orbital debris removal at GEO, and deep space exploration.  Another application for large space structures is in the design of sunshades for large space telescopes such as JWST.  Space-based microwave radar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are mission areas of great interest to NASA, NOAA and organizations within the Defense Department (USAF, DARPA, NRO, Navy).

Despite advances in CFD-appropriate kinetic mechanism reduction for kerosene-range fuels, significant combustion property variation among current and prospective certified fuels remains a challenge for meaningful CFD-advised design of high pressure, low-emissions combustors. The proposed project will leverage Princeton's ongoing work in aviation fuel surrogate formulation and modeling as well as kinetic mechanism development for emissions and high pressure combustion to produce and demonstrate a meta-model framework for automated generation of fuel-flexible compact chemical kinetic mechanisms appropriate for 3-D combustion CFD codes.During Phase I, Compact Mechanisms for both an alternative, natural-gas derived synthetic kerosene and a conventional petro-derived Jet A kerosene have been developed and demonstrated. Results indicated that, over a very broad range of pressures, temperatures, equivalence ratios, and characteristic times, these Compact Mechanisms well reproduce predictions of global combustion behaviors (ignition, extinction, heat release rate, pollutant mole fractions) relative to predictions of significantly larger target chemical kinetic mechanisms. Technical objectives for Phase II R&D include development of a stand-alone software application for generation of tailor-made, fuel-specific Compact Mechanisms, and demonstration of Compact Mechanism performance in computation-intensive CFD applications. Achievement of these objectives together will advance the current state of this R&D program to TRL 5.","The Technical Objectives presented in this Phase I proposal directly address a topic in the NASA SBIR solicitation for low emissions/clean power aircraft combustors. The ""compact"" low-dimensional chemical kinetic mechanisms proposed for modeling of real aviation fuel combustion chemistry will support physics-based CFD development of next-generation engines such as those employing lean direct injection (LDI) technology. Reacting flow simulation platforms like NASA's National Combustion Code (NCC), as well as ANSYS, KIVA, and OpenFOAM, require mechanisms sufficiently compact so as to be tractable for multi-dimensional, multi-physics, CFD simulations, but which also preserve the predictive fidelity of more detailed kinetic mechanisms. Importantly, the present framework permits the consideration of a variety of real fuels, including alternative fuels derived from a variety of non-petroleum resources. Evaluation of such alternative fuels is among the major NASA research thrusts under the general topic of propulsion.","The commercial product foreseen from this SBIR program is a stand-alone, novice-friendly real fuel kinetic mechanism generator software package that can interface with commercially-available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes.

When flying close to the ground (e.g., during takeoff and landing) obstacles such as cars, trees, buildings, power lines, people, and so on are not equipped with beacons.  In this setting, the ability to actively detect obstacles within the environment in real-time and to take evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions is a required capability for safe operation in the NAS.  Currently, there are no existing technologies that sufficiently address the sense/avoid problem associated with operation of small UAS platforms (<55lbs) operating within the NAS.  To this end, OKSI is developing the Stereo Obstacle Avoidance Rig (SOAR) that will provide a complete solution to the sense/avoid problem for small UAS platforms.  The SOAR system utilizes a video stream from a distributed aperture array of cell phone cameras combined with state-of-the-art single-camera stereo vision algorithms in order to construct accurate 3D environmental maps in real-time.","UAS in the NAS (ARMD): SOAR promotes the objectives of NASA SBIR Topic A2.01 Unmanned Aerial Systems Integration into the National Airspace by enabling sense/avoid for navigation within uncertain and hazardous environments, as well as promoting autonomous flight capabilities for UAS platforms.Autonomous landing and hazard avoidance (HEOMD and STMD): Safe landing is critical for spacecraft exploration, as was recently demonstrated by the European Space Agency's recent mission difficulties with the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander, which had difficulty locating a stable surface for landing.  SOAR can be utilized for safe landing site selection in unknown environments (e.g., for Project Morpheus).Multiple-Use Sensor Technologies/Instruments (SMD): SMD's goals include developing high-quality, multi-purpose, low-cost, low-SWaP sensing capabilities to make spacecraft missions more affordable).  SOAR uses COTS hardware with software-based sensing, meaning the SOAR system can be used for sense/avoid, navigation, automated landing, topographical mapping, reconnaissance and more.","There are no existing COTS sensor technologies that address the FAA's sense/avoid concerns for UAS operation within the NAS, particularly for small UAS platforms weighing 55lbs or less.  The ultimate goal of the proposed effort is to develop an operational SOAR sense/avoid system that can be used for real-time obstacle avoidance for UAS operating within the NAS.  This promotes the objectives of NASA SBIR Topic A2.01 Unmanned Aerial Systems Integration into the National Airspace by enabling sense/avoid for navigation within uncertain and hazardous environments, as well as promoting autonomous flight capabilities for UAS platforms (Figure 3).

Traditional approaches to fault management are costly, difficult to execute, and are largely decoupled from the main system engineering activities which aim to capture the system requirements and transform them into a robust and safe design. Our concept will enable the integration of fault management early in the system engineering lifecycle, facilitating the discovery of design weaknesses and enhancing the capability to produce safe, hazard-free systems.

In parallel, Systems Health management (SHM), with its operational subset Fault Management (FM), has also been developing with rigorous model-based practices, but largely separate from the mainstream of Systems Engineering and Design activities in NASA and the DoD. The technical and knowledge gap between the SE&I and SHM processes results in significant inefficiencies during product design, verification and validation, and excessive operational maintenance costs, collectively yielding unacceptably high life cycle costs and failure rates. To address these challenged, QSI with Dr. Stephen Johnson, intends to develop tool neutral architecture, processes and interfaces for integration of model-based SE&I designed in SysML (Systems Modeling Language), with SHM modeling and analysis performed in TEAMS® (Testability Engineering And Maintenance System). It is our intention to reduce the duplicative and disjoint effort by NASA's subject matter experts in the development of systems engineering and design models as well as systems health management/fault management models. The benefits realized through this effort are (a) Reduced systems engineering and fault management costs, combined with improved quality and traceability, as well as enhanced communication and coordination among stakeholders, (b) Improved quality of SE&I and SHM products by having inherent traceability across models and ability to catch defects in design and FM  earlier, and (c) Establishment of modeling recommendations for NASA community as it develops its MBSE approaches and models.","The proposed effort will have significant range of applications across various NASA multi-disciplinary engineering centers that are in charge of System Design where FM is an integral part of the System Design process. Clearly establishing the relationships between the design goals/intents and the consequent sub-goals, and derived state variables in the success space, with their complements in the Failure-space domain as practiced in TEAMS® Toolset widely used across NASA will be of tremendous value to NASA's Systems Engineering and SHM communities. One such clear application is the Space Launch System (SLS), managed by Marshall Space Flight Center. The QSI team has close relationship with the NASA MSFC SHM team responsible for the design of the FM system who are also current users of the TEAMS® software. Likewise other immediate applications of this technology will be with the Orion Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program, managed by Johnson Space Center, and the Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, the operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Other strong users of SysML, with strong FM programs include Glenn Research Center, Ames Research Center, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The aviation programs at ARC and at Langley Research Center are also likely long-term beneficiaries of this project, to translate design information into operations and maintenance models such as TEAMS® specializes in.","Among the other agencies that follow a strict system engineering and design process somewhat similar to NASA's are DoD institutions such as the Missile Defense Agency, Air Force and Navy. These are the most likely potential customers for the resulting technologies. Design verification and validation of Complex military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), etc. for the purpose of reliable and cost effective system and FM design can be ensured by using the targeted capabilities implemented in TEAMS®. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets where the FM aspects of system design is required to be highly efficient and cost-effective because of the natural budgetary pressures, could also be potential targets for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems where the vendors supply health management systems/schemes for them. Outside of the DoD, electrical power and nuclear power utilities also require rigorous modeling techniques such as those developed here.

In Phase I T.E.A.M., Inc. addressed the joint issue by developing an innovative stitching process capable of forming mechanically reinforced joints between densely woven, 3D carbon fiber pre-forms up to 3"" thick.

Due to communications latency, control algorithms for future autonomous space power systems need to be very robust, highly reliable and fault tolerant.Modeling of load flows is vital both to design spacecraft power systems and to operate them autonomously. A key element is state estimation—given the available sensors and their readings, what is the real state of the system? What action is required to maintain operation? State estimation is especially important when the system is in an off-nominal condition. Human operators draw upon experience to integrate off-nominal sensor readings and develop a gestalt of system state, but autonomous operation requires computation.Current modeling techniques (i.e., Newton-Raphson (NR) optimization) are not equal to this task due to their iterative nature and initial point dependency. Many off-nominal cases cannot be solved at all using NR. Worse, even more off-nominal cases appear to be solvable using NR, but the solutions are actually invalid. An NR-based autonomous control system faced with off-nominal conditions will reach an incorrect conclusion more often than not, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the spacecraft.By contrast, HELM™ provides deterministic solutions for off-nominal states, without dependence on initial solution seeds, thereby providing the level of fidelity and surety needed to develop an autonomous system.  In Phase I, Gridquant Technologies LLC successfully adapted HELM™ to solve the non-linearity problems of a small DC micro-grid, which will enable NASA to develop and implement the advanced architectures needed for future long-term deep-space exploration.","The project, when completed (all phases) will provide NASA with a reliable and fast State Estimator that will improve grid observability; optimization algorithms for load management under variable load demand and constrained capacity, yielding reliable results that have been power-flow checked; control-based applications; and auto-healing modules providing optimal (power-flow checked) action sequences for reconfiguration, in order to minimize brownouts and blackouts. These software applications provide the building blocks from which a truly autonomous power system can be built. Such a system is a pre-requisite for successful deep space missions requiring long-term operation with minimal human intervention. We envision that the first NASA system to receive the benefits of this effort will be Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP).","For non NASA opportunities, besides the existing AC grid applications, terrestrial opportunities are evident in AC, DC or AC-DC micro-grids. Terrestrial micro-grids pose unique scenarios for autonomous control because conditions differ substantially when the micro-grid is connected in parallel with the main grid instead of being islanded. Depending on the load/resource balance before islanding, quick actions will be required to ensure frequency and voltage stability. Renewable energy, particularly solar projects, will continue to play a larger role in the energy mix of micro-grids. Roof-top solar photo-voltaics on large commercial buildings coupled with battery storage and micro-turbines would be a good combination for energy efficiency and reliability. Military bases are excellent candidates for larger micro-grids, as they generally have enough land for larger scale solar projects, diesel generators for critical facilities and a significant transmission and distribution grid. The ability to manage electric power systems with minimal human intervention, with the implied cost reduction, will place these products as an appealing technological option to grid operators whether large or small.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Processing; Distribution/Management; Simulation & Modeling; Verification/Validation Tools,"Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storageis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The basis of this approach relies upon Be-38Al (a lower cost beryllium) to create a substrate, the use of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) matching phosphorous containing electroless nickel plating (NiP) to establish an amorphous surface, and then single point diamond turning (SPDT) that surface to a precision optical figure out to the edge of the substrate.  Be-38Al provides a substrate material that can provide the same stiffness as beryllium because it is not limited by its fracture sensitivity like beryllium.  Electroless nickel applied to Be-38Al with the right phosphorous content can match the Be-38Al's CTE, and the use of diamond turning can readily produce optical surfaces that can be used as is or with final polishing.","Potential uses, first and most obvious are for the applications currently under consideration for NASA large optical systems. That in and of itself will be a substantial technological success that will enable the advancement of the current state of the art of this innovative material system. In addition, this technology will be adaptable to other satellite programs like:-Astrophysics applications that require large aperture, lightweight and highly reflective mirrors that can operate down to cryogenic temperatures.-Lightweight x-ray imaging mirrors for future large advanced x-ray observatories. -Could enhance programs like AFTA/WFIRST, JUICE, ASTRO, EVI and possibly Euclid.","This advanced material system as it applies to mirrors for both UV/optical and x-ray optics can be applied to many research and development applications here on earth.

However, to fully realize the platform's potential, propulsion capability is required. For low-cost spacecraft developers, this capability remains among the most resource intensive to successfully implement. Planetary Resources Development Corporation (PRDC) proposes to significantly reduce required resources by seamlessly integrating propulsion with another critical resource-intensive subsystem: the spacecraft's primary structure. PRDC will integrate high-reliability COTS components from the medical consumer products industries into an additively-manufactured two-module primary structural element that includes integrated tank, plenum, and manifold geometries for a hybrid green monopropellant / cold-gas propulsion implementation, as well as the spacecraft's launch interface. The resulting system, called the Integrated Propulsion and Primary Structure Module (IPPSM), provides a standard interface, serving as the strongback for simple integration of other Cubesat subsystems and payloads within the 6U and 12U size regimes. During Phase II, PRDC will continue the IPPSM development initiated during Phase I, culminating in the fabrication, assembly, performance evaluation, and environmental test of a full-scale 12U IPPSM prototype with integrated RCS and high-thrust, high delta-V capability. It is expected that the completion of the above work will result in a technical maturation to TRL-6 by the end of Phase II, ready for flight demonstration.","The development of an low-cost, integrated propulsion and structure module for small satellites has the potential to assist in the progress towards the achievement of NASA near-term and long-term scientific and technical goals.

In particular, this research program would develop novel methods for conducting non-parametric, closed-loop simulation testing of collision avoidance algorithms as well as other autonomous operations.  The technology generates a campaign of simulation experiments that automatically adapt to the algorithms in question. The purpose of this innovation is to expose potential vulnerabilities in UAS autonomy that are generated through the interaction of autonomous UAS algorithms with other agents such as an intruding aircraft operating under ``right of way rules"".

The majority of the analysis tools that exist today, however, do not harness the capability to analyze these unique systems, especially in the rotorcraft realm. The Phase I effort focused mainly on the development of the PANTHER tool in preparing it for modeling hybrid and all-electric rotorcraft. The tool was then exercised by modeling a handful of propulsion architectures. The goal of the proposed Phase II effort is to further improve upon the strengths of the PANTHER code that was developed, and then utilize this tool to further explore the hybrid-electric rotorcraft design space. Given the goals of the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Project (RVLT), the PANTHER tool must be further expanded to enable the sizing and performance analysis of unique rotorcraft configurations with propulsion system designs unseen in the vertical lift realm. The tool will be expanded with modules for fuel cells and flywheels along with improved engine modules, physics-based motor and drive models, and a new capability to model complete missions. The thermal management aspect will also be addressed with modules for radiators, cooling ducts, fluids, and pumps. With the capability of PANTHER vastly enhanced, numerous trade studies will then be conducted that attempt to explore a large portion of the rotorcraft trade space made possible by hybrid-electric propulsion systems. These trades will aim to answer many of the questions that have arisen in the community about hybrid-electric rotorcraft. Using the results and lessons learned from these studies, and accommodating the goals of NASA and the RVLT project, a detailed conceptual design will be performed on a notional hybrid-electric rotorcraft demonstrator.","The potential NASA applications for this proposed effort will focus on delivering a tool that fits within a larger MDAO framework for hybrid electric aircraft design synthesis with a highly integrated thermal management system design and analysis tool, benefitting multiple NRA projects, and other direct NASA efforts, both internal and external. Several nuances native to the turbo-electric or hybrid electric distributed propulsion are electric component weight and structure, power transmission networks, and thermal management systems, collectively requiring a tool such as the one proposed for initial aircraft design synthesis. These new hurdles have not been addressed in previous textbook methods or efforts, but play a significant role in determining the feasibility of these new aircraft configurations. One of the major benefits to a decoupled energy management system using distributed propulsion is the freedom in placing the propulsors. Each configuration will inherently have vastly different structural and cooling considerations.","A commercial application for top-level distributed propulsion sizing tool would be very attractive, as the industry is pressing toward hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) concepts as new technologies for electric components and batteries develop. This product will leverage its ability to customize the propulsion system architecture and operation, and it will offer detailed analysis of thermal management system design and performance. A potential Phase III effort could pair the sizing and weights tool with aerodynamic analysis, terminal area operation analysis, and mission analysis tools to provide designers with a very useful hybrid electric aircraft design and analysis suite. AFRL would benefit as they are conducting in-house studies and supporting ESAero in other related areas. IARPA and the FAA will also benefit, as the tool will be distributed within the government FOUO. ESAero has identified the government and industry partners to develop this type of technology both near term (Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed Martin) and long term (NASA, AFRL, IARPA etc.).","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Distribution/Management; Heat Exchange; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Storage; Superconductance/Magnetics; Verification/Validation Tools",Rotorcraft   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

TVA is presently developing two RED systems with a high degree of technological similarity. The first is RED-Data2, a 1.7 kg capsule that rides along with a host vehicle to collect engineering data during reentry and breakup. RED-Data2 can also serve as a test-bed for testing and demonstrating high-temperature materials in actual flight conditions. The second device, named RED-4U, is a recoverable capsule sized to accommodate a payload mass and volume equivalent to four CubeSats or more. As the next step in hardware development toward commercialization of these systems, TVA proposes to produce a flight unit RED-Data2 and an engineering development unit of RED-4U. Flight of a RED-Data2 serves as an opportunity to both demonstrate the materials flight test mission, and to demonstrate key technologies for the RED-4U mission. The RED-4U engineering development unit is an important step toward an operational RED-4U system for on-demand return of experiment samples. Both RED-Data2 and RED-4U enable innovative commercial space activity and improved utilization of the ISS.","RED-Data2 has two main applications of benefit to NASA. The first is for reentry data to improve simulations and prediction models. This has value as NASA tackles challenges associated with orbital debris and end-of-life disposal, and for design of crewed space vehicles for survivability. The second application is for development of high temperature materials. Low-cost flight testing of materials allows for rapid qualification of materials in relevant environments for use on future government and COTS missions.The immediate application for RED-4U is to service government and commercial customers performing microgravity research on the ISS. Market research and workshops conducted by NASA and industry concluded that high-frequency payload return is an essential capability to drive high-volume research aboard the ISS. Longer-term NASA applications include sample return from asteroids or planetary bodies in support of robotic or human exploration.","The Non-NASA commercial applications of RED-Data2 and RED-4U parallel those of the government applications. Reentry breakup data collected by RED-Data2 can assist space vehicle engineers in designing expendable satellites to reduce the hazards of debris, and in designing reusable spacecraft for survivability. Better knowledge of reentry phenomena can improve understanding of risk and lead to increased satellite operational lifetimes. The ability to flight test new materials can help fill a gap in materials characterization to enable development of hypersonic vehicles for crew and cargo transportation.Small payload return capability complements the business models of the emerging commercial space industry and the rapidly expanding small satellite sector. RED-4U could be used to return scientific experiment samples and other payloads from commercial orbital platforms such as those proposed by Bigelow Aerospace and Orbital Technologies, or for intermittent return from free-flying commercial transportation vehicles such as the SpaceX DragonLab, Orbital Sciences Corporation Cygnus, or the Sierra Nevada DreamChaser. Sample return is also a key element of plans of commercial companies seeking to mine the Moon or asteroids such as Moon Express, Planetary Resources, and Deep Space Industries.","Biophysical Utilization; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

AdvR's design is enabled by capitalizing on robust, well-commercialized, low-noise telecom components with high reliability and declining costs which will help to drive the widespread deployment of this system.  The key innovation is the combination of current telecom-based fiber laser and modulator technology with periodically-poled waveguide technology to produce tunable laser light at rubidium D1 and D2 wavelengths (and expandable to other alkalis) using second harmonic generation (SHG).  With this technology, multiple channels can be independently tuned to produce the fields needed for addressing atomic states in atom interferometers and clocks.

This can result in significant propellant savings on space vehicles, allowing the overall mass to shrink for launch on a less expensive vehicle or to allow the space vehicle to carry more payload at the same weight.  Many of the electrical propulsion systems operate in pulse mode, pulsing hundreds or even thousands of times per second.  Creating reliable valves that can operate in pulse mode for extremely long life and at low power are critical in these applications.In Phase 1 of this effort, WASK Engineering demonstrated the suitability using a piezo actuated valve to meet the requirements of electric thrusters. Valves actuated with piezo crystals offer the benefits of 1) a demonstrated ability to operate at frequencies from 0 Hz to over 1,000 Hz, 2) the ability to throttle continuously from 0-100% open, 3) extremely fast response, 4) low power usage, 5) opening the valve with infinitely variable operating waveforms, sine wave, square wave, saw tooth, custom wave form, etc., 6) no EMI generated, and 7) a very low part count for reliability","Potential NASA applications include application of the valve to the propellant control for electric thrusters.  This includes both continuous firing and pulse mode units.  The valve's capability to throttle and readily adjust the frequency and pulse width of opening enables the possibility of easily operating a thruster at various average power levels, depending on mission requirements.  When this effort is completed, the valve will have demonstrated an unprecedented cycle life.  This will make it suitable not only as a valve for long duration missions with electric propulsion, but also for valves and regulators for satellites and space probes on long duration space missions. The valve can also be used, with some minor modifications as a cold gas thruster.  This would allow microsatellites a simple method of control while on orbit.  The ability to throttle makes the control very effective, as the impulse bit can be adjusted from large to very small depending on the immediate requirement.  This has the benefit of simplifying the control system due to the very small minimum impulse bit possible. For all of these applications, the combination of all the significant features of the valve, 1) throttling, 2) pulse mode operation at very high frequencies, 3) very small size, 4) very light weight, and 5) very low power requirement result in a very unique and innovative valve.","The capabilities the current valve possesses will permit it to be used for flow control in pneumatic systems.  The small size and low power consumption open the potential to use the valve in portable, battery powered applications.We are already evolving another piezo actuated valve for an application to actively control gas turbine combustion instabilities.  In this effort we are developing relationships with jet engine fuel control companies such as Woodward Controls. This has benefits not only commercially but also militarily, as the Navy is evaluating alternatives for active combustion control in their jet aircraft.  A second potential application is to apply this technology to rocket engine combustors. In current rocket engine developments, especially those using a heavy hydrocarbon fuel such as RP-1, combustion instability is an ongoing concern.  Typical approaches  significantly complicate the design.Incorporating a number of modulating valves into a small number of the injection elements in a combustor have the potential to counteract the devastating effects of the instabilities in rocket engines and significantly reduce development costs.  To this end we have had discussions with both NASA rocket engineers and engineers at the Air Force Research Laboratory about the potential of pursuing this approach.","Actuators & Motors; Attitude Determination & Control; Ceramics; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Metallics; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Spacecraft Main Engine",High Power Electric Propulsion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Quantitative results in these test environments are required to validate the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools that are used to extrapolate wind-tunnel data toward realistic flight conditions and hardware.  The development of fast instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme conditions present under such test conditions is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  Among the host of physical quantities, accurate mapping of velocity flow fields remains a significant yet essential challenge in these facilities.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of other flow parameters, such as gas density, pressure, temperature, and species mixing fractions, are of paramount importance to characterize fully the fluid dynamics.  Unfortunately, the widely available current suite of flow-field probes exhibit varying degrees of intrusiveness, requiring either the physical placement of probes inside the test facility or the introduction of foreign particles or gas-phase species into the flow field.  Thus, the development and application of non-invasive flow-field diagnostic probe techniques is of principal importance in these environments.  This proposal expands upon our successful Phase-I results and offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and flow diagnostics for ground-test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed range from proof-of-principle demonstration of novel methodologies using kHz-rate femtosecond (10-15 sec) and 100-kHz-rate burst-mode picosecond (10-12 s) duration laser sources to measurements in realistic tunnel conditions expected in the current solicitation.","The proposed research program will expand upon advanced laser-based, high-data-rate, multi-dimensional, multi-parameter, noninvasive optical diagnostic platforms for NASA ground-test facilities.

During the proposed program, we will develop these measurement tools into compact, user-friendly, and mobile platforms that enable broad implementation in ground-test facilities.  The expertise within this research team in state-of-the-art laser technologies, physics, and chemistry-based diagnostic techniques, and extensive product development and implementation background in defense, propulsion and energy applications will be a critical factor in realizing the proposed diagnostic platform and toolkit.","The advanced diagnostic toolkit proposed under the current program will be a significant step forward in using cutting-edge laser technology and spectroscopic approaches to address a variety of diagnostics challenges in multiple government and industrial applications.

The QSI-Vanderbilt team plans to emphasize advancement in the following five areas: (a) leverage extensive LADEE telemetry data to further enhance and develop online degradation profiles, performance analysis and remaining useful life (RUL) computation algorithms, (b) develop/implement degradation detection algorithms to compute time-to-alarm (TTA) and time-to-maintenance (TTM) predictions and correlate with alarm/maintenance events, (c) develop reusable library of models and tests, (d) verification and validation of the resulting solution, and (e) demonstrate the proposed solution on LADEE's and other spacecraft subsystems. Once fully developed, outcomes of this effort will lower the cost of developing prognostics and provide maximum critical system availability, smarter scheduling of maintenance, overall logistics support cost, and optimal match of assets to missions. The proposed offering will also provide a cost-effective and pragmatic solution to our commercial customers who want to reduce unscheduled downtime by practicing condition based maintenance, but cannot justify the cost of developing prognostic methods in the conventional way.","NASA is developing increasingly autonomous systems that can perform missions with a high degree of certainty with minimal human intervention. Examples of such mission include rovers operating in Mars, where the missions are extremely long, and therefore multiple components and subsystems will degrade and fail over the duration of the mission. However, due to the long communication delays between Mars and Earth, these systems cannot be monitored and diagnosed by mission control like any other near-earth mission. The proposed capability will be invaluable to NASA for such operations by (a) Predicting failures before they disrupt the mission, (b) Reducing false positives of such prediction with the proposed diagnosis-driven prognosis, and (c) identifying the remaining useful capability of the system. This will enable NASA to focus on the mission planning and recovery aspects, and manage the health of the system, rather than being blindsided by unexpected failures.","The potential applications for DoD and Commercial users are even larger. This is because they are likely to operate multiple systems, a fleet of vehicles for example, that have the opportunity of periodic preemptive maintenance. To address these customers' needs, we will develop a decision-support module on top of the proposed capability here that will allow the customer to define his own business rules. Such business rules will help the customer answer questions like ""if the system has a scheduled downtime window of 2 hours tomorrow, what pre-emptive repairs should I perform within that maintenance window so as to minimize the chance of unscheduled downtime (due to failure) in the next 10 days"". For enterprise-wide logistic planning, this decision-making capability will also help optimize the cost of additional opportunistic maintenance versus the cost of additional downtime if such maintenance were not performed. The capability developed here is key to proving the business case for prognostics in commercial and military applications.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Processing; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Simulation & Modeling,Prognostics and Decision Making   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

However, the reliable use of these exceptionally high capacity anodes in a commercial cell has not been achieved due to safety and reliability concerns resulting from thermal runaway and short-circuit issues due to dendritic growth on the metal anode from lithium plating during charge-discharge cycles. Solid-state electrolytes (SSE) have been identified as one option to address this cell failure mode, but SSE technologies must be developed that combine high conductivity and mechanical properties conducive to smooth Li plating with feasible manufacturing processes. Also, the Li anode must be combined with an ultra-high capacity cathode in order to reach NASA's aggressive cell-level energy goals. To address this need, Solid Power proposes to utilize a Li-metal-compatible solid-state battery design to far exceed the specific energies achieved by state-of-the-art (SOTA) Li-ion batteries in a format that also provides for intrinsic safety and abuse tolerance. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of surpassing 600 Wh/kg and 1000 Wh/L at the cell level which will give a 3-5X improvement over the best battery technologies planned for NASA missions today.","NASA has a wide variety of applications in need of advanced rechargeable battery solutions including exploration vehicles, extra-vehicular activity (EVA) equipment, landers and rovers, human habitat systems, and planetary orbiters. A common thread among the battery needs for all NASA missions is an increase in specific energy. Packing more energy into a given mass or volume can improve operational capability and flexibility, and it can also result in significant launch cost savings. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are now becoming the new industry standard for use as secondary batteries in space due to their specific energy advantages over legacy technologies. Even Li-ion, though, falls far short of the energy goals set by NASA for next-generation missions. Thus, if successful the commercial potential within NASA for the proposed solid-state battery technology is vast. Broadly speaking, the proposed safe, ultra high energy and low cost could see use in NASA missions such as scientific and exploration satellites, crewed spacecraft, human habitat systems and planetary rovers. If successful, the proposed technology would directly impact these missions by increasing operational performance (e.g., reduced system mass, increased system lifetime, reduced system cost, etc.) while also increasing mission reliability through the reduction in safety concerns associated with conventional Li-ion rechargeable batteries.","Beyond the impact to NASA missions, the commercial potential for the proposed safe, low cost and ultra high energy all solid-state rechargeable batteries is vast as it could find use within virtually every sector of the $20+BN rechargeable battery markets.

ASPECT encapsulates our airspace encounter generator, sensor/tracker fusion algorithms, and prediction, threat assessment, and avoidance modules.  It also provides both component-level and system-level analysis that is required for evaluating how well SAA sensors and software meet fundamental safety requirements for UAS in the NAS. ASPECT consists of MESSENGER (Multi-aircraft Encounter Scenario Generator), ASSIST (AsynchronouS Sensor fusIon SysTem), FORECAST (Fast On-line Prediction of Aircraft State Trajectories), and REACT (Rapid Encounter Avoidance & Conflict Resolution) modules. Initial versions of FORECAST and REACT were designed under related projects.   Phase I developed the ASSIST (Asynchronous Sensor Fusion System) capability, which fuses combinations of SAA sensors such as GRB, ABR, camera, and Mode C transponder for localizing non-communicating threats.  ASPECT was then used to analyze ASSIST's estimation accuracy, with the objective of achieving the precision of ADS-B and rejecting spurious/clutter tracks. Phase II will: (i) Expand and validate the underlying sensor models and demonstrate capability using flight test data generated at Olin College (Needham, MA), (ii) Extend our REACT system, and (iii) Carry out SAA system-level analyses using ASPECT to illustrate the relationship between sensor suite (hardware) selection, component SAA software modules, and achievable safety performance of the integrated system. The result of Phase II efforts will be a complete flow-down error and risk analysis framework, which constitutes a major step toward the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System.  Phase II plans have been reviewed by NASA's UAS Traffic Management Program and AeroVironment (letters of support attached), who we anticipate to be one of our early transition partners.","ASPECT technology will have immediate applications in NASA programs focused on integration of UAS into NAS such as the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) Program. In addition, NASA programs involving multiple collaborating UAS performing a variety of missions will substantially benefit from the ASPECT technology. This is since one of the major requirements for safe operation of multiple collaborating UAS is timely and accurate collision detection and effective collision avoidance. ASPECT will also find applications in NASA space programs where safety requirements include detection and avoidance of non-cooperative spacecraft, space debris, and small celestial bodies.","The ASPECT technology will be directly applicable to military UAS carrying out missions in GPS-denied environments. In such situations, secondary sensors are the only option, and collision avoidance is to be achieved with respect to both own team members and non-cooperating threats.

The key innovation required to provide a sub-system for longer-term missions is to develop catalyst technologies that maintain a high degree of activity and physical stability over multi-year operational lives. The high catalytic activity of noble metals combined with the surface area and adsorptivity of activated carbon are the ideal combination of parameters for achieving the highest level of performance at the lowest penalty for a post-processing sub-system. The problem has been the physical breakdown of traditional activated carbon catalyst supports. To address this problem, the Phase I and previous intermittent research efforts have shown that noble metal catalysts supported on Porous Solid Carbon, exhibit superior physical properties to alumina, ceramic and granular activated carbon-supported catalysts currently used by NASA and throughout the chemical process industries. The Porous Solid Carbon-based catalysts are proposed due to their remarkable hardness and physical stability combined with their high surface area and surface activity. Phase I continued the successful demonstration and scale-up of the technology, demonstrating that the reactors can be manufactured with high surface area and porosity and good internal consistency, as well as demonstrating that the catalytic activity is extremely high under very mild conditions. The Porous Solid carbon reactor scale-up will be completed in Phase II to International Space Station-sized reactors that will be fabricated, tested and characterized using advanced analytical methods that will yield a fully quailifiable protocol for manufacturing the reactors for Phase III flight implementation.","Long-range missions will benefit from upgraded catalytic post-processing reactors for both water recycling and air revitalization systems; multiple NASA programs can benefit from this technology. The opportunity for immediate implementation in the ISS Water Recovery System exists, and application of longer-life, more catalytically robust reactor technology to manned Mars missions, where re-supply options are even more constrained, is essential.","New PSC-based catalyst materials will provide benefits in sustainability, energy efficiency, selectivity and process economics that will help US manufacturing industries optimize the value of our petrochemical resources in global markets, maintain and create all-important manufacturing jobs in the US, fuel increased exports of American goods to worldwide markets, and provide a significant, sustainable source of geopolitical capital to the United States. Scaled to production quantities, Porous Solid Carbon has a high degree of potential to be a true breakthrough in the field of materials science. These physically stable and catalytically robust materials will have wide-ranging application throughout the chemical process industries, potentially impacting areas within as much as 75% of a global catalyst market projected at >US$24B by 2018. Examples include hydrotreating to reduce sulfur in fuels, olefinic monomer purification via selective hydrogenation, and potentially game-saving applications in several high-profile gas-to-liquids projects. The multiplicative impact is even greater- over $3T per annum in products are manufactured using catalytic processes. Sustainability impact is also high-- application of PSC to pollution control will provide a massive level of social benefit by reducing discharge of organic pollutants on people and place, helping to reverse the decades-long environmental problems plaguing Asia and other parts of the world.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment",Development of Treatment Technologies and Process Monitoring for Water Recovery   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The device uses simplified and robust techniques for loading the traps, and directly leverages hardware already developed by AOSense. The simplified architecture for PLUS makes it amenable to future space qualification. When paired with a sufficiently stable local oscillator, PLUS can be operated as an optical lattice clock. Alternatively, the lattice-trapped atoms could serve as a starting point for producing quantum degenerate Sr gases for use in future sensor technologies or fundamental science studies. In the latter case, possibilities span explorations of artificial gauge fields to quantum information processing. A space-qualified standard with the expected PLUS-levels of performance could revolutionize deep-space navigation by allowing spacecraft to autonomously calculate their own timing and navigation solutions rather than relying on two-way links to Earth. Similar performance levels could enable an entirely new class of sensors capable of sensitive gravitational wave detection with single baseline optical interferometers. Significant technical risk has been removed from the Phase I design by heavily leveraging hardware and strategies already developed by AOSense on other programs and conducting Phase I technology validation for the new, PLUS-specific hardware. We will continue to incorporate new developments from related AOSense programs as appropriate to further reduce technical risk or improve device performance.

Silicon Germanium (SiGe) is a robust IC technology with superior electronic properties, resilience to harsh environments, and moderate cost of Si fabrication that can dramatically reduce mission size-weight-and-power and cost (SWaP-C).  IBM's 90-nm state-of-the-art 9HP SiGe BiCMOS platform delivers higher performance and lower power, and enables highly integrated (sub-) millimeter wave applications not possible with earlier SiGe nodes. It is therefore, a prime candidate for designing future mixed-signal/RF electronics for NASA. Currently, however, there are few wide-temperature/radiation data, models, and circuits in this platform. Advanced computational tools are essential to support design and assess performance of 9HP-based electronics.This project aims to develop novel Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) analog/mixed-signal and RF ICs in the best-in-class 9HP technology. In Phase I, CFDRC and Georgia Tech investigated the electrical performance of 9HP SiGe HBTs across an ultra-wide temperature range. HBT-based circuits were examined for single-event transient (SET) response via irradiation testing and detailed mixed-mode simulations. RHBD techniques were identified for further evaluation. In Phase II, we will select representative 9HP-based circuits from high-frequency and general purpose (low-frequency analog/mixed-signal) applications, and perform electrical and radiation response characterization (DC and RF) across a wide temperature range, via testing and mixed-mode modeling. RHBD techniques will be implemented and verified via modeling, and promising designs will be fabricated, tested, and delivered to NASA. Technology scaling effects on extreme environment performance of SiGe HBTs/circuits across different generations (9HP vs. 8HP vs. 5AM) will be evaluated to support design/trade-off analyses","Radiation-hardened and wide-temperature mixed-signal/RF electronics development is aligned, per NASA OCT Technology Area TA08, with the major flight programs within the Planetary Science Division: Discovery 13/14, New Frontiers 4, Lunar Quest, Mars Exploration, Outer Planets Programs, and Europa Jupiter System Mission. Components based on state-of-the-art, 90-nm SiGe technology will help reduce the volume, mass, and power requirements of instrument electronics, essential to maximizing the science return for future missions. Electronics capable of operating in extreme environments will enable science missions currently thought to be impractical due to the requirement of bulky protective housing. Electronic parts are getting smaller with technology evolution and the radiation/temperature effects are becoming more severe. A robust physics-based capability to predict the behavior of electronic circuits increases mission confidence. Radiation-hardened and wide-temperature analog, mixed-signal, and RF circuits are essential for ALL avionic systems used in NASA exploration missions. The RHBD designs from this project will add to the NASA ""components library"" for extreme environment applications. The physics-based mixed-mode tools will help NASA better evaluate the wide-temperature performance and radiation response at an early stage, and design rad-hard low-temperature electronics with better understanding and control of design margins, thereby reducing the test time and cost.","Various critical analog, mixed-signal, and RF circuits are used in all space-based platforms, including DoD space systems (communication, surveillance, ballistic missiles, missile defense), and commercial satellites. Since modern electronics technologies and components are becoming increasingly sensitive to extreme environments, the capability to predict their behavior can dramatically increase mission confidence and reduce risk. The new RHBD designs and circuit/cell libraries, based on the best-in-class SiGe technology, offer reduced size-weight-and-power and cost (SWaP-C) to all aerospace applications. The physics-based computer aided design (CAD) tools can also be applied to cryogenic electronics for high-sensitivity, low-noise analog and mixed-signal applications, such as metrology, infrared (IR) imagers, sensors (radiation, optical, X-ray), radiometrology, precision instruments, radio and optical astronomy, infrared and photon detectors, and other high-end systems.  For all such devices and systems, predictive and accurate modeling and design tools reduce the amount of required radiation/temperature testing, thus decreasing their cost, and time to market or field application.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Extreme Environments Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

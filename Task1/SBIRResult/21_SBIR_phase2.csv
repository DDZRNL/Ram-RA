Current MDO design results may take into account many disciplines in the design resulting in an optimized aircraft, only to discover controller limitations post-aircraft configuration lock related, resulting in less efficient, less capable and ultimately less safe aircraft. After decades of designing and flying flight controllers for new and existing types of hybrid and distributed propulsion aircraft, our goal is to get add a controllability component to aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization.  Our controllability assessment tools can be used individually or together in an MDO/MDA framework to ensure the airplane is optimized for both aircraft performance and flight control control requirements.  We leverage open-source software from OpenMDAO and can import models form OpenVSP and other sources. New UAM and UAS configurations provided significant advantages and are being pursued by the aerospace industry.  Our software allows us to partner with aircraft makers to help develop their aircraft and then provide flight control solutions as a secondary output from our controllability assessment tools. Far too often, we’ve seen the aircraft OML locked and much later discovered aircraft flight envelope and CONOPS restrictions due to inability to control the aircraft.  By co-designing the aircraft and the flight controller, we optimize both simultaneously, resulting in a design that closes for performance, CONOPS, failure conditions, and controllability within a significantly reduced timeline.","RVLT concepts or slight modifications to the current concepts will allow RVLT to provide NASA with additional key critical technical areas to focus on in the future.  New concepts can be quickly iterated and evaluated. AAM can use the controllability tools to understand what closed-loop performance is achievable to be able to form new CONOPS and infrastructure plans. ARMD can use the controllability assessment tools to optimizing the use of motors, rotors and propulsion system powertrain with respect to controller use and limitations.","UAM and UAS markets have received significant investments on concept aircraft that may not be able to meet the proposed CONOPS or safety requirements.  These tools can be used to evaluate designs and pivot into plausible, but inadequate designs.  Technical due diligence could use the tools to compare and evaluate concepts for feasibility."

The complete measurement system will address the installation complexity, time, and cost challenges associated with data collection from sensors on the exterior of an aircraft. This work is aimed at fulfilling the aerospace industry’s need for economically viable sensing technology that meets required metrics for flight testing for a broad class of fluctuating pressure measurement use cases.  The proposed microphones and data acquisition system will expand NASA’s technology portfolio to allow for faster, higher-accuracy, lower-effort/cost testing by minimizing the technological, logistical, and cost-prohibitive issues associated with high-channel-count, high-bandwidth, fluctuating pressure measurement installations on the exterior of an aircraft. These improvements will allow for increased measurement fidelity and enable NASA to fully leverage expensive flight-test programs to gather comprehensive fluctuating pressure field information that cannot be practically acquired using existing technology.","The proposed technology has the potential to be usable in multiple NASA ground- and flight-test facilities as well as implemented across government-owned, industry, and academic institution test facilities.  Primary NASA-related programs include the Urban Air Mobility Working Group (UNWG), the Structural Acoustics Branch (SAB) at NASA Langley, and the AeroAcoustics Research Consortium (AARC).  In addition to UAM and FAA regulated applications, the proposed technology is primed for adoption by missile and military aircraft manufacturers.","The emerging UAM market is a key target for the proposed fuselage microphone technology.

The aeroacoustic signatures of the large bracing strut and jury member features of this configuration need to be studied with appropriate modeling to enable design cycle input based on far field noise estimates of these features. Building on Phase I success, we propose to produce a database of hemisphere noise levels (1/3 octave band) using PowerFLOW CFD, with an accompanying model based on machine learning for design cycle trades of this noise source.

Stochastic modeling techniques based on neural network and Kriging were also developed to establish the relationship between uncertain AE inputs and outputs. For the first time, adaptive sampling-guided AE ROM generation and UQ with NASA’s FUN3D was developed in a broad flight envelope and demonstrated to accurately capture flutter boundary in a computationally conscious manner.

This approach reduces electro-thermal stresses at the windings, which are traditionally viewed as the most vulnerable sub-system in motors for electric aircraft. The significantly improved dielectric protection extends the SOA on several fronts including thermal degradation, insulation quality, and partial discharge, preventing winding failure while retaining high power density and system-level benefits. The system offers enhanced electro-thermal performance with the unique infusion of cooling and magnetics, alleviating the iron yoke as a thermal bottleneck, reducing ΔT between the heatsink and coils, and creating sufficient thermal headroom to enhance the coil insulation without degrading motor performance. Combined with modular manufacturing and pre-qualification of the coil assembly offering independent quality assurance, this provides a path to meet NASA requirements for high reliability and safety in cost-effective, mass production. In Phase I, Hinetics demonstrated the feasibility of MAGICA through a combination of computer modeling, design/analysis, and the fabrication and test of a laboratory prototype, reducing development risks for Phase II. MAGICA has now reached TRL 4; in Phase II, Hinetics will expand the capabilities of MAGICA with integration into two fully functional generators, achieving TRL 6 at the project's conclusion. The demonstrated results will offer NASA and eVTOL OEMs the ability to extend motor/generator performance while prioritizing utmost reliability.","When complete, MAGICA will help improve the safety and reliability of the electrical motors used in UAM powertrains. Hinetics has developed a series of machines ranging from the 20-500 kW class, relevant to the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) project’s concept vehicles, to MW-class high speed machines for the Electrified Aircraft Propulsion program within ARMD. These motors can be readily retrofitted with MAGICA to increase reliability as we scale to volume production.","MAGICA enables reliable, safe operation of high power UAM aircraft. This will have uses for Government applications such as civil and military disaster relief, search and rescue, medical evacuation, firefighting, and commercial applications such as urban air mobility and cargo transport. With little alteration, MAGICA will also be capable of motors for commercial hybrid-electric regional aircraft."

Today, we have demonstrated best-in-class thermionic performance using novel materials and manufacturing techniques, as well as fully encapsulated prototypes meeting solicitation targets, including power density (1-10 W/cm2). Using these devices as a baseline, we propose to demonstrate a new device that is compatible with harvesting heat directly from high temperature surfaces in the vehicle, relying on existing thermal pathways within the vehicle to simultaneously generate electricity while thereby displacing and reducing the vehicle thermal load. Our Phase I effort resulted in a design relying on well-proven space charge mitigation techniques, as well as proof of principle tests of protecting high temperature emitter materials from high temperature environments. Once demonstrated as part of a Phase II effort, we believe our devices can increase the Mach number in any vehicle and we believe will be enabling for long-duration and reusable hypersonic vehicles. If successful, our solution will add virtually no extra weight or volume vs the existing skin / liner, becoming the “APU” for all next-generation long-duration hypersonic vehicles.","Development of hypersonic capabilities is “the highest technical priority” according to Dr. Michael Griffin, DoD Under Secretary for Research and Engineering. However, for reusable and long-duration hypersonic vehicles, no good way to power the vehicle currently exists: a standard APU is not compatible with the lack of moving parts in typical hypersonic propulsion systems.

This is a hardware/software solution which can transmit alerting messages about UAV operations in legacy VHF airband communication protocol so that the alert can be heard and understood readily by human pilots and air traffic controllers. In effect, this Automated Airband Radio (AAR) is a bridge between legacy (VHF) and emergent communication protocols (like WiFi, 4G/LTE, 5G, etc). In Phase I, KalScott Engineering demonstrated proof-of-concept hardware in ground and flight testing. The system is based on a software-defined radio (SDR).

This is then broadcast over VHF.  In Phase I, VHF transmissions from the SDR-based Automated Airband Radio were received and understood by human pilots at ranges from 0 to 8 nm, at altitudes from 0 to 4000 ft AGL. Both air-to-ground and ground-to-air tests were completed successfully.

During Phase I SBIR, we developed,  tested and validated these radiation countermeasures for: 1) reversal of immune dysregulation (immunosuppression) caused due to radiation, tested in vitro using human donor derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a screening method; 2) validation at a cellular level shown with increase in Tregulatory (Treg) cells reversing the immunosuppressive and radiation-induced ARS; and 3) in vivo testing and validation using an animal (mice) radiation model, showing reversal of immunosuppression in lungs by administration of EPO activating Nanoligomers, to reduce potential development of carcinogenesis. Additionally, we also showed reversal of radiation-induced neurodegeneration caused by neuroinflammation in brain, using transcriptional downregulation of intraperitoneally administered GM-CSF downregulator. These two therapeutics were developed using our proprietary Sachi platform for high-throughput, rapid, and targeted gene expression manipulation (reversible) of immune and other hematopoietic proteins, to utilize our own body to create these protective enzymes to counter and repair the damage caused by deep space radiation. Our work in Phase II SBIR will: 1) provide pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and biodistribution data with 2 different routes of administration (intraperitoneal IP and intranasal IN); 2) determine dosing and dose frequency to obtain optimal therapeutic effect for reversing radiation- and microgravity-induced immune dysfunction; and 3) conduct small (mice) and large animal (dogs) safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerable dose studies (IND-enabling studies), for translating the developed therapeutic into human clinical trials and filling for FDA-approval for clinical investigations.","Sachi is teaming with Space Tango (and Sierra Space) for development and deployment of “on-the-fly” and “GMP-in-a-box” module, for therapeutic manufacturing and testing in space. Sachi and Space Tango are currently fundraising for the proposed space-based manufacturing and drug-screening (joint federal grants, and exploring joint company formation and dilutive fundraising efforts to launch the project). When funded, two spaceflight missions and therapeutic manufacturing at ISS is planned within 24-36 months.","The space-based therapeutic screening can potentially accelerate drug-development for diseases such as neurodegeneration, cardiovascular, and cancer, by leveraging the accelerated disease progression due to microgravity and radiation. Commercialization objective also include translating the molecules developed here as combination therapy for cancer radiotherapy patients, to improve outcomes."

Current state of the art technology relies on astronaut swabbing of surfaces and subsequently performing molecular analysis on the samples to determine the microbial burden. To alleviate this burden, Nanohmics Inc., proposes to continue advanced development of an autonomous, fluorescence imaging detector (AFID) for microbial mapping demonstrated during the Phase I program. The key components of the unmanned, aerial, 3D-sensing AFID system are a custom fluorescence detector with excitation sources controlled by embedded image acquisition and processing that uses spectral fingerprints and machine learning to differentiate between bacteria, fungi, and other organic material.  The goal of the Phase II program will be design, optimization, and performance demonstration of the AFID system ability to generate a microorganism map of the total bioburden on simulated habitat surfaces relevant to future human spaceflight. The final AFID prototype will be advanced to TRL 5-6 over the course of the Phase II program with the ability to distinguish bacteria (detection threshold > 500 CFU/100 cm2) and fungi (detection threshold > 10 CFU/100 cm2) which meet the pre-flight and in-flight microbial mapping microbial monitoring requirements as defined by the International Space Station Medical Operations Requirements Documents (ISS MORD).","Numerous NASA applications benefit from ensuring proper disinfection of surfaces, particularly habitat protection applications.

Problems and inefficiency associated with packed beds are related to random packing of granules, poor thermal management, and poor mechanical stability.  An improved system is envisioned based on sorbent beds of 3D-printed monolithic lattices. For this project the extrusion–based additive manufacturing (AM) technique known as robocasting will be used to create lattices of zeolite (13X and 5A) that are more robust and efficient for reversibly adsorbing and desorbing CO2.  Success requires development of zeolite paste feedstocks suitable for the robocasting process and able to partially sinter into robust structures while simultaneously retaining high surface area and microporosity.  Great progress was made on this front in Phase I and 50mm monoliths were demonstrated to be feasible.  Studies for continued development of effective sintering aids (inorganic binders) and optimal lattice design will be completed in order to scale-up fabrication. Another critical objective is to build and demonstrate the incorporation of heating elements into a zeolite assembly that dissipates heat uniformly and activates desorption of CO2.  The target is to heat the zeolite monolith assembly in-situ up to 300C. A collaboration with Michigan Technological University will also be used to simulate, characterize, and optimize the lattice geometry for CO2 adsorption and pressure drop.  Synergistically, this collaboration will advance the state-of-the-art for desiccant monoliths to ensure only dry air interacts with the zeolite assembly. The final deliverable for Phase II will be the demonstration of a 10L canister of lattice monoliths 125–200 mm in size made with zeolite 13X and/or zeolite 5A that meets the material targets for strength, CO2 adsorption capacity, and pressure drop and incorporates heating elements for uniform heating to 300C.",Air Revitalization System (ARS) : NASA aims to use the 3D-printed sorbent beds as drop-in replacements for packed sorbent beds such as those found in the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) on the International Space Station (ISS) and for future NASA missions. Success will also have implications for water removal and humidity control of confined atmospheres.,Besides industrial-scale CO2 capture and specialty catalyst supports the most likely Non-NASA applications will be for gas separation to create concentrated oxygen.  For example: zeolite-based oxygen concentrator systems are widely used to produce at-home and portable medical-grade oxygen and on-board oxygen generating systems (OBOGS) for aircrews at high altitudes.

Currently, there exists a technology gap to meet FR needs for crew clothing. Toward this, InnoSense LLC (ISL) will continue developing durable FR treatment using non-halogenated and nontoxic organophosphorus materials (FROM™). In Phase I, ISL demonstrated the technical feasibility by achieving permanent FR coating for polyester (PET) fabrics. Test data showed high coating durability, soft-to-the-touch attribute, nontoxicity, insignificant weight gain, limited oxygen index of ≥56%, and excellent FR performance in both 20% and 36% O2 environments, thereby, exceeding Phase I performance targets. In Phase II, ISL will focus on the optimization and scale-up of treatment process, and perform rigorous testing.

To address this need, intrinsically flame-retardant (FR) halogen-free polyamide fibers and fabrics were developed for space crew clothing during the Phase I project. FR polymers were melt spun into multi-filament yarns and knitted into flexible FR textile fabrics.  The knitted FR fabrics demonstrated a V-0 grade in the standard UL-94 testing.

The FSA must accept a total of 12 lbs. of pure water prior to each Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), then supply this water to the cooling loop at ambient suit pressure during the EVA, functioning reliably for 700 cycles over 15 years of service. To meet these requirements, NASA has specified multiple ultra-pure fluoropolymer bladders captured in restraints providing overpressure tolerance to 38 psi. The assembly must also conform to a defined geometric envelope. Designs to date present challenges for two primary reasons. First, typical constructions involving a lay-flat bladder captured within a sewn textile restraint do not use space efficiently enough to store the required volume within the available space. Second, wrinkles that form as the bladders inflate cause the fluoropolymer membrane to tear. Other challenges include robust mounting to a rigid structure and visual access for inspection. RAPA Technologies has developed a novel defined envelope pressure bladder that meets all specifications for the FSA. The design combines the benefits of a flexible bladder with the strength and convenience of a rigid tank, providing an ultra-pure, ambient-pressure reservoir with high cycle life and pressure tolerance, high volumetric efficiency within the available envelope, near-zero dead volume, optical transparency for visual inspection, simplified mounting, and low mass, along with an integrated volume sensor. In Phase I we demonstrated the performance, overpressure resistance, and cycle life of this novel bladder system. In Phase II, we will develop and deliver multiple full-scale qualification FSA units tailored for use in the NASA xEMU.","Our defined envelope bladder system will meet all requirements for the FSA, a critical component of the NASA xEMU. It will also make a natural choice for many other fluid handling applications in space, and can be used to store water, process chemicals, and waste streams. As NASA pursues manned missions to the Moon, lunar orbit, and Mars, the need for bladders that are reliable and stable for years-long missions will continue to grow.","The recent expansion in human space activity by private industry will lead to diverse applications on vehicles, suits, and rovers.

This polyurethane will be used as a drop-in replacement for the current polyurethane coating material used in legacy space suit pressure garment bladders. This new polyurethane was created incorporating novel antimicrobial additives which make polyurethanes, as well as other polymers, persistently antimicrobial. These new polyurethanes are expected to decrease or even eliminate the need for biocide use in next-gen space suit applications, without causing significant changes to the current production or processing methods. In addition, minimizing friction with surrounding materials will be investigated as these polyurethanes are refined.

Due to the high efficiency of spiking neural networks and their low-latency, energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic computing hardware, NECR can be integrated into SWaP-constrained platforms in spacecraft and robotics, to provide reliable communication in unknown and uncharacterized space environments such as the Moon and Mars. In Phase II, Intellisense will improve the NECR system for cognitive communication capabilities accelerated by neuromorphic hardware. We will refine the overall NECR system architecture to achieve cognitive communication capabilities accelerated by neuromorphic hardware, on which a special focus will be the mapping, optimization, and implementation of smart sensing algorithms on the neuromorphic hardware. The Phase II smart sensing algorithm library will include Kalman filter, Carrier Frequency Offset estimation, symbol rate estimation, energy detection- and matched filter-based spectrum sensing, signal-to-noise ratio estimation, and automatic modulation identification.

IML is an approach that moves the development of machine learning models away from engineers and puts the development of the model in the hands of the end-user. A Human-Centered IVA is focused on continuously improving the Machine Learning (ML) models while also providing effective communication between the human crewmembers and the IVA. Human-centered IVA is a perspective on artificial intelligence and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness of being part of a larger system that includes end-users. This approach allows the IVA to incorporate the knowledge, insight, and feedback of the end-users allowing for tuning and refinement of the ML models. The Human-centered IVA will assist crewmembers in various tasks e.g., crew scheduling, procedure creation, and anomaly detection and resolution during a long-duration mission. ADAPT's Human-Centered IVA will provide the computationally heavy-lifting while still receiving inputs and insights from the crewmembers. This allows for the expansion of processes and information to a larger scale without compromising data integrity or mission success due to a lack of ground assistance. To provide crewmembers with a Human-Centered IVA this effort leverages the supervised learning algorithms Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost, Extreme Gradient Boost, Categorical Boost, and Associative Rule Models which were shown in Phase I to be succesful within an IML approach. Additionally, this phase will focus on providing an explainable interface that allows the end-user to query the IVA for the reason behind its prediction. This will be accomplished using an interactive visualization Graphical User Interface.","We expect the Human-centered Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) approach to improving model predictions throughout all phases of a long-duration mission will be of interest to several groups within NASA.

One such class of materials, covetics (nanocarbon-infused metals), are inherently difficult to produce on Earth but have great in-space and terrestrial commercial potential due to their enhanced physicochemical properties, such as higher thermal/electrical conductivity and higher strength at lower mass as compared to conventional wrought metals. This program will develop the technical capabilities of the direct print method and module to print covetic materials on-demand in an LEO environment with the desired material property enhancements. Alignment with NASA and commercial space needs, and acceleration of integration of the technology into NASA’s mission, will be done by designing and building a direct print module and method can be incorporated into nScrypt’s multi-module platform, for subsequent demonstration in a parabolic loop zero-gravity flight test. (Note: the nScrypt multi-module system is the same that NASA’s On-Demand Manufacturing of Electronics group is installing on the International Space Station in FY2024). A successful demonstration of the direct print method and module’s viability through the zero-gravity flight test will align the covetic manufacturing technology with space approved hardware and reduce the entry barrier toward LEO demonstration in Phase IIE/III. Finally, the commercial viability will be established by outreach to the communities interested in covetic material properties and by identifying a pathway to system scale and implementation on commercial space platforms.

The performance, or efficiency, of parabolic antennas used at most ground stations worldwide is sub-optimal. Two dominant losses which reduce antenna efficiency are illumination loss and spill-over loss, and both manifest as an impact to the phase and amplitude distribution of an electromagnetic signal at the antenna’s surface. Improving the efficiency of existing parabolic antennas without significantly increasing their price is highly desirable as the additional gain realized by the antenna translates to improved data throughput or a decrease in the size, weight, and power (SWaP) burden on the user spacecraft or the main ground terminal without the installation of entirely new antennas. Current solutions to improve efficiency of antennas are expensive as they require the redesign of components such as antenna feeds or even complete replacement of an existing antenna system with a new one. Teltrium’s innovation is a Parabolic Antenna Lens (PAL) that improves the performance of parabolic antennas by using metasurfaces composed of periodic subwavelength metal/dielectric structures that resonantly couple to the electric and/or magnetic components of the incident electromagnetic fields to reduce losses that impact antenna efficiency by compensating for non-uniformities in the phase of the electromagnetic signal received or transmitted by the antenna. Two solutions will be prototyped: a horn-mount PAL that has a small metasurface in front of an antenna’s horn feed to reduce spill-over loss, and a top-mount PAL that has a metasurface placed on top of a parabolic antenna to reduce illumination loss.  These two type of PALs will be integrated into COTS Ku-band antennas and performance tested.","The PAL innovation has the most direct near-term benefit to ground station terminals that provide communications services to space users. Improving the efficiency of existing antennas is a cost-effective way to gain performance that is relevant to NASA. PAL will help improve the performance of ground antennas used to support NASA spacecraft, particularly as new mission challenges drive higher communications performance.","Applications of the PAL innovation to commercial satellite ground stations are similar to those for NASA ground terminals. Commercial ground antennas including ground stations, teleports, VSATs and Direct-to-Home terminals segment can achieve improved performance with PAL, thus increasing data throughput capabilities of such systems and positively impacting business results."

The proposed INSPiRE System is an add-on to the CLAIRE Project, that is developing wide-band spectrum sensing, spectrum-aware routing and cognitive control plane riding on the NASA’ s CCSDS Bundle Protocol as an APP. CLAIRE provides spectrum and network situational awareness to enable link-layer selection and optimization to maximize the data flow. The INSPiRE System utilizes the CLAIRE APP to enable Network Slicing (NS) and Policy-based Routing (PBR). From a logical perspective INSPiRE architecture utilizes the three-state model of network topology, RF performance and PBR – two of these inputs are provided by CLAIRE while the third one defining policy is a flow down from NASA.  While the actual path optimizations are complex calculations, INSPiRE abstracts the paths as virtual NSs. INSPiRE brings interesting aspects of 5G networks in the form of Network Function Virtualization, Security, Service Level Agreement (SCI/NET/DET/PNT) and PBR, which allows NASA to leap ahead from link-optimization to secure network optimization. Each NS is end-to-end secure and logically separate tunnel, hence providing security and robustness. Unlike 5G NS which are bound to a specific path and support many applications, INSPiRE NSs are application specific and run across all paths over the node/ satellite constellation. The INSPiRE architecture utilizes the CLAIRE APPs which are embedded on satellite and ground system to determine the topology and measure the RF performance.  Collected data is uploaded to the INSPiRE management system where route optimizations are determined based on PBR.  These optimizations are transmitted to all CLAIRE APPs which enforce the policy decisions.","INSPiRE provides following Capabilities and Applications: 1. Network Slicing provides configuration flexibility to ALL current and future, terrestrial and space-based NASA networks, enabling Service Oriented Architecture and Network Function Virtualization. 2.

The vast distances and numerous satellites in current and future NASA missions necessitate multi-hop communications utilizing temporary stores. Space communication networks are characterized by intermittent links, high latencies, low bandwidths, ad hoc connections, mobile physical nodes, asymmetric data rates, higher error rates, and heterogenous node types.  DREAMS focuses on two separate but related aspects of optimal communications—routing and link optimization. Link optimization is the ability to optimize a given link by tuning the modulation scheme, coding scheme, transmit power, symbol rate, and roll-off factor, where optimality is the weighted sum of Bit Error Rate (BER), throughput, occupied bandwidth, spectral efficiency, transmit power efficiency, and Direct Current (DC) power consumption. Routing refers to the ability, given that links are already optimized and known (to the extent possible), to optimally schedule storage and transmission of data to maximize throughput. To optimally fill the router role, in Phase II we will develop a near-operational, distributed, optimized transmission and storage scheduler in three versions integrated with GRC’s ground testbed and ready for thorough testing in realistic simulations on a large number of very diverse scenarios.  The distributed nature is accomplished by a straightforward division of labor between separate computational nodes and exchange of extremely low volume information (resource status and the current schedule).  The Link Optimizer is based on Machine Learning techniques using data from KRATOS’s high fidelity RF Link simulator while the scheduler is based on the bottleneck avoidance algorithm, which uses information from the entire schedule and current resource status and congestion to best utilize ALL possible links to maximize successful transmission of the highest number of packets.","DREAMS will be directly useful for any kind of spacecraft-based communication, whether it be commanding and health and status telemetry; audio, video, or other SATCOM traffic; or Internet Data packets.

Applications range from atmospheric and climate modeling to aerospace vehicle design. Systems with higher temporal resolution and fidelity offer the ability to record increasingly transient atmospheric phenomena, leading to improved feedback for atmospheric modeling and for real-time adaptive systems for flight dynamics and wind power generation systems. Many of these applications are relevant to NASA’s goals and interests. Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) has proposed a Multi-Channel Long-Range Wind LIDAR system toward increasing the scan rate, and therefore the temporal resolution, of advanced Wind LIDAR systems. The proposed system scales up from a developed single-channel fiber optic based, eye-safe wind LIDAR, initially designed for UAV systems and brought to a bread board level through Army and NASA programs. The single-channel sensor assembly is composed of a fiber optic transceiver consisting of a narrow band seed, acousto-optic modulator for frequency shift and pulse forming, a three-stage erbium/yttrium-doped fiber amplifier, and a coherent receiver, all operating at an eye-safe wavelength of 1550 nm. For multi-channel operation, the LIDAR signal is split prior to the third gain stage. The system electronics and computational stack are in PCIe/104 format, allowing miniaturized light-weight packaging suitable for small UAV applications and the entire range of commercial and military aircraft. By further developing the capabilities of the proposed wind LIDAR system, specifically by increasing the channel count the overall system scan rate can be increased proportionately thereby improving the temporal resolution. The proposed Phase II effort will result in a working prototype at the TRL 6 level.","This Wind LIDAR will have high impact for NASA low altitude UAV applications and all aircraft for clear air turbulence and wind shear detection. Wind speed detection can be used during high altitude loitering to enhance mission duration. The small SWaP allow widespread platform applications. Another NASA application is tactical approaches for wildfire management. NASA is working with the U.S. Forest Service and USGS to be able to identify objects beneath forest canopies, particularly underbrush, that can act as a fuel source for forest fires.","The proposed system yields high fidelity atmospheric measurement leading to improved existing/future military and commercial aircraft design, and aiding weather forecasting and climate studies.

The proposed solution will process an IF I/Q signal up to 10GHz, derived, for example, in water vapor sounders at 180GHz band. To implement the required function, a previously developed ASIC will be redesigned to improve its analog front-end performance and implement a new DSP function with the increased SEE immunity. Within the DSP block, IF input signals will be channelized into 64 bands and cross-correlated within each band. Several innovations will be introduced to the ASIC and the board level solution to combine improved performance, programmability, minimized SWaP and radiation sensitivity.

Extending the range of solar wind speed measurements to 2,500 km/sec or more requires a new, innovative power supply with significant high-voltage DC and AC modulation capabilities. The desired voltage output range for a next generation Faraday Cup is 150V to 40kV. The power supply developed in this effort handles the upper range of 8kV to 40kV. The Upper Range Power Supply (URPS) is broken up into two main subsystems for the DC voltage generation and the variable AC sine wave generation, which will be AC Coupled to the DC bias. The URPS includes AC and DC voltage generating sub-systems that are superimposed on each other via a coupling network. The AC sub-system is a novel resonant push-pull (RPP) converter that generates a 2kHz sine wave with variable peak to peak voltage from 1kV to 4kV. The RPP converter achieves zero voltage switching (ZVS) with a self-tracking gate drive circuitry implemented with GaN technology. The output of the 2kHz circuit is capacitively coupled to the DC bias to produce a high voltage sine wave with an ultra-high voltage offset for the Faraday Cup. The DC subsystem includes a five stage Cockroft Walton Voltage Multiplier (CWVM) driven by another RPP converter oscillating at 200kHz.  The two sub-circuits are controlled independently to allow for maximum flexibility in setting DC offset and AC amplitude.

The current generation of instruments cannot accurately characterize the shape and optical properties of particles smaller than 100 µm, especially in mixed-phase or glaciated conditions. We also lack tools for characterizing coarse mode aerosol, which are difficult to sample from aircraft, that can also have important atmospheric impacts. To address this shortcoming, we propose development of a holographic imaging system capable of single-particle or ensemble measurements depending on conditions and operator need. Benefits over current instrumentation include faster time resolution and better sampling statistics compared to existing holographic instruments, more detail regarding particle morphology compared to existing particle sizing and counting instruments, and better sampling characterization compared to imaging instruments. In addition, our technique will enable direct determination of extinction cross-section for individual particles under certain conditions, which will enable better measurements of aerosol and cloud extinction, especially for thin features such as sub-visible cirrus and aerosol layers.","The project would be directly beneficial to NASA's Earth Science Division by enhancing capabilities to measure cloud microphysical properties. The instrument would be suitable for deployment on platforms including the DC-8, P-3, B-200, WB-57, and Global Hawk. The instrument is also well suited to validate satellite observations and model results, and will employ wavelengths measurements identical to those used on CALIOP and other LIDAR systems (532 and/or eventually 1064 nm), including those used on NASA's airborne science fleet.","The proposed instrument would be valuable to other entities performing airborne cloud measurements, including DOE, NOAA, and NSF in the US and NRC (CA), FAAM (UK), SAFIRE (FR), DLR (DE), and others internationally.

Atom interferometers have unmatched precision for in-situ measurements of local gravity acceleration. The Size, Weight, and Power consumption (SWaP) of existing atom interferometers is a major obstacle for employing them in NASA missions. One of the main components of an atom interferometer is an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system. UHV systems are typically the heaviest components of atom interferometers. A light, compact, and energy-efficient UHV system will be highly beneficial for NASA missions. Q-Peak is addressing the need for lighter, compact, energy-efficient UHV systems suitable for an atom interferometer. Within a successful Phase I program, Q-Peak experimentally proved the suitability of the Aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) as housing material for the UHV chamber. Aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) housing is capable of maintaining residual gas pressure well below 5×10-10 Torr. The AlSi10Mg alloy is 30% lighter than stainless steel. Q-Peak proposes to build a complete UHV chamber suitable for atom interferometry out of the AlSi10Mg alloy. The ability to machine AlSi10Mg using a 3D printing process removes the constraint of traditional manufacturing considerations that can further decrease the SWaP of the UHV system. Special attention will be devoted to the development of an energy-efficient and reliable alkali-atom source.",Keeping track of the actual spacecraft position is a key part of navigation for any spacecraft. Accurate in situ gravimetry based on atom interferometry can be used for satellite-based global gravity field mapping. Atom interferometry is a potential technology to gather the type of data currently produced by NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On mission. Europa Clipper can use an atom interferometer for determining the most likely locations to gain access to subsurface material.,Stable and precise accelerometers and gyroscopes are required for navigation and can be used for ships and planes. They are especially advantageous in situations when a GPS signal is absent and high accuracy is required. Such devices are of great value to the US Navy.

However, free-form optics manufacturing is expensive and requires lengthy production time hindering the adoption of this new design paradigm.  A significant problem with modern optics machining is the use of open-loop control which leaves the desired ultra-precise surfaces susceptible to malformation via non-deterministic effects.  It is only through multiple iterations of machining and in-process metrology that is possible to reach nanometer precision. These manufacturing challenges are exacerbated by free-form optical designs that rely on difficult multi-axis sub-aperture machining or tool rastering and protracted 3-D surface characterization techniques. The technical objectives in this project open the opportunity for low-cost, free-form optics manufacturing by integrating an in-situ optical metrology system into a newly-developed laser-based machining tool to achieve nanometer (x, y, z) root mean square precision over a 160 cm^2 glass workpiece. The metrology system will overcome the current challenges of characterizing free-forms with large spherical departure (>1mm), small inflection points, and asymmetries.  The approach of measuring optical properties, in contrast to the – as usual – physical shape, will also ensure the parts are functionally deployable.

At the same time UT-Si solar cells have a potential to also meet NASA goals for the long-term operation in high radiation environment (1 MeV 6e15 e/cm2). Together this will make UT-Si solar cell technology an ideal choice for several NASA projects including LISA solar array, Vertical Lunar Solar Arrays and large scale solar arrays for Solar Electric Propulsion.",The main advantage of UT-Si technology is compatibility with high volume manufacturing and a low manufacturing cost.

NASA’s mission profiles demand the highest achievable specific energy as well as operability under extreme conditions of temperature, vacuum, and radiation. While rechargeable battery technologies continue to advance the state-of-the-art to meet NASA’s needs, existing primary battery cell technologies (e.g. Li-CFx) can presently address NASA missions. However, maximizing the utilization of the stored energy will need improvements in state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH) determination/prediction. Li-CFx cells have attractive characteristics for NASA missions, including very high specific energy, self-heating during discharge, and radiation tolerance. However, discharge rate capability is limited, and the discharge voltage profile is only weakly correlated to SoC. Without accurate prediction of primary battery SoC, results of scientific missions (e.g. Europa) could be lost in space due to insufficient energy to transmit those results back to Earth. Alternatively, mission durations could be truncated due to overly conservative expectations of battery life. In either scenario, the return on NASA’s mission investment ranges from suboptimal to catastrophic. Improvements in Li-CFx modeling are needed to better determine and predict SoC to maximize NASA mission performance. Cornerstone Research Group proposes to continue development of an Advanced Primary Cell Model based on coupled thermodynamic and transport calculations combined and multiple monitoring inputs as feedback controls. The Advanced Primary Cell Model will enable NASA to maximize mission operations by optimally managing primary cell battery systems across mission operating conditions.

Therefore, conventional power technologies including photovoltaic power systems and the traditional batteries could not meet the requirement for Venus surface application. TalosTech LLC proposed to develop a high temperature all solid-state LiAl-CO2 battery with superior cell performance by using ambient carbon dioxide at Venus surface as a reactant at cathode, an innovative tri-layer solid state electrolyte framework as separator, and solidified lithium or lithium aluminum alloy as anode.

This scale factor enhancement coefficient (SFEC) can be as high as a million.  If the uncertainty in the laser frequency for an FRLG is the same as that for an RLG for otherwise identical conditions, then the factor of enhancement in measurement precision (FEMP) for an FRLG is the same as the SFEC.  However, it has been suggested that the frequency uncertainty for an FRLG based on a pair of coupled resonators may be larger than that for an RLG, due to the Petermann factor (PF), thus reducing the FEMP to a value smaller than the SFEC, and possibly to unity.  Theoretical investigation in Phase I has shown that when such an FRLG is operated far above threshold, it may be possible to achieve a value of FEMP significantly larger than unity.  We will carry out theoretical as well as experimental work to establish the maximum possible value of the FEMP that can be achieved for such an FRLG, employing intracavity gain in one cavity and intra-cavity loss in another, using Raman transitions in Rb.  In addition, we will investigate another type of FRLG in which a single ring cavity supports two counter-propagating lasers, without any cross-coupling, also realized using Raman transitions in Rb.  For each laser in this system, the nature of the eigenvalues indicates that the FEMP would also be limited by the PF.  However, it is not yet clear whether the PF exists in this case.  We will explore ways to resolve this issue theoretically, by using the approach of Langevin noise operators.  If the PF does not exist, it would indicate that for such an FRLG the FEMP can really be as larger as the SFEC.

Designed to be a modular and versatile software that leverages LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to provide navigation and mapping capabilities, ALIN specifically targets applications requiring high fidelity relative navigation solutions to non-cooperative dynamic spacecraft, such as the inspection and servicing of satellites. The proposed technology provides a solution that is not reliant on traditional dependencies of vision-based solutions like fiducials or prior knowledge of geometry to perform visual template matching. This enables ALIN to be effective in non-cooperative applications and in the presence of inconvenient shadowing, or even total darkness. Additionally, the LiDAR SLAM techniques utilized by Astrobotic provide “maps” of the observed object. These methods provide valuable three-dimensional “model” representations of the target, which is of particular value to missions where the target body has unknown shape, as in planetary or primitive body operations, or in the satellite servicing industry. Phase II work will involve optimizing the ALIN software on a powerful path-to-flight processor platform interfaced to a high-fidelity simulator for a space-grade LiDAR under a flight software framework with the goal of eventually maturing ALIN for use on a flight program.

Even with the advent of higher speed standards in Ethernet and Fibre Channel, the data throughput is crippled due to the need for non-binary encoding and error correction algorithms as a direct result of the limited bandwidth of the optical components. The induced latency and power consumption are acceptable in a data center environment but severely limits high performance computing. Efforts to increase the fundamental optical component bandwidth have not been successful in increasing to the point of achieving binary NRZ data transmission without error correction at 100Gbps. Binary NRZ is the most power and latency efficient means to transmit data in a super computing environment. A revolutionary optical component is needed to break the traditional paradigm.

The innovations that lead to these technical achievements are the design of a common active region for both the laser and EAM, and the use of enhanced coupling strength (ECS) gratings to provide wideband mirrors. This combination allows the laser emission to tune freely with temperature and the EAM absorption to track the laser. Further, the laser-EAM is realized in a single epitaxial growth, and the fabrication is completely monolithic. This provides a highly manufacturable and cost-effective solution to the optical component bandwidth problem.","The primary application of the laser-EAM will be in connectivity of processors and memory banks in a high-performance computing environment. Modern computing is limited by the data latency of the links between the computing elements, and currently available high-speed optical components use non-binary data encoding and error correction algorithms to achieve the data bandwidth. The proposed laser-EAM resolves the optical component bandwidth limitation and will enable higher speed and lower power consumption in the data connections.","The global network traffic continues to grow exponentially, and optical communications standards such as Ethernet and Fiber Channel need a clear path to 100Gbps serial data connectivity to support the demand. Current solutions are power inefficient and have high data latency. To enable an exaflop computer, which is expected in 2022, more than 1M links operating at 100Gbps are needed."

As demands have grown, so has the fidelity, complexity, and precision of spacecraft observations. In addition, modern spacecraft communications bandwidth allows for the transmission of more data than ever. These increased capabilities have placed extra demands on spacecraft science observations; for example, the recent OSIRIS-REx mission regularly executed observation plans with sub-second timing for up to 300 targets each day. Although creating observation plans is usually relegated to the flight operations period of a mission, teams can benefit by considering these observation designs through early stages of mission planning as well. Exceptional collaboration between science teams and operations teams requires a complex web of cumbersome technology for sharing and integrating observation plans and their resulting data. This significant complexity hinders the ability of responsible parties to make informed, sensible, and rapid decisions. Spaceline solves this problem with an application that every party involved can access. Additionally, Spaceline’s flexible access allows users of both browser-based GUI or WebAPI to work with Spaceline directly or link Spaceline to their own tools, maintaining a known provenance for every kernel. Spaceline is a server- and web-based application developed under two in-progress NASA SBIR Phase II contracts. The Spaceline application consists of three core capabilities: SPICE kernel management, 3D interactive display of a scene, and simulation of science data for any onboard instrument for a given instant in time. We propose to extend the core functionality of Spaceline from supporting only pre-compiled observation plans (in the form of uploaded CKs) to allowing users to create observation plans directly within Spaceline.",This work will be a welcome addition to any NASA mission looking to reduce costs and risks involved with operations planning. Users will have access to an environment in which they can analyze and measure the impact of proposed observation plans against complex scientific phenomena. This work will facilitate NASA in their goal of developing Mission Design Analysis tools to increase the accuracy of science modeling and enable design of future observing systems by predicting and optimizing their impacts on science data collection.,"The expansion of Spaceline to support operations planning would also facilitate mission planning for commercial Earth-orbiting constellations and Space Domain Awareness missions. Spaceline can also be used in classrooms, allowing students to explore a variety of data models for a planet, even adding their own models created from source data."

To lead technological advancements and successfully execute these missions, NASA desires new & robust onboard automated fault management technologies that address the full range of hardware & software faults, are transparent & reusable across platforms. This will lead to reduced costs and improved autonomy, resilience, & mission quality especially in missions that cannot afford comprehensive fault management and have a higher mission risk tolerance. Global Technology Connection, Inc., (GTC) proposes to automate generation of ARADISS (Adaptive Real-time Anomaly Detection and Identification for Space Systems) models tuned to any given system. Feasibility of this framework was successfully demonstrated in Phase I on multi-rotor UAVs, electric propulsion testbed, and a preliminary CubeSat dataset. In Phase II, GTC plans to use a CubeSat platform used on NASA missions to steer the development, evaluation, and hardware integration planning. ARADISS models include simple machine learning norm models to estimate system operational variables, and self-adapting anomaly detection and identification models. ARADISS framework is applicable to virtually all electrically powered systems. Independent one-one norm maps make this approach extremely reusable, transparent and explainable. ARADISS models can be rapidly adapted to any platform and are ideal for space platforms with limited processing power. Applicable future space mission platforms include NISAR, SWOT, Dragonfly, and SPHEREx. GTC has received interest from several space technology firms, and has partnered with CubeSat OEM and a space systems integration for Phase II for rapid technology transition and space deployment in Phase III.

Okean Solutions proposes to significantly improve FM system modeling and analysis by integrating their model-based fault management tool/system, called MONSID®, with JPL’s Computer Aided Engineering for Systems Architecture (CAESAR) platform. The innovation will create greater visibility into the FM process and lower the barriers to entry for users who are not FM experts. The combined capability will advance the practice of FM to ultimately decrease manually intensive and error-prone tasks and schedule costs while ensuring FM system robustness and appropriateness. The main application is FM analyses as well as design and software development. This could also be used in Integration and Test (I&T) and operational phases to update onboard FM models and in support of recovery operations. By integrating with CAESAR, Okean Solutions sees unique opportunities to increase visibility and the number of users of the MONSID toolset as well as to provide more functionality for CAESAR.","A MONSID adapter for CAESAR can support FM development in current and future programs, providing rapid model development, improving HW/SW trade accuracy and efficiency for fault containment, and FM performance analyses. It is applicable to a broad range of NASA missions that leverage model-based systems engineering tools. Such missions include Europa Clipper, Mars Sample Retrieval Lander, Psyche, CubeSats (INSPIRE, SunRISE),and future missions from near-Earth to interplanetary, risk-averse, and experimental.","MONSID and CAESAR are both model-based and application agnostic.

HPC models of heliophysics can also support the development of space weather mitigation technologies and decision making. NASA currently employs HPC models, such as ENLIL, to model the physics of the Solar wind.  However, ENLIL cannot currently fully exploit the parallel processing capabilities of modern multi-core compute nodes, nor can it utilize the GPU accelerators now common on NASA’s HPC clusters. Maintaining a mission critical code like ENLIL can be a challenge, as both the number of man hours required to enable the code to properly exploit new hardware is non-trivial, and the HPC environment itself is continually evolving. A new Domain Specific Language (DSL), together with a source-to-source translator (called ptool), is proposed that will allow mission critical NASA codes, like ENLIL, to be written in a form that allows for improved portability between various HPC environments and hardware (including GPU accelerators) and reduce the level of skill and effort required to maintain and extend such codes. A proof-of-concept prototype of ptool was developed in Phase I and demonstrated using an in-house CFD solver. The main deliverables in Phase II are progress reports, the final, production version of ptool, and an updated version of ENLIL rewritten using ptool’s syntax that exploits modern, heterogeneous HPC platforms, and will be easier to maintain as the HPC environment continues to evolve.","The proposed work will result in the modernization of ENLIL, a mission critical code used by the NASA CCMC for modeling heliophysics. By improving the performance, portability, and ease of maintenance of ENLIL, the proposed work will support NASA’s role under the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, and have a beneficial impact on NASA’s space weather forecasting and mitigation capabilities.","The Domain Specific Language (DSL) and translator may be applied to any Cartesian grid based PDE solver. In addition to space weather modeling, the tools developed under this work will potentially have application in the financial industry. Since the proposed DSL reduces the skill and effort required to write portable HPC code, the tools developed here may be useful for academic teaching/research."

Breakthroughs in refractory and ceramic materials have enabled engineers to consider the use of high-performance fuel, moderator, and structural materials that were historically unavailable for use in heritage NTP systems. For relevant materials developed after earlier testing campaigns, no experimental data exists. The successful construction of the proposed testing and evaluation infrastructure will enable performance verification of these materials in a prototypical environment. Without the proposed testing infrastructure, a variety of novel, high-performance materials will not reach the TRLs required for reliable infusion into target NTP-enabled missions.",Ultrahigh-temperature testing of NTP materials in a prototypical environment is critical to the safe development of the NTP engines NASA will use to transport astronauts to Mars. This facility will increase the national capacity for static hot hydrogen testing by 50% and will be the only facility designed with a materials characterization frame that features contact and non-contact strain measurement capabilities. NASA will be able to study how hydrogen embrittlement affects materials at-temperature as well as the elastic modulus of ceramics.,"This testing facility is critical to USNC-Tech’s product development and overarching commercialization plans, specifically the maturation of the fuels, moderators, and other materials within modern NTP systems. It will also support the high-temperature mechanical property testing needs of USNC’s development of the Micro Modular Reactor and its proprietary Fully Ceramic Microencapsulated fuel."

As part of this system, in situ resource utilization (ISRU) process requires a pressurized volume to be evacuated to prevent the loss of products to the vacuum of space. While processing the regolith, some of the released gasses have acidic elements that must be handled for oxygen production. For this reason, NASA has expressed the need for a contamination-tolerant vacuum pump which can recover vapors from the pressurized volume before discarding the spent regolith. The pump has two firm requirements: One promising ISRU oxygen extraction method is Gustafoson’s carbothermal system. This system is designed to collect oxygen from the Lunar regolith utilizing the carbothermal reduction process. The process may be summarized as a reduction of collected minerals containing metallic oxides (regolith) with carbonaceous source to form CO and H2, followed by a reduction of CO with H2 to form CH4 and water, and finally electrolysis of the water to form O2 and H2. While unnecessary on the pilot tested on Earth, a deployable system requires a contaminant tolerant vacuum pump to evacuate a process vessel to prevent the loss of any products or consumables to the vacuum of space. To accomplish this request, Air Squared is proposing the development of a robust, oil-free, Contamination-Tolerant Scroll Vacuum Pump (CTSVP).","By drawing a vacuum to preserve ISRU consumables in a pressurized volume and maintaining optimal performance while handling contaminant laden regolith or atmospheric vapors without contaminating downstream processes, the CTSVP fills two ISRU technological gaps.

SEER enables heating lunar regolith to maintain a focal point temperature between 1,000-1,100°C and sintering at translation speeds of between 1-10 mm/s. SEER may be interfaced with a primary solar concentrator through a fiber optic waveguide, or through a free space optical design for dramatically improved transmission efficiencies and reduced launch mass. The SEER design is scalable, efficient, durable, lightweight, and an ideal choice for regolith sintering and ISRU on the Moon. SEER enables continuous operation for high temperature thermochemical processes without causing damage to sensitive optics. The design is resistant to fouling from regolith dust, spallation, sputtering, and gases produced with high processing temperatures. The objectives of the proposed Phase II project are to advance the SEER TRL from 4 to 5 by documenting test performance in a simulated operational environment, establishing predicted performance for subsequent SEER development phases, and defining scaling requirements for SEER’s use in additive construction and manufacturing on the Moon with the ultimate goal of being scalable to 11.1 kW of delivered solar energy.

The issue remains critical for both manned and unmanned lunar or planetary missions, where key infrastructures can be degraded over time by highly abrasive dust. While active dust-mitigation approaches consume energy to remove dust from a surface, passive approaches typically aim to reduce surface energy to make dust less prone to sticking.

It became apparent during Phase I research that mathematical models representing dust adherence and removal force and the ability to test dust mitigation devices, in a representative environment, were both lacking. Two research scientists have joined our team to develop a mathematical model during Phase II.  The model intends to predict charged lunar dusts ability to adhere to xEMU surfaces and how dust particles may be removed by associated purge flows.

The system consists of electromagnetic arrays that are independently commutated to induce heat and forces to melt and manipulate metals.  This technology applies well-understood phenomena in a completely novel way for a substantial technological advance.  Its compact, integrated hardware has no moving parts, an infinite workspace, and scales to match material throughput to available power.  Current state of the art recycling and manufacturing is precise but slow, static, and life limited.  The inductive foundry produces basic feedstocks (ingots, bars, plates, filament) and may ultimately produce complex shapes (brackets, tools, extrusions) significantly faster than additive or subtractive manufacturing.  The rough products generated by our in-space inductive foundry can either be used in low-precision applications (radiators, scaffolding, tanks) or more complex applications using additional manufacturing processes in space.  The inductive foundry is the ideal tool for remote and continuous in-space recycling and manufacturing.  It has immediate applications on the ISS, a sustainable business case to manage orbital debris, and is a foundational element of the cislunar economy. In Phase I, Yolo Robotics concluded that this approach is feasible and successfully demonstrated moving, melting, forming, and cooling aluminum using its advanced inductive foundry technology. This Phase II effort shall integrate these processes into a complete prototype, culminating in a demonstration in vacuum on a reduced-gravity flight to validate the recycling process and characterize feedstocks produced in an analogous space environment.","For NASA, the initial application of the induction foundry is to convert waste streams into useful feedstocks in support of remote and novel missions.  At small scales, NASA can create a raw material reserve for repairs and new parts on the ISS and remote outposts.  At larger scales, this technology can recycle orbital debris, convert rocket bodies, or even upcycle the ISS if otherwise deorbited.  In the future, induction foundries will be a key element in cislunar and lunar infrastructure construction and operation.","For non-NASA applications, inductive foundries enable new opportunities for the cislunar economy and beyond.

To compound the issue, remote assets generally have myopic sensor feedback that does not provide sufficient information alone to maintain situational awareness for effective operations. As such, operators must also control any additional sensor apparatus or robots used to maintain situational awareness. Situational awareness has a large impact on mission outcome-salient information fused and appropriately displayed to a remote operator has shown to result in higher mission success. However, reconfiguring a multi-agent system to increase situational awareness will further burden crew workload as operators will need to manually allocate and position additional resources to obtain requisite views. To address this issue, TRACLabs has invented a framework called ACES (Autonomous Cobots to Enhance Situational Awareness) to enhance perceptual feedback and decrease the cognitive load on remote robot operators by building upon ideas from active perception, sliding autonomy and task-level commanding. The resulting system autonomously positions additional robots or sensor systems not currently engaged in a task to obtain additional meaningful percepts to enhance operator situational awareness, thus increasing the likelihood of successful task completion while reducing cognitive load on crew.","Multiple near-term and future NASA missions and projects could benefit from the advances we expect to see over the lifetime of this project, including:","OSAM efforts of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles (RV) division; DARPA RSGS; Commercial Space Companies; Inspection/verification for remote facilities for Energy, Automotive, and Chemical Manufacturing sectors"

The technology allows any Intra-Vehicular Activity (IVA) robot to collect data about its surrounding environment and share it with other robots via a central server to perform localization and mapping tasks. Sensors equipped to each IVA robot can be co-registered and fused with a collaboratively generated physical map of an environment which is stored on a central server. This fused multi-layered map of the environment consists of layers in which individual sensor data is registered with the physical map of the environment. The system is sensor and camera agnostic, meaning that any sensor and camera can be ingested by the system. This system not only eliminates the need for a ground team to manually update Astrobee maps, but also enables autonomous state assessment operations in space habitats which fills technical gaps identified in the Integrated System for Autonomous and Adaptive Caretaking (ISAAC) project. Developed hardware prototypes are to be used for validation in real-world environments by integrating the hardware and the software components of the system together. Beyond NASA, applications outside of Astrobee are not only feasible, but desirable. Improvements to the current state-of-the-art for collaborative SLAM not only impact Astrobee, but any system that uses multiple robots or SLAM in general. With the recent emergence of commercial space stations, autonomous cars, augmented reality (AR), and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there are many opportunities in which the technology can penetrate the market and make a ground breaking difference in the world of robot autonomy for years to come.","Current IVA robot programs such as Astrobee have the potential to directly benefit from this technology. IVA robots must be able to perform autonomous state assessment activities such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and leak identification which future orbiting facilities such as Lunar Gateway will require.

Accordingly, focus has been on constructing a swarm of these smallsats wherein each smallsat (or ‘node’) would transmit its individual signal that is then ‘arrayed’ together to form a combined signal that has more power. The traditional approach to this arraying concept is to pre-condition each node signal in phase and time prior to transmission such that all signals arrive at the receiver coherently. This phase adjustment is very burdensome and problematic for the space node. We refer to this arraying approach as spaced-based arraying’. Our innovation performs this signal ‘arraying’ operation in a way that effectively eliminates all the node synchronization and coordination complexities noted above by implementing ground-based Arraying. We denote our innovative arraying technology as “Swarm Array Coherent Combining” (SACC). SACC uses ground terminal signal processing to extract node phasing and timing for coherent combining allowing each node signal to be ‘uncoupled’ from each other and have significantly relaxed time and phase requirements. Also, noteworthy is that SACC technology provides the basis for a novel satellite relay concept that offers all the benefits of a large Phased Array in space by merely using a swarm of simple uncoupled smallsat transponder nodes that perform as elements of the array. Our SACC ground technology extracts all the phase information of these noise-dominated signals to achieve coherent node arraying. These space nodes do not need precise intra-swarm frequency and time coordination. Another key feature is that there is no need to calibrate any of the communication links even crosslinks. We refer to this novel relay system as the SACC SmallSat Relay System (SSRS).","As NASA continues to explore our solar system, there is always a need for communications. With the vast emergence of smallsats both to do science and to support communications, the SACC SSRS represents a resilient, flexible and efficient way to leverage these smallsats to provide these NASA communications needs. In particular, because the SSRS imposes negligible requirements both on the swarm and its constituent transponder nodes, it can be easily designed and operationalized to support NASA communications over all space regimes.",There is an ever-growing number of commercial smallsat constellations being deployed to support connectivity to the INTERNET. There are always issues related to achievable data rates and visibility to ground stations. Our SSRS offers the robust flexibility to create swarms of any size to address data rates.

The result is a simple, versatile, cost-effective stage with full bus functionality and with performance capabilities similar to that of a traditional bipropellant pressure-fed stage and which can be configured for cislunar and even Mars missions. Other benefits include scalability; use of green propellants and low-pressure tanks minimizing range safety operations and costs; high thrust for rapid, efficient transfer (compared with electric propulsion systems which have to be launched at higher orbits to avoid low altitude drag and which can require months to reach the targeted orbit while exposing the system to the damaging radiation of the Van Allen belts); minimized size provided by a high performance propulsion system; and attitude control system for long term operations.","A stage providing over 4.3 km/s delta-V to a nanosat payload can be an enabler for many NASA lunar and interplanetary missions. These include missions similar to the NASA Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE), or follow-ons to NASA’s Mars CubeSat missions MarCO-A and -B, and unlike MarCO, could enable Mars Orbit Insertion. It can also be used for NASA LEO and GEO nanosat missions, whether launched as dedicated or as secondary payloads.","Non-NASA applications include commercial and DoD missions requiring high orbital maneuver capabilities. These include dedicated missions on small launch vehicles where additional delta-V is required, as well as commercial space-tug applications, e.g. on Falcon-9 rideshare launches. The stage can also be modified for other applications such as orbital inspectors from LEO to cislunar operations."

Onboard planning enables new tasks to be assimilated independently of ground commands, enhancing near-Earth operations and enabling remote operations. Modern sensor algorithms can run locally on spacecraft to detect potential tasks, such as data collection opportunities for civil science missions, or launch events for defense missions. Planning capabilities are needed to prioritize and schedule tasks with overlapping windows of opportunity without the need for human intervention. Our proposed innovation, which we call Adjutant, is flight software (FSW) for planning that leverages state of the art optimization methods for scalability and relevance to current operations, an open systems approach to plan management from multiple sources, and code generation to simplify mission integration and reduce development time for operators. Adjutant is directly relevant to applications identified in our subtopic, such as missions operating “autonomously and cooperatively at cislunar or more remote destinations” by reducing and eventually eliminating the need for “ground-based semiautonomous scheduling”. Reducing the need for ground-based operations enables more efficient operation of near-Earth constellations, and can be extended to enable persistent remote operations in Cislunar or more remote environments. Our proposed Phase II extension will develop FSW prototypes of planning, goal monitoring, and plan management applications. In conjunction with our existing FSW applications, Adjutant will enable onboard planning and execution of complex missions, including activities such as station keeping, navigation, and fault recovery. Onboard planning will support missions including Earth science such as Landsat Next, heliophysics such as GDC, and exploration such as LunaNet.",,

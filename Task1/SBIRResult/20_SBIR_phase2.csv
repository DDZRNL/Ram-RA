The current ZONA's flagship commercial software called ZAERO for aeroelastic analysis has been adopted by many aerospace companies for over 25 years and has over 100 users worldwide. In the heart of ZAERO is the Unified Aerodynamic Influence Coefficient (UAIC) module that generates the structurally independent AIC matrices by solving the linear unsteady potential equation using the panel methods. Because of the linear potential flow assumption, the unsteady panel methods are not valid at transonic Mach numbers nor at high angles of attack. Due to the advances of the CFD methods, we can foresee that the replacement of panel methods by the CFD methods for aeroelastic analysis is on the horizon. To keep ZONA’s competitive edge in the software-licensing market of aeroelastic analysis, ZONA will develop a next generation of ZAERO, herein referred to as ZAERO++ in which the AIC matrix generated by the UAIC module will be replaced by the CFD-based AIC matrix generated by the GENAIC module that we developed in Phase I. With the user and application manuals that will be generated in Phase II, ZAERO++ will become a product-ready commercial software as the outcome of the Phase II effort.","The proposed effort is highly relevant to on-going and future NASA fixed wing projects, which involve innovative design concepts such as the Truss-Braced Wing, Blended Wing Body, and Supersonic Business Jet. The proposed work will offer a computational tool to NASA designers for generating the structurally independent AIC matrix that can be repeatedly used for aeroelastic analysis throughout the structural design cycle.","The proposed CFD-based AIC matrix generator can be applied to many categories of flight vehicles including blended wing-bodies, sub/supersonic transports, reusable launch vehicles, and similar revolutionary concepts pursued. Hence, the proposed research and its outcomes will be highly needed for designing the next generation of civil as well as military aircraft."

Work in Phase II will prepare the code for commercialization by expanding its capabilities and use cases and further validating the formulation with a variety of demonstrations that are meaningful to both the NASA and commercial communities. The expanded capabilities will include (1) further development of the code in the supersonic regime, (2) integration with static and dynamic loads, trim, and flutter solutions, (3) and generation of aerodynamic reduced order models for aeroservoelastic analysis and design. A direct plug-in for NASTRAN will be developed, automating grid generation from existing NASTRAN models, and direct integration into NASTRAN’s analysis and optimization solutions. Models being considered for demonstration include the F5 fighter wing, the AGARD 445.6 wing, and the KTH-NASA generic fighter aeroelastic wind-tunnel model.","Potential NASA applications will include the use of the developed technology for design of any new generation aircraft or RLV system including complex and novel configurations such as blended wing-bodies, truss-braced wing configurations, low-boom supersonic configurations, etc. Additionally, the aeroelasticity branch at LaRC will be prime candidates for using this technology and capability.","This technology is expected to have commercial applications to aircraft design of bombers, fighters, UAV’s, and general aviation airplanes and specifically those operating in the high-subsonic and low-supersonic regimes.  As such, it is expected to have significant commercial applications in airplane structural design, control system design, and aeroservoelastic analyses."

This work is aimed at addressing the aerospace industry’s need for technically feasible and economically viable high-temperature, aft-engine measurement capabilities that enable required noise diagnostic capabilities including characterization of fundamental jet noise sources and structures, and robust measurement capability for making combustion noise measurements. The proposed fiber-optic pressure sensor consists of a microfabricated silicon optical pressure sensor with an optical fiber exiting the side of the device. Placed within a low-profile housing, this design represents a robust, surface-mounted, miniature pressure sensor that possesses superior sensor survivability for aft-engine (high-temperature) measurements and immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI). The flow disturbance for this sensor is minimal because of the surface-mount design and small footprint. Use of fiber optics facilitate the remote placement of all sensor optoelectronics and this extends the upper temperature limit of the measurement capability. A custom-built, ruggedized optoelectronics system that leverages a novel dual-wavelength common-mode signal rejection method for amplitude modulated optical sensors, will be paired with the sensor to provide an output that is suitable for voltage input to dynamic data acquisition systems that are typically used in the test and measurement world for acoustic and dynamic pressure sensor measurements.","The proposed high-temperature, low-profile fiber-optic pressure sensor system has the potential to be transportable across multiple NASA facilities where model-scale and full-scale engine tests occur. The Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR) and the new DGEN Aeropropulsion Research Turbofan (DART) at NASA Glenn are excellent candidates for the sensor technology. In addition, NASA’s Commercial Supersonic Technology Project will need research testing of exotic engine designs.","Commercial turbofan engine manufacturers have long desired modal array measurements within the primary nozzle to reduce cost and increase information return compared with far-field static engine testing.

NASA is supporting the development of technology required for the success of these new UAM aircraft in which improved methods for acoustic modeling play a large role.  Safe and quiet operation are critical to public acceptance.  The proposing team intends to strongly leverage our recent major advances in the modeling and analysis of DEP UAM aircraft by enhancing our existing state-of-the-art DEP aircraft flight simulation, aeromechanics and acoustics analysis software with improved capabilities for modeling noise sources of specific importance to DEP UAM aircraft.  In Phase I, leveraged software was enhanced and demonstrated by performing acoustic predictions with high fidelity aeromechanics for a multirotor UAM aircraft in hover and transition flight with time-varying RPM on eight rotors.  The goal of the Phase II effort is to develop and deliver commercial-grade, comprehensive acoustic analysis for UAM aircraft, that would provide fast, accurate prediction of critical acoustic characteristics associated with DEP UAM aircraft, including (1) noise generated by the simultaneous operation of multiple, variable RPM rotors and props, (including coaxial rotors), (2) interacting rotor/prop/wing/airframe noise, (3) broadband noise pertinent to eVTOL UAM aircraft, (4) noise due to inflow turbulence from a variety of sources, and (5) electric motor noise.  The final software will include both a stand-alone analysis and, of significance, a flight simulation able to predict the acoustic impact of UAM aircraft control strategies during general maneuvering flight within realistic wind/turbulence environments during take-off, landing and cruise.","The comprehensive acoustic analysis proposed for development would enable accurate prediction of acoustics of UAM aircraft in computation times commensurate with daily design work, directly supporting NASA’s ARMD Strategic Thrust #4 - Safe, Quiet, and Affordable Vertical Lift Air Vehicles in the NASA Technology Roadmap.  The developed analysis would be of immediate use to NASA and the UAM entrepreneurs NASA supports in evaluating and designing low-noise UAM air-taxi configurations and identifying methods to reduce noise of UAM vehicles.","CDI collaborates with many UAM vehicle developers with an immediate need for a comprehensive acoustic analysis for DEP UAM aircraft.  The analysis will also be of great value to the FAA for use developing acoustic certification criteria for UAM air taxis, and the DoD and major rotorcraft manufacturers in analyzing acoustic characteristics of future vertical lift (FVL) concepts."

Particles emitted from jet turbines serve as cloud nuclei, and changes in their microphysical properties will impact upper level cloud formation, including contrails, which represents the major impact of aviation emissions on atmospheric radiation balance (climate change). Investigations into the impacts of current and future aviation emissions must determine any changes in the degree to which emissions affect contrail formation, cirrus cloud formation, and their evolution over time. The SBIR project seeks to develop an instrument suitable for both ground-based emission measurements as well as in-flight, low-pressure measurements of the ice forming properties of particles emitted from jet engines, building on existing continuous flow diffusion chamber approaches. The new instrument, the Counter for Ice Nucleated in Contrails Homogeneously and Heterogeneously (CINCH2), will measure ice formation by exposing engine emission particles to a region of controlled temperature and water vapor supersaturation and measuring any ice crystals that form in those conditions. The CINCH2 approach is well suited for both ground-based and airborne-based measurements because it will be fast, relatively compact, and capable of reproducing the entire range of atmospheric conditions important for studying ice nucleation processes. Phase II work will develop and test major subsystems for sample conditioning, refrigeration, and ice crystal detection, and combine these into a portable prototype instrument. Our overall goal is to produce the first commercial instrument capable of measuring ice formation in contrail emissions, as well as be suitable for studying ice formation on naturally-existing airborne particles in cirrus conditions more broadly.","Applications include NASA's Advanced Air Vehicles Program, which has the goal of enabling new aircraft to ""fly...cleaner, quieter, and more efficiently"", which in turn requires minimization of aviation impacts on the environment. It will serve as a powerful new tool for characterizing emissions on the ground at NASA facilities, such as the Advanced Subsonic Combustion Rig at NASA Glenn Research Center. The technology is also relevant to NASA's Earth Science Research Program and aviation emission focused missions such as ACCESS and ACCESS II.","Non-NASA applications include university-led research focused on understanding ice cloud formation and evolution, as well as government-led airborne research focused on similar topics, both domestically and internationally.

The Phase II will continue to focus on the design improvements started in the Phase I: (1) power loss and cooling and (2) electric drive integration, and will also include the building and testing of a prototype motor and drive system. In this work, we have avoided the use of a permanent magnet (PM) based motor arrangement, which of course, would contain NdFeB magnets. Our concept incorporates an asynchronous (induction) style motor with embedded inverters and a two-phase semi-evaporative cooling system. Our total system (motor and drive) ultimately targets a continuous power density of 10 kW/kg and 12.6 kW/L or greater. The motor and inverter design is based on two novel technologies and related controls for electric motors that have yielded record torque density and power density. The first novel technology is Variable Cross-Section Wet Coils (VCSWC) that configures the conductor windings with integrated cooling. The second technology is the integrated electronic drives, which are cooled as part of the same circuit that cools the stator, and which makes the full system very compact. Based on the results of the Phase I the proposed electric motor to be built in the Phase II should be a 2 MW, 5000 RPM machine that represents a number of advances over the extant OSU record-breaking induction motor, and will be a world record winning motor with double the torque and an increased power density (25% improvement to12.5 kW/kg, continuous) with, at the same time, an increased efficiency (98.5%, cruise). The Phase I/Phase II electric motor has an increased number of conductors per slot, and this is a key to loss reduction and increased efficiency. The Phase II will be focused on a design optimization within these basic parameters, and then a build and test program.","In addition to electric passenger aircraft, NASA can benefit from these high power density induction  motors because of low cost, and high efficiency for space applications.

This aspect concerns the transition region between the RANS and LES modes of such hybrid methods. The predictive accuracy of the hybrid methods tends to degrade under certain conditions of flow especially involving shallow regions of boundary later separation and reattachment.  To enable improved predictions of the aerodynamics and flow behavior in high Reynolds number industrial flow problems using hybrid RANS/LES approach, the foundation for the SBIR technology successfully established in Phase I in the form of a Synthetic Turbulence Generation (STG) and an Artificial Acoustic Liner (AAL) software module, will be enhanced and matured into a production-ready software toolkit in Phase II.

The Vertical Flight Society is tracking the progress of these vehicle concepts via a web portal that currently features over 140 vectored thrust, 60 lift plus cruise configurations, and approximately 100 wingless multicopters. Many of these vehicles have flown as scaled proof of concepts, while several others are flying as full-scale prototypes. While many of the concepts are envisioned to fly in an autonomous mode, the vehicles that will be certified by the FAA initially will all likely have pilot/operators on-board. Furthermore, these mostly electric vertical takeoff and landing concepts (eVTOL) will also likely feature advanced flight control concepts with highly augmented response types and a variety of cockpit control concepts from conventional helicopter to conventional fixed wing to unified (i.e., the F-35 approach). Given the industry push, these vehicles are clearly coming, but is the public ready to accept this disruptive technology? Besides the noise factor, which is not addressed here, there are safety and comfort factors to consider as well as a pilot pool that is likely to have less training and experience then those flying in the commercial transport market. To this end, a team led by Systems Technology, Inc. is developing the UAM Pilot Assessment Software System (U-PASS) toolbox that utilizes a Task-Pilot-Vehicle (TPV) approach to assess safety in terms of handling qualities and comfort in terms of ride qualities. By the end of Phase II, a prototype U-PASS toolbox will be available to support the design, analysis, and certification of UAM. Further, U-PASS can be used to enhance NASA’s FlightCODE (Flight dynamics and control modeling tool for COnceptual DEsign), an integrated collection of tools for the flight dynamics and control assessments of rotorcraft designs including eVTOL configurations.","The U-PASS toolbox directly supports the goals of the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Project to “develop and validate tools, technologies and concepts to overcome key barriers for vertical lift vehicles” including the FlightCODE software suite. Furthermore, U-PASS will provide a means to support the NASA National Campaign, which will provide “valuable knowledge that will be given to the organizations working to establish the certification requirements and standards needed for the market to move forward.”","A study by Frost & Sullivan sees the UAM marketplace “expanding with a compound annual growth rate of about 46% to more than 430,000 units in operation by 2040.” There is a need for the new methodologies in U-PASS to support the design, analysis, and certification of these vehicles.

For turbo-generators/range-extenders utilized in regional EAP concepts, small lightweight turboshaft engines are an excellent choice due to their maturity and availability. However, at small power scales, gas turbines are less efficient.

Analysis shows that the 3D-printed hybrid laminate recuperators provide reductions in volumes and weight of 4.4X and 7.7X, respectively, compared to conventional recuperators. These weight reductions translate directly into shorter fuel payback times and opportunities to increase payload or range.

The trend in the design of modern gas turbine engines is for ever-increasing cycle efficiency and reduced specific fuel consumption. To achieve these engine cycle efficiency goals, the low and high-pressure compressors (HPC) are pushed to ever-increasing levels of pressure ratio. Increasing levels of compressor pressure ratio results in higher rotor tip relative Mach number in the HPC front stages, and consequently steeper performance characteristic maps. The compressors with steep characteristics typically require variable geometry inlet guide vanes as well as variable stators in the first few stages to provides the desired performance and stability in an engine system. The design and development time of a modern high-pressure compressor with variable geometry can take years of design-build-test iterations. Determining the optimal combination of vane angle resets that will provide the desired compressor performance in an engine system environment is a time-consuming and expensive part of the development of high-pressure compressors. The proposed technology will include the AI-based multistage axial compressor performance prediction model, which can be easily incorporated in the system analysis tool and reliably predict the performance with high accuracy across the entire operating range of compressor even with multiple variable guide vanes and the capability to restore the compressor geometry based on the limited number of parameters, dramatically reducing the duration of the development of the compressor and the entire engine thus helping to approach true optimal engine performance and reduce the chances of additional expensive design iterations in real-life projects.","The research is closely aligned with NASA Aeronautics programs in the areas of Compact Gas Turbine and Electrified Aircraft Propulsion and will augment the corresponding Advanced Air Transport Technology Project's Technical Challenges.

Unfortunately, deployment of these measurement techniques into cryogenic wind tunnels has proven difficult. A system that can provide global measurements of mean and unsteady skin friction is of significant interest. ISSI and WMU propose exploiting existing measurement systems for temperature and pressure and utilizing a new variational mathematical approach that can extract global skin friction from high spatial resolution distributions of surface temperature acquired using Temperature- and Pressure-Sensitive Paint (TSP/PSP) or IR thermography. PSP and TSP are high TRL tools that are currently used in wind tunnels at both room temperature and cryogenic conditions. During the Phase I program, NASA provided the ISSI/WMU team with a set of cryogenic boundary layer transition data. This data was acquired using TSP data on a CRM model in the NTF. This data was reprocessed to produce global distributions of skin friction on the wing. The data clearly shows variations in skin friction over the wing and high-resolution features such as separation and attachment lines in the turbulent wedges at the leading edge of the wing. Combining the proven measurement capabilities of TSP and PSP with this new variational approach to extraction of skin friction from surface temperature and pressure distributions results in a low-risk approach to providing global skin friction measurements in cryogenic wind tunnels.","The clear NASA targets for this measurement capability are high Reynolds number facilities such as the NTF and 1/3-meter cryogenic wind tunnels. Quantitative measurements of skin friction should have immediate impact in NASA efforts to develop and design newer aerospace vehicles. Efforts to deploy laminar flow wings or coatings on legacy aircraft would also benefit from this measurement. Even without quantitative capability, the measurement offers something similar to oil flow visualization, which is not possible in these facilities.","The final product from this program should be a system capable of acquiring high spatial resolution distributions of skin friction on a model using Temperature-and Pressure-Sensitive Paint data. This is a technological capability that is of interest to ISSI’s current commercial, research, and military wind tunnel customers. ISSI expects to aggressively market this capability to these customers."

Unique to this design is the ability to wirelessly recharge the rotor de-ice system at electric vehicle docking stations using inductive coupling during scheduled UAM battery pack recharge cycles. Proof of concept of a wireless UAM rotor blade anti-icing system was demonstrated during the Phase I Icing Tunnel trials as well as the evaluation of promising ice sensors.

The large number of vehicles that are being designed to ferry passengers in dense urban environments will almost exclusively feature fly-by-wire flight control systems that may have advanced response-types. The processes and requirements needed to certify these disparate vehicles for operation within the National Airspace System are still emerging. To aid in the requirements and certification process, Systems Technology, Inc. (STI), under sponsorship by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is employing a mission-oriented approach to define and assess Mission Task Elements (MTEs) that will provide a flight test certification Means of Compliance (MOC). To minimize the need for physical courses that are standard with MTE evaluations, adapt to the changing regulatory environment, and streamline the testing process, a team led by STI has developed and demonstrated the Means of Compliance Requirements for UAM Evaluations and Ratings (MCRUER) system, a novel tablet-based cockpit display and sensor system, that provides the UAM test pilot evaluator virtual MTE courses against which to assess the vehicle. The on-screen display elements is driven by the actual vehicle’s motion in flight. This system is intended to support the MTE-based means of compliance for Part 23 eVTOL certification activities. Such a device will benefit the NASA AAM National Campaign as well as eVTOL flight test evaluations conducted by the manufacturers and FAA Aircraft Certification Offices. At the conclusion of the Phase II program, a prototype version of the complete MCRUER system will be available to the certification authorities and UAM manufactures to aid in their test and certification activities.","The MCRUER system supports NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility National Campaign intent to provide “…vehicle manufacturers and operators, as well as prospective airspace service providers, insights into the evolving regulatory and operational environment.” In this application, the MCRUER system will provide a means to easily and repeatedly perform MTE evaluations as part of AAM flight test activities. This will standardize these evaluations and maintain clarity in the lessons learned without the need to caveat the experiences due to test differences.","According to HTF Market Intelligence, the estimated UAM market size will be $15.2 billion by 2030.

To improve UAS-NAS aviation safety, Mosaic ATM proposes three UAS technology innovations: 1) An sUAS Collision Avoidance System (sUCAS) 2) A prototype Remote ID beacon, and 3) A prototype Remote ID receiver The first proposed innovation, the sUAS Collision Avoidance System (sUCAS), will be an enhancement to existing collision avoidance systems, specifically for mitigating collision risk with sUAS. sUCAS will take advantage of the position data broadcast by sUAS to present timely and situational awareness and maneuver guidance to augment a pilot’s see-and-avoid capability. The ultimate vision for sUCAS is to exist as an application on a pilot’s electronic flight bag (EFB). The second proposed innovation, a Remote ID beacon, will be a small, low-mass, portable, long range, self-powered module that can be mounted to an sUAS to broadcast Remote ID messages in accordance with the recently passed FAA rule. An integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) chip will provide interpolated position information of the sUAS. The third proposed innovation, a Remote ID receiver, like the beacon, will be a small, low-mass, portable, self-powered module that can be mounted to the interior windshield of the manned aircraft cockpit. The purpose of the receiver is to extend the effective range of the Remote ID beacon and integrate with sUCAS in the GA cockpit.","Applications within NASA include projects falling under the Airspace Operation and Safety program, especially those oriented towards future aviation systems like UTM, AAM, and ATM-X which have goals to safely accommodate emergent air vehicles.","Non-government markets for sUCAS and the Remote ID receiver include GA aircraft operators who fly in lower altitudes.

It operates in two modes: a preflight inspection routine that uses an aircraft's own propellers as a vibration stimulus, and passive in-flight monitoring, identifying defects and alerting personnel or triggering automated contingency measures. Although there are commercial systems that use vibration and acoustic data to guide maintenance intervals, none are able to diagnose defects before takeoff, and most of their focus is on guiding additional human inspection and maintenance activities rather than providing input into automated systems. Future high assurance aviation systems will require the higher fidelity and more effective automated health diagnostics that PreSound provides. During Phase I, GreenSight successfully proved the feasibility of PreSound in its small UAS implementation. We were able to demonstrate using a preflight ground testing routine not only that PreSound can reliably detect the presence of an off-nominal condition, but that it can identify the specific nature of the defect.  With future extension to in-flight use in mind, we formulated a novel preprocessing method that is especially immune to the uncontrolled airframe stimulus that will be encountered in actual flight conditions. In Phase 2, we intend to develop and commercialize two variants of PreSound. PreSound-S is optimized for sUAS and will run entirely on the native flight control and computing hardware that is already on the aircraft, gathering accelerometer data from the flight controller's IMU. PreSound-L will be optimized for larger, more complex, passenger-carrying aircraft. It will use multiple dedicated yet inexpensive and low-SWAP hardware monitoring and computing nodes to run the PreSound detection algorithms.","PreSound can reduce the level and human labor required to maintain a high assurance level in aviation, which has immediate benefits for NASA programs in Advanced Air Mobility. PreSound reduces the effort required for pre and post flight inspection and potential lengthens routine inspection intervals. Specific relevant NASA projects include:","GreenSight has an immediate commercialization path to deploy PreSound to its network of automated UAS used for data gathering at commercial facilities all over the world.

However, there remain barriers to increased adoption. NASA has recognized that current autonomous systems have poor perception of the environment. This is a problem because detecting and avoiding non-cooperative aircraft in all weather is a key requirement for operation in the National Airspace (NAS). During Phase I of this SBIR, KMB Telematics performed a feasibility study to determine whether it was possible to design a small, lightweight radar that would allow small drones (<55 lbs.) see other small drones, as well as larger targets. This solves an unmet need in the market, as there is currently no DAA radar with low enough size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) to be mounted on battery-operated small UAS (sUAS). This is a critical issue because sUAS use cases represent the majority of the total addressable market (TAM) currently imagined for the commercial drone market. To solve this problem, the approach taken was to evaluate KMB’s proprietary imaging radar technology which was originally developed over 18 months of IRAD for the autonomous vehicle (AV) market. The Phase I R&D concluded that it was possible to adapt KMB imaging radar to the UAS use case, resulting in a substantial improvement over the current state of the art. Our goal in this SBIR Phase II is to develop a SWAP-C DAA radar system, which allows the sUAS to safely fly in the NAS.

An actual network-enabled and modular commercially available FMS will be reconfigured for this project and tested in a simulation and used in flight to assess its ability. Therefore, this project will build an actual example of a Cloud FMS.  This proposal follows on a Phase I project in which an approximation of an FMS was used to demonstrate feasibility.   Once configured, functions can be added to the Cloud FMS to further enhance NAS safety and improve capacity through computations that are heretofore infeasible with the limited resources of a flight-deck-based FMS.

Our Phase I prototype has laid the foundation for such automated weather reasoning, focusing on a specific aspect of autonomous operation with clearly stated practical needs—TMI impact reduction—to demonstrate its capabilities. Today’s manually executed TMIs are often overly restrictive and are not routinely reviewed for possible reduction in scope or duration, resulting in excess delays & costs. To address this, we are developing an autonomous system which will continuously ingest latest weather forecasts, air traffic & TMI information, perform automated Forecast Trend Analysis to compare this latest information with previous forecast(s), identify when forecast trends toward less-severe, and if warranted, launch a search for TMI reduction opportunities. A “what-if” series of parallel fast-time NAS simulations, projecting current situation up to 8 hours ahead, combines meteorologically sound range of potential weather outcomes (given the forecast uncertainty) and parameterized TMI reductions in scope and end times. The application will evaluate results (including those from prior cycles) to establish, with a required degree of confidence, if a non-trivial TMI reduction opportunity exists. If so, it will alert relevant traffic managers and then continue autonomous monitoring, looking for additional TMI reduction opportunities during the operational day. In Phase II, we will transition from emulated to live real-time operation, with input from the FAA ATC System Command Center, using ensemble forecasts, expanded TMI reduction search, and data mining techniques. We will also leverage this technology into other domains, e.g., UAM and UTM.","This autonomous severe weather trend reasoning application supports and could be part of NASA’s goal to enable successful transition to an autonomously operating airspace system.

Phase II will also focus on how weather contributes to a UAS operation risk assessment for both strategic and tactical planning. Since the future weather data and predictions sent to users rely on accurate and reliable wind sensor, verifying the validity of the wind sensor input data will enable trust of the output data created by TruWeather Solutions’ urban wind model.","NASA will find the output of this effort useful in their National Campaign effort around Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM). As NASA and its partners look at vertiport locations and urban flight routes, it will be crucial to understand where to place IoT weather sensors for the best ROI as well as how these sensors can contribute to an urban wind model. Additionally, capabilities developed will directly contribute to NASA System Wide Safety Team’s mission to enable In-time system-wide safety assurance (ISSA) capabilities within the AAM ecosystem.","There is a push for “Smart Cities” initiatives in the US right now. Our FRAIHMWORK solution and the WSDM Service fits perfectly into this concept.

Urban vertiports are potential chokepoints for UAM operations and will need some form of traffic management to maintain safe and efficient operations. Providing traditional air traffic control (ATC) services at each vertiport would be costly. Vertiport automation is needed to provide real-time air traffic and information services.

LAWHAR addresses Subtopic A3.04’s need for dynamic route planning that considers changing environmental conditions (mainly fine-scale wind impacts) and vehicle performance. LAWHAR leverages NCAR’s Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model for predicting building-induced wind-flow effects at fine resolutions, applies clustering to predict dynamically changing wind hazard regions, and reroutes UAM aircraft away from these hazard regions. Phase I provided a proof-of-concept by demonstrating actionable wind hazard guidance for several Dallas, TX downtown Vertiports for a challenging cold weather-front passage scenario. In Phase II, we build on Phase I’s success to create a commercial, licensable low-altitude weather guidance tool for several use cases that benefit NASA UAM researchers, UAM/Helicopter/UAS operators and UAM infrastructure planners.

(PSI) proposes to complete development of a unique venturi for propellant feed systems that uses a passively controlled throat area to rapidly and automatically adjust flow rate. The Adaptive Venturi is a safety device that eliminates fluid hammer in gaseous, liquid, and cryogenic systems by adjusting flow rate to prevent pressure surges. These benefits are achieved without adding weight or volume. No sensors or electronics are used and no power is required. For high-pressure oxygen systems, the Adaptive Venturi eliminates the risk of ignition caused by adiabatic compression. This device has been demonstrated with a prompt response time and zero evidence of instability. In Phase I, PSI’s existing Adaptive Venturi was optimized specifically for high-pressure oxygen applications. The component’s performance was evaluated using gaseous nitrogen to quickly iterate and improve the geometric design. This effort resulted in an optimized design that reduces gas pressurization rates by more than 85% in comparison to a conventional orifice or venturi. In Phase II, the Adaptive Venturi’s ability to prevent ignition due to fluid impact will be demonstrated in the most extreme application, gaseous oxygen at pressures greater than 8,000 psi. This program will result in a final product at the conclusion of the Phase II program, offering a low risk, near-term transition to NASA and commercial propulsion facilities.","Successful demonstration of the Adaptive Venturi will have applications in any oxygen system where high pressures, soft goods, or high flow rates are needed. Extending the lifetime and maximum pressure capability of oxygen components will improve reliability and performance in these applications. More generally, the Adaptive Venturi will reduce the cost of qualifying gas, liquid, and cryogenic feed system by eliminating the need for surge mitigation testing. These benefits can be realized for both ground-based and flight plumbing systems.","The Adaptive Venturi can simplify propellant loading and priming operations for propellant systems in Air Force satellites and missile defense systems employed by the MDA, Army, and Navy.

The sorbent monoliths were also evaluated with respect to carbon-monoxide control, and a path to multipollutant TC control was defined for future R&D. The Phase 2 objectives: (1) to optimize sorbent properties and performance; (2) to design, construct, test, and deliver to NASA two full-scale TC sorbent prototypes; (3) to integrate the full-scale TC Control System (TCCS) with the xPLSS design, and particularly with the Rapid-Cycle Amine (RCA) swing bed for CO2 control. This work will be accomplished in five tasks: (1) Sorbent Development and Optimization; (2) Subscale Sorbent Testing; (3) Full-Scale Prototype Development; (4) Full-Scale Prototype Integration with xPLSS/RCA and Testing; and (5) System Evaluation. The main focus will be full-scale TCCS development and its integration with xPLSS/RCA (Tasks 3 and 4).","The main application of the proposed technology would be in spacecraft life-support systems, mainly in extravehicular activities (space suit), but after modifications also in cabin-air revitalization.","The developed technology may find applications in air-revitalization on board US Navy submarines, in commercial and military aircraft, in the future air-conditioning systems for green buildings, and in advanced scuba-diving systems."

Phase I results demonstrated the feasibility of using nanoporous silica as a vacuum regenerable sorbent for integration into NASA’s xPLSS.  It was shown that this sorbent has significant advantages due to its high capacity for ammonia and other trace contaminants. It also has the ability to be vacuum regenerated for potential future integration into the swing-bed structures in the xPLSS. For Phase II, XploSafe will further investigate physical properties of the sorbent as it related to specific NASA requirements, expand experimental measurements of the capacity and kinetics for the sorption of potential trace contaminants and their combinations to 18 potential target analytes, and develop and verify a prototype for integration in the xPLSS. The combination of the nanoporous silica and a functionalized material will be considered to ensure complete elimination of the wide range of contaminants.  For the prototype, two different versions will be examined, one in which the sorbent will be contained in microporous tubes, preventing all possibility of dust generation at the expense of kinetics; and a second more traditional design based on direct flow through the sorbent filter material. At a minimum, an early prototype is envisioned at the midpoint of the Phase II contract with the final version delivered at the end of the project","Successful development of the proposed technology will advance the state of the art in trace contamination control. As a part the Exploration Portable Life Support System (xPLSS) and the Exploration Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) units, the new sorbent technology will advance the viability of NASA's crewed deep space exploration objectives","Success in developing more effective and efficient filtration media could provide a significant enhancement in the protection of public health and the environment.

In Phase I, Mainstream replaced the liquid sealing mechanism to eliminate the cold-flow driven leakage that the PTLC and ATLC currently experience. In Phase II, Mainstream will develop improved PTLC and ATLC connectors for use on the xEMU prior to 2024.  We will integrate the liquid sealing mechanism as a drop-in replacement to the PTLC and redesign the ATLC.

The prototype will be prepared for a 2023 lunar demonstration with potential integration partner, Intuitive Machines. The proposed prototype will consist of two (2) bi-stable composite beams (targeted thickness of 0.66 mm). On the surface of the beams will be integrated piezoelectric or smart material motorless actuators (as demonstrated in Phase I). The actuators will be spaced along the length of the beam to control the vertical deployment and retraction of the MAD Energy system. During deployment and once deployed, the “c”-shaped bi-stable composite MAD Energy booms deliver the necessary stiffness and area moment of inertia for stable operation on the Lunar surface. The far end of the booms will connect directly to the array roll mandrel. The array roll mandrel includes a central rotation axis, composite ribs, outer mandrel surface, and axially mounted constant force springs. The membrane of the MAD Energy array will provide its own inherent stiffness. The semi-rigid membrane will consist of an approximately 2-ply, unidirectional glass substrate (0.15 mm). In Phase II, Dynovas will focus the development on the MAD Energy system and not on the solar cells and/or electrical circuits themselves. However, a detailed understanding of the array power module and circuitry is required to design the multi-functional membrane and the MAD Energy booms with the force necessary to deploy and retract 10+ kW arrays. The MAD Energy structure mounts to the array stowage box. The seal on the box works in concert with piezo vibration and the Lunar Electrostatic Array Deflector Shield (LEADS) to mitigate dust effects.

Further comparisons will be made of laminates SiC densified with polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) with those SiC densified using the melt infiltration (MI) process.  One of these processes will be selected to fabricate and test laminates reinforced with DiscoTex, stretched DiscoTex and continuous fabrics.  Needle punching selected laminates will also be performed to evaluate its benefits to increase interlaminar toughness.  This added through thickness reinforcement prevents delamination both during processing and in service.  Mechanical and thermal test matrices include both room temperature and high temperature testing.  In addition Pepin Associates will design and build a torch test rig to evaluate material samples with various reinforcement architectures and densification process history. Analysis will be performed to model DiscoTex reinforced laminates in both stretched and unstretched conditions.  The analysis will infer constituent material properties from previously measured data on composites fabricated from both stretched and unstretched DiscoTex.. Using the resulting material model, material properties for arbitrary laminate stacking sequences, fiber volume fractions, and degrees of ply stretching can be estimated. Pepin Associates will fabricate a nozzle extension for a small liquid rocket engine.  The DiscoTex forming process will be developed to most efficiently form the nozzle extension shape.  Samples of the nozzle material will be tested in the torch test rig.  The team will also fabricate a spherical shell atmospheric entry vehicle.

Today their use is limited by their expensive and time-consuming manufacturing process. Delivery times of over six months from order placement are common, a result of the long manufacturing process and the limited number of suppliers. With the domestic need for C/C parts increasing, TDA believes that there is a currently an outstanding opportunity to enter the C/C manufacturing market with a far less expensive, high performance C/C product. We have previously developed a process for economical manufacture of a non-graphitizing resin with an exceedingly high char yield. We now propose to use our demonstrated expertise in carbon manufacturing and commercialization to properly formulate and then use or resin to manufacture C/C parts in days to weeks, instead of months. TDA has therefore proposed a process that eliminates multiple densification cycles while arriving at the same density of the finished product, with equivalent mechanical and thermal properties.","The proposed improved C/C manufacturing process would be used for hot structures for a variety of propulsion systems, including upper stage rocket engines (including those of the Space Launch System), in-space propulsion systems, Lunar/Mars ascent/descent propulsion, nuclear thermal rockets, hot gas valves and separation/attitude control systems. TDA’s process will shorten development and procurement schedules, thereby providing substantial cost savings to all programs that utilize our C/C.","Several DoD agencies desire improved C/C manufacturing for their hypersonic vehicle programs, which make extensive use of C/C hot structures as acreage panels and in the combustor.

The semi-automated z-fiber stitching line from Phase I will be re-designed to introduce full automation, resulting in a repeatable and robust process.  The Phase II converging / diverging nozzle will be designed to fit the sub-scale test rig at Aerojet Rocketdyne’s Orange, VA facility.

These errors are generally not discovered until integration and test phases when costs to fix them are prohibitive. SAESM will enable multiple stakeholders to conduct these analyses without requiring expert knowledge of the underlying modeling language(s).

To further improve the data processing capability and efficiency, researchers, in general, explore from three orthogonal and complementary aspects: algorithm simplification and compression, computing architectures optimized for specific applications, and novel nano-devices that possess unique electrical properties, e.g., synapse- or neuro-alike behavior. These practices are respectively pursued by research societies of machine learning, computer architecture, and solid-state circuit and device. There lacks thorough and sufficient communications and coordination in between. As an example, the quantization of deep neural network (DNN) models often ignores the physical constraints on nano-devices like resistive memory (ReRAM, aka memristor), whose resistance suffers from different variation levels at different resistance values. The higher resistance level can also minimize the power consumption due to the reduced amplitude of the current participating in the computation.

There is a requirement that the crystals be small, below 100 or 50  micrometers, and uniform (the same size within a few percent). The problem: most recombinant protein biopharmaceuticals do not crystallize uniformly. A solution to this problem has been discovered in on-orbit experiments, which produced size coefficients of variation below ~8%.

Specifically, we propose to develop a pulsed power amplifier with a minimum duty cycle of 25% operating over the 65-71 GHz band. The output power of the SSPA is specified to be more than 10 Watts throughout the band of 65-to-71 GHz with an associated PAE of more than 30%. The efficiency and power goals of this program will be realized by employing a combination of state-of-the-art (SOA) device technology, innovative circuit design, and power combining techniques.

For more than 50 years, the Y-junction circulator has been the state-of-the-art MMW technology. They are commercially available with full waveguide band operation up to 40 GHz, although the isolation is generally less than 16 dB. Above 50 GHz the bandwidth is typically less than 4 GHz due to limitations in the ferrite material properties. The narrow bandwidth makes them unsuitable for many systems. Micro Harmonics invented and patented a new hybrid circulator technology. The prototype developed in the Phase I exhibited unsurpassed performance, covering the entire band from 150-190 GHz with 20 dB level isolation. For comparison, a state-of-the-art Y-junction isolator has about 3 GHz bandwidth at 160 GHz. The hybrid theory suggests that even higher levels of performance are possible. During the course of the Phase I work we identified several specific areas in the design that constrain the bandwidth and isolation. In the Phase II effort, we will address these issues and seek to improve the hybrid circulator performance. The hybrid comprises a modified Faraday rotation isolator and an orthomode transducer (OMT). We observed cross-coupling of the vertical and horizontal polarizations in the OMT common section and also in the OMT to isolator transition. This cross-coupling degrades the isolation between the Tx, Rx and antenna ports in the hybrid circulator. The transition is also the prime limiting factor in the bandwidth. Much of the proposed phase II effort is focused on reducing the cross-coupling and improving the bandwidth of the transition. Hybrid prototypes will be developed in seven waveguide bands from 50 GHz to 250 GHz. These prototypes will be delivered to NASA.

Both direct detection (DD) and heterodyne (Het) correlating radiometers are of interest to NASA. The Het systems are technically preferred because of the excellent frequency resolution. However, the DD systems, with appropriate filters, can often achieve the necessary resolution with even lower size, weight and power requirements. Thus, the choice between Het and DD systems is mission specific. Through the Phase II effort, VDI will develop and demonstrate both types of correlating radiometers at frequencies of highest interest to NASA for atmospheric research and weather monitoring, specifically 118 and 183 GHz. At the end of Phase II, VDI will have demonstrated a total of four radiometer systems. At 118GHz, VDI will demonstrate a single channel DD correlating radiometer and a deliverable Het correlating radiometer with broad available IF bandwidth. At 183GHz, VDI will demonstrate two DD radiometer systems, a single channel prototype and a four-channel deliverable system. All systems are expected to achieve excellent performance and the four-channel DD and heterodyne systems will be sufficiently compact for use on Small/CubeSat platforms. Throughout the effort, VDI will focus on the development of basic building blocks for radiometers, including 90-degree hybrids, 180-degree phase shifters, narrow band filters and low 1/f noise detector diodes. Each of the components will be demonstrated at 118 and 183 GHz, and the prospects for scaling to higher frequency will be evaluated, with an emphasis on determining how to extend operation throughout the 100–700GHz range.","NASA applications include weather monitoring, atmospheric studies and investigations of planetary atmospheres. Correlating radiometers are known to improve performance over the more standard radiometers used in the present generation of Small/CubeSats such as TROPICS, TEMPEST-D, MiRaTa. However, they have not yet been implemented primarily due to the added complexity, which increases size, weight and power requirements. However, with increased system integration and advanced component design, these challenges can be alleviated.","TEMPEST-D and TROPICS are technology demonstrators for future systems of many CubeSats offering global observations. The goal is to replace the billion-dollar satellites with a more versatile and affordable technology that can be cost-effectively updated on a routine basis. These CubeSats must be produced by industry, and the proposed research will foster that goal."

Alphacore’s new single-core ADC designed in the GlobalFoundries 22FDX 22nm FDSOI process allows full Nyquist rate conversion of input signals up to 20 GHz. The maximum sampling rate is 24 GS/s, resolution is 6 bits (effective number of bits, ENOB = 4.5 bits) and the power consumption is below 250mW (115mW core ADC + 134mW output interface) without counting the on-chip DSP. This is possible because of Alphacore’s innovative “digital folding” Flash ADC architecture. The low power supply value of 0.8V available in the 22FDX process also helps in keeping the power consumption at a lower level than what is possible in most comparable CMOS processes. The ADC will have an analog input bandwidth of 20GHz making it possible to sample and convert signals on the full second Nyquist band, which provides significant benefits to many applications. Alphacore will also make the ADC radiation-tolerant, which enables its use in space-borne applications. Alphacore's ADC provides unprecedented performance in terms of bandwidth and resolution at low power levels, in addition to radiation hardness, which opens possibilities for new and improved instruments and missions. Having such an ADC and other critical designs already available gives Alphacore a crucial advantage in developing a fieldable system by the end of the SBIR development cycle.",This rad-hard ADC is ideal for CubeSats and small/nano satellites.  It supports NASA’s remote radiometer microwave sensors for a wide range of Earth observing missions. Examples are potential SMAP follow-on missions and future upgrades to instruments like the AMR-C.

The advance over existing approaches is the implementation of single crystal AlN as substrates, which practically eliminates leakage induced by screw dislocations as seen in abundance in thin films of AlGaN grown on traditionally employed foreign substrates such as sapphire and SiC. This enables unprecedented high gain and low noise for the UV detectors. We aim to demonstrate sensitivity over the whole far UV range (120 – 240 nm) while being solar and visible blind. We will provide single APDs as well as detector arrays with varying pixel resolution and pixel size. The devices will exhibit very high sensitivity (> 40%) and dynamic range with sub-200 V operation. Furthermore, we will demonstrate operation in Geiger mode which enables single photon detection in the UV range. In addition, we aim to demonstrate high linear gains and avalanche operation by employing the improbability of hole ionization for Al molar fractions exceeding 80%. Our proposal aims to demonstrate significant improvement in AlGaN based detectors. When implemented into Hg based atomic clocks, as developed in the deep space atomic clocks program, the novel APDs can lead to a significant improvement of the stability and lifetime, while at the same time reducing volume and constraints to the accompanying electronic circuitry. Beyond application for atomic clock the far UV APDs could be used for space observation such as proposed in LUVOIR, for plume detection, or for bio-chem detection applications.","We will develop solar blind avalanche photodiodes with sensitivity in the deep-UV to replace currently-used photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in atomic clocks being developed for the deep space program.

In order to transform space-based particle sensors, nanocrystalline semiconductors provide an attractive material basis because they present a means of: 1) decreasing the underlying material cost by utilizing a solution-based fabrication methodology, 2) increasing the range of candidate materials by including the narrow-gap semiconductors, 3) increasing the exciton multiplicity upon the impingement of radiation by utilizing multi-exciton generation, and 4) increasing the radiation resistance because the introduction of a high density of nanoparticles can convey pronounced improvement in the radiation hardness of the material. During Phase I, we demonstrated various facile fabrication approaches to making nanostructured solids through which excited charge carriers can transport. Furthermore, one can exploit the accumulated effect of interfacial scattering events at the multitudinous boundaries with the nanostructured solid to enhance the stopping power of the solid relative to a homogeneous or single-crystalline equivalent. The research is designed to not only deliver a high-performance radiation resistant sensor that can be commercialized but it will also advance basic physics by studying the interactions between energetic particles and strongly-confined charge carriers. By finding general material-design methods to suppress both radiation-induced damage and the stochastic thermal loss component in semiconductor materials, one can greatly increase the charge-conversion efficiency, which impacts the resolution of sensing devices, such as the particle detection application targeted.","The higher spectroscopic performance in a radiation-hard package allows one to better correlate the solar particle emissions with the driving feature near the photosphere, thus helping to identify the origins and causes of the solar wind and the Sun’s magnetic field. Thus future NASA heliophysics missions will gain far greater specificity in mapping the solar-driven particles. Beyond heliophysics, fine energy resolution can be used to precisely characterize atmospheric and soil samples captured and ionized during planetary studies.","For the sensing of optical photons and nuclear radiation, the successful development of a low cost, high performance material will stand as a viable alternative to both single crystal semiconductors and scintillator-based detectors.

The sheath gas used for focusing provides a gas buffer to prevent the liquid particles from impacting and adhering to the internal surfaces of the NanoJet technology.  The transmission efficiency for the NanoJet technology is nearly 100%.  In the Phase I project IDS demonstrated that this same technology works for atmospheric sampling of small liquid-based aerosol droplets (0.3-5µm).  During the Phase I project, IDS was able to develop and validate computation fluid dynamic (CFD) models to accurately predict the behavior of the aerosol particles passing through the aerosol separation device.  These CFD tools will be used for design work in the Phase II project.  Using particle densities needed for printing, IDS was able to correlate the particle density on Venus to an expected operational lifetime of the aerosol separator operating on Venus.  The operational lifetime is predicted to exceed a 1-year operation by more than two orders of magnitude based on calculations.  This is a result of the near 100% transmission efficiency of the NanoJet particle concentration technology.  IDS demonstrated experimentally that the NanoJet technology would operate well in a vacuum environment to below 0.1 Bar pressure.  It is expected that the aerosol separator will operate continuously over a wide range of pressures.

Innovative Imaging and Research proposes Angstrom, an affordable, easily deployable multiband wide field of view (FOV) imaging star photometer that measures aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom parameter across the night sky using stars. It can be used to augment traditional sun/lunar photometer networks and significantly improve atmospheric monitoring. Angstrom applies state-of-the-art image processing techniques to imaging systems that use emerging high quantum efficiency, low read noise CMOS sensors and high-quality machine vision optics. Early simulations and test data suggest these imaging systems can acquire dim star fields at a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio. Our goal is to achieve a comparable level of accuracy as gold-standard daytime sun photometers. Imaging star photometers acquire large sky regions measuring near-instantaneous spatial variability not possible with traditional narrow FOV photometers. By imaging multiple stars in a portion of sky covering a wide range of air mass or by continuously imaging stars moving through varying air mass, Angstrom can take advantage of traditional Langley calibration or multi-star methods. Angstrom tracks stars through image processing, eliminating complex precision moving mechanisms. It also uses the relative positions of stars to determine the camera’s orientation, reducing installation and maintenance costs. This allows it to be more easily deployed on ships, UAVs, and fixed terrestrial locations where it has been difficult to obtain measurements.",Angstrom supports atmospheric studies by providing additional nighttime aerosol measurements to atmospheric models. It also supports Decadal Survey recommended ACCP and TEMPO satellite missions and is directly relevant to numerous field campaigns measuring and monitoring aerosols.

Angstrom data also helps scientists who require atmospherically corrected products from night imaging remote sensing instruments such as the VIIRS DNB.,"Emerging remote sensing applications that require nighttime aerosol measurements include mapping artificial lights and estimating power usage, important economic measures.

A sensor for measuring the downwelling irradiance above the sea surface is also included. The sensors provide data at high spectral resolution over the UV-VIS-NIR and minimize the uncertainties of common approaches, e.g., free falling profilers that generally do not provide good data close to the surface and buoy-based systems with a single-depth radiometer placed at near-surface depth or multi-depth radiometers placed at depths of 1 m and deeper. The uncertainties associated with extrapolation of subsurface measurements taken at a single depth or depths of ~1 m and deeper to just below the surface are particularly significant in the red and NIR spectrum even in optically uniform water column owing to effects of inelastic Raman scattering by water molecules. By conducting time series measurements, AquaFloat reduces errors due to variations in underwater light field associated with the effects of sea surface waves, vertical changes in water inherent optical properties including the effects of intermittent bubble clouds, and changes in sky conditions, which can affect profiling measurements. The low-cost design, ease, and flexibility of use of AquaFloat offers an improved tool for routine work aimed at the development and validation of in-water ocean color algorithms. These features of AquaFloat also facilitate the use of multiple systems in special experiments to map horizontal variability in remote-sensing reflectance; subpixel variability within the GSD of a satellite sensor or various events in optically complex coastal waters as red-tide blooms and river plumes.

While absorption spectra are the primary inversion product of ocean color remote sensing, providing a direct link to net primary production, the oceanographic community currently has no in-situ sensor for algorithm development and validation that measures absorption spectra with acceptable accuracy. The proposed instrument employs the following components: (i) an integrating sphere to maintain accuracy in the presence of particle scattering; (ii) broadband Xe arc lamp source to cover spectral range from 300nm to 750nm; (iii) spectral filters for rejection of fluorescence by phytoplankton pigments and dissolved organic material; (iv) dual spectrometers for measuring signal within integrating sphere as well as the source spectrum; (v) integrating sphere is designed with continuous fluid flow and bubble clearance in mind; and (vi) a solid absorption standard calibration is proposed to make highly accurate measurements in the field.","NASA scientists and funded researchers working on ocean color algorithm development and cal/val, are currently hindered by a lack of ground truth spectral IOP data. The oceanographic community currently has no in-situ sensor for algorithm development and validation that measures absorption spectra with acceptable accuracy. As hyperspectral remote sensing becomes more widespread, and in preparation for the hyperspectral PACE ocean color missions, development of this system is very timely.","Like the NASA applications, the target market for the proposed instrument is government scientists and agency-funded researchers utilizing optical measurements in ocean science, biogeochemistry, and ocean color algorithm development and cal/val. An in-situ instrument for measuring hyperspectral absorption without the confounding effects of scattering and fluorescence would see wide applicability."

These systems require a cold helium cooling of the instruments with a dewar for cryogen storage. Given the limited lift capability of a scientific balloon, the dewar mass is of critical importance. For structural, low mass flight applications, carbon fiber is a clear winner. GTL has developed BHL™, a micro-crack free, re-usable carbon fiber material for use in cryogenic vessels. GTL’s BHL is well suited for the application of the liquid helium dewar, with low mass, low thermal mass, and low thermal conductivity as carbon fiber is an excellent insulator at < 20K, far better than glass-fiber or epoxy itself. The proposed effort is directly relevant to NASA future mission planning. This is an enabling technology for a new generation of balloon-borne cryogenic observatories. Large (3 meter) cooled telescopes at balloon altitudes would have up to 100,000 times faster mapping speed than the current state of the art (SOFIA's ambient temperature telescope at 39,000 feet).","The BHL technology applied to dewar systems offers significant improvements over current state-of-the-art dewars. BHL will provide for reduced boil-off, reduced cost, and easier transport of the dewars. BHL dewars could be applied to a large number of NASA systems. Anywhere cryogenic fluid is stored could potentially be replaced with these low mass, high efficiency composite dewars. NASA space systems, lunar and Mars landers, lunar and Mars habitats, as well as long term storage could benefit greatly from low mass BHL dewars and/or cryotanks.","For the same reasons that these composite dewars would be so beneficial to NASA, they would also be beneficial to the DoD. These low mass dewars could enable aircraft to run off of other fuels, such as liquid natural gas and liquid hydrogen. In the private sector BHL cryogenic dewars could be implemented in hospitals, research corporations, and cold gas/welding suppliers."

Based on the Phase I results, the CCCE is projected to achieve a package size of 4 in3 for a power level of 25W, representing a stunning 75% volume reduction versus competing technology. Small (~ 300 g) cryocoolers are already available with more in development which are capable of supporting infrared sensing on very small satellites, all the way down to 2U (10 x 10 x 20 cm). CCCE makes relevant to the small sat industry the recent tactical cryocooler developments focused on hot midwave infrared (HMWIR), nominally 120K to 150K operation. West Coast Solutions, teamed with Creare, is applying decades of industry-leading experience and success in novel cryocooler electronics solutions to the development of the industry’s first radiation hard CCE targeting this new class of low voltage, low power cryocoolers. For missions requiring a high performance, long-life space cryocooler, the CCCE is paired with the LM Space Micro Pulse Tube. Longer term, the proposed effort is strongly leveraged by ongoing Missile Defense Agency-funded small satellite cryocooler development efforts to improve even further upon the current state of the art in miniature coolers, extending the applicability of this proposed research to long wave infrared (LWIR). During Phase I the brassboard electronics was successfully tested with five different small cryocoolers, including the Micro PT. Progress in Phase I has the CCCE Team on track to complete the development through TRL 6 Qualification Testing in Phase II, which could lead to flight opportunities as soon as late 2022.","Any spaceborne infrared sensor requiring use of a small cryocooler, such as for Earth imaging, planetary exploration, space-to-space viewing, Artemis program, etc.",This technology is of great interest to the Department of Defense as it pursues its Resiliency through Disaggregation approach by which one or few large satellites are replaced with a large constellation of small satellites.

The core of FAUVE is a novel DUV-VIS objective, capable of producing sharp images at high magnification with very little chromatic aberration using only materials that are radiation-hard (exceeding 300 krad). Additionally, FAUVE will feature a new microfluidic cartridge platform which will enable the rapid mounting of samples for microscopic viewing. An automated microfluidic subsystem will autonomously filter samples into the disposable cartridges and treat them with user-defined reagents which could include structural stains/dyes or even functionalized suspension array particles.

The oceans, which cover 70% of the Earth’s surface, are currently not instrumented for space weather measurements. The proposed instrument, called Ocean Stabilized Ionospheric Remote Imaging Sensor (OSIRIS), will image the nightglow OI 630.0 nm emission data and will be capable of operating from mobile and moored buoys. The OSIRIS design solution will include a gimballed platform for sensor stabilization. The proposed OSIRIS instrument design concept is novel as ionospheric imaging from ocean platforms has not been demonstrated. The objective of this proposal is to develop a flexible and modular all-sky instrument design so that it could be integrated with different types of buoys without changing the underlying architecture. The OSIRIS design will leverage the team’s experience with building terrestrial all-sky imagers for ionospheric remote sensing and use lessons-learned from building instruments and operating them on buoys to address design challenges associated with the ocean environment. This proposed study is a first step toward enabling the proliferation of ionospheric measurements from the ocean surface. It is anticipated that the OSIRIS design solution developed here for ocean buoys could lead to the miniaturization of future ionospheric imagers for CubeSat missions. The development of this new class of observing capability will be a pathfinder for future persistent ionospheric measurements from the ocean surface and addresses a critical gap in our current observational capability from the ocean surface.","We expect that the data from OSIRIS instruments when realized in its fullest will provide complementary data to the NASA GOLD and ICON missions. Future NASA missions, such as the Geospace Dynamics Constellation (GDC) mission, would also benefit from distributed arrays of OSIRIS in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Furthermore, the miniaturization of the imager in this project would be able to be transitioned for future NASA CubeSat missions.","Data from the OSIRIS instrument from buoys will support ionosphere-thermosphere research in academia, the DoD, and other federal agencies. Further, the versatility of OSIRIS would enable the instrument to be used to address multiple applications ranging from coastal security to meteorology. For example, the proposed instrument could be configured to provide cloud observations."

The coatings may also be applied in a batch coating process to substrates such as light baffles. Low-reflectance surfaces are needed for starshade light-blocking membranes to reduce stray light resulting from out-of-plane petals, and from light sources nearly behind the telescope.

A different CGH must be designed for each different test case, and for optics that are significantly affected by temperature changes or gravity sag, or that are imaged during various stages of the polishing process, the departure from the designed CGH may bring the wavefront error beyond the measurement range of a typical interferometer. Free-form optics in particular may have extreme departures from their design CGHs during the early stages of polishing. BNS proposes to extend the range of an interferometer by providing additional programmable phase control through incorporating an SLM into the beam path. In addition to allowing a single CGH to be used for a range of similar mirrors, or for a single mirror that departs significantly from its design CGH, the SLM interferometer will allow the user to apply additional arbitrary phase. In this way, the SLM interferometer can be used to employ new techniques for retrieving wavefront, gravity sag, and other mirror characteristics, as well as to test wavefronts from simulation. In Phase II BNS will incorporate an SLM into a commercial interferometer, the 4D PhaseCam 6100, and use this system to quantify performance when measuring a parabolic mirror, a CGH nulling setup, and an off-axis parabolic segment. We will also use Phase II to improve our SLM’s performance, including improved precision/flatness calibration and an upgrade to our new 1536x1536 pixel MacroSLM. This system will be delivered at the end of Phase II.","The addition of an SLM into the reference arm of an interferometer has the effect of extending the interferometer’s range by hundreds of waves. One of the most immediate benefits is the ability to use a single CGH to measure a variety of similar test optics, rather than the single optic for which it was designed. The SLM interferometer can produce a null by adding the inverse of the test optic’s retrieved wavefront, and add other arbitrary wavefronts for experiments including new methods of wavefront characterization.","The SLM interferometer can save manufacturers of catalog or custom optics, especially free-form optics, time and money during manufacturing, since a single CGH or other reference optic will be usable for a greater range of optics. The work in Phase 2 will also improve the MacroSLM’s phase calibration, improving diffraction efficiency and consistency for the SLM’s neuroscience users."

Next-generation coverglass replacement materials have been explored by several groups over the past decade. Pseudomorphic glass (PMG) uses glass microbeads embeded in a silicone matrix that can be formed into sheets or sprayed on interconnected modules. Pure silicone sheets using space-grade DC 93-500 have also been investigated for module-level protection.

The primary objective of the proposed Phase II program is to complete the development of both DC and AC NanolamTM capacitors, specifically designed for NASA dynamic energy conversion ACUs, and to supply parts to NASA technical personnel for evaluation.  Specific tasks include the development of larger 4.4mF/50V capacitors, bus bar design to handle high ripple currents, packaging and producing AC NanolamTM capacitors with a two layer electrode system, to maximize life in environments that can induce electrode corrosion.","There are multiple NASA applications for the NanolamTM capacitors, including power processing units (PPUs) for Hall thruster propulsion units, inverters for roll-out photovoltaic arrays and advance controller units for dynamic power conversion sources, such as Stirling engines.","The largest NanoLamTM market is DC-link capacitors for inverters used in hybrid vehicles, plug-in-hybrid, all electric, and automotive battery chargers. Other applications include inverters for aerospace applications, PV inverters, LED lighting, wind turbine, rail traction, un-manned aerial vehicles, pulsed power applications and industrial power supplies."

Magnetic levitation offers several advantages over classic ball bearings, such as the elimination of wear and friction, the elimination of lubricant, the longer life expectancy and the lower generated micro-vibration noise. All these features would be crucial for the design of future missions for the exploration of our solar system. The proposed technology aims at overcoming some of the fundamental drawbacks that have considerably limited the use of magnetic bearings in space missions, such as the need to operate at cryogenic temperatures (if superconducting materials are used for the levitation) or the high power consumption (for active magnetic bearings). The proposed semi-active technology would be capable of generating stable magnetic levitation at room temperature and with low power consumption. Moreover, the electronic board does not require either sensors or a control algorithm to operate, thus considerably simplifying its integration on a spacecraft. The objectives of Phase II will be to develop a fully operating engineering model with the integrated 5-DoF magnetic bearing and electric motor. A full set of functional and environmental requirements will be provided and a thorough investigation of power consumption, micro-vibration signature and magnetic cleanliness will be carried out. Phase II will end at TRL 5.","The proposed technology will be crucial for NASA future missions requiring stability accuracy of less than 1 milli-arcsec, such as observation missions (e.g. HabEx and LUVOIR) or laser communication missions (e.g. DSOC flight demonstration by JPL). A low-power levitating technology could also enable the development of new flywheels for energy storage and continue the work on G2 flywheel by NASA GRC. These flywheels have the potential to substitute electric batteries and increase the life of a spacecraft dramatically.","Magnetic wheels could allow DoD imaging satellites to achieve spatial resolution below 1.5ft. With the enhancement in laser comm precision, a GEO laser relay system (like ESA EDRS) would help EPA and NOAA to accelerate responses in emergencies by instantly connecting LEO satellites and ground stations. Magnetic wheels would enable corporations to implement laser-based internet satellite networks."

MARVEL is an autonomous robotic balloon vehicle capable of exercising trajectory and/or altitude control in the atmosphere of Venus. and/or altitude control in the atmosphere of Venus. Exploring the atmosphere and surface of Venus presents the issue of enduring the environmental extremes. The surface of Venus is extremely hot and contains gaseous components not favorable to many materials. The challenge lies largely in finding a means to protect and prolong time in which different sensors can be operate in the harsh thermal environment and record data. As most of the interest lies closer to the surface, below mid-level cloud cover the ability to more closely approach the surface increases the data fidelity and quality captured by the sensors. MARVEL accomplishes the goal of all Venus exploration by combining advanced material configurations with innovative thermal control configurations for the payload. This results in a specialty Venus Aerobot system that can reach and remain at a lower altitude for longer times in the atmosphere of Venus to capture more and higher quality data on Venus.The current state of the art (SOA) in Venus aerial vehicles has been designed to operate within the altitude range of 50 to 60 km. This innovation will 1 extend the operating range over 40 to 60 km, and integrate into a supporting aerial platform that will be able to operate on the sunlit side of Venus and be able to transit the night side and survive several circumnavigations around the planet.","The proposed Mechanical-compression Aerobot will have immediate application at Venus and Titan. In particular, supporting access to below Venus’ cloud layer for scientific payloads for missions such as the Venus Corona and Tessera Explorer (VeCaTEx) and investigating phosphine in Venus’ atmosphere and realizing 2020 Venus Flagship Mission Report and 2018 Venus Aerial Platforms Study report key science investigations.","Two aspects of the proposed deployment/activation and gas supply/control system would lend themselves to direct commercialization in terrestrial applications. Robust aerial deployment will enable MC-ACB to be employed for military applications requiring tactical aerial drops and  aerial deployment for timely, accurate weather/hurricane forecasting."

Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are a commonly utilized device for spacecraft due to high efficiency and flexibility (ability to integrate with deployable radiator, thermal control valve, etc.).  However, they are currently too costly to manufacture to make them viable for most cost-sensitive applications such as CubeSats and SmallSats.  Conventional loop heat pipe manufacturing method involves multiple labor-intensive steps including a knife edge seal process to ensure no back leak of vapor that affects the thermal transport capability.  Unfortunately, the steps to manufacture the wick, insert it in the LHP evaporator, and seal with a knife edge results in very high manufacturing costs.  Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) has developed a low-cost LHP evaporator using a technique called Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), otherwise known as 3D printing.  With the capability of building a porous wick structure together with a solid wall via additive manufacturing, 3D printed LHP eliminates the knife edge seal as well as many wick manufacturing and testing steps.  The 3D printed LHP reduces the fabrication cost by an order of magnitude, which enables the use of LHPs in many emerging space applications, including CubeSats and SmallSats. While the developed 3D printed loop heat pipe shows significant cost benefit compared to the loop heat pipe made by conventional fabrication process, the pore size of 3D printed primary is around 5~7 μm, much larger than the 1 μm pore size made by sintering process.  In addition, the porosity of the 3D printed primary wick is lower than sintering wick (31% vs. > 40%).  In order to apply this emerging technology to higher power, large satellite applications, which are the current main loop heat pipe market, further reduce pore size and increase porosity are needed.","NASA has expressed strong interest in LHPs for various applications, including miniaturized satellites such as SmallSat/CubeSat, traditional large satellites, planetary rovers, and landers. The proposed technology provides an attractive low-cost, DMLS-based LHP evaporator as an alternative to the traditionally-manufactured evaporator, which involves a series of high-skill, labor-intensive processes. An order of magnitude savings in the evaporator cost is obtained by eliminating complex processes such as wick insertion and the knife-edge seal.","The DMLS-based LHP evaporators are also applicable to DOD and other government satellites. With the rapid proliferation of cost-sensitive commercial satellites, there is an ever-increasing demand for low-cost thermal management solutions, which can also be addressed through further development of the proposed technology.  Current LHPs cost more than a University CubeSat."

While these moons outwardly present an icy surface, scientists believe tidal activity driven by their respective host planets may drive thermal activity beneath, sustaining warm bodies of water that could potentially provide conditions favorable for life. Robotic penetration technologies are needed to drive through the ice layer, enabling access to subsurface oceans for exploration. A leading approach to drilling surface ice for remote space missions involves use of a robotic melt‑probe, which would use residual heat from its radioisotope source to supply a warm water jet to accelerate the descent. The critical need for this type of system is a water jet pump that can operate in the extreme inhospitable environment of a deep subsurface ice, while reliably delivering melted ice to the jet nozzle for a long endurance, persistent drilling activity. To meet this need, Creare has developed a robust, miniature, high-speed water jet pump, designed for very long service life with limited sensitivity to inlet debris present in the ice melt. This pump directly enables needs requested by NASA 2020 Topic S4.02: Ice penetration technologies reaching more than 1 km in depth and enabling access to subsurface oceans. During Phase I, we proved feasibility of the water jet pump by carrying out initial design trades, developing a preliminary pump and motor design, and then demonstrating stable operation of a representative high-speed permanent magnet bearing system through laboratory testing. Specifically, we operated our bearings system well above the 10,000 rpm design speed with low runout in a highly successful first‑of‑a‑kind test assembly. In Phase II, we will finalize the pump design, fabricate a prototype pump with integral motor, demonstrate its performance in a representative environment, and deliver it to NASA JPL for further evaluation.","Creare’s water jet pump is designed to enable deep ice drilling that will facilitate exploration of subsurface oceans thought to be present on Europa and Enceladus. Other NASA uses for such a pump include melt‑probes to explore ice caps on the moon or on Mars, or drilling within ice on a comet, pumping of planetary liquids for ISRU propellant production, and open loop cooling systems for thermal control.",Downhole oil and gas and water production similarly require a pump tolerant to abrasive particles and rated for elevated ambient pressures and high ambient temperatures.

Today overwhelmingly almost all video cameras are based on silicon charge coupled devices (CCDs); however CCDs are not suited for and not capable of functioning at high/extreme temperature environments such as surface and atmosphere of Venus. Vidicons and other types of imaging vacuum tubes were used for decades as the primary source of video cameras and in broadcast (e.g., television) in the 1990s and even for space-based missions and medical applications. Vidicons have certain advantages including high resolution and distortion-free images and can be digitally controlled and operated in much the same way that modern CCD-based cameras are.

QuantSISR will be designed to achieve a 50% reduction in edge localization errors while matching pixel-wise accuracy comparable to methods optimized for visual perception quality. The QuantSISR algorithms will improve temporal coverage of data products, such as land cover/land use maps and building footprints.

The algorithms are able to generalize to new sensors and regions without any reference imagery, but can also utilize high-resolution reference imagery, when available, to improve accuracy.  This feature can be used during Solar System exploration missions to mitigate mismatch between terrestrial training data sets and the newly acquired data. By leveraging multiple observation geometries, high resolution in situ references can be obtained and used to enhance wide area images acquired at lower spatial resolution.

Operators of such systems have a compelling need for a capability to forecast major space weather storms and potential effects towards risk mitigation. Currently available tools are research-oriented and may not be suitable for operational use. CFD Research and the University of Alabama in Huntsville propose to develop a novel Radiation, Interplanetary Shocks, and Coronal Sources (RISCS) toolset by enhancing and integrating existing research codes into a software product for situational assessment and decision making related to space operations. Key technology features and innovations include: (1) efficient coupling between component codes that describe inner heliosphere, particle energization, and transport of solar energetic particles; (2) modularity via standardized interfaces for data exchange; (3) development in consultation with NASA and selected end users; (4) improved numerical algorithms and physics models of component codes; and (5) customized configuration of the final product for transition to operations (R2O). During Phase I, we have identified potential end users and technology transition avenues; derived RISCS design requirements for operational use; identified features, relevant performance metrics, and limitations of existing space weather modeling software; and derived a RISCS toolset design for operational performance and R2O transition. During Phase II, we will fully implement the software framework, improve numerical/physics models of component codes, extensively test RISCS for error detection and handling, run end-to-end simulations of the modular code to demonstrate that RISCS meets the specified design requirements, and customize and deliver RISCS to selected end users.","This topic directly addresses NASA’s R2O/O2R responsibilities outlined in the NSWAP, specifically their goal to understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth, including space weather.

The prototype OxPS being developed as part of this Phase II effort will be built at full scale and tested with a protoflight MRE system. The success of the Phase II effort will raise the maturity of the OxPS to a TRL 5 and demonstrate the ability to capture, purify, and store oxygen extracted from an MRE technology at an industrial scale (3,650kg oxygen per year).","The OxPS will provide NASA with 99.5% purity oxygen extracted from regolith from an MRE process. The oxygen can be used for human consumption on a Lunar Base, the Gateway, ISS, or other future human space assets. In addition, the oxygen can be used as an oxidizer to refuel lunar landers and spacecraft. Other direct uses are lunar or in-space farming, utilization for science experiments, gas to clear regolith from surface infrastructure. And the technology can be used on Mars for future Martian missions.","Non-NASA applications of the OxPS involves utilizing the system to capture, filter and store vaporized gasses for high-temperature resource extraction processes such as steel and aluminum production.  By capturing the emissions, the OxPS will be may be able to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions produced during resource processing activities."

Harvesting water ice from lunar regolith requires a dedicated thermal management system (TMS) since (1) it requires very high thermal energy input to sublimate ice into vapor (i.e., volatile) and (2) capturing these volatile in the near-vacuum environment also needs significant cooling capacity. Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc (ACT) in collaboration with Honeybee Robotics (HBR) is developing a well-engineered TMS for Lunar ice mining vehicles that are powered by MMRTG. The TMS can strategically and directly use the waste heat of nuclear power sources to extract water vapor from icy-soil on the moon and use cold environmental temperature as the heat sink to collect volatile within a cold trap container. This will enable ice harvesting with optimized consumption of electricity. In Phase I, ACT successfully developed and demonstrated two key thermal features of the proposed TMS. They are: A preliminary full-scale TMS for a mining vehicle that can potentially meet NASA‘s requirements was designed and analyzed. In Phase II, ACT/HBR team will further mature the proposed TMS for Lunar Ice Miners. The efforts include optimization of all thermal components and development and validation of a numerical model to simulate the ice mining operation in relevant environmental conditions. An end-to-end demonstration system will be set-up and tested in a Lunar environmental chamber. A detailed design of full-scale TMS with optimized SWaP will be developed and reported by the end of the Phase II program.",The thermal management technology for a nuclear-based Lunar Ice Mining vehicle can immediately benefit Lunar In-situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) to harvest water on the moon. Water can be further processed to product Oxygen for life support and/or converted into LH2 and LO2 for spacecraft and satellite refueling. The technology can be useful to harvest water on other planetary bodies such as Mars and Asteroids.,"The radioisotope power source that the TMS using may limit its potential in non-NASA applications. However, some components of the overall system may have market potential in foreseen lunar economy. For example: the switchable cold trap using no electricity and moving parts could be an essential ice storage device to support daily human activities on moon (e.g. lunar hotels, fueling station etc.)."

Cold trap collection and purification of water from various lunar ice mining architectures is relatively undeveloped. This Cold Trap must be able to interface with the extraction methods as well as downstream processing systems, such as Paragon’s in-development ISRU-derived water purification and Hydrogen Oxygen Production (IHOP) subsystem. A well-designed Cold Trap will selectively freeze out and collect water vapor from other volatile contaminants while rejecting the corrosive, toxic, and explosive contaminant gases found with water in the lunar regolith. The thermal management system of the ICICLE Cold Trap will be designed to achieve both the desired water purity and collection rates through maintaining isothermal internal deposition surface temperatures while simultaneously rejecting heat from the phase change of water. To this end, this proposal will develop a sub-scale ICICLE Cold Trap for standalone testing in a thermal vacuum chamber with simulated water vapor and contaminant inputs to demonstrate the critical functions of the system. Furthermore, the ICICLE Cold Trap will be integrated with the Honeybee Robotics’ Polar Volatiles Extractor (PVEx) and tested in a thermal vacuum chamber to demonstrate end-to-end water extraction-to-collection capability.","NASA is seeking commercial solutions to support and harvest space resources, specifically with regards to ISRU as part of the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate and the Space Technology Mission Directorate.

(HFR) is developing new, thin-film, Bendable Electrodynamic Dust Shields (BEDS) that allow for continuous dynamic bending over compound curvatures such as the joint regions of a spacesuit, e.g., ankles, knees, elbows, etc. The BEDS technology is based on a combination of customized rigid and bendable plastic sheet forms with thin film electrode arrays fabricated from commercial flexible copper circuit. The two-dimensional flat plastic sheets incorporate flexible ‘living’ hinges that can be bent in either a positive or negative radius to conform to curved surfaces. In Phase I HFR successfully demonstrated 250mm x 170mm laminate structures that allow living hinges to bend and flex over 100,000’s of bending cycles. This creates a highly suitable support material for thin film electrode arrays that use high strength electric fields to remove dust from the surface. In Phase I, HFR fabricated, assembled, and demonstrated the feasibility of the BEDS technology using high voltage waveforms and simulated regolith dust. We also investigated high voltage safety techniques, electro-magnetic interference reduction, and adaptive technologies to switch on the active dust cleaning only when necessary. In Phase II, HFR will expand the size of the BEDS technology to 1m x 2m grids using a roll-to-roll printing technology to reduce fabrication costs and demonstrate additional BEDS devices based on transparent Indium-Tin-Oxide films.","The initial NASA application for BEDS is to protect equipment from accumulation of lunar dust that can act as an abrasive material on moving parts and damage them over a period of time. Applications of the technology may include electro-static grids to disperse lunar dust from entrance pathways, habitats and shelters, tools, equipment, vehicles, electrodes in helmet visors to keep dust away, flexible electrode ‘tape’ for wrapping around tubes and piping, and integration onto the surface of space suits and other dynamically flexible materials.","For solar farms placed in desert areas where dust and sand are prevalent, a proven BEDS cleaning technology of relatively low cost could be retro-fitted to any existing installation. It could also be used to deflect sand and dust from vehicle windshields, pitched tents, and various other pieces of equipment and personnel."

Traditional space systems operate through nuclear, solar, or tethered power mechanisms that require great complexity and process to qualify and operate. Tethered systems are hindered tremendously by mechanically mated components that are prone to regolith incursion and that require large robotically generated forces for interconnection. Furthermore, astronauts suffer from limited suit dexterity to manipulate and manage such systems. Nuclear powered systems require intensive handling procedures, and in many cases, presidential authority to launch—greatly increasing the cost and schedule of such missions. Solar powered systems require continuous access to the Sun and must follow predicated operational plans to maximize sunlight exposure and limit system duty cycles, ultimately constraining system performance. A wireless charging system mitigates these challenges for standalone systems that are unable to generate power independently through such traditional methods. Furthermore, a product such as this could have great utility not only on the Moon, but also in critical space applications on Mars, in orbit, and beyond. The proposing team of Astrobotic and WiBotic, are developing a charging solution that can satisfy these needs. The performance and specifications were initially targeted for multi-kW applications, but through discussions with customers and NASA we have learned a 400 W product is more favorable. The targeted specifications are as follows:","There are several applications that necessitate proximity chargers in space. In relation to the Moon, these activities include supporting marsupial roving missions, enabling robotic systems that do not contain onboard nuclear or solar power generators, charging toolkits on crewed lunar terrain vehicles, and powering the heaters of critical devices to survive the lunar night. Near-field wireless power transmitters are important tools to reduce regolith incursion in mechanically mated systems and static joints.","Robotic systems are increasingly utilized in warehouses, energy/utility plants, construction sites, mines, and for last mile delivery applications.

These TCSs must be lightweight, reliable, and able to effectively control cabin and equipment temperatures under widely varying heat loads and ambient temperatures. In contrast to single‑phase pumped coolant loops, two‑phase pumped loops are very attractive for this application because of the uniform cooling temperature provided by the boiling coolant, low required pumping power, high‑heat transfer coefficients, and high thermal conductance. Introduction of two‑phase flow can pose design challenges associated with flow management and dynamic stability. A deployable condensing radiator technology is needed to enable future heat rejection systems with high turndown ratio, compatibility with freezing, while balancing considerations unique to two‑phase flow condensation. Creare has developed a freeze‑tolerant, variable‑conductance radiator for deployable heat rejection in two‑phase pumped loop systems. In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of the concept by developing a preliminary design for the inlet header and phase separator, then fabricating a breadboard condensing radiator to demonstrate its performance. In parallel, we developed a novel process for fabrication of high permeability metallic porous tube elements, and we demonstrated its favorable properties through testing in two-phase anhydrous ammonia. We then finalized the thermal, fluid, structural, and mechanical design of the integrated condensing radiator with deployment features. Our overall design meets all requirements as defined in the solicitation including mass (<8 kg/m2), radiation tolerance, high-turndown freeze-tolerance (200:1), and ammonia compatibility. In Phase II, we fabricate a prototype deployable radiator and demonstrate its performance in a representative thermal environment within a two-phase pumped ammonia loop.","Creare’s freeze‑tolerant radiator is designed specifically to meet NASA requirements for deployable heat rejection from space-borne, two-phase pumped loop systems. The technology would be applied to dissipate heat from spacecraft, rovers, or habitats to external environments. In addition to thermal control, this system could be used for heat rejection in a Rankine power cycle.","An active industry is developing around use of two‑phase TCSs for satellite thermal management. Several large satellite manufacturers and integrators are working to develop and implement space-borne, two-phase thermal control loops for powerful telecommunications satellites seeking to reject 1‑10 kW.

Our Additively manufactured Dexterous Leak-proof Interface (ADLI) is a radically simple design that uses four additively manufactured (AM) parts configured to interface with custom bellows formed from Nitinol, which is a ~50:50 alloy of nickel and titanium known for its superelastic behavior, using a proven commercial hydroforming process.  Importantly, our design uses no seals and no soft goods, yet still interfaces with propellant service valves along any vector within a full hemisphere about the hinge for the pitch axis. In short, ADLI provides the flexibility to transfer propellant from a servicing satellite, which is in a huge range of orientations relative to a client satellite with virtually any propellant service valve configuration.","We will work to insert ADLI into planned orbital servicing missions, such as a future follow-on to NASA’s OSAM-1 (On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing-1). Second, the Mars Sample Return has one mission architecture that places an empty launch vehicle on the Martian surface, then transfer propellants to it from a rover brought on a second flight. We plan to market ADLI to MSR architects at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Headquarters to help position ADLI for use in that flagship mission.","First, we plan to extend the marketing and planning effort for ADLI to the commercial space community, which is aware of the tremendous market potential for reclaiming those satellites, so we will begin to use our existing contacts at Virgin Orbit and Blue Origin (we have additively manufactured components for both companies) to create a true commercial pull for ADLI."

This approach results in better source identification and location for the complex signals encountered in structural health monitoring. To increase the sensitivity of the sensors while managing the program risk, a single element approach that uses the sensor resonance and matching networks to increase sensitivity, while still maintaining high fidelity mode identification analysis via the image software development, will be used.With the noise levels of commercially available electronic components in the nanovolt to microvolt range, dynamic range gains of up to 30 dB over conventional designs will be achieved in the electronic design and manufacture of the components. This is a very high bang-for-the-buck approach to gain a huge sensitivity leap for better flaw growth detection. It increases the dynamic range which reduces signal distortion due to amplifier and analog-to-digital converter saturation caused by the wide range of amplitudes encountered in passive monitoring, while lowering the voltage noise level to increase sensitivity.The signal analysis software uses wavelet transforms to turn raw 2D signals into 3D images that are rich in the information they contain.

Atomic and molecular-based optical diagnostics have been demonstrated to provide unprecedent insight into the dynamics and transport phenomena of reactive and non-reactive flows at spatio-temporal scales inaccessible to traditional (mostly intrusive) flow probes. High repetition rate femtosecond (fs) lasers and high-speed imaging systems have equipped them with new capabilities and new laser-based diagnostics have emerged. However, no single measurement technique can capture and quantify all the phenomena and variables of interest over a wide range of operational conditions. We will develop and deliver a mobile multifunctional optical diagnostic platform for non-intrusive, quantitative imaging of relevant gas parameters in arc driven and other high enthalpy ground testing facilities. The platform is powered by a single fs laser and implements and integrates three state-of-the art optical diagnostic techniques: Two Photon Absorption Laser Induced Fluorescence (TALIF), a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and Femtosecond Laser Electronic Excitation Tagging (FLEET). The core laser system enables kHz rate nonintrusive measurements of species density, nonequilibrium temperature and velocity. Multiple measurements can be achieved at reduced implementation and operational costs. Such direct experimental data are essential for validating predictions, and for the design and testing of thermal protection systems.","The multifunctional optical diagnostic platform for kHz rate density, temperature and flow velocity measurements will find direct applications in the high enthalpy arc jet facilities within the NASA Ames Arc Jet Complex (IHF, PTF, TFD, AHF). More direct applications are open to other high enthalpy facilities within NASA. There are two important features of the system (operational performance range, modular design) which allow for expanding the area of applicability into the NASA wind tunnel testing infrastructure.","A robust and versatile multimodal optical diagnostic prototype will find commercial applications in fields such as aerospace, combustion and plasma physics. Using a single laser as a source for several diagnostics make this system attractive because of a reduced size and price, and the fact that it is mobile makes it versatile for use in facilities with more than one laboratory."

Our Relative Dynamics Inc. (RDI) solution is an optical communication terminal (SCOUT) using integrated, modular, scalable and future-extendable communications for small spacecraft in the DSM configuration. Each key cost-driven optical communication terminal sub-system has been carefully considered to enable a number of key cost-saving high-performance innovations into our proposed RDI SCOUT. Precision (microradian)-pointing actuator and motors are vital for optical communications. We propose lowering system complexity and cost with a new-class of high-performance ultra-high-vacuum compatible motors that are widely used in the manufacturing industry. The RDI SCOUT terminal uses an innovative small-aperture structure small spacecraft antenna (telescope). The SCOUT terminal opto-mechanical structure uses new materials with high strength-to-weight ratio that are robust against thermal deformation. The new material is low-cost, widely available, readily manufacturable and amenable to compression-molding mass production. Low-cost high-performance telecommunications integrated photonic transceiver are at the heart of the RDI SCOUT modem. RDI SCOUT will use an open data format for compatibility and interoperability with lunar communications and navigation architecture plans. RDI SCOUT incorporates dual (comm and nav) functionality to enable clock-recovery based sub-millimeter laser ranging and precision pointing-knowledge for optical navigation with sub-arcsecond accuracy. A lander or orbiter system could provide valuable calibrated navigation range/angle data using both active terminals and passive corner-cubes. RDI will provide system engineering for DSM operational scenarios for the SCOUT terminal including planetary lander/orbiter, planetary lander/Earth terminal, satellite-to-satellite and satellite/Earth terminal.",Our RDI proposed Small Spacecraft Optical Terminal (SCOUT) will enable a collaborative configuration at Gbps data rates of widely distributed (10s to 100s km apart) NASA small spacecraft (180 kg or less) operating far into the near-Earth region of space and beyond into deep space. SCOUT will enable NASA mission Uplinks (Earth-to-space) and Downlinks (space-to-Earth) providing an alternative for Distributed Space-craft Missions (DSM) configuration from Earth as well as return of science data to Earth and bi-directional telemetry and navigation.,"SpaceX, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Airbus and OneWeb and other large companies are pursuing High Altitude Platforms and very large (thousands) LEO satellite constellations for global internet deployment.  This is a key commercial market for our low-cost high-data-rate optical communication RDI SCOUT terminal."

The proposed DragSail system is based upon a restowable and redeployable concept that allows for increase or decrease of surface area thus modulating aerodynamic drag of the system.  Modulation of the drag will allow the system to guide small spacecraft to specific locations at the Von Karman altitude, which is necessary for precision reentry targeting.  The primary objective of this DragSail design is to deorbit small spacecraft from LEO altitudes in 25 years or less using a modular DragSail system with minimal weight and stowage volume.  The proposed DragSail system is based on NeXolve-developed lightweight solar sail and deployment system technologies.  The concept design consists of ultralightweight polyimide thin-film material that is attached to a deployable boom structure to create a flexible DragSail system with shape morphing capability.  A key feature of this DragSail system is its ability to deploy as a 2-D structure and then shape morph into a 3-D structure that allows drag in all orbital orientations.  Another attractive feature of the design is that the system is a self-contained unit that can be attached to many different types of CubeSats and small satellites. The DragSail system proposed herein is a scalable system that will allow CubeSats and small satellites up to 200 kg to deorbit from altitudes between approximately 700-1100 km in 25 years or less with the potential for similar results up to 2,000 km.  This innovative restowable, redeployable 3-D shape morphing membrane system is capable of increasing cross-sectional area impinging in all positions along an orbital path.  Partial deployment or partial morphing will enable changes in orbital decay rates allowing for collision avoidance as well as targeted atmospheric re-entry.  This 3D shape morphing capability is a significant advantage over flat (2-D) constructions.",The proposed DragSail system is clearly relevant to numerous NASA applications.  Some specific NASA applications for the proposed DragSail system include: Some more general NASA applications include:,"Due to the mandated deorbit requirements, almost any future Earth orbiting small satellite or CubeSat is a potential application for the proposed DragSail system.

With a total wet mass around 200 kg without payload, the transfer stage is designed to provide high-thrust, high delta-V capabilities of over 3 km/s to one or more nanosat payloads weighing more than 30 kg. It will propel small spacecraft (CubeSat or nanosat) from Low Earth Orbit on to Trans-Lunar Injection trajectories and into lunar orbit. The system features a full set of avionics and can support payloads up to 40 W continuous (90 W peak). It can either stay attached to the small primary payload for long term mission operations, or deploy the latter at its destined lunar orbit. Other benefits include scalability; use of green propellants and low-pressure tanks minimizing range safety operations and costs; high thrust for rapid, efficient transfer (compared with electric propulsion systems which have to be launched at higher orbits to avoid low altitude drag and which can require months to reach the targeted orbit while exposing the system to the damaging radiation of the Van Allen belts); minimized size provided by a high performance propulsion system; and attitude control system which can ride along for cislunar operations.","A stage providing over 3 km/s delta-V to a nanosat payload can be an enabler for many NASA lunar and interplanetary missions. These include missions similar to the NASA Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE), or follow-ons to NASA’s Mars CubeSat missions MarCO-A and -B, and unlike MarCO, could enable Mars Orbit Insertion. It can also be used for NASA LEO and GEO nanosat missions, whether launched as dedicated or as secondary payloads.","Non-NASA applications include commercial and DoD missions requiring high orbital maneuver capabilities. These include dedicated missions on small launch vehicles where additional delta-V is required, as well as commercial space-tug applications, e.g. on Falcon-9 rideshare launches. The stage can also be used for other applications such as orbital inspectors from LEO to cislunar operations."

ExoTerra’s Solar Electric Propulsion Upper Stage augments small launch vehicles to enable missions to GEO, Trans-Lunar Injection, Earth-Moon Lagrange Points, Lunar Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits, and Low Lunar Orbit.  We have partnered with Virgin Orbit to develop an upper stage tailored to Virgin’s LauncherOne that can deliver up to 168 kg to the Moon, enabling low-cost lunar exploration using small satellites and landers.  This will aid in NASA's push to establish a permanent outpost on the Moon by providing a steady cadence of microsatellite scale support missions to the Moon such as CLPS landers, observers, GPS and telecom relays.","The SEP Upper Stage has several NASA applications.  The system can deliver scientific microsatellites to Low Lunar Orbit, NRHO or Halo orbits at the LaGrange points.  It can also deliver small landers on a direct descent trajectory.  Beyond the Moon, the Upper Stage can be tailored to deliver satellites to interplanetary trajectories from a GTO launch.  Finally, the Upper Stage can be modified for use as a bus to take advantage of its advanced propulsion and power system.",The SEP Upper Stage can be used to deliver satellites to MEO or GEO as well.

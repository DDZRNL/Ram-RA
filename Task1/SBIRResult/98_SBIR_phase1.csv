The proposed research is innovative in that it presents a novel, alternative approach for ATCSs to interact with graphical displays (using eye and voice) that can be efficient and cost-effective provided that eye-tracking can be made robust, non-intrusive and inexpensive.  The primary objectives of this R&D are: (1) to determine how eye/voice interaction can best be used in an ATC interface; and (2) to develop the necessary off-head eye-tracking technology to make an ATC eye/voice interface practical.  The ATCI concept depends on having off-head eye-tracking and will only be cost-effective when the price of eye-tracking drops.  We anticipate producing an eye-tracker design and engineering prototype that can be produced in large quantities for a few hundred dollars per unit.  The expected benefits of the ATCI are: (a) more efficient interaction by replacing some voice intensive interactions with natural use of point-of-gaze, and (b) improved performance over voice recognition only solutions in high noise, multiple speaker environments.",,"The proposed research will result in inexpensive eye-tracking that will both enable new applications and  provide an alternative to mouse and keyboard use.  Application areas include:  (1) hands-free operator-machine interaction for complex process control operations, e.g., air traffic control, space operations, and power plant control; (2)  hands-free interfaces for commercial and military aviation and space crewstations, (3) teleoperation of vehicles such as unmanned ground or aerial vehicles; (4) assistive device technology for persons with disabilities; and (5) general consumer computer use."

Even the initial results given in this proposal show that chaotic behavior will result in the presence of information delays and information errors.  This proposal also shows that in traffic modeling,  even in the case of stable behavior with no apparent cause, there will be sudden bursts of instability.

To achieve certification for flight into these conditions, aircraft must demonstrate in test and flight that they meet those requirements, some of which are as yet undefined.  In the USA, the only available facilities at which these tests can be conducted are located outdoors and are subject to weather and seasonal constraints.  None of the outdoor facilities addresses the need to include airspeed aspects for in-flight conditions.  Currently, there exists no year-round indoor facility in the USA or Canada for  controlled testing in Mixed Icing and Snow conditions.  Such a facility would significantly aid OEMs in the design phase of snow protection equipment by reducing cost and time to gather meaningful data.  The objective of this innovation is to create snow and mixed icing conditions in an environmental chamber and closed-loop wind tunnels where indoor testing can be accomplished in a controlled and repeatable manner year-round.  This involves designing appropriate nozzle geometries, defining the corresponding pressures and temperatures for specified wetness (or dryness) conditions, and controlling the ambient relative humidity for consistency and repeatability.",,"A test facility is intended to reduce the time spent looking and chasing--sometimes in vain--for the actual conditions under which the aircraft is to be tested.  As more becomes known about the icing environment, the greater will be the need to test for mixed and snow conditions in addition to supercooled water droplet environments.  A testing facility can be a valuable tool if it can operate independent of the season with repeatable conditions by reducing the time spent in pursuit of a specific type of  environmental condition and the cost involved.  The capability proposed herein will provide the basis for development of a system that can be incorporated in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) or other similar facilities in the nation.  This is because the Cox icing tunnel has the size and flow capability sufficiently large to permit reasonable extrapolation to larger facilities.  The LeClerc Icing Research Laboratory at Cox will offer the advantage of a controlled access to aircraft and engine manufacturers for conveniently testing in supercooled droplets, snow, or mixed conditions year-round."

Current de-icing mechanisms leave some residual ice on the airfoil and most impose substantial weight and power penalties.  A method for artificially inducing hydrophobic behavior on an airfoil surface for anti-icing and de-icing of aircraft is proposed. It has been demonstrated that a small correctly polarized electrical current passed through the junction of an ice (or water) and metal surface will neutralize the bonding forces that cause the ice to adhere to metal.  The electrical path can be implemented by a thin film electrode pattern that neither intrudes into the interior of the wind nor alters the aerodynamics of the wing.

This research will develop global analysis techniques and design tools for linear systems subject to actuator saturation. Building upon promising results obtained using a semi-global framework this research will address robust global stabilization in the presence of matched uncertainties (e.g., actuator saturation), robust output regulation from global initial states, and disturbance decoupling with global asymptotic stability. It is expected that the techniques developed in the proposed effort will lay the groundwork from which more challenging global control problems in the presence of actuator saturation, unmatched uncertainties, and unmatched disturbances can be approached.  As part of the effort, the proposers will develop a prototype MATLAB toolbox to assist engineers in applying these techniques to practical control problems in a wide range of application domains.",,"The proposed research will significantly advance the state-of-the-art for control of systems with saturating actuators.

It is hoped that the research will ultimately lead to global robust control in the presence of unmatched uncertainties and disturbances. Additionally, there are currently no software products on the market that can assist with the design and analysis of controllers for systems subject to saturation nonlinearities.

Most model-based FDI approaches use the system dynamic models directly. The problems with these approaches are that the system dynamic models are very complicated and the system topology may not reflect the actual flow of failure information. Our FDI approach is based on ""Dependency Model"" (DM), which describes the high level information flow during the occurrence of failures or faults. Therefore, DM is more suitable for FDI than the system dynamic model. The most difficult task in DM-based FDI is the generation of the DM. For example, it usually takes several men/months to generate a DM for a regular avionics system. In this Phase I work, we propose to develop a technique to automatically derive a DM from a GNC system dynamic model described in a system level simulator such as MATLAB and SIMULINK.

If an inconsistency between a system nominal model and real-time measurements is detected, faulty components and sensors/actuators within the system need to be identified. Most systems in use today are model based, but the models are difficult to develop and are generally very imprecise.  There are non-model based schemes but these require data from systems with specific failures to be able to diagnose failures.  In practice, such failure data is very difficult to obtain.

SSCI propose an innovative approach to on-line autonomous Health Monitoring, Failure Detection and Identification for aircraft and spacecraft systems based on  a novel combination of the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) approach and on-line System Identification (SI), that will be called ``adaptive IMM''. The IMM algorithm was originally developed, and has been successfully used, for tracking maneuvering  targets, but its application to FDI is completely new. In this new  approach, each possible (anticipated) failure is mapped into a different state space model. For each one of these models, a Kalman filter (KF) computes the individual state estimates and the likelihood function corresponding to that model. The individual estimates are weighted with the probability of each model being correct (derived from the likelihood functions) to give a single (accurate) state estimate. SI is needed for detecting and identifying  unanticipated failures (for example, partial degradation due to battle damage of an actuator surface or aircraft surface). On-line SI is performed using an approach based on Deterministic/Stochastic Realization Algorithms (DSRA) which identifies a state space model of the system from the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) measured data.",,"The Health Monitoring/FDI system to be developed during this Phase I will be of direct application to Bell Helicopter's Eagle Eye  UAV (already being fly-tested).

Examples of these markers include carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, oxides of nitrogen and hydrogen cyanide.  By detecting marker compounds  selectively and sensitively, this Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a commercially viable fire onset monitoring system (FOMS).  FOMS, an all fiber optic device, will use an intracore tunable filter to perform correlation spectroscopy ­ a form of absorption measurements.  Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS), Inc. will construct and test these filters tailored to precisely match the spectral characteristics of the marker compounds in the near infrared region.

This fact makes methanol an attractive propulsion fuel option for Mars exploration missions.  Using methanol as a rocket propulsion fuel also addresses key issues in current state-of-the-art hydrocarbon cooled rocket engines, such as coking, environmental compatibility and ground processing operations, from exhaust product and safety standpoints, respectively.  Coking is a major problem that limits the op-eration and performance of such systems.  Methanol can be decomposed endothermically, in the presence of a catalyst, into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, absorbing a great deal of enthalpy in the process.  It can also absorb more enthalpy for a given temperature change than hydrogen, making it a superior coolant.  A methanol fuel rocket system can use the test and operational infrastructure that are currently in place to support current hydrocarbon fueled engine systems.  Additionally, it is likely that no exotic, advanced technologies will be required to develop low-cost, modest perform-ance methanol fuel rocket engine systems.  Use of this low-cost propulsion system technology should provide significant improvement in life cycle cost, reliability, and safety of future space sys-tems, as well as make both manned and unmanned Mars exploration missions, attractive, realistic cost options.",,"There are three major commerical applications that can be identified for a methanol engine. The low freezing point of methanol makes it a promising candidate for a space storable upper stage.  Such a stage would be capable not only of restarting, like the Centaur upper stage, but also of operating for extended periods of time in interplanetary space, which the Centaur cannot.  Methanol's perform-ance and density make it superior in system performance when compared with other upper stage fuels as well, such as solid propellants and hydrazine.  Replacement of the Shuttle's Orbital Maneu-vering System (OMS), as well as booster and maneuvering engines for expendable and future reusable launch systems, are other potential applications.  Improved cooling for annular aerospike engines is also a possibility.  Finally, there is a concept for a unique type of space transportation ve-hicle called a propellant transfer spaceplane, which gets one propellant from the ground and transfers the other from a subsonic tanker.  For nearly every propellant combination of interest, the mixture ratio favors the oxidizer, requiring the development of aerial oxidizer transfer technology and the use of a dedicated tanker aircraft.  If a liquid oxygen/methanol engine is used, it may be operated at a mixture ratio of 1:1 with the loss of only a few seconds of performance.  This offers the prospect of being able to transfer the fuel instead of the oxidizer, removing the need for a dedicated aircraft and requiring no new technology development."

Johnson,,"411 Waverley Oaks Road, Suite 144, Waltham , MA  02452",,,,,,,,"Electrodynamic conductive tethers combined with electrical power sources have the potential to provide propellant-less reboost or deorbit forces to spacecraft in low Earth orbit.  Tether performance is limited by heating, which decreases strength and increases resistivity, lowering electrodynamic efficiency.  Electrodynamic tethers in space are heated both ohmically and by absorption of radiation from the Sun and Earth, while radiation is the only cooling mechanism.  To minimize tether temperature it is desirable to minimize the absorptivity/emissivity ratio, i.e. to reflect insolation and earthshine while radiating efficiently at low temperature.  Ion Optics proposes to accomplish this with ion-beam texturing, a blackening process which increases emissivity by carving micron-sized features into the wire surface.  Size and spacing of the features can be controlled to provide a relatively sharp transition from shiny at short wavelengths to black at long wavelengths.  Tailoring their surfaces to increase long wavelength emissivity from less than 0.1 to greater than 0.9 would allow aluminum tethers to handle three times the power at the same operating temperature and mass.  The resulting lighter, more efficient tethers mean dramatic cost savings for NASAs International Space Station reboost and space debris reduction programs.",,"Textured surfaces already have commercial applications; they play a key role in Ion Optics' line of  pulsIR infrared sources, extensively used in gas sensing instruments.

Global Aircraft Corporation is currently certifying its GT-3 Trainer airplane under FAA Part 23 Regulations.  The Company is in the process of starting production of a revolutionary new composite propeller that has been developed under the NASA SBIR Program. The Company currently has available funding to construct the initial production facility by November 1998. Global has adequate financial reserves in the current credit facility to finance production of the Rand Cam rotary diesel aircraft engine to be developed and FAA certified in Phase II.   Assuming the goals of the Phase I and Phase II Projects are achieved, Global Aircraft will team with an existing engine manufacturer to FAA certificate, produce, and market the rotary diesel engine to both domestic and international aviation markets.  Several engine manufacturers have indicated an interest in producing the engine when it is proven technically feasible.  A recent market survey by the Company indicates that the potential marine market for such an engine is ten times larger than the aviation market.  This market does not require the expensive costs of FAA certification and offers a lower cost start-up market for the engine.  The lower start-up costs and increased production volume for the marine market will greatly benefit the aviation market by lowering production cost and spreading development and manufacturing tooling costs over a substantially larger market volume."

With valves open, a detonable fuel/air mixture is brought into each tube and is detonated with the valves shut to force the combustion product gases to escape through the aft end of the tube, providing thrust. The low-cost, lightweight characteristics of this engine led APRI to the development of a PDE for subsonic propulsion applications.

It would thus be assured of numerous customers who need temperatures substantially lower than dry-ice but well above those of liquid nitrogen, and who do not wish to incur the large costs (>$10,000) required to buy small liquid nitrogen class refrigerators."

Such a processor array is expected to have many beneficial characteristics including low mass per quantity of particulates processed and high thermal efficiency when compared to macroprocessing approaches.  A complete system would include excavation of the particulate material on the planet surface, mechanical and/or electrostatic separation to remove coarse particles from the material stream, and a means of distribution of particulates to the processor array.

The objective of the research is to create a system that can simulate the physical structure of the lunar ice/dust mixtures to test and demonstrate mechanisms for the mining and processing of lunar ice deposits.  The fundamental purpose is to have a simulator available for supporting experiments as ice was discovered by the Lunar Prospector mission.  The simulator would be used to perform scientific experiments to help determine the characteristics of the lunar ice deposits.  This includes measuring fundamental properties such as the form of the ice deposited by sublimation at cryogenic temperatures.  ORBITEC proposes to design a lunar ice simulator in Phase 1 that would be built and tested in Phase II.  The simulator would be utilized to support studies of ice extraction from the lunar regolith in permanently-shadowed areas.  The preliminary requirements for future simulator systems large enough to accommodate  full-scale testing of a lunar robotic lander or ice recovery systems would also be determined.,,"The Moon is an attractive source of resources for the development of near-Earth space, because it is close to Earth, has a small gravity field and most of the chemical elements important in the development of space capabilities (e.g., oxygen, metals) can be readily found.  The most significant problem of lunar development is the scarcity of fuel for spacecraft.  Although oxygen is present in abundance in the minerals of the lunar regolith, no concentrated source of hydrogen was known with certainty to exist, prior to the recent Lunar Prospector mission.  If rocket fuel must be imported to the Moon to launch payloads from the Moon, it is very difficult to devise a low-cost Moon-to-space transportation system.  However, if both fuel and oxidizer can be obtained locally, a reusable transportation system that can reach Moon-orbit space at low cost may be feasible.  This is the promise of lunar water.  Water can easily be electrolyzed to produce hydrogen and oxygen, be liquefied and used as propellants.  If developed as a supply of propellant, a myriad of other beneficial uses for lunar water could be developed, ranging from life support to construction materials."

Using liquid propellant significantly reduces the mass of the spacecraft and cargo which must be brought from Earth.  Because the hydrogen to carbon ratio of liquid hydrocarbons is approximately 2, less hydrogen is required to make liquid propellants rather than methane.  Additionally, liquid hydrocarbon propellants do not require cryogenic storage which also saves weight.  These advantages make the in-situ generation of liquid hydrocarbon propellants an attractive alternative to replace or augment in-situ generated propellants such as methane and methanol.",,"A significant portion of the worlds natural gas resources (equivalent to 800 billion barrels of oil) is either in off-shore or remote locations that are presently uneconomical to develop.  The catalyst technology for the synthesis of middle distillate hydrocarbon propellants from synthesis gas (CO and H2) on Mars is directly applicable to the conversion of off-shore and remote natural gas.  In the industrial application, natural gas is converted into synthesis gas which is then fed to the Fischer-Tropsch reactor which produces liquid hydrocarbons.

Progress has been made in developing autonomous planning and scheduling technology.  The next step in fielding this technology in space applications is addressing how a crew can make effective use of such automated reasoning.  Our approach is to integrate existing planning and scheduling reasoners with intelligent user interface software that assists the crew in using these reasoners.  This requires developing new intelligent interface software that mediates crew interaction with a planner, a scheduler, and a plan executor (e.g., 3T architecture).  This interface software will enable mixed-initiative interaction between the crew and these specialized reasoners.  In such interaction the crew is responsible for plan generation and the intelligent interface assists the crew in allocating tasks to the reasoners and in understanding task results.  This approach makes the crew more autonomous from operations support, which reduces operation costs and accommodates the communication delays and blackouts common in space exploration.  This approach also gives the crew control of activity planning, which reduces the uncertainty of planning in complex, unpredictable space environments and makes costly plan failure less likely.",,"Planning and scheduling tasks are performed in a wide variety of industries, from schools and offices to manufacturing to space exploration.

These are critical parameters for determination of ocean primary productivity from remote sensing of ocean color.  Current profilers do not provide accurate biomass (because of fluorescence quantum yield variability), nor any information on photosynthetic status.  The proposed profiler incorporates novel technology developed at Ciencia for photosynthetic analysis based on chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime measurements, and will be the first in situ system to incorporate this novel capability.  Low ocean chlorophyll concentrations require a detection sensitivity of 0.1 ug/L.  This presents a major challenge because to obtain accurate values of photosynthetic parameters the exciting light intensity must be kept very low to not disturb the photosynthetic system.  To achieve this detection limit will require several innovations, which include development of a highly efficient optical design with an integrated flow-through sample interface, and a high-gain, low-noise detection system.  Additionally, the system must incorporate provisions for self-calibration on the fly, and embedded intelligence for instrument control, data acquisition, analysis and communications.

Economic, environmental and regulatory issues are putting pressure on farmers to manage their croplands more carefully by supplying fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and water at carefully controlled and variable rates.  To accomplish this, sensors such as the ones proposed here will be needed that provide accurate information on the physiological status of the crops.  High value crop farmers (e.g. California vineyards) are already experimenting with spectral analysis of crops to assess health in efforts to detect plant stress before it is visible to the naked eye.  This is vital because replanting is costly about $20,000 per acre [Ref. 38].  For example.

At high altitudes (with low pressures and temperatures) they are inaccurate, slow to respond to changes in humidity, and yield data with poor vertical resolution.  They are also slow to recover after exposure to liquid water, as encountered on passing through a cloud.  All of those factors combine to degrade data quality, and the quality of all derivative products, such as forecasts.  Heterocontact sensors are proposed as a solution to this problem.  These sensors offer a wide response range (up to six orders of magnitude) for accurate determination of humidity under a wider range of conditions.  As solid state devices, they have a faster response time than current sensors.  The advantages that these sensors offer can be further extended by including additional features in the sensors themselves, such as the use of dopants to fine tune the conductivity of the semiconducting elements and the addition of catalytic sites at the interface to improve the kinetics of the water electrolysis process, which is the key to the sensors functioning.  Prototype sensors will be fabricated and their performance will be tested by evaluating sensitivity as a function of temperature and relative humidity.",,"A huge  commercial market exists at present for humidity sensors in applications including atmospheric and climate research, industrial processes such as polymer processing industries, the furniture industry, printing and paint industries, paper mills, the tobacco industry, the textile industry, humidity control systems in air conditioners, dryers, microwave ovens, refrigerators, computer rooms, hospitals, cleaning rooms, agricultural soil water content measurement, greenhouse, film processing, monitoring moisture in concrete and composite materials, and other electrical appliances.

These problems have been addressed and published by Talent (1992) utilizing a phenomenological model of the debris environment in low-Earth-orbit (LEO).  The model, called the particle-in-a-box (PIB), examined the entire LEO environment as a whole and it confirmed the major results of several complex stochastic models.

Joining technologies are required that will withstand the extreme conditions to which the silicon carbide components will be exposed.  This SBIR Phase I proposal concerns the development of an improved active metal brazing system for joining silicon carbide to Inconel 600.  This system avoids the formation of brittle intermediate phases and will operate at temperatures above 1000 C without degradation.  The multilayer braze foil technology incorporates layers which prevent formation of brittle chromium carbides and excessive diffusion of silicon from the substrates.  This is accomplished by forming a post reaction equilibrium in silicon concentration, and uses reactive metal layers to trap carbides before large chromium carbide grains can form.  The resulting joint is expected to have long term strength in excess of 400 MPa. Testing of the joint will consist of four point bend testing in addition to x-ray diffraction and surface analysis.

The capability of fabricating inflatable/rigidizable structural truss members and frames which are complex and comprised of several different joints was developed and perfected under IRSS I and II programs. Under the IRSS II program, many critical aspects of these structures, such as vacuum deployability, packageability, life, environmental testing (vibration and thermal), and strength were studied and demonstrated. The IRSS II truss was only 5-ft long and deployed successfully in the vacuum under a 1g force without using any control hardware. Deployment of longer systems, however, may involve some unpredictable motion, which must be avoided or minimized. The need and importance of controlled deployment was well demonstrated in the NASA/L'Garde IAE, flown on the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS-77) in May 1996. Although the antenna deployed very successfully, the long 100-ft struts went through an uncertain course before full deployment.

Addition of ""controlling devices"" to the deployment mechanism of inflatable/rigidizable structures makes this technology more valued and reliable. This will create additional business opportunity in many aerospace areas, such as inflatable/rigidizable solar array and concentrators, communications satellites (antennas) SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) and many other structural components on commercial spacecraft.

Key advantages of our SPP concept, compared to a conventional power subsystem with separate solar array, battery, and power electronics components, include the following: - reduced launch mass and volume, and thus the number of launches to deploy a given system - reduced integration procedures; assembly of spacecraft also integrates the power subsystem - reduced mass of ""parasitic/low value"" structural elements.",,"The proposed ""Smart"" Power Panel system can be spun-off into either military or civilian applications.  The commercial spacecraft and aircraft industries could obviously benefit, however, there is also huge terrestrial potential. SPP could replace or augment diesel generators, thereby reducing fuel resupply demands, and noise and IR signatures.  It may also be used as a self sufficient power source for third world regions.  If SPP can be produced very cost-effectively, it could be implemented in villages where access to the main power grid is not economically feasible."

The end goal is an integrated design that has performance and stowed volume equivalent to traditional solar arrays but incorporating an array of radiating antenna elements.  Currently, antenna array designs are stand-alone sandwich structures made from aluminum or composites that require their own deployment.  This study will develop designs which provide for power generation and telecommunications antenna functions in a single aperture after a single deployment.  Our concept design(s) will address precision installation of the antenna elements and define compatible transmission line technologies with respect to stiffness, CTE and thermal expansion.  The resulting design(s) will yield an antenna array aperture that is lightweight and compatible with available stowed volume, high stiffness, dimensionally stable and low cost.

The shrinking government budgets, as well as commercial requirements, may not tolerate the costs associated with the technology that is currently being used.  In recent years, considerable progress has been made toward the design and fabrication of solar concentrators from Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) materials.  One of these concepts may also provide the necessary space for an array of radiating antenna elements.  Development is required to provide lighter multifunction structures which will meet the requirements of future military, science and commercial systems.

We claim these three capabilities are the minimum set of requirements to ready a probabilistic modeling tool such as ACPro for deployment in NASA data-understanding applications.  The combined capabilities would allow ACPro to be applied in constrained environments such as on-board satellites where power and data transmission are at a premium.  The reconfigurable front-end would allow custom tuning of ACPro to parallel processes used in commercial data mining, networks of workstations for internet mining, and the space-hardened processor arrays planned for NASA deep-space missions. Finally, the incremental capability would allow ACPro to operate in a data ``monitoring'' mode.

Ultimode's current growing client list includes mining companies with datasets from satellites and aircraft-borne instruments, and telecommunications companies with large customer  databases.  While these existing clients could be better served with these new tools, ability to handle increased size would greatly facilitate our expansion into other markets such as internet-related modeling, marketing, manufacturing, banking and finance.  Moreover, through our growing partnership with a leading data-mining tools provider, and through future partnerships with database vendors the reconfiguration capability would allow distribution of high-performance code across a range of commercial platforms.  Many database companies are still early on in their commercial expansion into the data mining area.

Currently, high speed photodiodes are restricted to very small areas (~50 micron diameters) to limit their capacitance and RC time constant.  Photodiode speed is then limited by photogenerated carrier transit time through the diode space-charge region (SCR).  Photodiodes with resonant optical cavities (ROCs) address this limitation. Their short SCRs have faster transit times while the ROC allows several light passes through the SCR, maintaining good quantum efficiency even with short SCRs.  Unfortunately, the shorter SCR also means ROC photodiodes have higher capacitance than photodiodes with long SCRs.

Advances in manufacturing technology now make it possible to physically realize a far larger range of the new areas of design. However, the design and optimization of diffractive optical elements is generally more complex and computationally intensive than traditional refractive optics, and less developed. Diffractive optics design for the most part is based on scalar or vector diffraction theory. Many advances have been made recently in the scalar regime. For example, we developed a general algorithm based on propagation reciprocity for the rapid design and optimization of kinoform diffractive elements which is well-suited for e-beam lithography fabrication. Diffractive optical elements with sub-wavelength structure require vector diffraction theory. Vectorial regime calculations are more complex and nonintuitive, with most design methods based on the coupled-wave approach. Straightforward application of this approach is not well suited for optimization, since it is impossible to solve the inverse problem.

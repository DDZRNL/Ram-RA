Currently, the unsteady panel methods still are the major workhorse used by the aerospace industry because these panel methods can generate the Aerodynamic Influence Coefficient (AIC) matrix. The AIC matrix is a multi-input-multi-output aerodynamic transfer function. Because it is an aerodynamic transfer function, the AIC matrix is independent of the structure and only depends on the aerodynamic geometry. Thus, once the aerodynamic configuration is fixed, the AIC matrix can be repeatedly used for structural design. However, because of the linear potential flow assumption, the unsteady panel methods are not valid at transonic Mach numbers. In these flow conditions, accurate unsteady aerodynamic forces can only be obtained by solving the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. Therefore, the aerospace industry would greatly benefit from having an innovative method that can efficiently generate the AIC matrix from the CFD methods. The overall technical objective of this Phase I effort is to develop a CFD-based AIC generator to generate the structurally independent AIC matrices using high fidelity CFD codes. Using these AIC matrices, the generalized aerodynamic forces (GAF) can be rapidly computed for performing aeroelastic analysis. With a small computational effort, the AIC matrices also can generate the GAFs due to control surface kinematic mode and gust excitation.",,"Aircraft structural design requires flutter, aeroservoelastic (ASE), and gust analysis. Aeroelastic problems usually occur in the transonic flow regime at which the unsteady aerodynamics solved by the unsteady panel methods are not accurate. The proposed CFD-based AIC generator, once developed, will be well accepted by all aerospace companies."

Leveraging on significant achievements by the proposing team in prior research, this Phase I effort represents a significant contribution to ROM technology adoption by ASE control engineers in NASA, and includes several emerging techniques: dual genetic algorithm (GA)-guided, fully automated ROMs, model order reduction with strong state consistent enforcement, and GA-optimized LPV control synthesis for enhanced vehicle stabilization. A modular software framework to streamline the entire workflow and efficiently transition from the model reduction to control synthesis will be established. The feasibility of the proposed technology will be demonstrated for ASE problems of NASA interest (e.g., X-56A MUTT, MADCAT, High-speed ASE, etc.) The Phase II effort will focus on: (1) LPV ROM and control synthesis engine optimization in terms of execution efficiency, robustness, and autonomy; (2) further process automation and exact input/output formatting for direct integration of the ‘intelligent’ environment into NASA workflow; and (3) extensive software validation and demonstration for ASE and flight control design of realistic aircrafts of current NASA interest.","The proposed technology will deliver NASA flight control engineers a valuable tool to (1) automate the entire process of ASE ROM and control synthesis on a single platform; (2) design advanced, robust aerostructural controller; and (3) perform real-time ASE simulation and analysis.

With their incorporation of lightweight flexible structures, such configurations may require active/adaptive control systems for load redistribution, flutter suppression and gust load alleviation to ensure reliability and safety. Unfortunately, contemporary analysis methods are unsuitable for aeroservoelastic analysis of such configurations. Design tools are dependent low-fidelity approaches that are inadequate for reliably analyzing advanced configurations, whereas CFD coupled to Finite Element structural models require significant user input to define and support advanced configurations, not to mention extensive computational resources. A new efficient approach that automates the geometry setup, mesh generation, and assembly of fluid-structural coupling interfaces is needed for aeroservoelastic analysis of conventional and new concepts. To address this critical need, Continuum Dynamics, Inc. proposes the development of a variable fidelity CFD-based aeroservoelastic analysis to support vehicle design, active/adaptive control effector design and integration, as well as wind-tunnel/flight testing and control system development. Building on CDI’s legacy in relevant areas, the project emphasizes technology development to streamlines workflows and minimize user involvement associated with mesh generation and coupling fluid and structural models on dissimilar grids.","The proposed effort directly supports several NASA projects: the Advanced Air Vehicle Program’s Advanced Air Transport Technologies (AATT) project developing the next generation of transport aircraft (i.e. truss-braced wing, joined-wing and blended wing body); the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program’s Flight Demonstrations and Capabilities (FDC) Project, as well as the X-56, X-57 and X-59 aircraft.

Modeling 3-D, full scale, fully coupled, aerodynamic and structural responses with high-fidelity computational approaches is only viable for evaluating a few conditions within the flight envelope, but intractable for defining a flutter boundary over a range of flight speeds.  To alleviate these challenges researchers have developed reduced order models to facilitate the aerodynamic calculations at a fraction of the cost.  These methods are incredibly powerful, but present significant problems when attempting to apply in the case of highly nonlinear flows as they can be costly to maintain fidelity required in the modeled response.  These nonlinear flows play a critical role in the aeroelastic response and as such require that the reduced order models provide a high level of fidelity. The proposed research will demonstrate a framework that decomposes nonlinear aerodynamic responses, in the form of Generalized Aerodynamic Forces based upon dynamical models which are then extended to the nonlinear range based upon the concept of a Volterra series.  By decomposing the Volterra series into the linear and nonlinear parts a significant cost savings can be leveraged as the linear terms can remain fixed for a given choice of flow parameters and the Volterra series need only serve to reproduce the nonlinear response of the system.  By taking this approach to modeling the aerodynamics we hypothesize an improvement in the reduced order model’s ability to reproduce an accurate nonlinear representation of the aerodynamics at a greatly reduced cost.  This will aid in both increasing the fidelity of aeroelastic predictions and provide a valuable resource to utilize in the development of aeroservoelastic control logic.",Applications are far reaching as all airframes require aeroelastic evaluation in the design stages to ensure safe flight. Aircraft that operate in the high-subsonic or transonic regime where complex shock structures can develop and move rapidly over the wing surfaces are also strong candidates for this modeling approach. Aircraft with structural complexity that can introduce strong aerodynamic interactions such as engine/nacelle/pylon interference or store load out may also be viable candidates for this modeling approach.,Interest in airframes from DoD may include fighter squadrons with varying store load outs. This is a challenging problem as the store loadout and positioning can produce significant aerodynamic shock interactions and other nonlinearities. There may also be opportunities in the private aircraft industry as well for aircraft designs are pushed outside the bounds that are currently well understood.

The proposed fiber-optic pressure sensor consists of a microfabricated silicon optical pressure sensor with an optical fiber exiting the side of the device. Placed within a low-profile housing, this design represents a robust, surface-mounted, miniature pressure sensor that possesses superior sensor survivability for aft-engine (high-temperature) measurements and immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI). The flow disturbance for this sensor is minimal because of the surface-mount design and small footprint. Use of fiber optics facilitate the remote placement of all sensor optoelectronics and this extends the upper temperature limit of the measurement capability.

In this Phase 1 proposal we seek to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our dual-mesh, dual-solver overset strategy for jet-noise aeroacoustics. An efficient unstructured mesh solver is used to resolve the flow near the nozzle, while our high-order, adaptive, Cartesian mesh DG solver is used to resolve the acoustic waves in the jet-plume region. The DDES approach is used to model the turbulent jet flow. The temporal evolution of the nozzle flow is used as input to a source-time-dominant implementation of the Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings (FW-H) equation to determine the jet’s noise spectra at far-field observers. The acoustic integration will be performed on a permeable surface that encloses the noise-generating turbulent structures in the jet. Additionally, the feasibility of the volume integration of the quadrupole term in the FW-H equation will be investigated. This Phase-1 work will target the prediction of the noise generated by an isolated round jet. The accurate prediction of the noise spectra at far-field observers will demonstrate the feasibility of our high-order, adaptive, overset noise-prediction strategy. The established noise-prediction methodology will be further refined and used in the second phase of this project to predict the noise generated by complex, installed engines configurations. Our overset mesh paradigm is well suited for complex geometries, and our successful implementation of the quadrupole term will resolve the uncertainties in choosing suitable FWH integration surfaces.","The proposed techniques will provide a novel cost-effective high-fidelity tool for jet noise prediction.

Particles emitted from jet turbines serve as cloud nuclei, and changes in their microphysical properties will impact upper level cloud formation, including contrails, which represents a major impact of aviation emissions on the environment and atmospheric radiation balance. Investigations into the impacts of current and future aviation emissions must determine any changes in the degree to which emissions affect contrail formation, cirrus cloud formation, and their evolution over time. This project seeks to develop an instrument suitable for in-flight, low-pressure measurements of the ice forming properties of particles emitted from jet engines, building on existing continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) technology. The CFDC measures ice nucleating particles (INP) by exposing them to a region of controlled temperature and supersaturation and measuring ice crystals that may form.

Smaller, portable versions of the CFDC are not yet commercially available, nor do they have sufficient cooling power to operate at conditions needed for studying contrail and cirrus formation. We will develop a CFDC-type instrument that uses newly developed flexible thermal electric devices to overcome existing limitations in that it will require less power, use smaller cooling system hardware that is more suitable for aircraft operation, and allow for the reduction of the physical size of the measurement chamber.

The Polarix ACTS motor provides a substantial enhancement of all three. This is the result of a new motor topology made possible by the integration of the inverter with the electro-mechanical current carrying elements.  The topology has the following unique characteristics:  1) elemental motors distributed around the periphery, each with its independently controlled inverter with overall control from a master MCU, 2) the elemental motors contained by 3 conductors with a dedicated inverter at one end, and a short at the other and thus no turns, and 3) the planar arrangement of the conductors allows for MEMS type manufacturing. This topology results in almost halving the volume and weight of the magnetic circuit and thus effectively doubling the specific power.  Secondly, the large independent motor elements provide for massive redundancy and thus substantial higher reliability.  Also, the elimination of turns and external wiring allows for greater copper utilization and thus higher efficiency. The performance discussed in the proposal in parametric form (Figure 9) shows 30kW/kg specific power with stator cooling at 5W/cm2 at 99% efficiency excluding windage and core losses.

In previous work, large volumetric fractions of Au, Ag, Cu and Al nanoparticles (NPs) were incorporated into a porous aramid nanofiber (ANF) matrix to realize films that have high electrical conductivity, yet maintain superior mechanical strength, the properties, which are usually hard to achieve simultaneously. Furthermore, the composite films demonstrate excellent flexibility, which is superior to other related classes of reported flexible conductors including carbon based nanomaterials (CNTs and graphene) and other metallic nanomaterials. The unique network structure enables high electrical conductivity and robust mechanical behavior of the metal-ANF films. Most pertinently for mass-restrictive applications, we demonstrated that copper-ANF composites had ~90 % less mass density than solid copper, but with electrical properties (conductivity, ampacity) that were at least 33 % of the bulk value. During Phase I, we will first find the lower limits of achievable mass that still provides acceptable conductivity, ampacity, and strength in both cylindrical and polygonal cross-sectional wires. We will then characterize the conductive and insulating properties of self-insulated wires, in which a single fabrication process can produce non-uniform conductivity with eleven orders of magnitude difference in the measured resistivity in different regions of the solid. Finally, we will design manufacturing tools to scale-up the production of wires and down-select to either a planar or cylindrical processing.","The high-strength, reduced-mass conductor material is multi-use and cross-cutting for a broad range of NASA mission applications, whether that includes hybrid electric aeronautical craft or spacecraft. For space power applications, the innovation can be used for planetary surface power, large-scale spacecraft prime power, small-scale robotic probe power, and small-sat power. For aeronautical applications, the low-mass wiring can efficiently distribute power to aircraft propulsors with minimal mass overhead, such as in the STARC-ABL project.","Lightweight metals can substantially impact the terrestrial electric vehicle and power-transmission markets. Energy storage systems must be flexible, robust, lightweight, and exhibit superior electrochemical activity. Furthermore, robust, flexible conductors are needed to meet the rapidly growing demand in smart sensors, roll-up displays, and other applications with unconventional form factors."

The application of this motor is propelling partially- or fully-electric aircraft. The technology has the potential to quadruple the existing state of the art in aircraft motor specific power. Gains in specific power come from several aspects of the design: The axial flux configuration is used rather than the radial flux. Low-temperature superconductor (LTS) is used for the rotor rather than permanent magnets or high-temperature superconductor. The LTS is cooled via conduction cooling rather than helium-bath cooling. An optimized Halbach winding array concentrates magnetic flux and removes the need for back iron. A relatively high rotational speed allows for direct coupling to a propeller or ducted fan. A cryogenic Litz wire stator is used to reduce dissipation and heat transfer to the rotor. A relatively high pole count for a superconducting machine allows greater efficiency at higher electrical frequency. In Phase I we propose to evaluate the principles using multiphysics modeling. We propose to design a 100 kg, 1 MW motor and a 1000 kg, 20 MW motor. For Phase II we would build and test the three test articles relevant to the 1 MW motor. A 1 MW motor coupled to a propeller is sufficient to replace a turboprop engine in a small business or regional airline aircraft. A 20 MW motor coupled to a ducted fan is sufficient to replace a jet engine in a large passenger aircraft.","This proposal is relevant to commercial aircraft fuel efficiency and emissions reduction, and electrification of aircraft propulsion.

This Phase I proposal will focus on design improvements in two areas, (1) loss and cooling, and (2) electric drive integration. The Phase I is a design effort, the phase II would continue design but also include a build and testing of components. Our concept incorporates an asynchronous (induction) style motor with embedded inverters and also incorporating two-phase semi-evaporative cooling. Ultimately targeting take-off power density of 13.4 kW/kg (and 16.9 kW/L) and around 6-7 kW/kg cruise by re-optimizing an existing record breaking design for the best trade-off between peak and continuous power density. In order to develop the above performance, the motor should not impose a high burden to the inverter. Our design for the motor and inverter will be based on two novel technologies and related controls for electric motors. The first novel technology herein called Variable Cross-Section Wet Coils (VCSWC) pertains to a motor with record torque density and power density. The second technology incorporates an electronic pole switch control strategy (EPS). In this way the power density and efficiency will subsequently be dramatically increased.  During the Phase I we will work on: motor design with enhanced power density, evaluation of the AC losses, ohmic and eddy currents properties, and cooling modes. As the culmination of the Phase I program, we will develop a nominal design for the prototype machine to be demonstrated in Phase II. The target specifications will be determined, and a nominal prototype design developed. This design will not be a build design, but will allow such a build design as the first task of a potential Phase II program.","Besides electric passenger aircraft, NASA can benefit for many applications where light weight power components are required such as smaller land-based generators, inverter type transformers, inductors, and higher frequency power conditioning equipment.","The results of this work can lead to applications related to high rpm rotating machines.

The commonly used hybrid approaches employing Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) in attached regions and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in regions of flow unsteadiness and separation, suffers from many issues related to the generation of resolved turbulence at the RANS/LES interface degrading their predictive accuracy. CRAFT Tech proposes to develop an integrated, modular, well-validated software toolset for the generation of acoustically adapted synthetic turbulence to be used in conjunction with any zonal hybrid RANS/LES approaches. This software toolset is envisioned to be a collection of STG approaches that are suited for various CFD codes used by NASA. Due to the artificial nature of the generated turbulence, it may not be entirely possible to avoid propagation of artificial acoustic disturbances from the interface. To address this, the toolset would also include an optional acoustic module than can be used to filter out spurious pressure fluctuations arising from the RANS/LES interface due to the synthetic turbulence generation. Many of the required feature sets for development and testing of the proposed toolset such as hybrid RANS/LES and WMLES turbulence models are already present in CRAFT CFD® and CRUNCH CFD® multi-physics codes developed and maintained at CRAFT Tech. The modeling capability will provide NASA with the means to efficiently characterize the flow across a RANS/LES interface thus drastically improving the predictive capability of the hybrid method. The toolset will be capable of interfacing with major CFD codes used by NASA such as FUN3D, LAVA, and OpenNCC, among others.","Using the SBIR modeling tools, NASA would be uniquely well-positioned to explore the design of innovative next-generation aircraft and hypersonic transport components. The models developed in Phase I and II would be invaluable in demonstrating the advantages of Hybrid RANS/LES with STG over the currently adopted industry-standard RANS approaches, with emphasis on the minimization of technical risk due to the use of its demonstrated high-fidelity predictive capability.",The modeling tools will be commercially licensed to prime vendors and supporting organizations engaged in the development of aircraft components. CRAFT Tech presently licenses CFD software to the aerospace industry under varied licensing terms and these active commercial relationships will be significantly enhanced by the software toolset that will be developed under the proposed SBIR program.

The Vertical Flight Society is tracking the progress of these vehicle concepts via a web portal that currently features over 90 vectored thrust, nearly 40 lift plus cruise configurations, and approximately 50 wingless multicopters. Many of these vehicles have flown as scaled proof of concepts, while several others are flying as full-scale prototypes. While many of the concepts are envisioned to fly in an autonomous mode, the vehicles that will be certified by the FAA initially will all likely have pilot/operators on-board. Furthermore, these mostly electric vertical takeoff and landing concepts (eVTOL) will also likely feature advanced flight control concepts with highly augmented response types and a variety of cockpit control concepts from conventional helicopter to conventional fixed wing to unified (i.e., the F-35 approach). Given the industry push, these vehicles are clearly coming, but is the public ready to accept this disruptive technology? Besides the noise factor, which is not addressed here, there are safety and comfort factors to consider as well as a pilot pool that is likely to have less training and experience then those flying in the commercial transport market. To this end, a team led by Systems Technology, Inc. proposes to develop the UAM Pilot Assessment Software System (U-PASS) toolbox that will utilize a Task-Pilot-Vehicle (TPV) approach to assess safety in terms of handling qualities and comfort in terms of ride qualities. By the end of Phase II, a prototype U-PASS toolbox will be available to support the design, analysis, and certification of UAM vehicles","The U-PASS toolbox directly supports the goals of the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Project. Here, U-PASS directly supports the goal to “develop and validate tools, technologies and concepts to overcome key barriers for vertical lift vehicles.” Furthermore, U-PASS will provide a means to support the UAM Grand Challenge, which will provide “valuable knowledge that will be given to the organizations working to establish the certification requirements and standards needed for the market to move forward.”","A study by Frost & Sullivan sees the UAM marketplace “expanding with a compound annual growth rate of about 46% to more than 430,000 units in operation by 2040.” There is a need for the new methodologies in U-PASS to support the design, analysis, and certification of these vehicles.

The technical focus is to (1) develop metrics and models that identify how passenger perceptions are affected by vehicle motion, noise, and vibration and (2) develop a Phase II simulation and analysis plan to measure the effects of vehicle motion on ride quality. This project will fill a gap in the knowledge necessary to achieve passenger acceptance of UAM. NASA’s work has related passenger comfort to noise and vibration, but no metric has been developed relating passenger acceptance to the combination of noise, vibration, and vehicle motion. Moreover, novel electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) configurations can be expected to have different motion dynamics from helicopters, the basis of NASA’s past studies. Experiment-based data with human subjects is needed to establish levels of acceptability for vehicle motion and for combinations of vehicle motion, noise, and vibration. Successful UAM air vehicles will have to be designed with ride quality in mind, and design choices will require resolution of tradeoffs involving ride quality, performance, cost, and other factors. Ride quality will thus become one of the primary axes of the UAM design trade space, rendering design strategies, guidelines, and metrics for ride quality imperative for the design process and for NASA research leading to passenger acceptance of UAM. The major results of Phase I will be to define a framework and measurable attributes relating measurable attributes of vehicle motion, vibration, and noise to UAM passenger acceptance, and to establish the scope of the simulation activity that will generate experiment-based metrics relating ride quality to passenger acceptance.","The proposed work will develop critical information for two NASA projects. The results will: 1.  Provide the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) project’s National Campaign with objectives, rationale, and performance measures related to ride quality – a critical element for successful implementation of UAM. 2.

As OPR increases for stress constrained SiC/SiC CMC components the variation in axial velocity between first and second stages increases.

For turbo-generators/range-extenders utilized in regional EAP concepts, small lightweight turboshaft engines are an excellent choice due to their maturity and availability. However, at small power scales, gas turbines are less efficient.

Cascade will port its moving version of the large-eddy simulation (LES) flow solver charLES to GPU-accelerated architectures. The moving mesh solver uses the same Voronoi diagram-based meshing strategy as the static mesh solver, however the meshing is now integrated with the solver to allow local regeneration of the Voronoi diagram when points are in relative motion. The current implementation for traditional architectures uses a conservative space-time formulation that allows for complex motions including collisions and full contact. Since complex motions and thus complex solver treatments are not required for the relatively simple solid-body rotational motion of turbomachinery, the development will be staged by first porting the Voronoi point search and cutting algorithms to the GPU, and simply re-cutting the interface cells in each time step, and updating the communication pattern. The entire algorithm can remain fully explicit, utilizing essentially the same solver as the static charLES for accelerated architectures. In regards to specific architectures, the static accelerated charLES is written in both CUDA and HIP, allowing us to leverage both NVIDIA and AMD accelerated architectures. Verification will be performed by comparing the GPU and CPU implementations in two stages. First, a comparison of the geometric data and operators (e.g. geometric conservation, volumetric fluxes and gradient operators) will be conducted on a mesh containing a moving disk part. Second, a comparison of the flow variables will be made on canonical flows (e.g. Euler vortex, 1D acoustic wave and solid body rotation) with and without a moving disk part.

The trend in the design of modern gas turbine engines is for ever-increasing cycle efficiency and reduced specific fuel consumption. To achieve these engine cycle efficiency goals, the low and high-pressure compressors (HPC) are pushed to ever-increasing levels of pressure ratio. Increasing levels of compressor pressure ratio results in higher rotor tip relative Mach number in the HPC front stages, and consequently steeper performance characteristic maps. The compressors with steep characteristics typically require variable geometry inlet guide vanes as well as variable stators in the first few stages to provides the desired performance and stability in an engine system. The design and development time of a modern high-pressure compressor with variable geometry can take years of design-build-test iterations which includes testing a large number of possible reset angles of the variable vanes. Determining the optimal combination of vane angle resets that will provide the desired compressor performance in an engine system environment is a time consuming and expensive part in the development of high-pressure compressors. It is proposed to address the optimization of the variable geometry reset angle schedules with the use of the innovative autonomous AI technology. The AI-based performance prediction model can be easily incorporated inside of the system analysis tool and reliably predict the performance with high accuracy across the entire operating range of compressor even with multiple variable guide vanes and thus helping to approach true optimal engine performance and reduce the chances of additional expensive design iterations in real-life projects.","The research is closely aligned with NASA Aeronautics programs in the areas of Compact Gas Turbine and Electrified Aircraft Propulsion and will augment the corresponding Advanced Air Transport Technology Project's Technical Challenges, in particular the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for highly accurate axial compressor performance map generation which will help to quickly find the optimal strategies of guide vanes reset angles variation to maximize performance.

Measurement techniques that provide global distributions of skin friction, such as oil film interferometry, shear sensitive liquid crystals, and surface stress sensitive films, have demonstrated steady state skin friction distributions in specific settings. Unfortunately, deployment of these measurement techniques into cryogenic wind tunnels has proven difficult. A system that can provide global measurements of mean and unsteady skin friction is of significant interest. ISSI and WMU propose exploiting existing measurement systems for temperature and utilizing a new variational mathematical approach that can extract global skin friction from high spatial resolution distributions of surface temperature acquired using Temperature-Sensitive Paint (TSP) and IR thermography. The process is based on the well-established relationship between the energy equation and skin friction. This approach has recently been demonstrated by the proposing team as part of a Phase II Air Force SBIR program, thus demonstrating the technical maturity of the technique. Temperature-Sensitive Paint and IR thermography are high TRL tools that are currently used in wind tunnels at both room temperature and cryogenic conditions. These systems, combined with surface heating devices such as carbon nanotubes, provide the high spatial resolution measurements of temperature gradients that are required for extraction of skin friction using this new approach. Combining the proven measurement capabilities of TSP and IR thermography with this new variational approach to extraction of skin friction results in a low risk approach to providing global skin friction measurements in cryogenic wind tunnels.","The SFW program has developed a model to assess the capabilities of various computational techniques, FAITH Hill. Fluctuating aerodynamic loads are a significant concern for the SLS program as unsteady aerodynamic pressures can excite the vehicle dynamic modes. Experimental measurements from the proposed sensor would provide each of these programs with heat transfer and flow separation/attachment data to validate computational models. Similar testing capability could be demonstrated in other NASA tunnels as part of a Phase II program.","The final product from this program should be a system capable of acquiring high spatial resolution distributions of both heat transfer and skin friction on a model in a cryogenic wind tunnel. This is a technological capability that is of interest to ISSI’s current commercial, research, and military wind tunnel customers. ISSI expects to aggressively market this capability to these customers."

These O-rings are frequently used to seal one environment from another especially in mechanical designs incorporating moving components at the interface. As supersonic and hypersonic vehicles increase in importance, materials capable of meeting their demanding applications are sought. Current high temperature elastomers encounter an upper temperature limit near 600℉ - a new material that surpasses this limitation may offer new utility. We propose an oligomeric pre-polymer strategy to synthesize tractable oligomers - a proven technique derivative of ATSP’s core chemical strategy for synthesis of high glass transition temperature aromatic thermosetting copolyester resins but redesigned to incorprate the flexible chains necessary to form an extremely thermally stable new elastomer -offering continuous performance at 700℉ (371℃) and above, thus meeting the high-end requirements for hypersonic vehicles requested in the solicitation. The synthesized chemistry will be examined via nuclear magnetic resonance. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) will then be used to determine a rational thermal cure cycle. Thermal stability will be assessed through thermogravimetry. The combined process cycle will be developed through multiple iterative cycles while being evaluated through density determination and x-ray micro-computed tomography to determine void content and converge on the ideal density in the produced article.

Current state-of-the-art high temperature thermal seals are often made from ceramic oxide fibers that are easily abraded at room temperature, even more so at sustained, elevated temperatures.  An abraded seal can lead to higher leak rates, increased temperatures, and decreased life-span (increased cost).  There is a need to improve the abrasion resistance of these seals without significantly reducing their other desirable characteristics (e.g., flexibility, temperature capability, flow-blocking).

First, JBE will partner with prime contractors and NASA stakeholders to research and identify potential abrasion resistant coatings and down-select the most promising coating types.  JBE has already identified two potential coating types in this proposal.  Second, JBE will manufacture coupons representative of high temperature seals and apply the chosen coatings.  Third, JBE will utilize in-house capability to perform abrasion testing on the coupons to determine the effectiveness of the coatings vs. baseline state-of-the art seals.  As a result of the work done in Phase I, one or more coatings will be identified, applied, tested for abrasion resistance, and either accepted or rejected for additional (Phase II) testing and development.","Improved high-temperature seals would provide increased capability wherever seals are currently utilized such as reusable space vehicles and high-speed propulsion systems.

This translates to longer battery life in typical wireless sensor nodes, where most of the battery capacity is expended in operating the wireless link. Backscatter holds promise to substantially reduce the need to replace batteries, and/or reduce the weight/volume of batteries. However, this emerging technology doesn't yet include a means of over-the-air time synchronization, which is needed in instrumentation and telemetry applications where measurements must be taken synchronously or time-stamped. Upon completing this project, Jeeva will have extended the backscatter networking protocol to enable wireless time synchronization between sensor node and hub, allowing synchronous data captures and time-stamping of data. A testbed will have been developed for characterization of system performance. This project will bring backscatter technology closer to readiness for applications in wireless flight test instrumentation and other wireless avionics applications.",,

The proposed innovation, the sUAS Collision Avoidance System (sUCAS), will be a plugin to existing collision avoidance systems, specifically for general aviation pilots to mitigate collision risk with sUAS. sUCAS will take advantage of the position data broadcast by sUAS – a likely, forthcoming requirement of the FAA’s Remote ID policy – to present timely and informational situational awareness and maneuver guidance to augment a pilot’s see-and-avoid capability. The ultimate vision for the proposed innovation is to exist as a collision avoidance supplement to an established flight planning software application, such as ForeFlight, living within a pilot’s electronic flight bag. The proposed innovation would combine the best of breed of Detect and Avoid (DAA) technologies, including the established science of DAA for larger aircraft and the to-be-determined science for sUAS. To be clear about the role of sUCAS, it is important to note that the proposed innovation would not supersede a pilot’s responsibility to perform see-and-avoid duties, but rather augment the pilot’s capability to do so. In the course of the effort, the team will design and develop a DAA research testbed specialized for manned aircraft encounters with sUAS. Using the testbed, the team will evaluate the efficacy of existing DAA technology for manned vs. sUAS encounters and the efficacy of novel sUAS DAA technologies the team devises, such as reverse proportional navigation theories. A primary technical objective of the research is to help define minimum operational performance standards for the FAA’s Remote ID broadcast range. In its proposed policy, the FAA chose not to define the broadcast range, leaving it up to industry. Its definition has huge implications for the future of aviation safety, where longer ranges place a higher burden on sUAS manufacturers but enable a wide range of safety mechanisms.","sUCAS applications within NASA include projects falling under the Airspace Operation and Safety program, especially those oriented towards future aviation systems like UAM and ATM-X which have goals to safely accommodate emergent air vehicles.",Potential non-government markets include general aviation customers who operate aircraft that fly more frequently in relatively lower altitudes where sUAS are more likely to be encountered. This target market includes single- and twin-piston and single- and twin-turboprop certified light aircraft such as the Cessna Skyhawk and Cirrus SR models.

These new capabilities will be critical in the first and last 50 feet of takeoff and landing, especially in emergency scenarios such as GPS or propulsion failure. To enable these features, KEF will explore two objectives: (1) non-rigid sparse visual state estimation and (2) dense stereo-vision under changing extrinsics. Sparse visual state estimation is the current gold-standard for GPS denied SLAM, but currently works primarily on monocular or rigid, parallel-boresight stereo cameras. To achieve this, we will implement online extrinsics calibration methods and multi-camera feature initialization and test them with simulated datasets. Dense stereo-vision is commonly used for hazard detection and avoidance, but again almost exclusively uses rigid, parallel-boresight stereo cameras.

But such systems require pre-flight inspections conducted by humans. This requirement is a major barrier to fully automated UAV operations.  To address this, we propose “PreSound”: a system that uses vibration and acoustic data, combined with machine learning, to replace preflight visual inspections.  PreSound does not add any significant equipment to the UAV, but intelligently repurposes hardware already on most UAVs: accelerometers, computers, and small microphones. Combined with the vehicle’s motors and propellers, this is all the hardware necessary to create a vibration and acoustic stimulus and measurement device to conduct a pre-flight test and determine whether the airframe is safe to fly.  Each UAV motor, running in reverse, will cycle through its entire range of speeds. An accelerometer and microphone will collect data from each of the motors. Defects such as loose screws, frame cracks, and broken propellers will change how the airframe vibrates and the resulting sounds. Analyzing these samples to determine whether they come from a defect falls to a pre-trained machine learning classification network that runs on the on-board computer after data collection is complete.","NASA has taken a leading role in sUAS integration, urban air mobility and the NextGen Airspace management program. PreSound fits into these efforts, representing a means to verify the integrity of any unmanned airframe without a hands-on inspection. As such, it will be a crucial enabler to future UAV systems that will operate on a day-to-day basis without the intervention of humans, and is a key driver to the safe adoption of autonomous vehicles in the national airspace.","GreenSight already maintains a fleet of over 100 aircraft which fly daily autonomous missions  and would make immediate use of Presound for automated pre-flight inspections.  Many other companies are also developing fully autonomous UAV systems, both for commercial and military application, and would happily pay for a PreSound system to electronically ‘inspect’ their UAV before takeoff."

This smart pallet consists of a reconfigurable sensor suite, flexible interfacing unit, processing with SD-card memory, and power management. The components are housed in a small form-factor and lightweight frame that can be easily attached to and detached from different vehicles. This smart pallet is designed to be plug-and-play for use on low-cost, common commercial drones, instantly granting them with the smart capabilities of multi-modality sensing with data acquisition and online sensor fusion processing. This technology will instantly enable NASA scientists and many other researchers to test and deploy their own algorithms and sensors on commercial drones. The collected data can be input into in-flight processing algorithms but will also be saved in public repositories to facilitate research by diverse groups with the ultimate goal of advancing Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and the testing of technologies as needed for unmanned flight in the National Airspace. For demonstrating the utility of the smart pallet, an object recognition and collision avoidance Use Case is included which shows how the sensor suite can provide data to an algorithm to conduct a task of relevance to UAM. Key innovations include: (1) plug-and-play hardware and software; (2) flight optimized design; (3) embedded cognition with obstacle avoidance and (4) data labeling scheme for sensor quality generation.","The DroneMSP system will advance the state-of-the-art of NASA’s unmanned aircraft systems by facilitating the deployment and testing of sensor payloads with data-fusion and intelligent algorithms.

But in subsequent phases we plan to extend it to arbitrary program specifications, including those using temporal logic. This verification method has been used for non-real-time software, we will extend it to real-time embedded systems.  We propose (1) to extend RV-Match, our semantics-based C dynamic analysis tool, to target one of the real-time operating systems that NASA uses for running UAS embedded software;  (2) to produce a symbolic bounded model checker for C based on the most complete operational semantics of the language (exactly the same semantics as used by our dynamic analysis tool); and (3) to evaluate our dynamic analysis tool and model checker by using them to analyze real NASA flight software, such as the NASA core Flight System (cFS).",The analysis of NASA flight software produced as a result of this project should be directly useful to developers of that software.

However, there remain barriers to increased adoption. Current autonomous systems have poor perception of the environment. At the same time, detecting and avoiding non-cooperative aircraft in all weather is a key requirement for operation in the National Airspace (NAS). To bridge this gap, KMB Telematics Inc. is proposing the development of a low size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) imaging radar for UAS sense-and-avoid applications. This sensor is based on 18 months of IRAD conducted by KMB Telematics to develop imaging radar for the automotive market. Automotive radar has seen a flurry of innovation in recent years, resulting in inexpensive, high-resolution sensors. This proposed Phase I effort will focus on the technical objectives needed to show the feasibility of adapting these technologies for UAS sense-and-avoid. By meeting these objectives, this radar will be suitable for use on small commercial package delivery UAS for which there is currently no available sense-and-avoid sensor. The proposed radar will be smaller, lighter, and more inexpensive than currently available technologies. The radar will consume less power and will be designed for redundancy and fault tolerance. The goal is for the radar developed under this SBIR to (1) accelerate the Integrated Aviation Systems Program’s ongoing effort to expand NAS access to broader classes of UAS, and (2) allow commercial package delivery UAS operators to receive FAA waivers for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations. Phase I will result in simulation, analysis, and feasibility determination needed to show that the imaging radar approach is capable of being used on lightweight, power constrained UAS platforms. Phase I will also result in a design that is ready to be prototyped in Phase II.","This sensor would allow IASP to use smaller, cheaper UAS to perform research like the development of sense and avoid algorithms, sensor fusion, pattern recognition, and decision-making algorithms. The sensor could be used in a ground-based configuration to assist AOSP’s research related to UAS path planning, ATC, and non-cooperative surveillance. In space, this radar could be used as an Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) sensor for terrain mapping, for spacecraft docking, and for On Orbit-Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM).","This sensor would enable commercial package delivery UAS operators to fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). This is a large, growing market. Another potential market is counter-UAS around critical infrastructure, selling to DHS, DoD, and and commercial integrators. Also interesting is commercial spaceflight, in  precision applications like asteroid mining and landing reusable launch vehicles."

Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Urban Air Mobility operations and traffic management will also require novel approaches to affordable, adaptable, vehicle automation capabilities. A possible solution is hosting FMS capabilities as cloud-based services. The Cloud FMS concept proposes an architecture in which flight control and autopilot functions remain on the air vehicle while more strategic navigation and mission planning functions run on cloud computing resources, connected to the vehicle with high-bandwidth/reliability digital communication. Mosaic ATM, working with SmartSky Networks, will assess Cloud FMS feasibility with respect to safety and communication requirements, through experimentation within a simulation environment, utilizing SmartSky’s state-of-the-art air-ground network, analyzing the communication performance characteristics, including bandwidth, latency, integrity, continuity, coverage as a function of latitude/longitude and altitude. This analysis will be performed using SmartSky’s test/performance monitoring data, as well as predictive analytical tools such as RF coverage analysis. Cloud FMS could benefit traditional commercial passenger and cargo aircraft by enabling new automation capabilities with lower certification and installation costs.  By reducing vehicle weight and power requirements, Cloud FMS could benefit Unmanned Air Vehicles and urban air taxis. Cloud FMS could also reduce per vehicle cost by replacing an expensive component in a way that scales with quantity more favorably.","This research has application in reducing pilot responsibilities/air vehicles without pilots (e.g., some UAS and UAM) and developing “default safe” or “station keeping” behavior in case of communication or ground-system failure.

The concept is designed to be self-operating and self-powering, to enable the weather stations to be situated virtually anywhere and deliver networked information to a dispatcher at a local or distant location. Additionally, this concept begins to develop the precepts of urban weather forecasting, first by building a database of urban weather for mining, and by beginning to derive weather lessons from the collected data.","NAUCS will contribute directly to achieving NASA research objectives for the Advanced Air Mobility Project by providing networked weather stations for early testing at NASA Center test sites. Weather data availability is an important constraint on urban flight operations and NAUCS offers access to data for early testing and later evaluation in realistic operational environments. These deployments will generate data for use in analyzing vehicle performance and integration with flight planning, fleet monitoring, and trajectory management.","NAUCS will provide a service required by UAM and drone delivery operators. Once integrated into flight planning and monitoring, NAUCS will enable safer and more efficient operations by avoiding hazards and unexpected power drains."

More reliance on automation means there are less nodes in the workflow where humans can identify anomalies in data. ResilienX is proposing to develop a Weather Sensor and Data Monitor (WSDM) service that we will integrate into our commercial In-time System-wide Safety Assurance (ISSA) platform; FRAIHMWORKTM (Fault Recovery and Isolation, Health Monitoring frameWORK). The goal of the WSDM is to detect when a weather source is not providing valid data. Weather sources may be IoT sensors, cameras, crowd sourced data, radar data, or even national, academia and private sector weather feeds. We will focus this effort on low altitude, urban environments that have specific complex micro-weather challenges and enable the accelerated deployment of an initial urban wind model capability. We will monitor and enhance these weather sources by creating a micro-weather model for the urban environment which considers the structure (i.e. building and terrain) using Computational Fluid Dynamics as well as meteorology at low altitude. Since the weather data and forecasts are based off the input data to this model, verifying the validity of the input data will enable trust of the output. Our vision is to enhance our ISSA platform with an advanced low altitude urban weather model capable of detecting and predicting “hot spots” that drones should stay away from. This initial model will accelerate commercialization of an important data set to identify hazard areas and keep airframes and people safe as we test, demonstrate, and deploy initial UAS and UAM operations in urban environments. We will also provide the capability to verify inputs to this model and identify misbehaving sensors before they have the chance to put bad data in and potentially affect the model.","This initiative enables NASA applications that depend on highly reliable and persistent non-government space, atmospheric and terrestrial measurements and predictions: UAS and UAM is a “blue sky” mission area to demonstrate how weather systems and weather monitoring, especially in urban areas, can reduce the impact of anomalous events to mission critical operations.","Our applications for this technology extend to FAA and commercial endeavors of the same mission areas that NASA is working in, namely: We are also looking at how cities can use urban micro weather data as part of Smart City initiatives by deploying IoT weather sensors."

While these air traffic management concepts differ greatly in the details, the validation goal remains the same. To achieve safe operation, one must minimize flight risk. The current NAS relies on the cognition and decision-making capabilities of human actors to minimize flight risk. In order to realize the future air traffic management concepts described above, new validation strategies are required that can replace the safety assurances currently provided by the human actors in the system. The overall goal of the proposed research program is to develop a new validation strategy for future air traffic management concepts that is based on a probabilistic modeling methodology called generalized polynomial chaos (gPC). As measures of safety in aviation are inherently probabilistic, gPC provides a unique advantage over other methodologies that can isolate worst-case behavior but cannot necessarily quantify the likelihood of a hazardous/catastrophic event. During Phase I, Barron Associates will: (1) identify near-term, mid-term, and long-term air traffic management concepts, (2) define the operating space (e.g. variations in the airspace environment) and safety metrics for each concept, (3) compute a gPC model that maps the operating space for a given air traffic management concept to the set of metrics that characterize system safety, and (4) analyze the gPC model to quantify how the operating space impacts the safety metrics. While the Phase I program is structured to support a traditional validation process that occurs before fielding a new technology, Barron Associates will outline how the same techniques (with a few minor modifications) can be used to support In-Time System-wide Safety Assurance (ISSA).","The proposed research is directly in line with the System-Wide Safety project and addresses two out of the six NASA ARMD strategic thrusts: Real-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance and Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation (AAAT). Specifically, the proposed research addresses the following research activity: “cost-efficient verification and validation methods that provide justifiable confidence in safety claims for designs of complex ATM/avionics systems, including increasingly autonomous, non­deterministic systems.”",The proposed research has a high-transition potential to government agencies that currently manage airspace operations including the FAA and the DoD.

We modify this by adding an extra intermediate layer at the UAS Service Supplier (USS) level (USS functions). The aim of the proposed effort is to develop and demonstrate a strategic cybersecurity framework for this UTM-ISSA architecture. While there are many risk factors that impact ISSA, we focus on risks that emanate from cybersecurity threats from a variety of players. For the monitor portion, we propose an approach to aggregate a variety of cybersecurity-relevant data sources at various levels of the UTM-ISSA. Designing the information schema for these data elements is part of the proposed effort. We divide the Assess portion into two: Assess-1 and Assess-2. The Assess-1 portion involves a signature-based misuse detection for cybersecurity threats followed (sequentially) by a deep learning based anomaly detection module. The Assess-2 takes as input the anomalous patterns from Assess-1 and provides strategic labels: Who?, What?, Why?, How? and When? based on a deep learning multi-label classifier. The Mitigate component uses an attack tree for devising strategic countermeasures and a game theory module for devising tactical countermeasures corresponding to each strategy at each level of the UTM-ISSA. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using an illustrative cyber-terrorist scenario that features a coordinated cybersecurity attack on multiple UAS.","NASA's UTM-ISSA program is the first anticipated tech transfer target and application.

However, as increasingly autonomous (IA) capabilities and systems are introduced into existing human-centric environments, the roles and responsibilities of humans change, especially when working in collaborative environments, such as the Airport Operations Area (AOA) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The integration of autonomous capabilities into traditionally human-centric environments with the goal of Human-Automation Interaction and Teaming (HAIT) makes it difficult for IA systems to not be brittle (i.e., working well in the lab under nominal circumstance, but perform poorly in unexpected situations) and accident-prone (i.e. account for emergent behavior due to unexpected decision by people or environment changes) as they attempt to work collaboratively with people. Therefore, we propose the Virtual EnviRonment for InFormative analYsis (VERIFY) framework, which links physical spaces to a virtual environment (i.e. mixed-reality). VERIFY will be used as a research tool for proactively understanding how humans and IA systems will need to work collaboratively to address and mitigate system hazards and unexpected events as a HAIT. By using a mixed-reality environment, researchers can explore multiple environmental variables simultaneously, to understand their impact on individual tasks across multiple HAIT arrangements. The objective is to leverage use cases to define key characteristics for probabilistic scenario generation to define HAIT test cases for evaluation within a mixed-reality environment. This approach also enables engineers to safely employ both physical and virtual hazards for training adaptive and non-deterministic systems and human operators to work alongside each other under nominal and off-nominal conditions.","A variety of NASA technologies and missions could benefit from this effort, e.g, ISS robots: Astrobee and R2, OSAM system Restore-L, the in-Space Assembled Telescope, the Lunar Surface Science Mobility System, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and future manned Mars missions.

Unfortunately, flight operators do not have sufficient look-ahead time to efficiently respond to these real-time SAA status changes. The proposed innovation includes: 1) A capability for new entrants to more efficiently provide and receive airspace definition and status information, particularly when critical to their proposed operations; 2) A capability to forecast SAA status and determine a measure of forecast confidence; 3) Forecast SAA status that is knowable to the flight operator pre-departure, combined with real-time SAA status, will enable flight operators to fly more efficient routes; 4) A prototype application to display scheduled, real-time, and forecast status of new entrant airspace, SAA, and TFRs.

We specifically target developing a software system called the Quiet UAM Impact Path Planning (QUIPP) Tool for generating electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft flight paths that minimize noise impacts on people within the UAM on-demand environment. This new capability will enhance the A3.04 subtopic’s need for “dynamic route planning that considers changing environmental conditions, vehicle performance and endurance” by developing flight paths based on current noise impacts and constraints within the operating environment, thereby adding agility, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic route planning. The QUIPP system proposed in this SBIR generates 4-dimensional trajectories that are the least intrusive in terms of the overall cumulative noise impacts on the population while considering vehicle endurance such as maximum range. QUIPP comprises dynamic input datasets and flight path optimization that rely on current noise contours from a noise model. The dynamic inputs are used by QUIPP to synthesize noise-sensitive 4-D trajectories by applying an adaptation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the lowest cost route. QUIPP will help to gain community acceptance of UAM by developing optimal flight paths that utilize the current noise conditions and the temporal movement of people throughout the day to minimize noise exposure. QUIPP minimizes the noise impact of UAM flights to gain local community acceptance, which is a critical issue to UAM success. The anticipated result of Phase I is successful demonstration of a proof-of-concept where flight paths are developed that minimize the noise impact on the population while working within the boundaries of environmental and aircraft constraints.

Originally funded by DARPA, with additional funding by NASA, GTL has developed a novel composite system (BHL™) for cryogen storage and transfer. BHL is used to produce LOX and cryogen compatible components that leverage the full strength of carbon fiber. For ground systems, the reduction in thermal mass will be more advantageous than the mass reduction (1/4 the mass of existing state of the art equivalents). BHL has 5-7 times lower thermal mass than stainless steel components, and over 10 times lower thermal mass than aluminum components (for the same pressure capability). BHL tubes chill down in less than 10% of the time of stainless-steel tubes. This increases the quality of the cryogenic liquid, reduces bubble entrainment, and allows for longer tube run lengths. Composite structures are insensitive to hydrogen embrittlement and are highly resistant to fatigue. Furthermore, composite structures CTE can be tailored allowing for a zero lengthwise CTE. This ensures that components will not move around, fighting connection points and interconnections, further reducing fatigue and failure mechanisms. In addition to the nominal benefits, GTL has developed a novel flow sensor method based around BHL. This sensor will allow for monitoring of the flow velocity profile, quality, and fill level. In this phase I effort, GTL will design and produce a series of test articles to demonstrate the application of BHL to ground systems. This includes the extension to very high pressures, ground handling damage testing, and flow sensor testing. GTL is experienced in cryogenic testing, LOX and LCH4 testing, propulsion system design and testing, and ground facility production. In the phase II, full scale components will be produced and delivered, and testing can be performed yielding a high-quality validation data set for TRL advancement.","Low thermal mass, low mass cryogenic compatible components and sensors are applicable to many of NASA systems including ground test facilities, launch vehicles, nuclear propulsion, landers, lunar and mars habitats, and other space systems. The significant reduction in mass of cryogenic storage and transfer from BHL will allow for the highest performing cryogen systems ever produced.","The DoD and commercial launch services will benefit greatly from BHL components.

This methodology will be developed in the Loci-STREAM CFD code and will allow significantly reduced solution time for unsteady simulations of cavitating flows and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations at NASA, as well as simulation of liquid jets and sprays such as in NASA/SSC’s B-2 test facility. The work will involve: (a) upgrading the unsteady methodology in Loci-STREAM by implementing the PIMPLE algorithm, and will improve runtime of cavitation and FSI simulations by a factor of 3–5, and (b) Implementing an algebraic VOF method using compressive schemes which will allow simulations of two-phase flows (involving liquid jets) in a robust and more efficient manner (significantly faster solution times) manner than is currently possible with the geometric VOF available in Loci-STREAM. Two types of compressive schemes will be implemented: (a) Schemes based on the Normalized Variable Diagram (NVD) and Convection Boundedness Criterion (CBC), and (b) Flux-limiting schemes with the total variation diminishing (TVD) condition.

(PSI) proposes to develop a unique venturi for propellant feed systems that uses a passively controlled throat area to adjust flow rate. The adaptive venturi is a safety device that eliminates fluid hammer in gaseous, liquid, and cryogenic systems by rapidly adjusting flow area to prevent pressure surges. These benefits are achieved without adding weight, volume, or power requirements. Sensors are not used. For high-pressure oxygen systems, the adaptive venturi eliminates the risk of ignition caused by adiabatic compression. This device has been demonstrated with a prompt response time and zero evidence of instability. In Phase I, PSI’s existing adaptive venturi will be optimized specifically for high-pressure oxygen applications. The component’s performance will be evaluated using gaseous nitrogen to quickly iterate and improve the geometric design. Then, the adaptive venturi’s ability to prevent ignition due to fluid impact will be evaluated with gaseous oxygen at high pressures. Upon successful technology development under the SBIR program, the adaptive venture is a near-term product that will be transitioned to markets for both flight and ground-based applications.","Successful demonstration of the adaptive venturi will have applications in any oxygen system where high pressures, soft goods, or high flow rates are desired. Extending the lifetime and maximum pressure capability of oxygen components will improve reliability and performance in these applications. More generally, the adaptive venturi will reduce the cost of qualifying gas, liquid, and cryogenic feed system by eliminating the need for surge mitigation testing. These benefits can be realized for both ground-based and flight plumbing systems.","The adaptive venturi can simplify propellant loading and priming operations for propellant systems in Air Force satellites and missile defense systems employed by the MDA, Army, and Navy. The ground test facilities that support these missions in DoD and private industry will benefit from the adaptive venturi due to improvements in safety, performance, and cost."

The technique identifies the hardware element that is the cause of the detected fault thereby enabling more targeted recovery/repair response. MONSID supports autonomous operations technology requirements to reduce operations and maintenance costs and minimizes human in the loop intervention.

A common mechanistic pathway in these events is unchecked oxidative stress. We have developed a countermeasure that protects mice from whole body x-ray radiation-induced death when given systemically 4 hours after lethal radiation exposure. At this time point, a lot of the immediate free radical generation from ionizing radiation exposure has already occurred and yet, we were able to protect these mice. This is largely due to the extremely potent free radical scavenging ability of our C60 fullerene derivative we term C60-ser that (i) has been made biocompatible by decorating it with a serinol malonamide to dramatically increase its water solubility (>250 mg/ml) and (ii) readily traverses physical barriers within tissues and cells to achieve excellent concentrations in all tissues within the body. C60-ser exists in a dynamic equilibrium state seamlessly flipping between the conjugate monomers (~3nm) and aggregates (100-2000 nm). Such duality enables the conjugates to use passive diffusion and active transport (e.g. endocytosis, transcytosis) for efficient and seamless shuttling from the vasculature to tissues including the brain. The sub-5nm size also allows a long circulation time by evading opsonization and reticuloendothelial capture and facilitating renal elimination. C60-ser can be reliably and reproducibly created in our facilities by facile and scalable techniques that we have pioneered. The studies proposed in this submission are extensions of this exciting preliminary work that will now explore the ability of C60-ser to protect multiple cell types from charged particle radiotherapy injuries.  Collectively these studies will set the stage for testing C60-ser in animal models in phase II of this NASA SBIR program.","We have developed a radiation countermeasure, C60-ser, that protects mice from whole body x-ray radiation-induced death when given systemically 4 hours after lethal radiation exposure. If these properties hold true with space exposure-relevant radiation types, energies, and doses, we expect C60-ser could be used by astronauts during space missions (prophylactically before take-off or therapeutically after documented high-risk exposure such as a solar flare event).","Our radiation countermeasure, C60-ser, protects mice from whole body x-ray radiation-induced death when given systemically 4 hours after radiation via extremely potent free radical scavenging.

Patterns in these data can indicate that astronauts are not at peak physical or mental performance, and patterns in these data sets can suggest how to return the astronauts to peak performance.

For example, this algorithm could track metabolic activity in crew in real time and suggest changes to environmental system parameters to maintain constant CO2 levels in a most resource-efficient way. Another example is early warning of dangerous conditions (precursors to hypercapnia). Its diagnostic power lies in its ability to learn in real time, and also in its ability to find subtle correlations between multiple bio parameters in data telemetry available to it. This algorithm also has the added benefit of fast learning for adapting to nuances between astronauts' metabolic profiles and finding new diagnostic correlations in real time during the mission.

Space oxygen recovery technologies implemented include carbon formation reactors (CFR) and methane pyrolysis assembly (PPA) reactors. These technologies, however, almost universally result in the formation of particulate carbon, which could undermine the operation of the spacecraft and threaten crew safety. Therefore, this proposed project directly addresses the needs of the subtopic H3.01: Advancements in Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Critical Subsystems and Solid Carbon Repurposing. The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop a new class of catalytic nanoarray-based monolithic filters to achieve the efficient filtration of particulate carbon for space oxygen recovery by integrating catalytically active nanostructured arrays onto the porous metal particulate filters. During the filtration process, the conformal nanoarray forests can increase the filtration efficiency while maintaining a low-pressure drop. Meanwhile, the nanoarray-supported catalysts can motivate the carbon gasification reaction and achieve fast filter regeneration at low temperatures. The proposed particulate filter could also completely avoid crew exposure to the accumulated carbon particulates. This project, if completed, will enable NASA to remove and manage the particulate carbon in the space station in a more efficient way with a more space compact, light-weighted, energy-efficient, and easily regenerable filtration device.","The proposed nanoarray-based monolithic filter is designed for the filtration of carbon particulate emissions from the plasma pyrolysis assembly for methane decomposition, but it could also be used to remove different particulate contaminant in other areas of the space stations.","The nanoarray-based monolithic filters will provide an energy-efficient, cost-effective, space compact and easily regenerable technology to remove particulate matters in different applications.

The current approach used to determine microbial growth is through analytical microbiology, which relies on sampling from tanks and analysis of these grab samples in a high-tech laboratory with specialized equipment (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA techniques).  There are several drawbacks to this current approach.  First, analysis of the dynamics of microbial growth and microbial contamination is completely lost; single grab samples over time are unlikely to show how fast the microbial growth is advancing, and if enough grab samples are taken to try to track the dynamics of microbial growth, there is then a sample number/volume challenge in being able to analyze many samples in a timely manner.  Second, an analytical instrumentation laboratory requires highly specialized and trained scientists and operators, which limits the feasibility of many operations having good access to such a laboratory.  Third, this approach is time intensive; it often takes days to weeks to obtain and analyze grab samples in an analytical laboratory.  Finally, this approach does not offer any real-time or online information about microbial growth and therefore is likely to miss early-stage growth where identification and mitigation are ideal; the longer the microbes are allowed to grow, the worse the damage is to the air, surface, and water quality.  For all of these reasons, on-line, inline technology is desired and required to enable spacecraft operations to easily identify microbial contamination in air, surfaces, and potable water early enough to address safety and health quality concerns.","Microbial and fungal contamination of the air, surfaces, and water resources on spacecraft is a major health hazard for astronauts. The risks include infection and illness, the release of microbially-produced toxins, alteration of astronaut immune systems, and the degradation of materials and equipment on spacecraft. Therefore, the real-time monitoring of microbial growth for air, surface, and water environments for crewed and uncrewed operations would provide ample warning for microbial growth prevention methods to be implemented.","The simplicity and elegance of this approach are that the array can be used for any mixture of metabolites across gas and liquid phase because it does not rely on one-to-one binding. This allows the technology to be easily implemented into different microbiological testing markets such as the agricultural industry, the water industry, the healthcare industry, and the oil and gas industry."

Composite samples will be subjected to rigorous testing to assess their performance, as well as processability and endurance.  Optimized layered combinations will be subjected to various water challenges in an environmental chamber.  Finally, we will also carry out a high-fidelity engineering analysis to estimate the cost of the composite materials as a function of production volume.","Since Extravehicular Activities can last up to 8 hours, comfort and prevention of hand injuries can be increased by controlling the space suit glove atmosphere.  TDA Research proposes to develop a new composite material for facilitated water transport that can be integrated into the space suit glove bladder to provide a means to prevent water/humidity accumulation in the glove.  The facilitated transport membrane also has applications for NASA in adult diapers.",The enhanced water wicking capability of this new composite will enable its use in advanced fabrics and sports apparel.  The chemically modified fabric will work far better than today’s water wicking porous fabrics.  Adult diapers are another application with a large commercial market.

To meet NASA’s demands for deployable and retractable high-power solar arrays Opterus proposes the Rollable-Retractable Mast Array (R-ROMA). R-ROMA is the first of its kind H-configuration deployable-retractable blanket solar array structure utilizing a single High Strain Composite (HSC), closed lenticular cross section rollable mast. Opterus’ R-ROMA technology can be applied either as a stand-alone solar electric power system or an innovation of current state of the art H-configuration blanket array structures.

Featuring single-axis vertical deployment and retraction, OBELISC is a low-maintenance, robust design leading to long life and multiple retractions for relocation or service. Unlike a rotating flat array, OBELISC’s design boasts a 360-degree view with no need for a vertical axis gimble. The enclosed internal mechanisms are protected from lunar dust by the blanket array and reduction in complexity (and therefore the number of failure points) increases OBELISC’s service life and reliability. The system consists mainly of the folding blanket array and the support structure. The architecture uses an identical trapezoidal facet repeated throughout the entire array, with each side of the column folding compactly in a z-folded manner. The trapezoidal facets are populated with PV cells and the triangular facets are left unpopulated but are retained for two purposes: control the folding and unfolding of the PV panels and act as the first line of defense against dust for the enclosed mechanisms. The OBELISC architecture is tailorable in stowed inner and outer diameters, number of sides, and number of bays. The outer diameter variability allows for convenient integration onto common lunar lander designs and within launch fairings. The inner diameter variability allows for the central support structure to be housed within the central volume. The variability of the number of sides allows for optimal design of panels versus the performance of the solar array. The variability in the number of bays increases or decreases the deployed height of the column, allowing for a tractable way to tailor the deployed area without changing the rest of the geometry.","OBELISC will benefit NASA initial manned and unmanned missions to the lunar surface.  These missions could use large photovoltaic solar arrays to generate power for habitats, ISRU, science investigations, and battery charging. The proposed technology could also impact a broad array of NASA missions, such as NASA’s needs for large deployable and retractable solar arrays for solar electric propulsion and hybrid propulsion schemes or for powering lunar and planetary tug spacecraft.","OBELISC will benefit the DoD, prime contractors, and commercial spacecraft providers that are interested in large solar arrays. Specific examples include providers that endorse OBELISC development (Astrobotic and Firefly), and others such as Air Force, Army, SpaceX, and Northrup Grumman.

The MAD energy system weighs up to 10% less than traditional arrays by eliminating the motor drive for deployment. Instead, solar array deployment and retraction are actuated by pieozoelectrics mounted to the array structure that excite the array substrate through bistable extended and coiled geometries. The piezo alignment and substrate design will be optimized as part of this program to minimize the radius of curvature around which the array can coil, thereby maximizing the packaging efficiency. Furthermore, the electrically driven actuators provide a dual purpose for the electrically conductive paths harvesting energy from the array’s solar cells. The “snap through” behavior in the MAD energy system’s structure is much like that of a tape measure or a “slap” bracelet (the novelty children’s toy). The extended geometry maintains a subtle curvature such as c-shaped or lenticular. When coiled, the structure lays flat for a packaging efficiency up to and exceeding 100 kW/m3. The potential energy of the asymmetric layup, when excited, enables the transition from coiled (retracted) to extended (deployed), or vice versa. To accelerate readiness for missions as early as 2024, the MAD energy system is leveraging high TRL technologies already demonstrated in space or laboratory-based testing. The use of high TRL subsystems and leveraging decades of prior deployable structure development allows the focus of the MAD Energy system development to be on the system level packaging and TRL maturation of the lightweight, high packaging efficient piezoelectric actuation.

The utility of MG Resin is being explored through funding with various government agencies for a wide range of applications including hot structures, thermal protection systems (TPS), and an elastomeric formulation for rocket motor insulation. Addressing the need for affordable hot structures, MG Resin has proven to be an excellent material for replacing legacy pitch and phenolic resins in the production of C/C composites. The MG Resin chemistry is highly tailorable and is compatible with both liquid infusion and prepreg processing. During carbonization it forms a strong char with very high yield (>70%), and is able to produce C/C composites with densities greater that 1.6 g/cc within two PIP densification cycles. Reducing the number of densification cycles reduces the total lead time to produce a part, which directly correlates to a massive reduction in cost due to the labor savings. CRG has demonstrated this lead time reduction by fabricating fully dense C/C using 3D woven preforms in two weeks. When this time savings is combined with the enhancements to mechanical performance offered by z-stitching and oxidation resistance afforded through higher temperature capable coatings and densification using Si-containing MG Resin formulations, C/C of superior quality will be produced in less time and at a lower cost than the current state-of-the art.

The other ~half of panels will be delivered as-is for potential C-C densification and testing by NASA or by TEAM at beginning of Phase II. The advantage of the proposed approach is that both the braiding process and the stitching work cell are easily scaled in terms of part size and geometry.  Through thickness property issues with traditional C-C tape-lay are addressed by the proposed stitching process.

It allows the engineer to represent the system in a comprehensive computer model allowing for better traceability, tracking, and information consistency. The vision and promise of MBSE is one where systems models and analyses are tightly integrated in an automated, collaborative, easily accessible and secure framework. However, the current state-of-the-art falls short of this promise due to a significant gap between MBSE tools and its integration with analysis tools. Phoenix Integration proposes to develop and prototype a framework that would help realize the vision and promise of MBSE. This prototype framework will be web-based, utilizing existing tools and frameworks already deployed and being used at NASA. At the center of the framework is the connection between OpenMBEE and ModelCenter® MBSE. OpenMBEE is an open source collaboration environment for engineering models. It is driven by models and capabilities that support a model-based approach. ModelCenter® MBSE on the other hand, is a next generation MBSE analysis integration tool currently being commercially developed at Phoenix Integration. This framework will be connected to a continuous integration server for automated execution in response to a model change. In addition to being able to interact with the systems model through a web environment, the user would be able to execute the associated analyses and workflows using information from the systems model. Automatic requirements verification can be performed through automated analysis execution whenever a change in the systems model is detected. The analysis that is run can also be represented back in the systems model for full traceability.","These capabilities will directly benefit ongoing and future NASA projects, such as the Europa Clipper and Lander missions, the Team X and related collaborative design teams, as well as all future science missions. NASA would be able to leverage this technology on any project that involves a significant level of technical and programmatic complexity. This includes most of NASA's commercial lunar lander initiative, various aircraft technology initiatives, as well as planetary exploration missions.","This technology will benefit all programs adopting MBSE, including those at the Department of Defense. Commercial organizations such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing will also benefit as they implement MBSE activities. Other industries such as automotive, pharmaceutical and manufacturing could take advantage of the innovative technology developed here."

Neural Networks operating at the Edge will need to perform Continuous Learning and Few-shot/One-shot Learning with very low energy requirements, as will NN operation. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide the architectural framework to enable Edge operation and Continuous Learning. SNNs are event-driven and represent events as a spike or a train of spikes. Because of the sparsity of their data representation, the amount of processing Neural Networks need to do for the same stimulus can be significantly less than conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), much like a human brain. To function in Space and in other extreme Edge environments, Neural Networks, including SNNs, must be made rad-hard.

Neuromorphic processing will enable NASA to meet growing demands for applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on-board a spacecraft to optimize and automate operations.  It has been widely received that the recent success of artificial intelligence (AI) is built on three cornerstones: the advance of algorithms, the acquisition of big data, and the availability of high computing power. To further improve the data processing capability and efficiency, researchers, in general, explore from three orthogonal and complementary aspects: algorithm simplification and compression, computing architectures optimized for specific applications, and novel nano-devices that possess unique electrical properties, e.g., synapse- or neuro-alike behavior. These practices are respectively pursued by research societies of machine learning, computer architecture, and solid-state circuit and device. There lacks thorough and sufficient communications and coordination in between. As an example, the quantization of deep neural network (DNN) models often ignores the physical constraints on nano-devices like resistive memory (ReRAM, aka memristor), whose resistance suffers from different variation levels at different resistance values. The higher resistance level can also minimize the power consumption due to the reduced amplitude of the current participating in the computation.  Carefully optimizing the quantization scheme of DNNs can achieve both high computational robustness and low power consumption of the ReRAM-based neuromorphic processor.","Technology proposed addresses NASA's TA1 - Flight Computing objectives, which are to “increase onboard autonomy and enable large-scale data triage to support more capable instruments” and “support reliable onboard processing in extreme environments to enable new exploration missions.”  And, the TA1 - Ground Computing objectives are to “support 1,000X larger mission computations to enable high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data analysis” and “demonstrate efficient solution of complex NASA problems through quantum and cognitive computing.”","Fast and efficient processing platforms are crucial to the IT revolution.

The crystalline state is most stable, allows a high-concentration, low-viscosity parenteral formulation, and facilitates alternate routes of administration. There is a requirement that the crystals be small, a few micrometers or less, and uniform, the same size within a few per cent.  The problem: most recombinant protein biopharmaceuticals do not crystallize uniformly.  A solution to this problem has been discovered in on-orbit crystallization experiments, which produced very uniform sized crystals. Manufacturers are creating demand for on-orbit testing of uniform crystallization protocols, but suitable hardware and ISS research opportunities are inadequate.  Techshot proposes a business plan in which cost and time saving versatile flight hardware and flexible flight opportunities are made openly available to corporate and institutional users seeking improvements or refinements in product purification, formulation and/or delivery.  Hardware and flight plans on ISS will be offered in which factorial and/or real-time photography experiments can be performed on the basis of Techshot’s regular ISS access and versatile hardware fleet.  In Phase I research Techshot will (1) adapt up to four different existing hardware modules for this specific application, (2) test these modules in model protein crystallization experiments in the laboratory, and (3) perform mathematical modeling for a ground-based crystallization reactor with adjustable parameters for approximating the relevant low-gravity physics.  In Phase II research Techshot will prepare the hardware modules for flight readiness, prepare an aggressive ISS use plan, and construct and operate an optimizable ground-based reactor.  The intended outcome is a business paradigm for hastening the availability of stable biopharmaceuticals with favorable options for delivery.","NASA has solicited research topics in this area of pharmaceutical production on spacecraft making deep space voyages to solve problems of availability and stowage.  Such projects include short-cut production of biopharmaceuticals by stored microbial cells but also need to include short-cut purification schemes.   A crystallization plan, Techshot’s proposed innovation, could eliminate several (chromatography, extraction, etc.) downstream steps toward such on-orbit formulation, although non-NASA commercialization is the project’s primary goal.","Success in producing a crystalline product will save big due to longer ambient stability, lower delivery volume and novel routes of administration of their product, whether it is an approved pharmaceutical or an emerging therapeutic.

As a result, communication opportunities must be exploited optimally to achieve the reliable, high volume and low latency data transfers that will be demanded by future space missions. This goal is hindered by the use of a communication management approach that is mainly centralized. Such practice creates limitations to what can be optimized not only because of the need for expert human assistance but also because certain system updates could not be communicated to the required network devices within a reasonable time to be effective given the physical dimensions and nature of the network.

This proposal addresses the critical need for high-efficiency, millimeter-wave amplifiers used in absorption radar for remote pressure sensing to improve weather models. Specifically, we propose to develop a pulsed power amplifier with a minimum duty cycle of 25% operating over the 65-71 GHz band. The maximum power of 10+ Watts at 65 GHz and 1+ Watts at 71 GHz will be achieved with a minimum associated PAE of 35% and 5% respectively. The efficiency and power goals of this program will be realized by employing a combination of state-of-the-art (SOA) device technology, innovative circuit design, and power combining techniques. Simulations show that the power-added-efficiency (PAE) of 39% to 8.5 % in the MMIC can be achieved across the band of 65 to 71 GHz with an associated output power of 2.7 and 0.28 Watts respectively. An on-chip active low-pass network is developed to provide the 10:1 frequency-dependent power attenuation as required by the program. This high-Q, low-pass network integrated on-chip also minimizes efficiency loss by more than 4.6 percentage points as compared to using an ideal, lossless 10-dB attenuator in conjunction with the MMIC of 39% PAE. This translates into a saving of 4.6% in the total DC power consumption at 71 GHz. To realize the required SSPA power level with high efficiencies, we are proposing to use high-efficiency wave-guide circuit combining techniques. A  high-efficiency, 4-way H-tee combiner network will be exploited to realize a combining efficiencies of greater than 93%. These simulations have been experimentally verified at frequencies ranging from Q-band to W-band. The compact size and light weight of the SSPA are projected 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.0 inches and 6 oz. respectively, which make it suitable for application to CubeSat/SmallSat platforms.","The main application for NASA is absorption radar for pressure sensing. The introduction of a high efficiency power amplifier will help solve one of the “most important questions” mentioned in the decadal survey. The remote sensing measurement of pressure will drastically improve the numerical weather models.  NASA has had proposals planned based on the demonstration of this technology. Further, NASA employs satellite-based, active sensors for Earth and planetary science applications. They would benefit from this high-efficiency SSPA approach.",Applications for this high-efficiency amplifier technology abound at other government agencies for frequencies above and below V-band. These include SATCOM and radar applications for all military services. There is an initiative within the FCC to expand the unlicensed frequency spectrum in V-band (57-64 GHz) to include the 64-71 GHz band where the technology is directly applicable.

The proposed PA architecture utilizes a gallium nitride (GaN) process in order to provide high output power, efficiency and speed. The proposed PA will have 6 GHz of bandwidth around the center frequency (68GHz). The proposed amplifier will be designed using HRL’s T3 gallium nitride on silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC) process and will have an extended frequency range from 64 GHz to 72 GHz to compensate any process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation. The design will have a radiation hardness level >1Mrad and operating temperature range from -55˚C to +85˚C. Additional temperature compensation circuitry will be added to accommodate a stretch goal of –55C to 125C. To achieve an output power of greater than 10 Watt, the PA will be designed by combining the generated power of separate PA MMICs. The radiation-hard techniques provided by Alphacore Inc. ensures the correct operation of the PA for CubeSat/Small Sat platforms with high power added efficiency (PAE).

At the heart of the device is a ferrite core located at the junction of three waveguides. The magnetically biased ferrite is non-reciprocal which gives rise to the unique circulator behavior. Circulators are available with full waveguide band operation up to 40 GHz, although the isolation is generally less than 16 dB. At higher frequencies the bandwidth is severely limited by the ferrite material properties. Y-junction circulators operating between 50-90 GHz typically have bandwidths near 2 GHz and above 100 GHz the bandwidth is only 1 GHz, making them unsuitable for many systems. What is needed is an all-new approach to the problem. We propose a novel hybrid circulator comprising an orthomode transducer (OMT) and a modified Faraday rotation isolator. These two devices can be combined to form a hybrid circulator that can operate with very high isolation over nearly full rectangular waveguide bands. Circulators with this level of performance simply do not exist in the commercial market. The hybrid circulator is thus an enabling technology, offering significantly improved performance over the current state-of-the-art. At the end of the Phase I contract, we will deliver a prototype hybrid circulator covering the 150-190 GHz band to NASA. This component will find application in NASA G-band radar systems designed for future cloud, water, and precipitation missions. Micro Harmonics is uniquely qualified to carry out this research.

For nuclear instruments, the silicon photomultiplier used with scintillation crystals has shown significant advances, yet silicon is a limiting material. The bandgap of the material, which is around 1 electron volt, can lead to a high generation of dark noise, wherein any slight increase (tenths of an electron volt) in the bandgap can reduce the dark noise by an order of magnitude.  Radiation damage on a silicon photomultiplier that damages the bulk material of the silicon will result in an increase in the dark noise.  Unlike other types of silicon technologies that can be tolerant by design, the silicon photomultiplier requires a volume of silicon across a p-n junction with a controlled electric field, making it intrinsically susceptible to radiation damage. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is a preferred material for solar arrays in space as it provides the required sensitivity with a slower degradation from radiation compared to silicon. Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs) is a variant of GaAs and has preferable characteristics for UV to visible light detection. A major limiting factor to the use of AlGaAs for photodetectors has been poor material quality, yet the bandgap can be controlled to enhance optical and electrical performance. We plan to address the material quality issues in this project to develop a high-performance solid-state photomultiplier.","The development of a solid-state photomultiplier using AlGaAs will support the development of gamma-ray and neutron detectors, which are used for planetary science to understand the geochemistry. The detector is compact compared to the photomultiplier tube and operates at a lower bias. As the photomultiplier is developed from a segmentation of diodes operated in parallel, development of instruments for imaging is viable, where x-ray and gamma-ray imaging is a critical tool for astronomy.","Radiation dosimetry, Cherenkov detectors, gamma/neutron spectroscopy, medical imaging such as PET and SPECT, LIDAR, monitors for nuclear materials, and radiation detectors for oil logging are a few applications. The silicon photomultiplier is the state of the art, and the AlGaAs photodetector will supplant this technology, as the anticipated dark noise will be significantly smaller."

To meet the needs of hard X-ray astronomy a lower cost, more uniform and more readily available alternative to CZT is desirable. Thallium bromide (TlBr) has higher density and atomic number than CZT and therefore higher stopping power at hard X-ray energies. TlBr has a low melting point (460 °C, compared to ~ 1100 °C for CZT) and cubic crystal structure and can be grown from the melt by low cost techniques.

Sample area dimensions must be known for calculations of higher-order products and are unique for each probe due to manufacturing tolerances. Cloud OPC sizing performance is commonly evaluated by passing precision glass beads through an instrument’s sample area. The number and transit location of glass beads is unknown, so the method cannot be used to provide position-dependent sizing uncertainty assessments or provide measurements of sample area dimensions.

Since sun photometers only provide aerosol information during the day, even though there is scientific interest, there is very little information on aerosols at night. Innovative Imaging and Research proposes Angstrom, an affordable easily deployable multiband wide field of view (FOV) imaging star photometer that measures aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom parameter across the night sky using stars. It can be used to augment traditional sun/lunar photometer networks and significantly improve atmospheric monitoring. Angstrom applies state-of-the-art image processing techniques to imaging systems that make use of emerging high quantum efficiency, low read noise CMOS sensors and high-quality machine vision optics. Early simulations and test data suggest these types of imaging systems can acquire dim star fields at a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio to produce traditional sun/lunar photometer AOD and Angstrom parameter measurements using stars instead of the sun or moon. Imaging star photometry acquires large regions of sky and can measure near-instantaneous spatial variability not possible with traditional narrow FOV photometers. By imaging multiple stars in a portion of sky covering a wide range of air mass or by continuously imaging stars moving through varying air mass, Angstrom can take advantage of traditional Langley calibration or multi-star methods. Angstrom tracks stars though image processing, eliminating complex precision moving mechanisms. It also uses the relative positions of stars to determine its orientation simplifying upfront, installation and maintenance costs allowing it to be more easily deployed on ships, UAVs and fixed terrestrial locations where historically it has been difficult to obtain measurements.",Angstrom supports atmospheric studies by providing additional nighttime aerosol measurements to atmospheric models. It also supports Decadal Survey recommended ACCP and TEMPO satellite missions and is directly relevant to numerous field campaigns that measure and monitor aerosols.

It will provide simultaneous measurement of total NOx and NO2 concentrations (and thus NO by difference) .  It will have a physical time constant of 1 second (e-1) and provide one independent sample per second.  Its accuracy will be better than 5% and its precision less than 0.2 ppb in one second sampling.  It will utilize less than 100 W power and weigh less than 25 kilograms.  The monitor is based on Aerodyne Research’s patented CAPS (Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift) technology which is already used to produce commercial instruments for both the research and regulatory measurement communities. Nitrogen Dioxide is measured as a column density by NASA satellites.  Accurate and precise ground truth measurements must be made in order to provide proper interpretation of such data.  It is also designated as a ""Criteria Pollutant"" by the Clean Air Act of 1970.  The relationship between NO and NO2 is also an indicator of plumes originating from combustion systems such as aircraft and diesel engines  and  electric power generators.  The monitors currently used by NASA deploy an outdated technology, chemiluminescence detection of NO, which is subject to numerous chemical interferences.  Furthermore, these monitors cannot provide the fast-response sub-ppb precision required for the measurement of fast moving plumes.","Nitrogen dioxide is a “criteria pollutant” according to the Clean Air Act of 1970.  High resolution spatial and temporal measurements of NO2  will enhance the interpretation of both ground- and  space-based measurements.  This information will not only help validate satellite-based measurements, but provide more accurate source apportionment data.  Inclusion of a total NOx measurement capability (and thus NO measurements) would provide NASA with a more accurate and reliable replacement for its standard chemiluminescence-based monitors.",Aerodyne Research has already provided almost 100 CAPS-based NO2 monitors to university and government laboratories on 5 continents.  The inclusion of the total NOx channel will enhance sales of these instruments as it becomes clear that they offer a viable replacement for the  chemiluminescence-based monitors that are currently used to measure NOx and NO.

A sensor for measuring the downwelling irradiance above the sea surface will also be included. The sensors will provide data at high spectral resolution over a broad spectral range (300 - 950 nm) and will minimize the uncertainties of common approaches of free-falling profilers that generally do not provide good data close to the surface or buoy-based systems with multi-depth radiometers placed at depths of 1 m and deeper.  These uncertainties are associated with extrapolation of subsurface measurements taken at depths of ~1 m or deeper to just below the surface and are particularly significant in the red and near-infrared parts of the spectrum due to effects of inelastic radiative processes even within the homogenous water column, as well as across the entire spectral range when the near-surface water column is optically heterogenous.  By conducting simultaneous time series measurements at multiple near-surface depths, AquaFloat will also reduce errors due to variations in underwater light field associated with the effects of sea surface waves, intermittent bubble clouds, and changes in sky conditions, which can affect profiling measurements with a single radiance sensor.  The low-cost design, ease and flexibility of use of AquaFloat will offer an improved tool for routine work aimed at the development and validation of in-water ocean color algorithms. In addition, by satisfying the appropriate radiometric accuracy requirements the AquaFloat can be useful in vicarious calibration activities of current and future satellite ocean color missions.","AquaFloat supports NASA ocean color-related calibration/validation activities for universities, NASA centers, and government labs. AquaFloat is easy to deploy in deep ocean, littoral regions, estuaries, and inland water bodies. Current and future missions (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS/JPSS, PACe, HyspIRI, GEO-CAPE, OLCI/Sentinel, SGLI/GCOM, GOCI) involving ocean color measurements will benefit from AquaFloat's near-sea surface radiometry. AquaFloat benefits NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry programs supporting satellite ocean color missions.","The AquaFloat sea surface radiometer will enhance the capabilities of existing marine radiometer sensors, improving applications of satellite and airborne ocean color remote sensing. This, in turn, will provide improvements in data for countries, states, municipalities, and research institutions to assess the conditions and trends within the aquatic environments and make informed decisions."

Enhancing our ability to observe greenhouse gases with significant global warming potential and trace gases relevant to air quality is critical.Satellite trace gas observations pioneered by NASA provide information on temporal and spatial scales that is unmatched by surface observing networks, yet they cannot be calibrated to the same standards as ground-based networks. Without this comparability, the potential of satellites to detect changes and emissions of greenhouses is lost. Biases from surface albedo, aerosols and water vapor also impact these retrievals. We provide a mechanism for evaluating satellite retrievals with calibrated trace gases and aerosol measurements using the AirCore and Printed Optical Particle Spectrometer, respectively. These innovative instruments provide a powerful set of observations for over 98% of the atmosphere when incorporated into a high-altitude UAS. We directly address the SBIR Section 9, S1.08 Phase I solicitation to uniquely provide capabilities to support satellite and model validation and advancement of surface-based remote sensing and observing networks relative to current networks. We will augment and test a previously-designed platform to return high-value sensors, design a concept of operations for use in controlled airspace, and demonstrate a low-cost pathway for advancing NASA satellite validation and supplementing NASA Earth Venture suborbital mission data. This platform will also provide a means for improving weather prediction capabilities at a low cost relative to routine, commercial aircraft measurements.","Current atmospheric observing networks that are used for NASA satellite validation are limited, especially in the tropics where changes in trace gases have a profound influence on our climate.  AirCore and POPS sensor glider flights can expand atmospheric profiling capabilities worldwide;increase data throughput in under sampled areas; improve NASA satellite retrievals (OCO, GeoCARB, MLS, TES, EMIT), linking them to surface observing networks; and contextualize NASA campaigns focused on atmospheric composition and climate.","A high-altitude return vehicle will revolutionize meteorological profiling worldwide with the capability to reuse and recover high-accuracy atmospheric and environmental sensors.This low-cost capability can improve weather prediction capabilities, aviation flight path modeling, and provide a pathway for atmospheric sampling and surveying in high-risk events (volcanic, toxic or natural disasters)."

The proposed instrument will employ an integrating cavity design with high resolution spectral discrimination from 300 nm to the 750 nm for both source light and detector to mitigate the effects of scattering error and fluorescence contamination. The integrating cavity has distinct advantages over current commercial in-water spectrophotometers in having enhanced sensitivity in a compact form factor associated with a very long pathlength, while also eliminating substantial scattering errors that are the largest source of bias for the existing instrument currently on the market (SeaBird/WET Labs ac-s). While absorption spectra are a primary inversion product of ocean color remote sensing, providing a direct link to primary production, the ocean science community currently lacks an in-water sensor for algorithm development and validation with acceptable accuracy and needed spectral range. Indeed, the PACE Science Team has identified this as a key technology gap related to their mission Our objective in Phase I is to examine design tradeoffs to achieve high SNR, uniformity of light field in the cavity, and high sample throughput, while eliminating scattering and fluorescence contamination in a compact, low power embodiment. Modeling and bench top experimentation will be used to optimize light source selection, coupling to spectral dispersion elements and cavity, and configuration of the integrating sphere. Our ultimate accuracy target is 2%, consistent with state-of-the-art bench top systems. This is the accuracy required for PACE ocean biogeochemistry research and is at least an order of magnitude better than any current in-water sensor. The result of Phase I will be a thoroughly vetted design concept for a submersible absorption spectrometer for in-water and lab use to be built in Phase II.","NASA scientists and funded researchers working on ocean color algorithm development and cal/val, are currently hindered by a lack of ground truth spectral IOP data. The oceanographic community currently has no in-situ sensor for algorithm development and validation that measures absorption spectra with acceptable accuracy. As hyperspectral remote sensing becomes more widespread and given the push within NASA programs in preparation for the hyperspectral PACE, GEOCAPE, and GLIMR ocean color missions, development of this system is very timely.","Like the NASA applications, the target market for the proposed instrument is government scientists and agency-funded researchers utilizing optical measurements in ocean science, biogeochemistry, and ocean color algorithm development and cal/val.

Our approach targets identified NASA needs for improved air quality monitoring and modeling data inputs, especially from wildfires where current monitoring technologies are unable to collect timely, high resolution data due to conflicts with firefighting aircraft. Our system is capable of collecting measurements that support current air quality model validation, improve surface-based remote sensing networks, and in particular augment the NASA FIREX-AQ Airborne Science Program campaign.

We will provide highly resolved measurements of burn temperature, composition of burned material, and smoke signals above active fires. The combination of high-spatial resolution RGB and LWIR data above fires will enable research investigating the correlation between wildfires and resulting air quality. Through direct measures of burning biomass intensity, density and composition, our data will augment air quality prediction models while supporting operational real-time firefighting. Urban Sky will deliver a TRL 6 sensor/platform prototype capable of operational flight and data collection over demonstration areas. Each fully operational system is estimated to cost just a few tens of thousands of dollars, each of which is reusable and capable of covering over 3,000 sq. km per mission within just hours of deployment.","This high-altitude, broad area thermal and optical remote sensing vehicle has the potential to support and augment a variety of NASA programs and missions by providing a low-cost, rapidly deployable airborne system for capturing data in higher spatial resolution than existing platforms.","The proposed system has wide commercial and civil-government related applications.

To date, there have been several implementations of VSF instruments that capture a portion of these requirements, but none that completely capture them.  The current state of the art instrument for capturing polarized VSF utilizes a single wavelength and a scanning head to capture light intensity at angles along the beam. Therefore, we propose an innovative instrument design using approximately 180 optical fiber positions laid out in a concentric circle pointing to the small volume of water being measured. Each fiber will feed into a multichannel spectrometer (spectrograph) which can take all the spectra in a single acquisition.  This way, spectra at all scattering angles can be collected simultaneously, which greatly reduces the overall measurement time. In additional to the much faster speed, the proposed scheme also offers the following advantages over the current state of the art instrument design: 1) There will be no moving parts outside of the main instrument housing, which makes it easier to be sealed, more robust and portable;2) Instead of collecting scattered light at different points along the laser beam, the proposed design looks at the same small volume of water.3) Because the optical path lengths for all scattering angles are the same in the proposed new instrument  The overall simple and symmetric geometry (e.g. the identical optical path lengths at different angles) will make calibration easier and improve accuracy.",,

The baseline Lynx design recognizes this challenge, presently assuming that a mechanical isolation structure and a long transfer line between the cryocooler compressor and cold head will provide the necessary vibration isolation for the microcalorimeter instrument. This approach carries structural design risk and necessitates a complicated, custom, unproven cryocooler integration scheme. West Coast Solutions (WCS) and teammate Lockheed Martin Space (LM Space) propose to develop an active Cryocooler Exported Vibration Reduction System (CEVRS) for use with mechanical cryocoolers to reduce the jitter exported to the optical instrument and to simplify the cryocooler integration.

Iris is using the Lockheed Martin Space (LMS) Advanced Technology Center Mega Compressor as the target device. A number of innovative techniques to the CCE design are planned to achieve a target goal of 85% efficient production of 800 watts of cooler power. Two primary innovations are being applied to the power stages. The first is dynamic current balancing power slice architecture.

The use of these slices reduce input and output capacitor requirements and allows the use of much smaller inductors, while synchronous operation increases efficiency, reduces power losses and eases thermal requirements, simplifying high power generation. The other innovation is the use of GaN FETs in the power stages in place of MOSFETs. The GaN FETs can switch more than 10 times as fast as MOSFETs, therefore capacitor and inductors values can be further reduced by another factor of 10 making the design even more space and power efficient.

The goals of Focus Area S1.11 In Situ Instruments/Technologies and Plume Sampling Systems for Ocean Worlds Life Detection are to advance science instruments focused on the detection of life, especially extant life in the Ocean Worlds, including innovative new scientific measurements. Our proposed polarimeter with its exceptional circular polarization measurement capability has particular relevance to these goals. Circular polarization serves as a pure agnostic biosignature, symptomatic of the uniquely biological phenomenon of homochirality. S1.11 seeks “Life detection approaches optimized for evaluating and analyzing the composition of ice matrices with unknown pH and salt content. Instruments capable of detecting and identifying organic molecules (in particular biomolecules), … such as … organic analysis instruments with chiral discrimination.” Circular polarization spectroscopy is sensitive to any chiral structures, including those of amino acids, proteins and more, without specificity, hence provides a truly generic, agnostic life detection capacity. The instrument’s optimal response to circular polarization leads to mission relevant sensitivity for life detection. Dissolved salts and pH level have no influence. The polarimeter simultaneously and independently measures circular and linear polarization hence offering a powerful tool for the characterization of surfaces and particles with implications for habitability.","In situ life detection capability relevant to Ocean Worlds missions such as the Europa Lander In situ life detection for Ocean World plume fly-through samples, in particular Enceladus and Europa Remote sensing for life detection, habitability and physical characterization in solar system exploration in general.","Versatility and low cost provides opportunity in the private space sector.

The core of FAUVE is a novel DUV-VIS objective, capable of producing sharp images at high magnification with very little chromatic aberration using only materials that are radiation-hard (exceeding 300 krad). Additionally, FAUVE will feature a new microfluidic cartridge platform which will enable the rapid mounting of samples for microscopic viewing.

Our innovation, Pulsed Waveguide Latency Spectral Receptor, PWLSR, leverages such tethered approaches to ice penetration. Adding a single dispersive optical fiber cable, PWLSR turns the tether into a spectrometer that obtains time-correlated in-situ spectroscopy information aboard Europa iceprobes. PWLSR is a cost-effective way to enhance the science return of subsurface Europa missions: it adds just 2 kg and 2,000 cc to the iceprobe and a 0.2 mm fiber cable to the tether, and returns compositional information of the subsurface as the iceprobe advances through the ice. PWLSR focuses laser light into the the ice, collects scattered and re-emitted photons, and launches them into a dispersive optical fiber integrated into the tether connecting iceprobe and lander. The fiber is terminated in a retroflector at the surface end of the tether which reflects light back into the fiber. Photons return to the iceprobe, where they are routed into a detector and analyzed. Results are compressed and transmitted to lander using tethered and/or free-space communication system.  PWLSR fiber cable can be split into several segments, linked by fiber-optic connectors. This way, it can be housed into several spool bays that can be sequentially left behind in the ice once a spool is depleted. PWLSR combines, for the first time, deep subsurface access and laser spectroscopy to build a scientific instrument that addresses scientific objectives of future landed science missions to Ocean Worlds, particularly Europa.  Developing PWLSR is a key, risk-reducing effort that paves the way for maturation of the instrument towards flight while also stimulating technological innovation both for commercial and federal use beyond planetary exploration.","PWLSR enables NASA's search for life by providing new sensing capabilities to Europa ice penetration platforms currently under development (e.g. SLUSH, Cryobot), which require instruments to be housed inside them.  PWLSR has potential to become a critical new instrument in NASA’s effort to detect evidence of life, especially extant life, in the ocean worlds of the outer solar system by providing in-situ analysis of subsurface ice and, if integrated with an ocean explorer, subsurface liquid water bodies as well.","The technology is directly applicable to deep ocean research (packed into ROV to perform laser spectroscopic sensing), resource exploration and development industries (in-situ downhole fluid analysis for the exploration and development of oil and gas and subsurface materials during exploration drilling in mining), and scientific end environmental drilling (environmental evaluation or remediation)."

The OSIRIS design solution will include a gimballed platform for sensor stabilization. The proposed OSIRIS instrument design is novel as ionospheric imaging from the ocean platform has not been demonstrated. We will leverage our unique experiences operating instruments on buoys to develop a flexible and modular design of OSIRIS so that it could be integrated with different types of buoys without changing the underlying architecture. The proposed study of OSIRIS is a first step toward enabling the proliferation of ionospheric measurements from the ocean surface. It is anticipated that the design solution developed here for ocean buoys could lead to miniaturization of OSIRIS for future CubeSat missions. The development of this new class of observing capability will be a pathfinder for future persistent ionospheric measurements from the ocean surface. This effort addresses a critical gap in our current observational capability from the ocean surface.","We expect that the data from OSIRIS instruments when realized in its fullest will provide complementary data to the NASA GOLD and ICON missions.

The coatings will be applied to polyimide membrane surfaces such as KaptonTM or CP1TM and will be designed to produce very dark and  specular surfaces. The coatings may also be applied directly to rigid substrates such as light baffles. Low reflectance surfaces are needed for starshades to reduce stray light from entering the telescope from earthshine, moonshine, near-planets, and background stars and galaxies.  A specular membrane will ensure only a small solid angle of light coming from directly behind the telescope can produce stray light. A specular coating will also prevent the reflectance phenomenon known as the ""opposition effect"", which causes an observed brightening in the retro-direction from coherent backscater off a rough surface. Existing blackening processes such as carbon nanotubes, copper oxides, carbon-filled KaptonTM, and others, result in rough surfaces that reflect and scatter significant energy.  Many of these three-dimensional surfaces are easily damaged by abrasion (creating particulate contamination), degrade in humidity during ground storage, degrade in the high radiation environments of space, or in the case of black-KaptonTM, are significantly reflective and relatively heavy.  In this SBIR, we will demonstrate the feasibility of creating new materials and processes that alleviate these deficiencies.

As the sizes of optics increase to accommodate ever-present inherent resolution limitations, these structures continue to grow with the expectation of similar or better overall thermal stability. These requirements spurred the development and maturation of low-CTE carbon fiber tube structures. While production of the carbon fiber tubes themselves is well developed to produce lightweight, low CTE structures, the components that attach these tubes are still heavy and expensive to produce. Mantis Composites proposes a solution to this problem utilizing in-house-developed continuous 5-axis carbon fiber 3D printers. The 3D printing capability this provides allows for 3-dimensional fiber paths that can enable the low-CTE benefits of carbon fiber composites while retaining the intricacy capabilities of machined metals.

This scope of work brought the effective TRL for this application of our manufacturing process to 3. The goal of this proposal is to utilize this same three-prong connector demonstration component to mature and develop applications specifically targeting low-CTE needs for applications such as optical benches and metering structures. During this Phase I, we will: validate, test, and modify existing bonding methods; validate predicted low-CTE results at a coupon level; adapt our three-prong connector design for low CTE filament by tuning processing parameters and fiber paths; and finally produce and mechanically test a full-scale tube and connector mock-up.","While IR-band imaging systems (identified in the solicitation) are perhaps the most valuable application of the proposed capabilities, the component volumes are small.

For test optics with large surface errors, a reference optic and/or a custom computer-generated hologram (CGH) can be used to bring the errors within the interferometer’s range. However, many situations result in large departures from reference optics. Thermal & gravity sag effects in large optics can cause significant deviations, only some of which may be predictable. Test optics in semiconductor manufacturing may include sharp, irregular steps of many waves. In the early stages of optics polishing, departures from reference can be extreme. Custom optics, including asphere and freeform, can deviate hugely from spherical, and for these a custom CGH (with a typical lead time of 6 months and cost of $10k) is not always economical.

Many of the mirror deficiencies, such as areal density, surface figure error, stiffness, and surface figure changes over temperature, can be traced – either directly or indirectly – to mirror lightweighting.  Current lightweighting processes result in pockets in the rear-side of the mirror that have abrupt stress-concentrating corners, poor front-rear symmetry, and poor material allocation in the webbing.  The proposed laser machining process allows for the fabrication of cavities within a mirror that preserves front-rear symmetry, has no corners, and has a near ideal allocation of material within the webbing. The novel laser machining process utilizes a CO2 laser in an ablation regimen in which the focused beam strikes below the surface of the workpiece from the side (as opposed to the front or rear as is commonly done).  Material between the focused beam and the surface is ejected by the shockwave produced by the laser’s pulse, greatly increasing the amount of material removed for each pulse.  Further, the focused laser beam can be split in two and laterally separated; when pulsed the shockwave – and material removal – can bridge the gap between the focal spots and increase the removal rate further.

Proof of feasibility projects that could reduce cost and lead time for manufacture of non-rotationally symmetric shapes such as freeforms, large off axis parabolas, or other light-weighted (LW) telescope designs are of great interest. Unfortunately, differences in substrate flexure leave LW quilting errors during generation and polishing steps while tooling moves across supported and unsupported structures of the optic’s LW pocketing. In addition, post subaperture polishing (SAP) can create additional mid-spatial frequency (MSF) errors. Combined, these errors affect the point spread function of the optic and subsequently degrade the overall performance of the entire system. The Pocket Protector strategy aims to prove feasibility of disrupting the current manufacturing state in two areas: First, it will utilize a six-axis robot to smooth MSF errors on optical components at the post generation step, to reduce the amount of SAP required to remove underlying damage. The Pocket Protector will selectively account for differences in substrate flexure due to underlying pockets to prevent quilting during this step. Second, we propose adding the selective force process to the SAP/smoothing cycle for enhanced final results. The project aims to allow quicker turn-around of high precision, LW optics with reduced MSF and quilting errors, beginning their eradication earlier in the manufacturing sequence and applying the strategy to other required steps.","The fabrication techniques that could be scaled up from the feasibility studies of the Pocket Protector strategy could help reduce cost and lead time for many projects impacted by MSF errors, but specifically those utilizing light-weighted backing technology, such as the LUVOIR Ultraviolet Multi Object Spectrograph, or components that may not be viable options for post-polishing light-weighting due to material considerations.","There is a need for improved performance and lead time for LW optics in the field of high energy laser optics, such as fast steering high power lasers.

The main components of a temperature control loop are spatially distributed temperature heaters, controllers, and spatially distributed temperature sensors (thermistors or thermocouples). Traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control approaches do not achieve optimal system performance when there are significant delays between the control inputs or disturbances and observed state variables, and when the system is of higher order. PID controllers often cannot achieve optimal energy consumption, as well as high control performance and accuracy. Besides these challenges, optimal tuning of PID controllers for systems with many inputs and outputs (such as the thermal control system for space telescopes) is a highly nontrivial and still active research problem.

These lumped model representations may be too simplistic to produce accurate results and do not include the coupling between the absorbed external flux and the system dynamics. System identification (SID) uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data.  It is the basis for modern data-driven control systems, in which concepts of system identification are integrated into the controller design laying the foundations for formal controller optimality proofs.

These include the Large UV/Optical (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet (HabEx) Missions. A potential exoplanet mission requires total telescope wavefront stability on order of 10 pico-meters RMS per 10 minutes. Our active thermal control using system identification (ATC-SID) is clearly an enabling technology for upcoming NASA large space telescope missions.","According to the ""Photolithography Market 2019 Global Industry Analysis to 2025"" research report published by Market Research Future, the global photolithography market is projected to grow at 4.26% annual rate and reach USD 7.34 billion during 2019 to 2025.

(ACT) proposes to develop a novel “dark” photovoltaic cell technology that can generate electricity when there is no sunlight.  The proposed “dark” PV technology exploits the thermo-radiative (TR) cell, which is also made of semiconductor p-n junctions and can be viewed as a reversed PV cell, as a new way to efficiently convert heat to electricity when radiatively coupled to a low temperature heat sink. In a previous NASA sponsored program, ACT has successfully demonstrated the proof-of-concept by using commercial narrow-gap semiconductor p-n junctions as thermo-radiative cells to generate electrical power. These results strongly suggested that thermo-radiative cells can be used as a “dark” photovoltaic technology to generate electrical power when the cells face the extremely cold deep space. For example, we could use it to generate electricity during lunar night by utilizing the waste heat from the radiator. We could also use it as an alternative high temperature photovoltaic technology for near-Sun missions that the backside of the cells faces the sun to absorb the solar-thermal energy and the frontside of the cells faces to the dark space. Our modeling results showed that thermo-radiative cells can have a power density up to 1200 W/m^2 when the cell temperature is about 700 K, with an efficiency around 30-40%. To increase the maturity of this technology, ACT, in collaboration with University of Michigan, plans to develop a customized thermo-radiative cell with an area orders of magnitude larger than commercial narrow-gap semiconductor p-n junctions. ACT has a strong R&D team in place to perform the proposed work and a long history of supplying advanced thermal systems for flight applications. The team at UM has a long history working with narrow-gap semiconductor materials, including growth, fabrication and characterization.","The immediate NASA application is to generate electrical power during the lunar night using the waste heat from the radiators of lunar lander. Another potential application is to use TR cell as an alternative technology for high-temperature solar cell, which could be helpful for near-Sun missions (e.g., near Mercury orbit), since the performance of TR cell increases rapidly with temperature. In addition, this technology is well-aligned with NASA Space Power and Energy Storage Roadmap.","Additional night time power can be provided by integrating TR cells to the back of residential solar panels. The solar cell side faces up in the daytime. After sunset, the panels flip to allow the TR cell side face up. Unlike the traditional PV panel which can only generate electricity in the daytime, this new system can generate electricity for residential use throughout the day and night."

Conventional solar cells for space use specialized coverglass that provides essential environmental protection from high-energy particle and ultraviolet solar radiation but is expensive to apply and has high fragility. Next-generation coverglass replacement materials have been explored by several groups over the past decade. Pseudomorphic glass (PMG) uses glass microbeads embeded in a silicone matrix that can be formed into sheets or sprayed on interconnected modules. Pure silicone sheets using space-grade DC 93-500 have also been investigated for module-level protection. Both approaches have the additional benefit of high flexibility that is synergistic with thin-film, inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) solar cells manufactured by MicroLink Devices, enabling a pathway to truly flexible solar modules. The central innovation in this proposal is to introduce a novel, prismatic texturing method that will improve the performance and manufacturability of silicone-based encapsulations including PMG. Texturing of glass encapsulants has previously been explored for enhancing high-angle light capture for terrestrial solar arrays, but prismatic structuring of space coverglass has not been widely investigated. Polymer materials are much more readily formed into prismatic shapes, which presents a new opportunity to introduce this important technique. In this Phase I program MicroLink will demonstrate that prismatic structures not only increase the high-angle collection efficiency of space solar cells by up to 30%, but also reduce the operating temperature by as much as 3 degrees. Equally important, the surface texturing is expected to substantially simplify the design and robustness of essential UV protective coating layers deposited over the encapsulation.",,

In those machines, the phase angle and amplitude ratio between the displacer and piston are independently adjusted with forces provided by springs and drive rods. Therefore, piston and displacer amplitudes tend to remain proportional, and instability takes the form of both components over-stroking or under-stroking together. Essentially this amounts to a single degree of freedom vibrational system, which is relatively straight forward to control. However, for our double-acting convertor, the amplitudes and relative phases of adjacent pistons are not locked together. Instead, the behavior of every piston also influences its neighbors. There are multiple degrees of freedom, requiring increased control strategy sophistication. Pistons cannot be controlled independently but rather must all be controlled simultaneously. A new class of controller is needed. In addition to supporting possible future NASA radioisotope power system (RPS) missions, a new controller that addresses the unique requirements of our double-acting multi-module convertor would also have immediate benefits for the continued development of Stirling machines similar to ours in the laboratory. The controller would improve both hardware safety and the repeatability of test conditions – leading to increased data quality and confidence in test results. Under this Phase I project, our team’s core strengths for modeling the device thermodynamics, interdependent dynamics of multiple double-acting pistons, and linear alternators will be applied to create a new end-to-end system model. The system model will be used to evaluate the performance and stability of the preliminary controller design.

Dynamic power conversion systems designed for long duration deep space missions, require stable and reliable ACUs to precisely control the function of the energy conversion system and provide DC power to the spacecraft.  MLCs have poor capacitance stability with temperature, voltage and time on voltage.   This development proposes to design, produce and evaluate energy buffer capacitors using Nanolam capacitors, developed for use in inverters of hybrid and electric vehicles.  Nanolam capacitors comprise 10,000s of high temperature radiation cured polymers that have superior capacitance and dissipation factor stability in the temperature range of -196oC to +200oC.  Nanolam capacitors are self-healing, prismatic in shape and they are radiation tolerant.  One unique feature of the Nanolam capacitor technology is the use of submicron polymer dielectric layers.  It has been demonstrated that as the thickness of the cross-linked amorphous dielectrics decreases below about 1.0mm, the breakdown strength increases significantly, which results in capacitors with superior energy density.   Internal series sections allow Nanolam capacitors with dielectric thicknesses of few hundred nanometers to service applications with voltages as high as 10,000V. The proposed development will produce and evaluate energy buffer Nanolam capacitors with a rating of 1200mF/175VDC for an 120V power bus.  A single Nanolam capacitor will be used to replace at least ten individual MLC parts, mounted on a PCB to make up the 1200mF.  The major project objective is to demonstrate superior capacitance stability, energy density and specific energy to MLCs as well as deliver parts to the NASA technical personnel for independent evaluation.","Radioisotope dynamic power conversion systems controllers, as well as roll-out photovoltaic array controllers used to power Hall thrusters, are tailored mostly to 120V and there is some ongoing development with 300V systems.  Nanolam capacitors can replace multilayer ceramic capacitors in multiple circuits of a single controller.  Potential circuit applications include power factor correction in a rectifier circuit, energy buffer in an AC/DC inverter and DC-link in a DC/DC inverter.","Developing lower voltage capacitors will greatly expand the Nanolam market size and application space.

In this project, Ultramet will design, fabricate, and test compact heat exchangers based on open-cell graphite foams with extremely low pressure drops. With foam-based heat exchangers, the ligaments comprising the foam are the extended surface used for heat transfer. Because of their high volumetric surface area, foam-based exchangers can be far more efficient than a fin-based heat exchanger. The foams to be used in this project, which are fabricated by chemical vapor deposition, have very low pressure drops and have demonstrated heat transfer coefficients that are 3.4 times greater than those of wavy aluminum fins. The technology is cycle-agnostic and can be used in Stirling, Brayton, and/or Rankine cycles. The high efficiency of these heat exchangers will allow them to be much smaller and weigh considerably less than a conventional heat exchanger, which will significantly reduce the overall mission cost.","NASA applications for compact foam-based heat exchangers include not only Brayton, Stirling, and Rankine cycle heat engines, but also environmental control on crewed spacecraft, heat sinks for electronics, evaporators in heat pipes, cryogenic fluid management systems, regeneratively cooled rocket engines, heaters for nuclear-thermal propulsion systems, and many more.

For example, Mars and small body surface mission concepts which include robotic landers, rovers, and aerial vehicles, require rechargeable batteries capable of operating down to   -40°C conditions. State-of-the-art (SOA) lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been adapted to improve low temperature operation, but their performance is still severely limited at temperatures below -20°C. In addition, the gravimetric energy density of SOA LIB cells qualified for NASA missions is low (~100-150 Wh/kg), with this value further reduced by 20-50% at the battery pack level. Battery performance at low temperature is limited by a reduction in Li-ion conductivity of the liquid electrolyte and an increase in Li-ion transport resistance through the solid electrolyte interface and the electrode/electrolyte interface. In Phase I, Giner, Inc., will develop customized electrolytes that enables reliable and efficient operation of high energy density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries at low temperature conditions down to -40°C. The Li-S battery is one of the most promising technologies for future NASA missions because of its high theoretical gravimetric energy density of 2500 Wh/kg, which is up to 5 times higher than the theoretical value of SOA commercial LIB cells. A successfully developed Li-S battery capable of low temperature operation would offer a significant performance advantage over current SOA lithium-ion batteries in NASA mission applications.","The technology will enable use of a high energy density Li-S battery that can operate at low temperatures down to -40°C for various NASA programs including robotic landers, rovers, aerial vehicles for exploring Mars, the Moon, and the outer planets. Other NASA applications include batteries for extravehicular activities (e.g., power for life support, communications, power tools, glove heaters, lights and other devices), satellites and electrified vehicle propulsion (EAP) (e.g., power for urban air mobility, thin haul and short haul aircraft).","This technology will enable commercialization of high energy density and low temperature tolerant Li-S batteries for electric vehicles, unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles, military aircraft and satellites, large-scale grid energy storage, and consumer electronics."

Magnetic levitation offers several advantages over classic ball bearings, such as the elimination of wear and friction, elimination of lubricant, longer life expectancy and lower generated micro-vibration noise. All these features would be crucial for the design of future missions for the exploration of our solar system. The proposed technology aims at overcoming some of the fundamental drawbacks that have considerably limited the use of magnetic bearings in space missions, such as the need to operate at cryogenic temperatures (if superconducting materials are used for the levitation) or the high power consumption (for active magnetic bearings). The proposed semi-active technology would be capable of generating stable magnetic levitation at room temperature and with low power consumption. Moreover, the electronic board does not require either sensors or a control algorithm to operate, thus considerably simplifying its integration on a spacecraft. This project will be carried out with Adcole Maryland Aerospace Inc. and the objectives of the Phase I will be to prove both analytically and experimentally the ability of generating a stable levitating force on the rotor along 3 degrees of freedom, while showing enhanced isolating capabilities. The latter feature is a further improvement of the state of the art since having a critically damped system would mean that all the rotor natural modes are highly attenuated as well as the rotor imbalance disturbance. Phase II will develop the full 5-DoF magnetically levitated reaction wheel.","The proposed technology will be crucial for NASA future missions requiring stability accuracy of less than 1 milli-arcsec, such as observation missions (e.g. HabEx and LUVOIR) or laser communication missions (e.g. DSOC flight demonstration by JPL). A low-power levitating technology could also enable the development of new flywheels for energy storage and continue the work on G2 flywheel by NASA GRC. These flywheels have the potential to substitute electric batteries and increase the life of a spacecraft dramatically.","Magnetic wheels could allow DoD imaging satellites to achieve spatial resolution below 1.5ft. With the enhancement in laser comm precision, a GEO laser relay system (like ESA EDRS) would help EPA and NOAA to accelerate responses in emergencies by instantly connecting LEO satellites and ground stations. Magnetic wheels would enable corporations to implement laser-based internet satellite networks."

XFORGE enables significant Size, Weight and Power, Cost, and Performance (SwaP-CP) improvements over current state-of-the-art Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) GNC calculations by generating equivalent formulations that have no numerical errors or instabilities. Within XFORGE, these formulations can be implemented in flight-like hardware and assessed so that implementations that require excessive computer resources, are too sensitive to environmental factors, are susceptible to Cyber-attack etc., are eliminated. Finally, fault tolerance technology is applied across the formulations to provide an expedient, stable, robust implementation of required GNC calculations. XFORGE differs from COTS GNC calculations which use standard primitives (e.g. square root, sine, exponential) to implement trigonometric and algebraic equations. These standard primitives use iterative algorithms that loop through successively better estimates until the required accuracy is obtained (e.g. the “Newton-Raphson Method”). This method is fragile to implementation methodologies such as mixing single precision and double precision variables within the same calculation. Also, the amount of time needed to complete COTS GNC calculations varies depending on the values of the inputs, and sometimes the inputs can completely disrupt flight computer operations.

In the GRS, a storable liquid such as ammonia is carried aboard the balloon mission gondola and used to replace helium that leaks from a SPB. The ammonia can be used directly as a helium replacement gas, or it can be dissociated into a very low molecular weight nitrogen/hydrogen mix. In either case, the balloon remains fully inflated, and remains floating at nearly constant altitude. The advantage of using a storable liquid in this way, rather than as ballast, is that consumable mass is greatly reduced, being cut by a factor of 1.7 in the simple (S) non-dissociation system and 3.4 in the (D) dissociation system. Moreover, in a ballast system the floating mass of the balloon changes by the sum of the ballast and the leaked helium, whereas in the GRS the only the leaked helium is lost. Thus the floating mass of the system remains almost constant, with near constant cruise altitude being maintained as a result, Indeed, using the CRS the altitude excursion for compensating for a given amount of helium leakage being reduced by a factor of 8 compared to a ballast-dropping alternative. The GRS is a simple low-mass system requiring very low power. In the proposed program, the potential performance of the GRS will be analyzed, design options compared, designs developed and built for both S and D type units, and the concept validated by means of lab tests of GRS prototypes.","The primary purpose of the GRS is to enable SPB systems that can fly or long durations in the Earth’s stratosphere at near constant altitude, without need to drop ballast or provide replacement gas. By lengthening the duration of such missions, the science return and overall cost-effectiveness of the program can be multiplied accordingly. Such a system could also be used with extraordinary advantage to study Venus or Mars, not only by sounding its atmosphere, but by carrying remote sensing look-down instruments such as ground penetrating radar.","There are many commercial applications possible for GRS technology derived systems. SPBs are much cheaper than satellites, and flying at altitudes approaching 40 km, could enable remote sensing, cell phone, internet, and other forms of communications coverage over vast regions of the Earth, including Africa, Asia, and the world's oceans."

MC-ACB’s unique planar fabrication protocol is highly conducive to incorporation of the aforementioned extreme temperature structural and gas barrier constituents. MC-ACB is a robust, continuously super-pressurized, rapid altitude control aerobot. Ascent and descent are initiated and maintained by modulation of the balloon’s lifting gas density through motorized mechanical compression. As the aerobot ascends and descends in accordance with its programmed trajectory, the balloon’s accordion-like segmented envelope leaves the lifting gas volume free to adapt to the variation in atmospheric density associated with the varying altitude. The number of balloon segments can be adapted to the desired altitude range: A larger number of segments presents a greater ratio of distended to compressed volume, which in turn provides controlled access to the great range of trajectory altitudes sought by NASA.","Particularly in light of global warming, the MC-ACB’s rapid, accurate mobility provides an ideal Earth-observational platform for surface and atmosphere, as well as for biological systems. The technology could also prove enabling in development of stratospheric balloon-borne observation systems such as suborbital telescopes.

Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are a commonly utilized device for spacecraft due to high efficiency and flexibility (ability to integrate with deployable radiator, thermal control valve, etc.).  However, they are currently too costly to manufacture to make them viable for most cost-sensitive applications such as CubeSats and SmallSats.  Conventional loop heat pipe manufacturing method involves multiple labor-intensive steps including a knife edge seal process to ensure no back leak of vapor that affects the thermal transport capability.  Unfortunately, the steps to manufacture the wick, insert it in the LHP evaporator, and seal with a knife edge results in very high manufacturing costs.  Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) has developed a low-cost LHP evaporator using a technique called Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), otherwise known as 3D printing.  With the capability of building a porous wick structure together with a solid wall via additive manufacturing, 3D printed LHP eliminates the knife edge seal as well as many wick manufacturing and testing steps.  The 3D printed LHP reduces the fabrication cost by an order of magnitude, which enables the use of LHPs in many emerging space applications, including CubeSats and SmallSats. While the developed 3D printed loop heat pipe shows significant cost benefit compared to the loop heat pipe made by conventional fabrication process, the pore size of 3D printed primary is around 5~7 μm, much larger than the 1 μm pore size made by sintering process.  In addition, the porosity of the 3D printed primary wick is lower than sintering wick (31% vs. > 40%).  In order to apply this emerging technology to higher power, large satellite applications, which are the current main loop heat pipe market, further pore size reductions and increased porosity are needed.","NASA is interested in using loop heat pipes for various applications, including SamllSat, CubeSat, Large Satellite, as well as Lunar Rovers and Landers. The proposed technology provides a low cost manufacturing method for loop heat pipe, which addresses the main drawback (high cost) of this technology.  In addition, by eliminating the knife edge seal, the 3D printed loop heat pipe can be more robust.","In addition to NASA, DOD have similar demands for the space thermal control and can benefit from the developed low-cost 3D printed loop heat pipe technology.  More important, there are an increasing number of cost-sensitive commercial satellites, including satellite swarms.

This payload must survive the large temperature swings of the lunar diurnal cycle and the challenging lunar thermal environment. This lunar environment poses significant difficulties to small, low power (≤100W) payloads, rovers, and landers required for lunar science, especially in the absence of perpetual power supplies, while still demanding operability for many lunar cycles in the extreme lunar environment. To achieve these goals, ThermAvant Technologies, LLC proposes developing a system of interconnected Oscillating Heat Pipes (OHPs) to enable an enhanced thermal wadi. Essentially, the lunar wadi concept is to create a thermal mass by solidifying loose lunar regolith and configuring this mass such that it can be heated during the lunar day and can provide sufficient heat during the lunar night to maintain lunar rovers and other payload equipment above their minimum survival temperatures. An OHP-enhanced thermal wadi is envisioned that takes advantage of completely burying the thermal mass in lunar regolith and using OHPs to capture and transport the heat for storage (Hot Sink), for rover warming (Parking Plate), and, independently, for power generation (Heat Engine). The OHP-based Hot Sink will provide unique features not found in a state-of-the-art thermal wadi by demonstrating OHPs functioning as variable conductance devices integrated as thermal switches, variable heat flux acquisition and heat load capability depending on temperature demands, application-specific working fluids capable of operating over the extreme lunar temperature conditions, improved effective thermal conductivity, structural body form factor for improved thermal resistance with reduced mass, and gravity independent performance.","NASA's Thermal Control Systems project resides within 2020 NASA Technology Taxonomy TX14: Thermal Management Systems.

To compel the vapor to vent into the vapor line to be transported to the condenser for heat rejection and not to percolate into the wick core, a liquid-vapor (LV) “seal” is established.  A knife-edge seal is formed by using a hydraulic press to “incision” join a tube with sharp edges into the primary wick.  It requires tedious manufacturing steps driving up the hardware cost.  The knife edge introduces hidden micro-cracks in the primary wick, which cannot be detected if the cracks do not propagate all the way through the wick.  The wick may produce a satisfactory pressure head initially but, when exposed to an excessive shock/vibration environment or recurring thermal cycling, the micro-cracks become larger and progressively advance all the way to the core.  To make matters worse, the cost of LHP manufacturing has risen significantly, mainly because of the intricate design and “hand-made” fabrication/assembly process of the wick structure inside the evaporator/reservoir.  The wick sintering, machining, insertion into the metal casing, and forming the knife-edge seal require expensive specialized tooling with tight tolerances and highly-skilled technicians many hours to carry out, contributing to the overall LHP price tag.  However, the consistency/reproducibility of identical design LHPs in terms of performance have always been at issue with the users.  TTH Research proposes to modify the existing LHP design and manufacturing process to (i) do away with the knife-edge L-V seal, (ii) simplify/modify the evaporator design to reduce the amount of tight-tolerance machining of the wicks and casing, and (iii) automate the wick fabrication and insertion methods for consistent quality assurance.","As the thermal requirements continues to increase at a fast rate due to advances in space electronics.  Every NASA satellite and spacecraft in the future needs high-performance heat transports like the LHPs.  Room-temperature TCS would welcome, in earnest, the proposed construction method to manufacture less costly LHPs.  Nevertheless, thermal management in other temperature ranges such as cryogenic cooling for IR instruments is also benefited from the reduction in the overall LHP price tag.","The high cost of LHPs is driven by unnecessarily complicated fabrication of the evaporator.  Thermal engineers often opt for less capable thermal devices.  The terrestrial usage of the technology is nearly non-existent despite the many operational benefits of LHPs.  Buy significantly reducing the LHP fabrication cost, the technology is expected to take off in the commercial electronic devices."

RISC-V is an industry standard, open source architecture where the Government have full source code access and significant influence on its architecture and directions.

(""Motiv"") is proposing a new design for a contamination tolerant tool-changer for use on lunar and other off-Earth missions that employ a robotic arm with a modest complexity end-effector payload (i.e., not an MSL-class payload). Past missions such as Phoenix and InSight are examples of missions with robotic arms that in retrospect could accommodate such a tool-changer. Future missions with a similar class of robotic arms include the lunar COLDArm, a Technology Payload for the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) suite of mission opportunities, and exploratory missions to the surfaces of the Ocean Worlds, comets, and asteroids. For these missions, a tool-changer would enable the robotic arm to perform a more complicated suite of activities such as scooping, gripping, grinding, and debris removal, all using separate tools that are swapped onto the arm as needed. This SBIR addresses a major problem with tool-changing mechanism designs in general, in that they are comprised of mechanical and electrical coupling elements that are sensitive to contamination. Contamination can result in failure to couple or jamming upon release, along with intermittent or broken electrical continuity. Because robotic arm end-effectors are likely to interact with the surface (and subsurface) of the Moon, Mars, or other planetary bodies, contamination problems are inevitable, the Moon in particular because the regolith particles are small, sharp, and prone to attachment because of the Moon's static electricity buildup. Motiv's tool-changer design will allow contamination to collect on mechanical and electrical coupling features and surfaces, but not preclude normal functioning of the tool-changer beyond some loss of positional repeatability when the various tools are exchanged. Electrical functionality will be preserved via self-cleaning of the electrical contacts during the tool exchange cycles","Potential applications for the contamination tolerant tool changer are missions with in-situ robotic arm activities in which the arm requires end-effector tools or instrumentation of modest complexity, particularly regarding electrical signal count. These missions would benefit from the additional flexibility that exchangeable tools offers. The contamination tolerance of the design would allow for its use on the Moon, Mars, the Ocean Worlds, comets, and asteroids, all of which are known to have environments rich in contaminating particulates.","A contamination tolerant tool-changer would be a useful part of terrestrial robotic arm systems, particularly those incorporated into mobile robotic platforms that perform hazardous duties or serve in hazardous environments. Tool exchange flexibility and worn or malfunctioning tool replacement would mitigate the time needed for human interaction, expanding uninterrupted service time"

While these moons outwardly present an icy surface, scientists believe tidal activity driven by their respective host planets may drive thermal activity beneath, sustaining warm bodies of water that could potentially provide conditions favorable for life. Robotic penetration technologies are needed to drive through the ice layer, enabling access to subsurface oceans for exploration. A leading approach to drilling surface ice for remote space missions involves use of a robotic melt‑probe that would use residual heat from its radioisotope source to supply a warm water jet to accelerate the descent. A critical need for this type of system is a water jet pump that can operate in the extreme inhospitable environment of a deep subsurface ice, while reliably delivering melted ice to the jet nozzle for a long endurance, persistent drilling activity. To meet this need, Creare proposes to develop a robust, miniature, high speed water jet pump, designed for very long service life with limited sensitivity to inlet debris present in the ice‑melt. The proposed pump directly enables needs requested by NASA 2020 Topic S4.02: Ice penetration technologies reaching more than 1 km in depth and enabling access to subsurface oceans.","Creare’s water jet pump is designed specifically with NASA’s needs in mind, in particular to enable deep ice drilling that will facilitate exploration of subsurface oceans thought to be present on Europa and Enceladus.

The variables which will affect the result are the carrier gas temperature, the impact velocity on the substrate and the ratio of WS2 to metal. Three different metals are being explored to increase chances of success. Harder, higher melting point metals like Ti64 are more challenging for the Cold Spray technique, but if successful, could be extremely useful because of the extensive use of Ti64 on spacecraft. Al2024 is less hard with a lower melting point, and so is more likely to work, and also has some application on spacecraft. Using copper will ensure success of the technique, and its hardness is greater than that of WS2 alone. In addition, all three will be evaluated as to the best coating for stainless steel surfaces like 440C. In addition to friction and wear in sliding contact, abrasion testing will be conducted to evaluate which of the three composite coatings are more resistant to the potentially hard abrasive materials to be encountered on planet surfaces. We expect greatly increased durability over other Dry Film Lubricants because wear of the composites will result in burnishing a thin, pure, low friction film of WS2 on top of the hard, wear resistant substrate. This proposed metal/WS2 coating will create self-lubricating parts that with continued sliding contact will continually create a thin low friction layer on the surface. At the end of this Phase I program, we anticipate having successfully grown various compositions of each of the three composite types on test samples, and evaluated their friction and wear properties using pin-on-disk testing in an inert atmosphere (to model space and planet environments). Abrasion testing will be done to evaluate the coatings’ resistance to harsh particulate-filled environments.

NASA Glenn Research Center’s JFET-R technology is the only one that has shown 1000’s of hours operation under Venus surface conditions. Due to the extreme environment found on the surface of Venus, access to reliable passive components such as resistors and capacitors to accompany JFET-R chipsets are minimal to not available. Furthermore, this has restricted design exploration into mixed signal application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) due to there dependency on off chip passive components. Ozark IC has identified additive manufacturing capabilities that would enable custom tunable resistors to accompany JFET-R analog to digital converters. The objective for this proposal is an all JFET-R based analog to digital converter with supporting passive components in a single integrated package. The project will utilize additive manufacturing techniques to create high-temperature single layer printed resistors in several different conductors. Furthermore, high-temperatures capacitors will be integrated onto the same substrate as the printed resistors. This, in combination with NASA’s JFET-R technology will create a design technology which will be used to develop a analog to digital sensor node. These advancements in passive component integration should allow a library of mixed signal designs to be utilized. Once resistor materials have been selected, resistor test structures will be printed in all pastes.

Today overwhelmingly almost all video cameras are based on silicon charge coupled devices (CCDs); however CCDs are not suited for and not capable of functioning at high/extreme temperature environments such as surface and atmosphere of Venus. Vidicons and similar types of imaging vacuum tubes such as Plumbicons were used for decades as the primary source of video cameras and in broadcast (e.g., television) in the 1990s and even for space-based missions and medical applications.

These electronics stop operating properly at temperatures above 175C due to high off-state junction leakages. Silicon-on-insulator variants of this technology push this limit further to roughly 250C; however, Venus surface exploration systems, gas giant probes, and solar orbiters require electronics that can operate above these temperature values. Wide bandgap semiconductor technologies naturally offer a possibility of proper electrical operation in the high temperature range. This is due to their relatively low background carrier concentration levels not overwhelming the intentional dopant levels, and thus rendering electrical junctions intact at high temperatures.

Towards that goal, and in an effort to demonstrate the importance, feasibility and usability of the proposed framework, the Phase I effort will focus of the following  objectives in order to develop a functional PerfDev prototype:","The PerfDev framework will be beneficial for optimization of HEC/HPC NASA applications that are being developed in C, C++, Fortran, Python and Perl. The tool will aid NASA while developing new applications and porting/optimizing existing applications for new and complex compute architectures. Software of potential interest to NASA include CFD, CSD, FEM, and other numeric simulation applications and libraries. PerfDev will also lead to an improved software development lifecycle that better meets the current high performance computing environment.","Many government agencies, university research groups, and industry researchers are utilizing high performance computing systems and face the same challenges in developing and optimizing codes for new and existing architectures. All of these sectors need an adequate tool to help in optimizing and porting applications to emerging high performing compute systems."

In recent decades, Machine learning (ML) technologies have been proven to speed up the process and reliability of identifying anomalies.  However, as the volume and complexity of sensor data has grown, traditional ML methods have failed to scale and require carefully crafted sensor models to get meaningful results.  More recently, Deep Learning (DL) methods have been proven to achieve superhuman performance and reliability in extremely complex domains such as object recognition, natural language processing, and games.  They achieve this by identifying patterns and relationships in data that humans are unable to quantify and encoding them hierarchically within “deep” neural networks.  With DL technology having been proven in many domains, we will build a DL-based, real-time engine sensor diagnostic and health management system to enable superhuman-level analysis and decision-making during firing tests and launches.","NASA is a major developer and operator of rocket engines.

Mapping the destruction wrought by these fires offers insight that can aid fire and forest management, climate and carbon cycle research, and even aid private and corporate risk-tolerance analysis.  Satellite imagery of the Earth is captured regularly, providing a vast wealth of detailed information that greatly benefits from automated analysis and has particular utility for burned area detection and mapping.  Existing state-of-the-art burned area algorithms are accurate but slow, involving region-specific models and human-in-the-loop quality assessments. Meanwhile, a powerful array of tools and techniques have been developed in the deep-learning community for semantic segmentation and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become increasingly capable.  However, benchmark datasets are not generally composed of remote sensing imagery and there are important considerations to adapting state-of-the-art techniques to this data. To address this need and fully leverage the available data, Toyon will implement a core Feature Extraction Module (FEM) that incorporates a modern suite of best practices in CNN architecture and design, transfer learning, and remote sensing imagery analysis.  Additionally, Toyon will implement 2 enhancement modules: A pre-processing Super-Resolution Module (SRM) and a post-processing Contextual Representation Module (CRM).  The SRM is composed of a CNN that produces high-resolution auxiliary outputs for human viewing but is trained with the core segmentation model to enhance the latter’s performance.  The CRM uses candidate semantic segmentations to refine and augment the FEM-derived features.  Both enhancement modules are entirely general and can be used toward a variety of other remote sensing tasks. Toyon will combine the 3 modules to produce a sophisticated burned-area detector that can automatically process satellite imagery on an ongoing basis.","Potential NASA applications include burned area detection and mapping but also extend to satellite and remote sensing imagery analysis more generally. Specifically, any semantic segmentation model can be immediately enhanced by applying our techniques and modules.  Moreover, other downstream tasks related to remote sensing analysis can benefit from the task-tailored super-resolution images produced SRM and the context incorporation method exemplified by our CRM.",Non-NASA researchers in climate and carbon science would benefit from our burned area detection tool.

ACORN offers a standardized method for designing, implementing, and running fault protection across disparate spacecraft. The approach uses graphical representations of state machines which manage various subsystems of the spacecraft. The runtime version of state machines coordinate together using guard conditions on transitions. These state machines identify and respond to faults at the component, intermediate, and system levels. Identification of fault conditions is based on telemetry values and sequence global variable values written to by flight software during runtime. The state-based design of ACORN enforces flight rules and other requirements, operating the spacecraft in a constraint-oriented manner. Responses take the form of spacecraft commands and sequence block invocations, which are implementations found on all spacecraft. Since ACORN runs onboard the spacecraft, it has immediate access to all of the telemetry necessary to detect faults. ACORN specifications are mission-independent. If a mission lacks a sufficiently powerful sequencing capability to implement the specification, the ACORN process is still extremely useful as a high-level design specification for custom components to be implemented, and allows a standardized capability to be used. Should the target mission feature a sequencing capability with an ACORN translation tool, the specification is automatically translated into an executable set of sequencing components that fully implement the desired detections and capabilities.

Operators of such systems are in critical need of a capability to forecast major space weather storms and potential effects towards risk mitigation. Currently available tools are research-oriented and may not be suitable for operational use. CFD Research and the University of Alabama in Huntsville propose to develop a novel Radiation, Interplanetary Shocks, and Coronal Sources (RISCS) toolset by enhancing and integrating existing research codes into a software product for situational assessment and decision making related to space operations. Key technology features and innovations include: (1) efficient coupling between component codes that describe inner heliosphere and transport of solar energetic particles; (2) modularity via standardized interfaces for data exchange and user interfaces; (3) development in consultation with NASA and selected end users; (4) improved component codes numerical and physics models; (5) customized configuration of final product for transition to end user operations (R2O/O2R). In Phase I, we will (1) identify potential ends users and technology transition avenues; (2) derive RISCS design requirements t for operational use; (3) characterize features, performance, and limitations of existing space weather modeling software; (4) enhance RISCS toolset via improved interfaces for data exchange, user input, etc.; (5) demonstrate operational performance of a toolset prototype and derive plans for continued R2O/O2R. During Phase II, we will improve component codes numerical/physics models, extensively test RISCS to improve error detection and handling, demonstrate modularity via swap-out of component codes, run end-to-end simulations of the modular code to demonstrate that RISCS meets the specified design requirements, customize and deliver RISCS to selected end user.","This topic directly addresses NASA’s R2O/O2R responsibilities outlined in the NSWAP, specifically their goal to understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth, including space weather. It also supports NASA SMD’s goal to coordinate efforts to prepare the nation for space weather events, and is aligned with Technology Roadmap TA-11 (11.2.0 on Modeling). The developed RISCS toolkit will support mission operations by forecasting all-clear periods and the occurrence and effects of SPEs to allow implementation of mitigation solutions.","A predictive capability for SPE-induced radiation and resulting operational effects can help mission/equipment managers schedule tasks and adopt risk mitigation strategies.

The TIS instrument design will be based on the Double-Probe &Topside-Ionosphere-Sounder (DPTIS) instrument design, previously developed by LDI for deployment on small satellites under Phases 1 and 2 AFRL-SBIR contracts (2016). The DPTIS design will be miniaturized adapting it to a CubeSat environment. Automatic processing of the measured vertical-incident topside ionograms, and calculation of the electron density profiles (EDP) from the height of the spacecraft to the F2 layer peak is proposed, including the height hmF2 and electron density NmF2 of the F2 layer peak. The inversion of the topside ionograms does not use any model assumptions. Automatic assimilation of the topside EDPs in existing ionospheric models, both physics-based and empirical, will facilitate the generation of realistic ionospheric weather models in near-real-time. The proposed assimilation technique adopts the method currently applied to the assimilation of ground-based NmF2/hmF2 measurements by the Global Ionospheric Radio Observatory (GIRO) into the ISO-standard for the ionosphere, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. Assimilating measured NmF2/hmF2 data from the proposed “CubeTIS” will significantly increase the coverage over land and, most importantly, will extend this coverage over the oceans, by generate reliable nowcast of the realistic ionospheric plasma distribution over land and oceans, and short term forecasting. Global difference maps depicting the differences between quiet-time average NmF2/hmF2 model and realistic assimilative model predictions will provide the basis for the development of an Ionospheric Disturbance Index (IDI) as function of location and time.","NASA’s satellite navigation applications need be corrected for retarding/refracting effects in the ionosphere. Even with using double-frequency methods (TOPEX/Jason, GNSS) to eliminate first order effects, higher order effects need be considered. CubeTIS data assimilated in IRI generate such a model. The recent GOLD and ICON satellites rely on the IRI to generate some of their Level 2 data products. The near-real time assimilative IRI using CubeTIS data has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy of data products from these missions","Nowcasting of Ionospheric Disturbance Indices, derived from a fleet of CubeTIS measurements, will provide a warning system for most regions on the globe in support of ionospheric or transionospheric radio frequency systems, like GPS, HFGeo, and OTHR systems.The CubeTIS radio sounder system can be the starting design point for a rescue ground-penetrating radar to survey post-catastrophe areas."

The HASDM-ML algorithm will be validated against a subset of the SET HASDM database. In addition, the team will use HASDM-ML densities with Two-Line Elements (TLEs) of a few representative satellites to create more accurate ballistic coefficients, B*, for a few satellites in a historic atmosphere under known solar irradiance and geomagnetic conditions. The uncertainty will be quantified for density and for forecast satellite drag. We will extend orbit estimates to current and near-term epochs to improve orbit forecasting relevant to LEO space traffic management by using the new B* values. Finally, we will improve JB2008 indices’ forecast over the next 72 hours using ML techniques; this will be complemented by the capture of high speed streams (HSS) not currently represented for the Dst geomagnetic index as well as by extending forecast accuracy out to 7 days using the existing ADAPT model values for F10 and S10.","The existing SET support of the U.S. Space Force's HASDM leads to regular conjunction assessment for NASA high value vehicles.

It is especially important for the propagation of solar energetic particles (SEPs), guiding them along the magnetic field from their generation near the Sun to locations in the heliosphere.  Solar Particle Events (SPEs), arising from SEPs produced by solar eruptions, represent a significant hazard for humans and technological infrastructure.  Providing longer range (2-3 day) forecasts of SPEs and/or all-clear periods is highly desirable but difficult to achieve, because a forecast must occur prior to the start of the eruption.  Given a flare/CME forecast, a major source of uncertainty in SPEs is the magnetic connectivity.  The goal of  our project is to develop CORHEL-E (CORHEL with Evolution).  CORHEL-E will provide time-dependent coronal and solar wind solutions, driven by evolving boundary conditions provided by photospheric flux transport models.  In phase I of our project, we will demonstrate time-dependent estimates of magnetic connectivity of Earth for specific time periods, using ensembles of solutions to assess variability and uncertainty.  At the completion of phase II, we will provide CORHEL-E to the CCMC, capable of running continuously.  Given a flare/eruption forecast from a threatening active region, CORHEL-E will allow the user to assess the regional connectivity and likelihood that SEPs can reach Earth or other heliospheric locations of interest.  Using STAT, an eruption can actually be simulated and particle fluxes predicted.  Longer term, our vision for an operational capability is a near-real time model of the solar corona and inner heliosphere, updated with new magnetic (and other) observations as they become available.  CMEs would be initiated in the model after being observed, and then be simulated as part of the continuous solution.  The development of CORHEL-E is a crucial next step towards this goal.","SPEs are of particular concern to NASA  SRAG,  which is responsible  for  ensuring that the radiation exposure received by astronauts remains below established safety limits.  Connectivity of the solar magnetic field plays a crucial role in determining where the particles propagate.  CORHEL-E will provide a tool for assessing this connectivity.  It complements tools presently used in operations such as MAG4, and can be used in conjunction with the SPE Threat Assessment Tool (STAT) already delivered to the CCMC at NASA GSFC.","SPEs are of concern to many government and commercial entities dependent on satellites and aircraft.  For example, NOAA SWPC provides space weather information to customers requiring forecasting of SPEs.  The Air Force is also interested in mitigation strategies for SPEs.

This innovation employs the existing reactor neutron radiation coupled with boron based thermoelectric materials to significantly enhance their performance through effects that radiation is known to have on electrical conductivity of solids. The boron-10 material in a neutron field will react to create alpha particles and ionize the feet of the TEG to greatly improve material properties, resulting in an Advanced Thermoelectric Generator, or ATEG.The major aspect of this innovation revolves around the tendency for ionizing radiation to excite the electrons in a material as it passes through. In doing so, the electrical conductivity of the material increases due to Radiation Induced Conductivity (RIC). However, it is known that the thermal and Seebeck properties of the material remain relatively unchanged. The figure of merit (ZT) for TEGs depends heavily on the electrical and thermal conductivity of the material, as well as the Seebeck coefficient. All three of these factors have been shown to improve when exposed to ionizing radiation. Based on effects seen from previous irradiation tests, the ZT of an ATEG can increase to the point where conversion efficiency can reach over 20%.Previous work performed by Howe Industries has demonstrated the electrical conductivity change in boron nitride samples during tests at KSU. As boron based TEGs currently exist, adapting these for use with the Kilopower reactor will be the main focus of this project. Doing so will allow for an improved conversion efficiency, reliable power production, and minimal changes to the current designs. This project has the potential to not only increase the performance of the Kilopower reactor, but also decrease overall mass and design complications.",The ATEG system can be used for fission surface power with reactors as well as for high efficiency conversion with radioisotopes. Substituting the boron material with americium dopant allows for power generation uncoupled from a neutron source. Having a 20% efficient TEG would decrease the overall amount of radioisotope fuel required for deep space missions and enable larger missions or more missions per year to take place.,"The ATEG system can be adapted for use on Earth for small modular reactors, full scale nuclear power plants, and waste head reclamation. Current estimates suggest that power can be generated in an ATEG SMR for $0.02/kWh and waste heat units can produce power at $0.003/kWh. Studies have found future market predictions for SMR and thermoelectrics to be $4.5B and $741M, respectively."

In order to enable high power (>100kW) and longer distribution systems on the surface of the moon or Mars, NASA is in need of low mass insulating materials which offer greater dielectric strength and operate in extreme temperature environments.  Wires are often coated with a thin layer of acrylic, polyurethane, polyester imide or polyamide imide to provide insulation and allow them to operate at high voltage, however these materials cannot withstand the high temperatures required for space applications.  When thermal stability is required, polyimides or fluorinated polymers such as PTFE are used, however these materials are costly, difficult to coat and in the case of fluorinated polymers exhibit poor adhesion to the wire.  The proposed SBIR will develop a thermosetting resin that offers low cost, high glass transition temperature, excellent adhesion to metallic substrates and greatly improved dielectric strength over currently used enamels.  Furthermore, the resin has a low processing viscosity which can allow thin insulation layers and can be cured in seconds, therefore, enabling rapid manufacture of lighter weight wire that can withstand extreme temperatures.  While current high Tg resins cost hundreds of dollars per pound, Trimer’s resin can be produced for dollars a pound.  In addition to the low cost, which is not the primary driver for aerospace materials, Trimer’s material exhibits excellent processability and mechanical properties and was recently measured to have a dielectric strength over 760 MV/m which is more than double polyimides.  Ultimately, the proposed polymer has the potential to drastically reduce the cost of magnet wire and produced thermally stable coatings which can be applied for future human-rated space missions.","Throughout NASA’s technology roadmap the need for improved materials is called out in nearly all Technology Areas and are highlighted as the enablers behind the systems that NASA develops and uses to fulfill its missions.  This need is evident throughout the next-generation space missions, which require insulators with greater dielectric strength and thermally stability for the wiring used in power transmission as well as motors, high voltage electronics and the encapsulation of electrical components.","The market for electromagnetic systems is experiencing significant growth, driven by electric vehicles and wind power as well as increasing wealth in emerging economies. Our commercialization efforts will seek to capitalize upon the low cost to produce polymers with high thermal stability and dielectric strength to market the resin in a range of industrial power applications."

This power is expected to exceed the 100kW range of the ISS, currently the highest power space-based electrical system in existence.  Power conversion is an important element in any large-scale electrical distribution system, required to control the flow of power and provide galvanic isolation barriers to improve safety, robustness, and electromagnetic compatibility. The terrestrial power electronics industry is currently making dramatic improvements in power density and efficiency, through the use of wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductor technology.  Especially critical to planetary base applications, WBG semiconductors allow higher switching frequencies, thereby reducing the weight of an isolation transformer and enabling the target of >2kW/kg power density, as well as promising an inherently higher robustness against space radiation. ​ Over the last five years, PCKA has employed WBG devices in power conversion applications with voltages ranging from 28–750 Vdc and power levels ranging from 2–440 kW.  These applications have focused on military vehicle and aircraft power systems, which have many of the same objectives as a space-based application.  However, taking this technology into a planetary surface power application requires overcoming challenges such as temperatures below –100C, bombardment from space radiation, and the harsh impact of dust and regolith.  Many of the state-of-the-art components utilized in the existing designs do not have direct radiation hardened substitutes and will require additional development and test. In this proposed effort, PCKA will adapt one of its WBG isolated dc/dc converters to meet the requirements of a planetary base application.   This high-impact technology will then be demonstrated over the course of the SBIR program.","The target applications for the isolated power converter development are lunar and planetary lander base power systems.  There are additional potential applications in space-station power conversion, such as the Lunar Gateway system, in which high-power dc-dc converters are also required.​",Military and commercial satellites have increasing power requirements with similar requirements to lunar and planetary landers.

To achieve the technology performance goal of > 300 V for the derated semiconductor operating voltage, new technologies are needed. An example immediate benefit of space hardened high voltage parts is that they would enable next generation high-power electric propulsion systems. Use of a wide bandgap semiconductor such as silicon carbide is also likely to increase their efficiency. The mature silicon technology has not been able to offer discrete very high power and radiation resistant components with favorable electrical characteristics such as low losses and high frequency operation capabilities. Silicon carbide power devices offer a unique opportunity with possible derated voltages of several hundreds of volts or larger. However, the nascent silicon carbide technology, which is in its infancy compared to silicon but significantly more mature relative to other wide bandgap technologies such as gallium nitride and gallium oxide, requires radiation hardening by design and process to achieve this. We propose novel silicon carbide LDMOS and DMOS power device designs that are radiation tolerant. These designs are guided by results of detailed simulations, and extensive empirical data from previous radiation tests. Moreover, the proposed radiation tolerant power switch is likely to increase modularity of high and low power switchgear, and therefore reduce the logistics of incorporating interchangeable parts. This proposal directly addresses the capability performance goals of a) developing basic power building blocks for multiple applications, and b) distributing power at increased voltage to lower overall power system mass. Our silicon carbide electronics is additionally capable of addressing technology performance goal of power distribution components and interconnects at high temperatures.","Extending the power level in International Space Station (ISS) and other spacecraft necessitates higher voltage ratings.

The proposed phase I activity builds upon the work done at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to improve the SEB failure rate of Silicon Carbide devices. The team at RPI conducted detailed electrothermal simulations that revealed the device physics behind SEB failure of Silicon Carbide vertical devices. The team discovered that using a special epitaxial structure used to fabricate the devices, the SEB tolerance of Silicon carbide vertical devices can be increased from 30% to 80% of rated voltage.

Cryogenic fluids such as liquefied hydrogen, oxygen, and methane are expected to be used for chemical and nuclear propulsion, fuel cells, life support systems, cooling, refrigeration, liquefaction, and In-Situ Resource Utilization. Transfer of stored cryogenic liquids from a supply tank to an empty tank will be an important procedure during which phase change will occur.  In addition, temperature fluctuations during long term storage of cryogenic fluids can result in the vaporization of these liquids.  In low gravity conditions, buoyancy forces will be insufficient to separate the vapors formed from the liquids and  the presence of vapor in the liquid streams will interfere with combustion in engines, and pumps, resulting in equipment damage. In this Phase I SBIR project, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of using a specially designed chamber to separate the vapor from the cryogenic liquid. This separator will use swirl to generate centripetal forces to force vapor out of the liquid into the central core of the vortex. The lighter vapor bubbles will separate  from the cryogenic liquid to form a stable core in the center of the chamber surrounded by the liquid. The vapor can then be pumped from the system and collected for further use. The design will prevent the vaporous core from reaching the liquid exit. The liquid stream will flow out of the other end of the chamber where it can be stored or transferred. This approach is based on our previous separator designs for removing air from water under microgravity. The resulting technology has been tested under microgravity conditions. Based on those results the application of a similar design to cryogenic fluid management is predicted to succeed.","Numerous NASA applications to be used for longterm space habitation and manned missions into deep space will require cryogenic fluids management. These include the storage and transfer of cryogenic fluids for chemical and nuclear based propulsors, life support systems formation and recovery of fluids generated in situ, etc. Longterm storage of cryogenic fluids may subject the stored fluids to boil off. Therefore, cryogenic phase separation is needed to protect pumps and equipment from bubbly flows in low gravity conditions.","The separation of vapor phases in cryogenic fluids is applicable in Magnetic Resonance Imaging equipment, superconductors, supercomputers and cryopreservation of biological samples liquefaction of natural gas and cryopreservation of pathology and biological samples.

Although magnetic propellant orientation methods have been proposed and investigated for cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen delivery in microgravity before, the MPS applies recent trends in high-strength permanent magnets, modeling, and a novel centrifuge test platform to facilitate the configuration and refinement of magnet geometry and controls over long test periods.

These replace the more expensive, less compact, brazing technology and mechanical capture currently used. The proposed techniques include welding 1) molybdenum to molybdenum; 2) molybdenum and molybdenum alloys to porous tungsten; 3) molybdenum to stainless steel; 4) molybdenum to kovar; 5) a new potted tungsten heater to cathodes and supports; and 6) alternative materials such as niobium and hafnium. All of these weld processes allow automated production. E beam has over 30 years’ experience developing new, innovative cathode structures. It is the leader in cathode miniaturization. Precision laser and resistance welding is essential for these structures. E beam is the only company that can reliably weld impregnated cathodes to base metals. The secret to successful welding of disparate refractories is the choice of interface materials and the allowance for mismatches in the coefficient of thermal expansion. We routinely employ TIG, resistance, and laser welding in cathode production, and have done ebeam welding. In addition to conventional hollow cathodes, we plan to apply the new joining techniques to scandate hollow cathodes, hollow reservoir cathodes, and planar micro-thruster cathodes. The proposed innovations will improve and lower the cost of conventional hollow cathodes. A planar 0.050-inch diameter planar scandate cathode using heater power of only half a watt is able to produce over one ampere of discharge current.","The innovations apply to NASA’s Hall and ion thrusters that employ conventional impregnated cathodes. These cathodes will be more compact, use less power, be more manufacturable and reliable. For long-range space missions, hollow reservoir cathodes provide longer life than impregnated cathodes. The improvements here will improve the reliability of reservoir cathodes. NASA has several initiatives involving micro-thrusters. The weld technology proposed is critical for  very small planar scandate cathodes capable of  up to 4A of discharge.","The innovations proposed here would apply to hollow cathodes, including reservoir cathodes used in orbit-raising of heavy communications satellites.

NASA has specifically encouraged prospective proposers in fields outside of electric propulsion, like HiFunda, to apply if they have experiences with materials and processes that may be suitable for this application.  Insulation and potting degradation during thruster operations can lead to early thruster failures that have occurred with existing processes for manufacturing and potting magnetic wire. HiFunda is proposing a new geopolymer composite potting material and casting process that will extend the temperature limits of conventional polymeric and/or ceramic potting materials thereby minimizing or eliminating instances of potting and insulation failures. High-temperature electromagnet coils are potted with a ceramic material that is intended to fill the gaps between the windings and to be free of voids. Unfortunately, in practice, the ceramic potting compound develops cracks due to the large startup thermal gradients and the large difference in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the constituent materials.  The proposed technology will mitigate this issue by adding reinforcing fibers to the potting compound and more closely matching the effective CTE of the geopolymer matrix. In Phase I, HiFunda will develop and demonstrate robustness and suitability of a CICPM in a potting test vehicle (PTV) and a subscale proof-of-concept high-temperature electromagnet (POC-HTEM) simulant. The proposed technology will be further refined and demonstrated on a high-temperature electromagnet design of interest to NASA and/or aerospace contractors in Phase II.","The proposed new low-cost castable inorganic composite potting material (CICPM) and process will be used by NASA for electromagnets in electric propulsion systems on spacecraft.  Benefits to NASA include improved reliability and longer lifetimes of high-temperature electromagnets and potential cost reduction of potting materials, acceptance testing, and the high cost of thrusters.  Also, the CTE and thermal conductivity of the proposed CICPM can be tailored for a variety of other thermal management applications of interest to NASA.","The proposed technology will find commercial adoption for non-NASA thermal management applications like encapsulating, coating, and/or potting of hot components, subassemblies, and surfaces in high-temperature environments for gas turbine engines, furnaces, processing equipment, aerospace, and automotive.

Current Hall effect thrusters make use of hexagonal boron nitride (BN) for the discharge channel in which plasma is generated and accelerated.

The process involves using an extractor reactor and a refiner reactor. The liquid metals can be extracted in sequence according to the stabilities of their oxides as expressed by the values of the free energy of oxide formation (e.g. Cr, Mn, Fe, Si, Ti, Al, Mg, and Ca). The Moon is rich in mineral resources capable of sustaining the production of oxygen, Si, and a variety of metals, (e.g., Fe, Al, and Ti). However, the extraction of these elements will require the use of rather different processes from those used on Earth 10. For example, mineral beneficiation has been an enduring paradigm in terrestrial extractive metallurgy for economic reasons but the reliance on such unit operations as froth flotation with its attendant consumption of huge quantities of water summarily disqualifies beneficiation from consideration in the lunar setting.

One particular need for habitation and deep space exploration is the continuous supply of oxygen for life support and for propellants in the form of liquid oxygen. As missions are foreseen to extend with limited accessibility of earth resupply, the availability of oxygen will become critical.

Using nylon or polypropylene plastic material and rapid prototyping techniques such as selective laser sintering (SLS), arbitrary plastic structures can be designed and fabricated that allow living hinges to bend and flex over 100,000’s of bending cycles. This creates a highly suitable support material for thin film electrode arrays that use high strength electric fields to remove dust from the surface. In Phase I, HFR will fabricate, assemble, and demonstrate the feasibility of the BEDS technology using high voltage waveforms and simulated regolith dust. We will also investigate high voltage safety techniques, electro-magnetic interference reduction, and adaptive technologies to switch on the active dust cleaning only when necessary. The active BEDS arrays will be combined with passive dust mitigation strategies for experimentation with new concepts of operation.","The initial application is to protect equipment from abrasive lunar dust. Airborne dust may be inhaled and cause lung damage. Therefore, secondary applications may include grids to disperse lunar dust from pathways, habitats, equipment, and vehicles. Developing a flexible BEDS material will allow for broader applications in helmet visors, flexible wrap-around electrode ‘tape’, integration onto the surface of space suits, protective skin for vehicle body, the vehicle seats (to prevent wear on astronauts’ suits), zip-lock plastic bags etc.","The Army can use BEDS to deflect dust from vehicle windshields, pitched tents, and other pieces of equipment and personnel. EPA applications cover charged particle pollution filtering systems for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation use. The DHS and the USPS may see applications in screening mail contents for powders. Solar farms require dust mitigation technologies."

Traditional space systems operate through nuclear, solar, or tethered power mechanisms that require great complexity and process to qualify and operate. Tethered systems are hindered tremendously by mechanically mated components that are prone to regolith incursion and that require large robotically generated forces for interconnection. Furthermore, astronauts suffer from limited suit dexterity to manipulate and manage such systems. Nuclear powered systems require intensive handling procedures, and in many cases, presidential authority to launch—greatly increasing the cost and schedule of such missions. Solar powered systems require continuous access to the Sun and must follow predicated operational plans to maximize sunlight exposure and limit system duty cycles, ultimately constraining system performance. A wireless charging system would mitigate these challenges for standalone systems that don’t have the resources to generate power independently through the traditional methods listed above and would in many cases eliminate the need for some quick disconnect technologies used in static joints. Furthermore, a charging technology such as this could have great utility not only on the Moon, but also in critical space applications on Mars, in orbit, and beyond. The proposing team of Astrobotic and WiBotic, are developing a charging solution that can satisfy these needs. The performance and specifications of the proposed wireless charging system are summarized as follows:","There are several applications that necessitate proximity chargers in space. In relation to the Moon, these activities include supporting marsupial roving missions, enabling robotic systems that do not contain onboard nuclear or solar power generators, charging toolkits on crewed lunar terrain vehicles, and powering the heaters of critical devices to survive the lunar night. Near-field wireless power transmitters are important tools to reduce regolith incursion in mechanically mated systems and static joints.","Robotic systems are increasingly utilized in warehouses, energy/utility plants, construction sites, mines, and for last mile delivery applications. Underwater robotic systems enable ocean research for aquaculture, ocean mapping and maritime trade security inspections. All of these systems are battery powered and require recharging to maintain a high level of reliability and automation."

The fitting design is well suited for use in the ultra-cold permanently shadowed regions of the Moon and will be adaptable for quick operation automatically or by a suited astronaut. The fitting will achieve reliable, long-term, repeated use in the dusty environments off Earth with negligible loss of product by employing several layers of passive and active dust mitigation including an internal gas-purge system to remove dust from the fitting threads and sealing faces, threads that can function without jamming in the presence of regolith dust, surface geometries that reduce the concentration of electro-static charges, and ultra-smooth surfaces to eliminate locations that dust particles can be trapped.  The fitting will be electro-statically grounded to its system. The fitting will have a dust cover and a gas-operated cleaning cuff for removing dust before the fitting is operated. The gas flow to clean the threads and sealing surfaces can be supplied to the fitting either through the attaching system itself or by a separate gas supply bottle as needed. In Phase 2 the fitting will be further developed to include electrostatic dissipative (ESD) coatings and a vibrational source, such as a small external ultrasonic transducer or from a clicking feature in the nut similar to a socket wrench, which will produce vibrations while the nut is being turned to help knock loose dust and regolith particles throughout the fitting.  An in-line filter will be downstream of the fitting to trap any dust that may make its way past the fitting.

These TCSs must be lightweight, reliable, and able to effectively control cabin and equipment temperatures under widely varying heat loads and ambient temperatures. In contrast to single‑phase pumped coolant loops, two‑phase pumped loops are very attractive for this application because of the uniform cooling temperature provided by the boiling coolant, low required pumping power, high‑heat transfer coefficients, and high thermal conductance. However, introduction of two‑phase flow can pose design challenges associated with flow management and dynamic stability. A condensing radiator technology is needed to enable future heat rejection systems with high turndown ratio, compatibility with freezing, and deployability, while balancing considerations unique to two‑phase flow condensation. To meet these performance requirements, Creare has developed a freeze‑tolerant, variable‑conductance radiator for deployable heat rejection in two‑phase pumped loop systems.","Creare’s freeze‑tolerant radiator is designed specifically with NASA’s needs in mind, in particular to enable deployable heat rejection from space‑borne two‑phase pumped loop systems.

Pumped Two Phase (P2P) Loops (Backpressure regulators).  There is a clear need for advanced thermal control solutions that can support extended-duration science payloads on the lunar surface. Since the primary power source for near term Lunar surface science missions is a combination of solar photovoltaic arrays & batteries (note that each watt of power required through the lunar night requires ~5 kg of batteries), a thermal control system that rejects daytime heat efficiently & conserves energy through the night is essential to keep the payloads, batteries and other critical components at suitable temperatures.  This proposed program will develop passive Thermal Control Valves, and test them with a low-cost, 3D-printed Loop Heat Pipe (LHP).Conventional LHPs provide very efficient heat transfer between electronics and spacecraft radiators when necessary but require 2-3 W of power continuously to shut down and minimize heat transfer (e.g. through the night), which can increase battery mass substantially if applied for the entire lunar night. The TCV requires no electrical power, passively shutting down the LHP and minimizing power needs and heat losses at night By using 3D printing, ACT will develop TCVs integrated with the LHP evaporator (3D printed) and Compensation Chamber.  The body of the TCV will be printed separately, probably in two sections.  The TCV will then be welded to the tube through the evaporator end, and the rest of the compensation chamber will be fabricated around it. In the Phase II program, ACT will develop TCVs for pumped single- and/or two-phase systems.  3D printing of the valve bodies will be examined, to both develop lower mass solutions, and integrate the valves with the cold plates.","Thermal Control Valves (TCVs) will be develop for: 1. LHPs, 2. Single-Phase Loops, and 3. P2P Loops.  The Phase I program will develop On/Off TCVs for LHPs, since this technology is needed to provide Variable Thermal Links for Lunar Landers, Rovers, and Habitats.  TCVs will be developed for pumped single phase loops for applications like manned spacecraft, Lunar and Martian Rovers, and the Europa Clipper. All of these applications can benefit from a passive TCV.  Finally, satellite and Lunar Habits will benefit from a pumped two-phase loops.","An application for both NASA and non-NASA is inexpensive 3D printed LHPs with TCVs for SmallSats and CubeSats, which together provide a low-cost thermal management system.  In contrast, currently available LHPs and TCVs can cost more than a University CubeSat.

The key enabling components of the MMC-TDR are 1) a passive, reliable membrane phase separator for robust two-phase flow control in the absence of gravity, 2) a passive bypass valve which regulates flowrates in the radiator to control heat rejection, and 3) a modular, deployable tube-on-plate three phase radiator design which is three-phase compatible. The system integrates with a two-phase pumped loop using ammonia as the process fluid. The MMC-TDR uses an integrated membrane phase separator that achieves separation via capillary action, so that operation is insensitive to gravity and inertia effects. Separate vapor and liquid ammonia streams are distributed to the freezable radiator through two distributions headers. The subcooled liquid from both streams is combined at the outlet of the radiator array in the collection header. The MMC-TDR will use increased pressure losses and heat transfer from longer channel lengths with a variable opening PCM bypass valve to selectively reduce flow through outer most channels as heat load is reduced. The reduction in flow will results in high degrees of subcooling until freezing occurs. The percentage of flow through the bypass line vs. the radiator channels is passively controlled by modulating the bypass valve position, increasing or reducing the bypass line pressure drop relative to the channel pressure drops. The PCM bypass valve regulates the flow through the system to achieve the desired subcooled temperature, effectively allowing the radiator channels to gradually lose flow and freeze during periods of low desired heat dissipation. The freezable radiator panel is constructed of a series of parallel “U” channels. The channels are constructed of aluminum encased Inconel tubes.","The proposed research is targeted at improvement in the deployable radiator state of the art.

Developed during the WSF program, in-space vacuum deposition technology is currently considered at TRL 8 and consists of depositing materials atomic layer-by-atomic layer to fabricate functional thin films in the vacuum of space. The concept consists of depositing a thick film layer of an element onto a material(s) through a physical vacuum deposition process in the vacuum of space. Considering the constraints for space flight (mass, volume, power, etc.) Lunar Resources has developed a specialized thermal deposition process to deposit coatings on-orbit which would be ideal for joining as it is low-power and is deployed by an autonomous, low-mass, space deposition system. The thermal deposition process coats the substrate (in this case the material to be joined) creating a bond between the substrate/material and the deposited coating. Lunar Resources has adapted the traditional terrestrial thermal deposition process to account for microgravity and overspray. The space deposition system is able to create thick-films (>10microns) to join materials for bonding, repairing or replacing applications. and able to deposit a wide range of elements with vaporization temperatures up to 2000 oC. For joining applications, Lunar Resources foresees the benefit to deposit numerous coatings depending on the required strength of the bond and its application. For example, for joining two joints that will not need to be unjoined, Lunar Resources could deposit a  thick titanium coating. However, for joints that may need to be replaced or whose lifetimes are less than the structures which they are joining, we could deposit a lower melting temperature material such as indium to be able to unjoin and replace the joint by melting the deposited joining coating.","Lunar Resources space deposition system is a dual-use universal material fabrication facility. Its general capability of fabricating atomically structured materials, layer-by-layer, can fabricate coatings and thin films for a variety of applications. For joining applications, it is able to join, repair, replace and manufacture materials on-orbit. Specific NASA applications include: joining, rigidization, and repair of aerospace grade metals and themoplastics for habitat modules, trusses, solar arrays, and antenna reflectors.","Potential Non-NASA applications of on-orbit joining through space deposition include satellite servicing and assembly involving the joining of components (habitat modules, trusses, solar arrays and antenna reflectors) on-orbit and the repair/replacement of components by melting previously deposited thick film coatings without the need to cut materials on-orbit."

However, when it comes to high-payload operations, gantry robots, with their rigid construct, are still the option of choice. This is particularly true when precision is of concern. Unfortunately, a rigid gantry setup is difficult to implement in space especially considering weight constraints and the need for flexibility.

The robotic forming cell consists of two heterogenous, 6-axis robots mounted on two linear tracks and a real-time monitoring and control system. The robots must work in coordination with each other to incrementally form a sheet of metal into a part based on an input CAD file. This work introduces a software solution which addresses a number of challenges. First, both robots need to be synced while experiencing differing loading conditions imposed by the forming operation (e.g., due to variation in friction). Second, the positioning of the two robots need to be dynamically adjusted to make sure the overall compliance of the robotic system is minimized. Third, the system monitors the forming operation in real-time and assesses its deviation against the initially defined path.

Space vehicles must ensure safety and reliability throughout missions, the durations of which are ever-increasing as the bounds of space are pushed. Therefore, each component used in these vehicles must start with and maintain critical levels of structural integrity. Additive manufacturing (AM) processes offer a solution to the challenges of manufacturing unique, complex parts rapidly, but can be expensive and error-prone. Powder-based AM processes use expensive and oftentimes hazardous feedstock and produce large amounts of waste material. Wire-based AM processes solve these problems, but are still limited in relation to repeatability, reliability, and the need for inspection to identify defects that significantly reduce part performance. Solvus Global’s proposed solution is to implement a detection and feedback monitoring software integrated with multiple sensors for defect detection, enabling maximum information and decision-making power for wire-fed AM processes, specifically the high deposition rate Wire Arc AM (WAAM). Solvus Global will utilize their existing AM process monitoring platform, APEX, to collect, store and analyze data from WAAM process parameters and the integrated sensor-suite including laser profilometry and thermal imaging for surface monitoring, arc health analysis, and wire resistivity for feedstock quality assurance. When correlated to process parameters, these methods will improve the consistency of AM processes and establish the foundation for closed-loop control with real-time defect correction. Through this work, Solvus Global will prove the feasibility of using the proposed sensor suite for real-time defect detection during WAAM processing and will determine the path forward towards real-time correction of defects.","Improved repeatability and reliability of AM processes will benefit many of NASA’s high-priority missions and applications, including the Orion crew vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS), commercial crew and commercial cargo programs, and science missions. Specifically, DRM 5 Asteroid Redirect, DRM 6 Crewed to NEA, DRM 7 Crewed to Lunar Surface, DRM 8 Crewed to Mars Moons, DRM 8a Crewed Mars Orbital, and DRM 9 Crewed Mars Surface Missions will all be enabled by Solvus Global’s technology.","Non-NASA markets for WAAM range from marine and automotive applications to renewable energy, oil & gas, and nuclear sectors. Any unique or complex components that need to be rapidly, repeatably, and cost-effectively manufactured and require structural integrity would benefit from improved reliability and repeatability in AM processes."

SAW wireless sensors have proven performance in harsh and space environments due to their radiation harness, large temperature operation range, passive operation, and inherent solid state monolithic construction.  SAW devices are manufactured in high volume and low cost, can be RFID encoded, operate at RF frequencies, and are small in size and weight. This Phase I project will provide the required elements for the Phase II implementation of a wireless passive sensor system. The Phase I effort will provide an analysis and design study that includes the essential elements for a wireless SAW temperature sensor system, which include the test frame and sensor array, new RFID encoding theory for SAW device implementation, SAW device simulations and new embodiments, and system configuration analysis including post processing techniques. The approach will use several layers of SAW encoding including: PN phase shifting, orthogonal frequency coding, and time delay. Temperature sensing will be the initial SAW device since it is ubiquitous and Pegasense has a large experience base.  Various test-bed aeronautic materials will be studied for their electrical and mechanical properties, approaches considered for sensor mounting, and for RF communications. The transceiver will use the latest developing systems within Pegasense, which is currently about a TRL 5, based on a software defined radio (SDR) approach using an ETTUS universal software radio peripheral (USRP). This effort an intended results will lay a foundation for understanding design principles and problem encountered in establishing large SAW based sensor arrays.  The approach leverages NASA SBIR/STTR past efforts in software defined radio (SDR) that allows Pegasense to concentrate on the sensor array, materials and sensor advancements.","Because of the passive and rugged nature of SAW devices, there are a wealth of applications. A SAW device platform can be modified for differing operations by adding thin or thick films, or hybrid elements.  Examples include: 1) ground operations- spacecraft lift off temperature and gas monitoring, cement NDE and gas sensing, 2) spacecraft - temperature, strain, radiation, and gas cabin monitoring, 3)space exploration- inflatable habitat, radiation and simple terrestrial positioning system, and 4) astronaut SHM - temperature and gas sensing.","Applications include: 1) radiation sensing in nuclear power plants, energy power grid monitoring, temperature monitoring in harsh environments, such as turbines, motors, engines, 2) hydrogen gas sensing for nuclear power plants, turbines and hydrogen storage containers, and 3) aviation industry wireless aircraft sensors for a wealth of applications needing multi sensor wireless passive sensors."

Our PA-MAE concept promises a revolutionary assessment capability that operates in real time to detect, locate, and evaluate major structural impacts and age related defects in all materials much more effectively than current health monitoring capabilities. Our proposal is founded on the same technology NASA used on the Space Shuttles after the Columbia incident to detect impacts during launch. The gain in sensor sensitivity is achieved by stacking broadband piezoelectric crystal elements into a single sensor housing and then creating a phased array of the stacked elements at a single monitoring site. Stacking the sensors will increase signal amplitudes by summing outputs at the same detection location, while using a phased array and summing signals from closely spaced stacks will increase signal amplitudes via the phasing. Using both the stacks and the phased signals provides a 30 to 40 dB gain in sensitivity with no electronic gain required, thus significantly reducing electronic noise levels. In addition, the system will utilize a 24 bit analog-to-digital converter instead of the normal 16 bit converter to provide a larger dynamic range.  This will eliminate the signal saturation due to extraneous noise signals that saturates current hardware leading to signal distortion and missed defect growth signals. This novel approach results in a sensor array that is based on proven technology, monitors the full frequency spectrum of guided waves propagating as a result of damaging events, and detects and locates damage and cracks over very large areas of NASA structures more accurately, efficiently, and reliably than current monitoring systems.","Antech envisions the proposed enhanced PA-MAE monitoring system being used primarily as a Structural Health Monitoring system for NASA spacecraft and launch vehicles both manned and unmanned to detect/locate/characterize impact damage and age related defects, such as cracks in metallic structures and microcracks, fiber buckling, and fiber breakage in composite materials. With better sensor sensitivity, the system will be efficient, effective, and reliable, and provide real time mission critical information on the status of NASA structures.","The PA-MAE system could be used on Navy, Coast Guard, and commercial ships as a Structural Health Monitoring system able to monitor the entire hull for cracks and impacts with widely dispersed phased arrays. It could also monitor composite pressure vessels used for transportation of compressed natural gas and hydrogen fuels, above ground storage tanks for leaks, and concrete structures for damage."

These spacecraft will utilize a variety of material systems, and many of the components are targeted for reusability and long-term use. This offers many challenges, not only for design and manufacturing, but also for inspection and maintenance. For example, inspection of thermal protection systems (TPS), bondlines, or multilayered structures using traditional nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is time consuming, expensive, and often not possible when access is limited (e.g. covered by TPS). All conventional NDE methods have significant limitations in evaluating conditions beneath attenuative TPS material, making inspection of the bondline very challenging. To inspect the bondline between the TPS and the composite substrate, a mechanical wave such as ultrasound is necessary. However, TPS materials are highly attenuative to conventional ultrasound waves. An opportunity exists to meet this challenge by utilizing non-diffracting ultrasonic Bessel Beams that resist attenuation. In this project, it is proposed to develop an NDE technique to inspect carbon fiber composite substrates and bondlines beneath attenuative TPS material. A comparatively new approach using a Restorative Ultrasonic Bessel Beam Yielding (RUBY) method is proposed to perform NDE using an ad-hoc metastructure with multi-stage acoustic axicons in-front of the transducer to create self-healing ultrasonic Bessel Beams that focus the wave energy without being affected by the attenuative layer. Bessel Beams are a special class of beams that resist diffraction and, in some cases, attenuation up to a certain distance (depth of field). The objective of the project is to develop a system capable of generating nondiffracting beams that resist the loss effects and maintain amplitude and spot size of their central core for long distances, suitable for inspection beneath thick attenuative layers.","It is anticipated that the first application of the technology will be the integration into NASA’s inspection tools for TPS material such as the Orion heat shield, followed by applications for multi-wall composite pressure vessels, additively manufacture components, and inspection beneath thick protective coatings. As NASA continues to direct efforts into deep space flight, novel inspection systems, such as RUBY, will be needed to provide mission critical information of the structure’s status.","Non-NASA applications include large, commercial space launch vehicles. Other non-NASA applications include military/commercial aircraft structures that use thick protective coatings. In addition to structural inspection, transmitting ultrasonic Bessel Beams through attenuative layers of skull, muscle, and skin would enable faster, safer, and cheaper biomedical imaging capabilities."

This system will reduce the complexity of scanning detailed structures by providing immediate identification of areas of concern, which will allow those areas to be scanned in more detail in the initial scan. In addition, the detailed position information and automatic registration of NDE data to precise locations on the structure will improve the accuracy of results, increase comparability of data from one scan to another, and enable automated or robotically assisted inspection processes. During Phase I Luna will build a prototype system and demonstrate its performance on test surfaces with known geometries and defect profiles. The results will be projected on a model of the surface in a 3-D visualization software tool. Methods for transitioning the damage visualization data to augmented reality or VR hardware will be researched for development in the Phase II effort.","The proposed NDE visualization tool will enable faster, more accurate scanning of surfaces, and will provide real time results to users during the scanning process, facilitating quicker decision making based on reliable NDE data. Better data registration will improve NDE data resolution and accuracy, which will facilitate Digital Twin efforts.

However, a primary challenge in this immature process is the lack of knowledge and controlling of the microstructure formation and evolution through this method, especially for the in-process interface between layers where defects are likely to be generated. Although after-process destructive inspection may provide information about the grain’s microstructure for the additively manufactured part, the after-process characterization does not reveal critical in situ information and thus the possibility for in situ correction. Therefore, any means to measure surface and buried defects in situ efficiently with a high spatial resolution would be highly desirable. To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII) proposes to develop an innovative optical-thermal-thermosonic-infrared (OTTI) imaging technology for the nondestructive, in-process inspection of critical flaws both on the layer surface and inside the welded build. The proposed NDE technique builds on the XII-developed multi-frequency thermosonic infrared technology, which is capable of detection of defects as small as micron-size. Combined with the optical and thermal imaging techniques, OTTI reveals unprecedented information in situ on defect formation between layers and microstructure evolution on the layers, which can lead to further in situ correction and control for the structure and quality of the building part during the additive manufacturing process.","It is estimated that the proposed system will have a substantial impact in the following NASA programs: Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly program, In-Space Propulsion Technologies Project, Advanced Telescope Technologies program, Air Vehicle Technology program, Small Spacecraft Technologies program, as well as the On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM) program, and other efforts where additive manufacturing are being engineered at NASA.","OTTI technology significantly improves additive manufacturing in multiple ways including design, development, evaluation, analysis, and product quality control.

Automated, metallography-based serial sectioning offers a reliable method to establish ground truth data on the flaw populations as well as microstructural variations of AM components. Such data can be used to validate, and subsequently improve the reliability of NDE methods. UES proposes a project aimed at establishing comparison methods and workflows for validating CT (and potentially other NDE data) with ground truth from serial sectioning, and developing probability of detection (POD) curves. The knowledge gained from these efforts will inform CT scan strategies for improved flaw detection in AM components, evaluate flaw detectability in CT using serial sectioning as a ground truth comparison, and quantify the risk of the flaws absent from the CT data sets.

Planned human exploration beyond Earth orbit will rely on an orbiting facility near the Moon, called ‘Gateway’ with intermittent human occupation, requiring robust autonomous inspection and diagnostics tools. EMMA’s sensors and machine learning algorithms will establish nominal background conditions throughout the vehicle, to easily identify anomalies and trigger further action. For instance, fast leak of pressurized lines may be detected quickly via change in noise levels, which would trigger EMMA to look for small changes in pressure level and small changes in chemical signatures, which combined and compared to nominal background conditions using machine learning tools, provide early diagnostics data that would enable quick mitigation actions (e.g., isolation by valves, selectively shutting down systems, etc.).

This is done in two steps. First, we will develop several parametrized primitives that allow an operator to specify a broad range of constrained motions, including climbing in microgravity, turning valves, and opening doors. Second, we will develop a task construction framework that allows an operator to compose such primitives into much larger tasks. The task construction framework will be able to compute complete end-to-end continuous motion plans that satisfy all relevant motion constraints. The operator will be able to preview these plans and select one for execution. We will also develop appropriate user interfaces that allow operators to specify complex tasks without having to write any code.","The proposed system would enable operators to specify complex sequences of motions for humanoid robots (such as Robonaut 2) in microgravity environments like the International Space Station or the Gateway.

While theoretically it may be possible to design robots to interact with a habitat designed without robotic interactions in mind, the addition of cooperative robotic interaction features can dramatically simplify and improve the robustness of the robotic outfitting hardware. These robotic interaction aids ideally can serve three purposes: 1) helping robots determine their relative pose and position with respect to the target, and their relative location/pose inside or outside the habitat, 2) identifying what the objects are, especially if the objects are mobile like soft-goods bags, and 3) simplifying physical interactions with the object, including anchoring to and manipulating the object.

Gearing is often critical for aerospace applications because the size and mass of a motor are more strongly correlated to its torque rating than its power rating.  Therefore, coupling a high-speed and, thus, relatively small and lightweight motor to the load through a gearbox can significantly reduce system size and mass relative to a direct-drive system with a low-speed and, thus, relatively large and heavy motor and no gearbox.  However, mechanical gears introduce additional challenges to the system, including additional maintenance requirements and reduced reliability, which are unacceptable for space applications.  Additionally, it can be difficult to keep mechanical gearboxes adequately lubricated in extremely cold environments.  On the other hand, magnetic gears transfer power through the interaction of magnetic fields, instead of mechanical contact.  This noncontact operation allows magnetic gears to potentially mitigate the reliability, maintenance, and lubrication challenges associated with mechanical gears.","Phase I results will provide a strong indication of whether the topology will be viable to achieve the gear ratio, torque density, and efficiency requirements for space applications. The prototype for space applications has the potential to increase reliability, reduce maintenance, and eliminate the lubrication challenges associated with mechanical gearbozes currently used in lunar rover technologies. The resulting technology can be used to contribute to more capable and reliable lunar robots in general.","This prototype will advance magnetic gearing technology in general. High gear ratio magnetic gear technology is applicable to low-speed terrestrial applications, from robotic joints to wind turbines and wave energy converters. While these applications have different gear ratio, size, cost, and environmental constraints, they can benefit from MG with higher gear ratios than previous prototypes."

This proposed set of numerical tools innovates on the current state of the art by explicitly solving for both thermal and mechanical interactions between rover components and regolith, and by the inclusion of volatiles such as water ice of multiple forms (e.g. vapor deposited “frost”, blocky deposits, and icy regolith mixtures) in a grain-based DEM model. Rover components including probes, drills, wheels, and soil sampling equipment will be simulated using coupled FEM software to reduce computation time. A coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical model will further be explored for its suitability in simulating volatile phase change and gas transport through cryogenic regolith as represented by a bonded-particle DEM. These numerical modeling capabilities will be integrated within a single, easy to use simulation framework for approximating thermal and mechanical interactions between rovers and regolith across ranges of possible conditions which may be encountered in and near PSRs on the Moon. These combined numerical tools will enable NASA and its partners to inexpensively evaluate hardware designs for lunar ISRU missions aimed at exploration and prospecting for volatiles. These improved modeling capabilities will further de-risk planned missions to the lunar south pole by identifying successful control strategies and hardware designs for ISRU sampling, material handling, increased rover operability, and surviving the lunar night, leading to more rugged and capable rovers for lunar polar missions while reducing their costs related to development and testing.","This project leads to many potential NASA applications including the design and evaluation of rovers and sampling equipment for use in lunar polar regions for ISRU prospecting and exploration missions.

For this phase I, NASA has identified a need to improve measurement accuracy, reduce external processing of sensor data for the spacecraft, reduce SWaP, and operate in dust and illumination effects during EDL. ASC’s roadmap of improvements to the GSFL resolves these current short comings of the current state of the art sensors for EDL. To meet NASA’s identified needs, ASC plans to implement additional processing capacity in the GSFL and embed Hazard avoidance, NASA’s Super Resolution, and other algorithms to increase measurement accuracy, precision, and resolution; while offloading the external processing of the spacecraft to the GSFL. ASC has plans to reconfigure the TRL9 GoldenEye GSFL into a Compact Modular flash LIDAR (CMFL) that is low power, and ½ the size and weight of the GoldenEye. ASC will also implement new functions in the space GSFL that have been proven in the terrestrial applications for imaging and ranging through dust. The GSFL also operates in total darkness and direct sunlight.

During terminal descent, lander maneuvers include vehicle reorientation to facilitate surface relative sensing and using propulsion to divert away from hazards. During EDL, precise knowledge of the spacecraft state, as well as the properties of the landing area, are critically important. The NDL directly measures radial velocity and line of sight distance, providing precise knowledge of the vehicle state estimates relative to the landing surface. The unprecedented velocity accuracy provided by the NDL is due to the continuous wave (CW) lidar waveform. As such, the only way to obtain distance measurements is to modulate the waveform. The Linear frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) waveform employed provides distance measurements without compromising the accuracy of the velocity measurements. We propose an innovative integrated opto-electronic device hybridized into a new chip-scale waveform modulation system for Navigation Doppler Lidar.

D. Miller & Associates (SDMA) developed methods of embedding materials into fiber matrices to enhance their thermal properties.  Silica aerogel was embedded into an alumina fiber matrix to create Flexible Insulation with a Reinforced Aerogel (FIRA).  In the current Phase I effort, a High Temperature FIRA (HTFIRA) will be demonstrated by embedding aerogel with a higher temperature capability.  Since commercially available aerogel blankets are currently limited to 1200OF, producing HTFIRA with a scalable manufacturing process would be a significant advance in the state-of-the-art.  The re-entry trajectory and payload capacity of Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs) are limited by the materials in the Thermal Protection System (TPS).  For example, the TPS on the LOFTID (Low-Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator) uses carbon felt and silica aerogel that degrade during re-entry when temperatures can exceed 2800OF.  Replacing all or part of these layers with HTFIRA will allow higher heating rates without degradation, facilitating heavier payloads and more direct re-entry trajectories.  HTFIRA will also be more flexible, lighter and more compact than the existing TPS materials, further increasing the payload capacity of HIAD.  In Phase I, SDMA will collaborate with NASA Glenn Research Center to make aerogel.  SDMA will then embed that aerogel in an alumina fiber matrix to demonstrate HTFIRA.   Thermal properties will be determined.  In a parallel effort in preparation for Phase II and III, SDMA will investigate the scalability of the aerogel manufacturing process and the compatibility of HTFIRA with the fabrication methods developed for the TPS of LOFTID.  HTFIRA promises a significant improvement in TPS for multiple Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) strategies including HIAD and controlled flight through planetary atmospheres.","NASA will test LOFTID in 2022.  Future inflatable decelerators will be used for getting humans to the surface of Mars, to recover booster engines after launch, to haul equipment back from the International Space Station, to return materials like fiber optic cables manufactured in space, and as emergency evacuation vehicles for crews working in orbit.  HTFIRA will reduce the weight and bulk of the TPS on these vehicles, increasing the capacity for fuel and payload, and allow better optimization of the re-entry trajectory.","HTFIRA will let commercial space companies deliver payloads to Mars for less money. Whether you use rockets or inflatable decelerators to land on Mars, the thin atmosphere and larger payloads mean higher heating rates. HTFIRA will reduce costs by enabling larger payloads.

Each key cost-driven optical communication terminal sub-system has been carefully considered to enable a number of key cost-saving high-performance innovations into our proposed RDI SCOUT.  Precision (microradian)-pointing actuator and motors are vital for optical communications.  We propose lowering system complexity and cost with a new-class of high-performance ultra-high-vacuum compatible motors that are widely used in the manufacturing industry.  The RDI SCOUT terminal uses an innovative small-aperture structure small spacecraft antenna (telescope).  The SCOUT terminal opto-mechanical structure uses new materials with high strength-to-weight ratio that are robust against thermal deformation. The new material is low-cost, widely available, readily manufacturable and amenable to compression-molding mass production. Low-cost high-performance telecommunications integrated photonic transceiver are at the heart of the RDI SCOUT modem. RDI SCOUT will use an open data format for compatibility and interoperability with lunar communications and navigation architecture plans.  RDI SCOUT incorporates dual (comm and nav) functionality to enable clock-recovery based sub-millimeter laser ranging and precision pointing-knowledge for optical navigation with sub-arcsecond accuracy.  A lander or orbiter system could provide valuable calibrated navigation range/angle data using both active terminals and passive corner-cubes.

To address this technology need, SkyGig is bringing innovative approaches to antenna design through a unique antenna architecture with high-gain electronic beamforming, low SWaP-C, and low-profile modular configuration. With an order of magnitude improvement, the proposed Ka-band technology significantly enhances link capacity, reliability, and latency in the communication system and can a play a pivotal role is a variety of NASA small spacecraft missions and programs: (1) Inter-Satellite Links (ISL) in DSM configurations, where SkyGig’s technology enables much higher aggregated throughput and reliability with lower latency in the ISL network.

Furthermore, a series of spacecraft in lunar or Martian orbit can use this system to provide PNTC services to nearby.  The growth of the CubeSat industry over the past decade and the related increase in launch opportunities for these spacecraft couple with the need by NASA users for improved PNT services and increased data collection capabilities combine to make the development of the PNTC terminal not just desirable for current users, but enabling of future missions requiring orders of magnitude more precise PNT services.","This system is an enabling technology for swarms of spacecraft collecting data in a coordinated fashion; and precision navigation, timing and communication services necessary for operations in cis-lunar and Martian orbits.

In the magsail deorbiting system, a loop of aluminum or copper wire is deployed at the end of life of an Earth orbiting spacecraft, and energized with an electric current, producing a magnetic field. The magnetic field forces the wire into a circular loop, and creates a small magnetosphere around the spacecraft. This magnetosphere in tern then creates drag against the ambient plasma surrounding the Earth, causing the spacecraft to deorbit. For typical configurations, the magsail wire mass required to create a drag area of a given size is two orders of magnitude less than that needed using solar sail or any other physical material. In addition to being a uniquely advantageous technology for LEO spacecraft deorbiting, the normal-conducting magsail can serve as a precursor technology to superconducting magsails capable of generating sufficient field to effectively propel interplanetary spacecraft using the momentum flux of the solar wind. In the proposed program, the potential performance of the magsail deorbiting system will be analyzed, design options compared, deployment and operation simulated, and the concept validated by means of computer analysis and laboratory tests.","Magsails using normal conductors can lower spacecraft orbits around Earth, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Titan, Uranus or Neptune  Magsails could be used to enable reusable orbit transfer vehicles or TLI stages to return to LEO without requiring either the expenditure of propellant or aerobraking.

The proposed DragSail system is based upon a restowable and redeployable concept that allows for increase or decrease of surface area thus modulating aerodynamic drag of the system.  Modulation of the drag will allow the system to guide small spacecraft to specific locations at the Von Karman altitude, which is necessary for precision reentry targeting.  The primary objective of this DragSail design is to deorbit small spacecraft from LEO altitudes in 25 years or less using a modular DragSail system with minimal weight and stowage volume.  The proposed DragSail system is based on NeXolve-developed lightweight solar sail and deployment system technologies.  The concept design consists of ultralightweight polyimide thin-film material that is attached to a deployable boom structure to create a flexible DragSail system with shape morphing capability.  A key feature of this DragSail system is its ability to deploy as a 2-D structure and then shape morph into a 3-D structure that allows drag in all orbital orientations.  Another attractive feature of the design is that the system is a self-contained unit that can be attached to many different types of CubeSats and small satellites.

There is a need to develop a lunar transfer stage for small rocket launch vehicles to deliver a 25 kg satellite payload to lunar orbit. This transfer stage needs to be capable but compact. It should also be low cost and safe, which can be achieved by utilizing new non-toxic “green” propellants. Lynntech, along with a large industry team and AFRL, proposes to use a proprietary “green” monopropellant engine and PMD tank to develop a transfer stage that is compact, efficient, and cost-effective for the delivery of payloads. This monopropellant was flight-proven in 2019 and is ready for general use. In Phase I, we will define the mission, perform analysis, ground-test a propulsion element, and identify all necessary components and team members in preparation for demonstration and delivery in Phase II.","The proposed technology can be utilized to transfer satellites from TLI to NRHO as well as to orbit other planets in support of NASA missions. Lynntech’s revolutionary engine could enable low-cost exploration of the Solar System while making launch operations safer. The engine is scalable so higher thrust levels are achieved with minor changes to the injector, enabling necessary delta-V burns. Our proprietary PMD technology could also allow for effective square or rectangular PMD tanks that maximize space utilization aboard CubeSats.",The proposed technology is of general applicability to rocket transfer stages from LEO to GEO (for military and commercial satellites). The growth of the orbital economy will depend on low-cost movement and placement of satellites which this system will provide. The propulsion system could also be used to create agile satellites for greater survivability in military operations.

At the same time, accelerating spacecraft development schedules mean less time available for fully custom system implementation on every project.  Spacecraft system developers and operators need commonality for avionic and sensor subsystem integration.  Common components, software, interface specifications support technology reuse, speeding development and testing, lowering costs and significantly improving system reliability. Simultaneously, spacecraft must benefit from the latest wireless communications, sensors, avionics and component technologies.  Short-range (i.e. wireless local area networks, WLAN or Wi-Fi) systems have now evolved to support the high level of reliability required by small spacecraft avionics system and sensor interconnectivity.  This makes practical wireline to wireless replacement for a large part of spacecraft’s internal and nearby communications requirements. Wireless communications replacing wires is likely to reduce size, weight and power (SWaP); however, more importantly, this change simplifies and adds flexibility to system development and maintenance.  Simplification also fosters common interfacing and thereby subsystem component and software reuse.  New Wi-Fi systems support higher data rates often exceeding those of legacy wired systems.  The ease of adding redundancy to these systems as well improves overall system reliability. Innoflight’s radiation hardened Wi-Fi systems development provides a path to more efficient, reliable and cost effective spacecraft avionics and sensor system implementation.","By leveraging Innoflight’s high reliability WLAN technology, the wireless communication system can be integrated into radiation hardened flight hardware and surrounded with an intelligent object-oriented management system thus making it an asset for NASA’s Lunar to Mars mission and other potential customers interested in future space exploration. Potential customers include companies integrating spacecraft or aircraft (including UAV/UAS), companies developing subsystems for use on these vehicles, a variety of NASA and DoD offices, and so forth.","Considering that this is a core technology with applicability to a tremendous portion of these markets, we expect a large potential customer base.

I-WIN revolves around a plug-and-play framework and to enable a network-centric communications link for avionics and sensor components. This software architecture, coupled with highly configurable and advanced manufactured embedded hardware, develops a system focused on interoperability between subsystems and sensors and avionics applications. I-WIN provides an adaptable and modular architecture for innovative avionics, transforming both current and future satellite systems into wireless component networks (WCN). These WCNs can be configured at run-time reducing systems engineering costs, data distribution complexities, and enables the use of commercial-off-the-shelf components. Using Intelligent Wireless Modules (IWM), the self-configuring architecture is enabled without the use of predefined configurations of the components. I-WIN and IWMs provide an inherent fault tolerance and dynamic fault management system coupled with a low size, weight, and power (Low-SWaP) sensing solution for spacecraft. The packaged solution will be developed, and preliminarily evaluated during this Phase I research effort using software and hardware-in-the-loop setups available for this project. The proposed solutions will be capable of augmenting existing early stage mission architectures increasing autonomy and reliability and will also provide a baseline for a wireless spacecraft avionics for future space missions and operations. I-WIN will provide a theoretical and experimental framework for development and demonstration of wireless technologies to increase space system capabilities, reduce integration and design complexities, and produce a rapid response avionics package capable of using advanced manufacturing techniques.

Yet these structures are complex, creating challenges for engineers who are designing, analyzing and testing new systems. Often, the prudent engineering response is to build in more safety margin than is needed to ensure the system will not fail. New passive wireless sensors that can accurately measure the strain on parachutes and inflatable structures would enable engineers to understand the behavior of these complex systems better, allowing them to develop more accurate simulation tools and design structures that will meet mission needs with adequate safety margins without unnecessary additional weight and cost. Individually identifiable wireless sensors that can be deployed in multiple positions across a flexible structure and read by a centralized reader would enable dynamic measurement of strain during system deployment. To meet mission needs, including long storage periods prior to deployment and long use lives, passive wireless sensors (without any batteries to change) are ideal. We propose the use of innovative passive wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) based strain sensors or sensor-tags for near real-time strain measurement in parachutes and inflatable habitats. These devices can be produced in sets of tens up to a hundred or so individually identifiable devices, that work together and can be read simultaneously by data aggregators without inter-sensor interference. The sensor-tags can be read wirelessly over a range of tens of meters or more depending on transmit power limitations and environment. Successful completion of the proposed effort will evaluate the technical feasibility of both flexible SAW strain sensors and a new type of hybrid strain sensor. The proposed work will provide a basis needed to prototype a complete strain sensor system in Phase II","The proposed passive wireless flexible strain sensors will provide distributed near-real-time data on parachutes and inflatable structures as they deploy, and over the life of the structure. Programs with inflatable vehicles and/or parachutes that could benefit from the proposed sensors include the Bloostar launch vehicle by Zero2Infinity, which uses parachutes for platform recovery on launch abort, and the  Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle by ULA, for aerial recovery of the booster engines, avionics, and thrust structure after module descent.","The proposed passive wireless flexible strain sensors will likely have commercially significant terrestrial applications in areas such as instrumented clothing, and in medical fields such as orthopedics, physical therapy, prosthetics, and kinesiology. Virtual reality and gaming is also another area where gloves equipped with flexible stretch/movement sensors are an emerging product sector."

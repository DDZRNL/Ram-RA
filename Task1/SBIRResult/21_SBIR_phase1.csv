These vehicles center on the use of Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) and offer several benefits in terms of faster, safer, quieter, more efficient and environmentally friendly transportation of passengers and goods. These vehicles are nonetheless complex to design, due, amongst others to the greater number of control effectors present relative to traditional fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. In addition to conventional control surfaces, each propeller can act as a control effector that influences aircraft dynamic behavior. Control effector actuation stems from flight control laws that are developed after the aircraft design has been finalized. As such, flight control laws are not currently accounted for in the aircraft design process. Inclusion of flight controls within multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) of DEP aircraft can result in more efficient and novel designs. The proposed effort aims to develop a modular MDO software framework for DEP aircraft design that will couple flight controls together with key disciplines such as aerodynamics and structures to meet this need. Resulting designs will leverage the inclusion of open- and closed-loop flight control parameters in the optimization to tailor aircraft sizing and performance. A prototype framework will be developed to demonstrate proof of concept in Phase I. An application case study using notional DEP aircraft configuration as baseline will be performed to demonstrate tool viability and assess efficiency.","The development and application of the proposed tool will directly support NASA’s ARMD Strategic Thrust #3 “Ultra-Efficient Subsonic Transports” and Strategic Thrust #4 “Safe, Quiet, and Affordable Vertical Lift Air Vehicles” since the inclusion of flight controls in DEP aircraft design is expected to produce novel, efficient, and cost-effective vehicle designs for both long-haul transportations, as well as inter- and intra-city UAM applications.",CDI provides engineering services and licenses software to multiple eVTOL companies and industry teams responsible for engineering analyses of large-scale DoD Future Vehicle Lift (FVL) aircraft development programs. The proposed capability will be of immediate use to these entities and will significantly reduce the number of design iterations in their aircraft design cycles.

Current MDO design results may take into account many disciplines in the design resulting in an optimized aircraft, only to be locally re-optimized based on engineering performed post-aircraft configuration lock related to flight control, resulting in less efficient and less capable aircraft. Electric and hybrid-electric aircraft with distributed propulsion provide significant advantages such as significantly reduced stall speeds and dramatically increased power efficiency (>50%) (X-57).   Software weighs nothing, so there always a push to move the problem downstream for controllers to manage in software, effectively trading bits for atoms.  The net result may be the control system requires faster than available actuation, inadequate control authority, or large feedback gains to stabilize unstable dynamics.  These issues are costly to uncover late in the system development, since typically flight controller work takes place after the configuration and outer-mode-line (OML) has been locked.   It is essential to the success of hybrid and urban air mobility aircraft to include controllability of the aircraft within the aircraft optimization design. After decades of designing and flying flight controllers for new types of hybrid and distributed propulsion aircraft, our goal is to get add a controllability component to MDO to ensure the aircraft designed make the right trades and adjustments for flight controls.  Rather than throw a controller MDO cycle into the middle of the aircraft MDO, the controllability problem is broken down into a series of targeted hierarchical Components that contribute to the monolithic optimization suitable for the nonlinear and linear solvers in OpenMDO.","The proposed controllability component has far-reaching benefits, since it will become clear later in the development of new types of aircraft that control’s-related constraints were accounted for.  This will accelerate the urban air mobility research and distributed electric thrust by providing new designs that are more capable than ever before.","It often takes many years beyond aircraft MDO before the control-related issues become clear and there’s not enough programmatic time or money to compensate.  This has the potential to save many companies and programs. Applications include UAM aircraft, STOL distributed propulsion aircraft, and delivery drones more effective and with more stability and maneuver margin."

Several manufacturers, as well as, NASA, have come up with concepts for UAM aircraft; mostly using Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP). However, the multidisciplinary interactions involved and the ability to utilize the distributed propulsors for improved control are not fully understood. In particular there is a need to incorporate control surface and controller design in the design framework and account for aeroservoelastic interactions. To achieve this, we are developing the ADEPt, a design optimization architecture that includes multidisciplinary analyses for integrated airframe-DEP design. This technology, if successful, can push the state of the art in UAM aircraft concept design and DEP enabled aircraft in general.","The AAM project at NASA (and UTM as well) will directly benefit from this research, in terms of availing the true benefits of DEP-enabled aircraft.

This work is aimed at fulfilling the aerospace industry’s need for economically viable sensing technology that meets required metrics for flight testing for a broad class of fluctuating pressure measurement use cases including noise source location, noise shielding effects, noise source interaction effects (such as engine/airframe interactions), boundary layer measurement/characterization, and high-gradient flow investigations; essentially, any on-body fluctuating pressure field problem of interest whether it includes propagating acoustics, hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations, or a combination of both.  The proposed flat-pack microphones will be batch fabricated using micromachining technologies to enable low cost per device, tight phase matching, and consistent device performance.  Silicon vias will be integrated into the sensor structure to enable backside electrical connection to the piezoelectric ring.  The sensors will be mounted into ultra-low profile (≤1.0 mm thick) flat-pack housings along with low-power signal conditioning electronics, analog-to-digital conversion electronics, and custom fairings to enable measurements with minimal disturbance to the flow.  The digital data output capability of the microphones may be serialized and converted to an optical signal for transmission through the airplane fuselage, thus eliminating the need to drive analog signals over long cables, the need to penetrate the fuselage with every signal cable, and the need for a lightning arrester for every channel to mitigate the potential impacts of a lightning strike while in flight.","The proposed instrumentation technology has the potential to be usable in multiple NASA ground- and flight-test facilities as well as implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities. The target application for entry into NASA is instrumentation for full-scale flight tests for noise source localization to evaluate noise shielding effects and engine/airframe interactions and  to perform fluctuating boundary layer pressure measurement/characterization.","The initial target market is in-flight pressure sensors for the aerospace industry (commercial & government/military), or use in flight-test R&D.

Techsburg and AVEC’s proposal “Design Cycle Modeling Tool for Wing-Strut Junction Flow Noise” addresses a technology analysis gap in the development of a leading airframe concept, the Transonic Truss Braced Wing (TTBW) aircraft. The aeroacoustic signatures of the large bracing strut and jury member features of this configuration need to be studied with appropriate modeling to enable design cycle input based on far field noise estimates of these features. We propose to produce a database of hemisphere noise levels (1/3 octave band) using PowerFLOW CFD, with an accompanying model based on machine learning for design cycle trades of this noise source.

One of the main degradation mechanisms at high temperature (>1200 °C) is due to calcia-magnesia-alumina-silicate (CMAS) deposit. Under this SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations LLC will utilize its expertise in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and Materials by Design® approach to design multilayer thermal-environmental barrier coatings (T-EBCs) with improved environmental durability for enhanced performance of advanced CMC engine components. While EBC such as ytterbium disilicate is promising for protection against volatilization of thermally grown oxide, it is ineffective as a long-term protection against CMAS attack. Phase I will focus on development of a multiphase TBC with desired properties such as high reactivity with CMAS, high fracture toughness, low thermal conductivity and small coefficient of thermal expansion. This multiphase TBC acts as sacrificial layer by promoting reactive crystallization to mitigate CMAS infiltration and protect underlying materials from CMAS attack. QuesTek will leverage computational thermodynamic models and databases to predict CMAS-coating interactions and develop a CMAS-resistant multilayer T-EBC capable of extended performance at temperatures at or above 1482°C by the end of Phase II.

To enable these systems, thermal management systems (TMS) are needed which can be scaled to the power ranges required while providing the efficiency and power density that makes these technologies compelling. ThermAvant Technologies, LLC proposes a novel TMS based on the company’s flagship technology: structurally embedded oscillating heat pipes (OHPs). The OHP is a passive two-phase heat transfer device that relies on concentrated heat loads to passively drive a working fluid through a high-density array of microchannels, which are ideal for embedding within thin structures such as a structural skin. Without the need for the wick structures of their conventional predecessor heat pipes, OHPs are especially well suited for integration into materials within which it is difficult to construct traditional heat pipes. In addition to the absence of a wick structure, the OHP’s unique I-beam architecture (formed by the walls between the microchannels) enables the structure to be multifunctional and serve as a structural member with integrated passive thermal management. Furthermore, through the use of additive manufacturing technology, these devices can be deeply integrated within the structure of EAP systems. These high-conductance, embedded devices will provide significant improvements to power density by both decreasing thermal impedance and reducing mass, and provide additional design freedom for the layout of heat generating components within the EAP system while still providing improved thermal performance. To provide further performance optimization under both transient and steady-state conditions, energy storage devices will be evaluated to independently optimize the conductive and capacitive properties of the heat sink.","NASA's Electrified Aircraft Propulsion project resides within the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate Strategic Thrust 4: Transition to Low-Carbon Propulsion.

This approach reduces electro-thermal stresses at the windings, which are traditionally viewed as the most vulnerable sub-system in motors for electric aircraft. The significantly improved dielectric protection extends the SOA on several fronts including thermal degradation, insulation quality, and partial discharge, preventing winding failure while retaining high power density and system-level benefits. The system offers enhanced electro-thermal performance with the unique infusion of cooling and magnetics, alleviating the iron yoke as a thermal bottleneck, reducing ΔT between the heatsink and coils, and creating sufficient thermal headroom to enhance the coil insulation without degrading motor performance. Combined with modular manufacturing and pre-qualification of the coil assembly offering independent quality assurance, this provides a path to meet NASA requirements for high reliability and safety in cost-effective, mass production. During Phase I, HINETICS will demonstrate the feasibility of MAGICA through a combination of computer modeling, design optimization, and fabrication and test of a laboratory prototype, which will reduce development risk in Phase II. MAGICA is currently at TRL 2; in Phase II, HINETICS plans to expand the capabilities of the MAGICA into a functional motor prototype at TRL 6. The demonstrated results will offer NASA capability to improve motor performance while prioritizing utmost reliability.","When complete, MAGICA will help improve the safety and reliability of the electrical motors used in UAM powertrains. Hinetics has developed a series of machines ranging from the 20-500 kW class, relevant to the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) project’s concept vehicles, to MW-class high speed machines for the Electrified Aircraft Propulsion program within ARMD. These motors can be readily retrofitted with MAGICA to increase reliability as we scale to volume production.","MAGICA enables reliable, safe operation of high power UAM aircraft. This will have uses for Government applications such as civil and military disaster relief, search and rescue, medical evacuation, firefighting, and commercial applications such as urban air mobility and cargo transport. With little alteration, MAGICA will also be capable of motors for commercial hybrid-electric regional aircraft."

The final PHM system will consist of a microcomputer or FPGA loaded with a fault detection algorithm connected to the sensors in an inverter. This stage will focus on refining the algorithm. Past ESAero PHM used deep autoencoder, but convolutional autoencoder, a recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) units, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) will be investigated as alternatives and improvements. ESAero will add additional software functions of fault classification and remaining useful life.

This effort will utilize ESAero’s large depository of X57 test data taking during prototype and acceptance testing. PHM will “operate” on the data and detect and predict faults recorded in the X57 tests. This will demonstrate PHM’s capability, performance, requirements, and reduce risks before entering hardware design. Planning ahead, ESAero will investigate the certification and regulations that will be applicable to PHM. ESAero will develop a risk mitigation plan to overcome regulatory barriers. The product of this research will lead to the development of PHM requirements for UAM inverters. In addition, ESAero will begin prototype component selection which will verify currently available hardware can meet these requirements.","This effort will add understanding of health and remaining useful life (RUL) of inverters for electric UAM.

Today, we have demonstrated best-in-class thermionic performance using novel materials and manufacturing techniques, as well as fully encapsulated prototypes meeting solicitation targets, including power density (1-10 W/cm2). Using these devices as a baseline, we propose to develop a new design that is compatible with harvesting heat directly from high temperature surfaces in the vehicle, relying on existing thermal pathways within the vehicle to simultaneously generate electricity while thereby displacing and reducing the vehicle thermal load. These devices can increase the Mach number in any vehicle and we believe will be enabling for long-duration and reusable hypersonic vehicles. If successful, our solution will add virtually no extra weight or volume vs the existing skin / liner, becoming the “APU” for all next-generation long-duration hypersonic vehicles.","Development of hypersonic capabilities is “the highest technical priority” according to Dr. Michael Griffin, DoD Under Secretary for Research and Engineering. However, for reusable and long-duration hypersonic vehicles, no good way to power the vehicle currently exists: a standard APU is not compatible with the lack of moving parts in typical hypersonic propulsion systems. For reusable and long-duration vehicles, of strong interest to NASA, we propose thermionics can become the ""APU,"" generating power from existing high-T waste heat streams.","The applications outside of NASA are numerous for Spark's uniquely high power density technology.

NASA needs innovative solutions to fulfill requirements, close capability gaps, and provide technological advancements. To address this major issue, LeNgineer has begun the development of an Artificial Intelligence software called Multidisciplinary Instrument Tool and Analysis (MITA), which can be further advanced and customized for integrated use in the in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP), the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) and Flight Demonstrations and Capabilities (FDC) projects. Currently, there is no software in the market that integrates into NASA systems in such a way that MITA does, making the current process highly inefficient. Without the proper technology for rapid data processing, there is a decrease in efficient data capture and analysis that doesn’t allow a system to make accurate predictions. The machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities of MITA would be able to make predictions and capture/analyze data in a manner more efficient than ever before while decreasing the overall energy consumption. MITA functions as an RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) base to test and analyze the existing launch systems, including those currently implemented at NASA. The RTU delivers and receives information from the system as a multipurpose device for remote monitoring and control of various automation systems. MITA seeks to improve the control of in-flight test conditions, expand measurement and analysis methodologies and improve test data acquisition and management. MITA can detect issues in real-time and has the capability to present solutions or work to resolve the problem.",,"MITA can be applied for environmental, manufacturing, process control, and medical devices. The tool is designed to be a testing schema to analyze systems by taking in multiple data sources to validate itself. MITA is aimed to be distributed among various industries as a basic package that would include all the necessary hardware components and base software for testing, analysis, and predictions."

The Vertical Flight Society is tracking the progress of these vehicle concepts via a web portal that currently identifies over 130 vectored thrust, nearly 60 lift plus cruise configurations, and over 100 wingless multicopters. Many of these vehicles have flown as scaled proof of concepts, while several others are now flying as full-scale prototypes. These vehicles almost exclusively feature fly-by-wire flight control systems including advanced control modes (i.e., response augmentation), increased automation, and autonomous systems of varying levels. Following the Simplified Vehicle Operations (SVO) and progression of the UAM Maturity Levels (UML), technological, infrastructure, and certification advancements are required to ultimately lead to fully autonomous operations. Because of the complexities involved in control system design, autonomous systems, and operating environments, new certification means of compliance methods are needed to ensure safe operations within the national airspace, especially dense urban environments. To address this critical need, a team led by Systems Technology, Inc. (STI) proposes to develop the Simulation-based Automation and Failure Evaluations (SAFE) system, easily exercised via a tablet-based computer, that will provide a means of compliance certification method for autonomous and degraded modes that is safe, repeatable, and discriminating.",This proposal addresses ARMD Strategic Thrust 5 In-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance and Thrust 6 Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation as SAFE provides a certification process for autonomous systems. SAFE directly supports NASA’s RVLT Project and its goal to develop tools that “overcome key barriers to the expanded use of vertical lift configurations in the nation’s airspace.” SAFE is directly applicable to the National Campaign and its “goal to promote public confidence and accelerate the realization of emerging aviation markets...”,"The target commercial market for SAFE is the burgeoning urban air mobility market. The estimated market size will be $15.2 billion by 2030. All the emerging vehicles that operate in the US will need to go through a certification process with the FAA thereby defining the market for SAFE, which will be introduced as a tablet-based software system as well as a productized service to support its use"

Nokomis’ approach to identify functionality and health diagnostic data relies on identifying changes in unintended RF emissions and characterizing them using a hybrid of spectral quantification metrics and machine learning algorithms.  Nokomis proposes to create a system which can autonomously monitor system and subsystem health to identify possible critical failures or unsafe states and monitor electronics with no a priori knowledge to detect meaningful variations from emissions baseline indicative of critical states. This will allow for more efficient and direct reaction to critical states and allow for countermeasures to protect the system prior to system failure. The autonomous nature of the system addresses trends towards unsafe states without relying on operator response. Most electronic devices have precipitous changes in emissions when under a stress state indicative of system degradation which can rapidly lead to system faults. When the frequency spectrum data is processed via algorithms to quantify these changes, the signal extracted by analysis algorithms clearly differentiates between safe and stressed system states.  In this effort, Nokomis will develop a methodology to allow for the fault monitoring of electronics without a priori knowledge of the emissions of a standard condition. The proposed effort will autonomously discriminate these critical system faults from changes in emissions related to background changes, normal changes in operation, or expected normal wear.","The primary application of this technology is use by unmanned vehicles to provide a safety system to identify any threats to vehicle performance and mission.  Safety and reliability of electronic subsystems and equipment is crucial to the success of a space mission, as failure of a single component can lead to a catastrophic failure or cripple mission. The real-time threat analysis system will enhance vehicle safety without the need for an operator to either identify issues or initiate measures to compensate for unsafe operating states.","Nokomis has identified a significant need in the commercial market for autonomous vehicle, especially drone, safety. As the drone market is rapidly expanding, the detection of safety faults and avoiding critical failures will be an important factor in the wider implementation of UAS in commercial applications such as law enforcement, surveying, precision agriculture, and commercial delivery."

We predict the number of interactions between agents will climb in orders of magnitude in the future. In terms of the demand, access to these modes of transport will also increase, which will push for safety, security, and efficiency improvements. When we compare the current transportation methods and Air Mobility's impact, all the possible interactions are hard to describe, plan, and simulate. These perceived challenges are just the tip of the iceberg for logistics, technology, and resource allocation. The computer gaming industry has grown to become a large and vital market, spending an exorbitant amount of money developing new game engines. The final product's price is inconsequential compared to a professional 3D simulation/visualization/animation tool and its development costs. The idea of using gaming platforms' potential for other purposes than gaming seems clear to us. To this end, we propose the selection of an appropriate gaming engine platform using the relevant metrics for a project we have called DIGEST (DIgital Game Engine data acquisition and Screening Tool). Also, we plan to combine our knowledge in industrial automation and simulation to create a functional Digital Twin and Synthetic Environment prototype in Phase I of a model city integrated with an Orchestration Simulation Tool (OST) for Advanced Air Mobility planning solutions in combination with other modes of transportation, considering safety, security, scalability, jurisdiction, and area of application, while reducing time and cost of deployment.

The objective of Phase I is to implement an infrasonic processing system that classifies infrasound as originating from a region of aircraft-scale turbulence. Previous theoretical and observational studies have found that infrasound associated with atmospheric turbulence exhibits a power-law spectrum with low overall coherence, a feature shared by infrasonic emissions from atmospheric convection. Therefore the initial classifier design will compare infrasonic signal characteristics with convective indicators such as NEXRAD and lightning strike data. The existence of aircraft scale turbulence will be determined by collecting in situ pilot reports in the region of the infrasonic sensor array. The classifier will be applied to data measured by an array of three highly sensitive, NASA-developed electret microphones. An off-the-shelf spatiotemporal database containing infrasonic analyses and meteorological data will enable an innovative data analysis with two aims. First, the performance of the classifier will be gauged by a sensitivity analysis and by studying missed events/false alarms for physical insight. Second, the detected turbulence events will be used to develop a more complete model of infrasonic emissions from aircraft-scale turbulence.

The RiBT will be used in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations by human Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) and Autonomous vehicles in the Flight Planning and En Route phases of flight. RiBT enhances trajectory based operations (TBO) for UAS by providing a rigorous safety facet to optimizing trajectories within the National Air Space (NAS) – enhancing “safe, end-to-end TBO”, as described in the topic and the FAA NextGen 2025 Trajectory Based Operations goals. The service based design of the proposed RiBT solution supports the service architecture design of UTM and further enables the “integration of independent systems and domains, and increasingly diverse and unconventional operations” by creating common understanding of the relative risk of the airspace. RiBT supports Thrust 1 of the AMRD Strategic Plan (NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, Strategic Implementation Plan, 2019 Update) by supporting the safe integration of UAS through consistent risk assessment and application to trajectory.  RiBT addresses the research theme of Safety Management and Emergent Risks in Thrust 1 by hosting and delivering multiple prognostic risk estimates, in real time, to all NAS participants; supporting safety assurance in a NAS with increased traffic volume and diversity of operations. ATA will provide a fully functional RiBT prototype at a NASA Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 with a testing and performance metrics for validation and verification.

AirWAZE moves this process further forward, capitalizing on available technology and with crowd-sourced inputs exponentially broadens common situational awareness for improved CDM results. Through simple inputs and with easily understood icons, the community can rapidly alert to safety events (icing, turbulence, wind shear), and inefficiencies (holding, vectors, departure delays) thereby having useful, actionable information for flight and fleet planning decisions. This concept includes a “NAS Chat” feature to accommodate amplifying event information providing a running record to allow self-briefing at any time for improved situational awareness.

Our proposed innovation is directly relevant to subtopic A3.03 Future Aviation System Safety and fills two critical gaps in the state-of-the-art.  First, it allows for the continuous monitoring of the arrival domain of the NAS and fuses diverse data sets including airborne trajectory, surface tracking, air traffic automation, and weather data to identify the precursors to a key indicator of risk in the system (i.e., a go-around). Second, it applies innovative machine learning (ML) techniques to build and train a model using historic go-around occurrences in order to predict go-around safety margins in real time. A key outcome in the first decade of ISSA-related research is improved safety through initial real-time detection and alerting of hazards at the domain level and decision support for limited operations.  Our proposed innovation directly addresses this outcome by focusing on the near-airport (within 10 miles) domain to identify risks to stakeholders (e.g., air traffic controllers and pilots) in enough time (before a go-around is necessary) for them to employ effective risk mitigations. Through the combination of a real-time data input stream and a ML based predictive model, the software service allows for the continuous computation of the probability of a go-around. Results can be updated and displayed to operators (i.e., air traffic controllers and pilots) as each arrival flight approaches the airport.

Risk assessments of UAS in the air space have been performed by US DOT Volpe Center and NASA Langley Research Center. They identified hazards, estimated their probabilities and risk mitigations in case a failure occurs. Many of the risks that UAS pose to the air space and ground communities are evolving. We propose to develop engineering models of the 3-D, time-dependent hazard trajectory volume that travels with the UAS in case of a failure. This volume is larger than a projection of the crash area on the ground as some UAS may glide for a distance while others may spin before crashing. We will focus on the key failure scenarios addressed in prior studies such that our results complement the state-of-the-art by defining the potential severity of the failure as a function of space and time. The actual severity will depend on the intersection of these hazard volumes with other UAS or vulnerable people or assets. As the UAS follows its trajectory, the hazard trajectory volume of a failure change and the risk changes accordingly. In Phase I, we will develop engineering models of the dynamics and flow characteristics of six failure scenarios that will relate the hazard volume shape and size swept by the UAV. This model will be tied to key parameters of the vehicle, its operation, and environment. This hazard volume will move and evolve with the UAV from the instant of failure to crash. In Phase II, we will couple our hazard volume model with probability of failure models to identify, quantify, and prioritize risks to the air space. Furthermore, our model will be tied to real-time data collected from the UAVs including their identity and locations as function of time, so the hazard volume evolves in time.","This fast-running model can be used offline in the development stage of the IASMS. This model will be used in the flight planning stage to give an idea of what density of UAS is acceptable as a function of each UAS’s capability and characteristics, as well as environmental variables such as wind velocity and weather. The Hazard Volume model can also be expanded to be used in the IASMS to give risk calculations of the airspace in real time, as a component of an advanced collision avoidance system.","The model can be incorporated into any larger system that involves the autonomous management of more than one UAS in close proximity, such as avoiding catastrophic chain reaction events, as well as identifying the risk of using UAS around vulnerable assets and personnel. This model can be used in construction work, emergency responses (e.g.: firefighting, search and rescue)."

Further, most of these flights are expected to employ electric propulsion vertical takeoff/landing aircraft (eVTOL). While eVTOLs offer many advantages over conventional gasoline fueled aircraft, huge strides are needed in battery or energy storage technologies to enable long duration flights. The immediate implication for this is that airborne eVTOLs may not have large reserves of energy to implement congestion mitigation procedures such as hold patterns. Further, current technology requires many hours to recharge the batteries on these aircraft, which implies that the UAM operators require accurate predictions of available airspace capacity to schedule their operations and manage their fleet’s energy resources. Given this situation, there is a need for accurate estimation of available capacity and how the prevalent demand can be balanced to take full advantage of this capacity, also known as demand capacity balancing (DCB). From another perspective, accurate DCB estimation offers the opportunity to evaluate which technological and operational enhancements best serve the prevalent and anticipated demand. The concept of DCB has been implemented within the commercial aviation world at some of the busiest airports across the world. However, those DCB approaches do not readily translate for the UAM paradigm. To address these needs and gaps, IAI proposes UAM Demand Capacity Modeling through Ensemble Learning (UDC-ModEL) to accurately and rapidly model DCB at UAM vertiports. As the name suggests, our technology leverages the latest advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to erect a rapid estimation capability that is agnostic to the UAM market’s location or the eVTOL fleet mix used by a UAM operator.

Also, UDC-ModEL will be valuable for design and development of eVTOL and other concepts to provide improved airspace capacity and throughput.","Aircraft manufacturers, PSUs and vertiport operators are customers for UDC-ModEL.

Our solution involves the integration of two enabling technologies: 1) highly resolved and accurate microscale weather information from a “building-resolving” atmospheric model that can provide near surface winds and turbulence at meter-scale resolutions.  2) graph analytics data analysis methodologies designed to fuse the microscale weather data, aircraft operational parameters, UTM characteristics and operational constraints. The proposed system uses a large eddy simulation (LES) model to translate standard environmental data into  highly resolved micro-scale wind/turbulence information that can account for terrain, land-use characteristics, and buildings.  LES microscale weather data will then be combined with aircraft performance parameters to calculate UAM/AAM aircraft specific parameters for all of the scheduled UAM/AAM vehicles over all of the possible routes and flight plans.  Graph analytics will then be utilized on this dataset to estimate the best combination of routes and corresponding departure and flight schedules for both the in-flight and departing UAM/AAM aircraft.  This graph analysis calculation will also incorporate flight duration and/or path length, aircraft separation safety requirements, and aircraft arrival delay relative to the planned arrival time. The UAM/AAM UTM flight scheduling and route guidance products produced by this system will act to condition the UTM airspace to ensure safe aircraft separation, merging and sequencing of aircraft along the flight routes, metered arrivals at destination aerodromes, and efficiency through the identification of the shortest flights routes through the UTM system.",A core mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is to support the development of technologies that enhance the safety and efficiency of aviation operations in the United States National Airspace System.

This device will have the following features: Power - This device is now possible due to relatively recent advancements in the reduction of power for short-range communication (e.g. Bluetooth 5.0), analog to digital conversion chips, and the improvement in volumetric storage capacity of lithium battery technology. For instance, a single 18650 cell (one of the most common lithium ion cells on the market) has approximately 9 W-hr of total storage in a 2.6 inch long x 0.75 inch diameter form factor.

The hydrogen embrittlement problems endemic to industries that require heavy use of hydrogen have been solved in various ways. Most of these solutions involve the careful development of alloys that are less susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Unfortunately, these alloys often require a sacrifice of some other highly desired material property, such as strength, hardness, ductility, etc. Coatings have also been attempted. However, these coatings and coating techniques have their own drawbacks, which include ceramic coatings that flake off after only a few use cycles and coating techniques that cannot deposit onto a finished part because they require line of sight during deposition. To better mitigate the very pressing hydrogen embrittlement challenge, Summit Information Solutions, Inc. proposes the use of a mature deposition technique that has not seen much use outside of the microelectronics industry. Summit has successfully demonstrated the thin film encapsulate deposition on dummy substrates of Inconel 718 and A-286 stainless steel. These coatings held up in a hot hydrogen at 1,800 degrees C. Summit will demonstrate that this thin film can be deposited onto pipe/tube structures with the same success.

Additionally, the technology will be applicable to future nuclear thermal propulsion test infrastructure and engine hardware. This will also have wide NASA applications for everything from other traditional hydrogen embrittlement needs to coatings for high reflectivity X-Ray optical coatings.","The proposed technology will be useful for a pipe system that requires internal coating. Biofouling prevention would see a direct benefit. Power generation systems are particularly vulnerable to this biofouling, and it is prohibitively expensive to replace or disassemble these systems to apply a coating treatment.

The high cost of these materials and the difficulty in processing them from start to finish further restricts their use. Forging of near-net shape parts can potentially reduce material waste, shorten cycle times, and improve properties, which would open up many additional applications in current markets. Refractory metals can be hot forged but traditional forging of W requires temperatures up to 3000°F. These temperatures, however, limit tool life, require protective atmospheres to prevent severe oxidation, and result in relatively poor properties. This SBIR Phase I work will demonstrate a novel manufacturing process to form refractory metals and alloys at much lower temperatures that presently possible. A lower temperature process will ultimately be safer and less expensive, since less energy is needed and cheaper tool materials can be used and will last longer. Significant reduction in part costs will also be possible given that less starting material is needed and the amount of machining necessary will be greatly decreased given that the near-net shaping capability. The proposed technology will also allow for better microstructural control and therefore more robust properties, thus may enable this class of materials to begin to reach its full promise for extreme temperature use.","This program should result in higher performance, more affordable refractory metal/alloy parts for use in very high temperature hot zone structures and components such as advanced ground propulsion testing, reactor fuel elements, hot gas path nozzles, and thrusters for spacecraft.

The self-diagnosis capabilities will help reduce operation and maintenance cost as it is expected that the self-diagnosis capabilities will be used to inform and mitigate impending failure events while still conserving operation conditions, and thus extend lifetime of the device to increase utilization. The key technical objective is to demonstrate the ability to extend the lifetime of a HASEL actuator by monitoring the impedance, recognizing predetermined indicators of failure, and adjusting the driving signal accordingly. The intelligence of the HASEL actuator will be realized through temporal impedance measurements and informed through extensive experimentation to build out large datasets required to find statistically significant indicators of failure.","Artimus Robotics intends to implement HASEL actuation technology into AOT ground systems that do not currently support Health Determination and Fault Management, enabling prediction, prognosis, and anomaly detection of system and component failure/degradation.

Recent multi-omics studies and radiobiological insights have also provided new gene targets to act as radiation MCM. Using a range of different proteins poses significant challenges and associated logistical challenges in their safe transportation and storage during space travel. Existing genetic manipulation methods are laborious, expensive, and inefficient. We propose to address this market and technology void by rapid design, build, and test of molecules using a proprietary FAST platform to target any gene in any organism.

Eg., GM-CSF FASTmer demonstrated large-scale immunomodulation and specific haemopoietic protein regulation in human PBMCs during acute radiation exposure (3Gy). During this proposal, we will use individual FASTmers targeting specific genes related to ARS, and evaluate their efficacy using specific haemopoietic proteins and cytokine markers. Based on their efficacy, the top-ranked candidates will be evaluated as a combination therapy. Using detailed fractional factorial design and ensuing statistical analysis, we will identify the: 1) top therapeutic targets for ARS, both in monotherapy and combinations; and 2) ranked FASTmers as therapeutic assets for mono- and combination therapy, to further test and validate in animal and clinical testing (Phase II SBIR).","Our proposed work will result in rapid development of radiation countermeasures (single targets for first-in-class, and combination targets for best-in-class) for deployment in deep-space missions.

The use of multiple excitation wavelengths allows for the detection of many different molecular species (including background contaminants) which would otherwise not all be accessible and/or as distinguishable with a single excitation wavelength. FLARE draws heritage from another flow-through fluorescence instrument developed by LMT which uses a single excitation wavelength (265nm) and six emission bands to detect microbial protein fluorescence. This predecessor has been deployed and tested aboard the VALKYRIE cryobot at the Matanuska Glacier (AK) where it monitored, in real time, microbial cells in the generated melt water at concentrations below 50 cells/mL with good precision. By expanding the number of excitation wavelengths and significantly increasing the number of detection channels to 16 or even 32, FLARE will be able to excite a much larger number of compounds and be better equipped to spectroscopically distinguish between them. This will allow FLARE to detect cells (e.g., via proteins) and, by measuring the fluorescence from tell-tale fluorophores such as NAD(P)H (which only fluoresces in a reduced state) and siderophores (e.g., pyoverdin), inform as to the metabolic activity or possible pathogenicity of the microbes. Since FLARE is a continuously-monitoring flow-through system, it can detect larger eukaryotic cells such as protists and fungi at very low levels (<< 1 cell/mL). Their relatively large biomass will cause very large distinguishable spikes in the data. Based on performance of its predecessor, we expect that FLARE will be able to meet the monitoring requirements of NASA's microbiological limits of detection for potable water sources.","FLARE would be ideal to deploy aboard the ISS or other crewed vehicle where it could continuously monitor the potable water for microbial contamination. Future missions would include those to and on the Moon and, later, Mars. Additionally, FLARE could be used aboard a long-duration science exploration mission to an Ocean World where it could be used as a triage instrument to trigger sample acquisition and analysis by a limited-run high-performance instruments.","FLARE could be used for industrial water monitoring. For example, FLARE could be deployed at sites of mining operations and oil/gas exploration where industrial holding pond water must be monitored for aromatic compounds before being released into the environment. Additionally, FLARE can monitor drinking water quality for aromatic compounds and microbes at treatment centers and bottling plants."

The FSA must accept a total of 12 lbs of pure water prior to each Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), then supply this water to the cooling loop at ambient suit pressure during the EVA, functioning reliably for up to 15 years of service. To meet these requirements, NASA has specified multiple ultra-pure fluoropolymer bladders captured in restraints providing overpressure tolerance to 38 psi. The assembly must also conform to a defined geometric envelope. Unfortunately, designs to date have failed, for two primary reasons. First, typical constructions involving a lay-flat bladder captured within a sewn textile restraint do not use space efficiently enough to store the required volume within the available space. Second, wrinkles that form as the bladders inflate cause the fluoropolymer membrane to tear. Other challenges include robust mounting to a rigid structure and visual access for inspection. New thinking is required to achieve a viable design. RAPA Technologies has developed a novel defined envelope pressure bladder that meets all specifications for the FSA. The design combines the benefits of a flexible bladder with the strength and convenience of a rigid tank, providing an ultra-pure, ambient-pressure reservoir with high overpressure tolerance, high volumetric efficiency within the available envelope, near-zero dead volume, optical transparency for visual inspection, simplified mounting, and low mass. In Phase I we will demonstrate the performance, overpressure resistance, and cycle life of this novel bladder system. In Phase II, we will develop and deliver multiple qualification FSA units tailored for use in the NASA xEMU.","Our defined envelope bladder system will meet all requirements for the FSA, a critical component of the NASA xEMU. It will also make a natural choice for many other fluid handling applications in space, and can can be used to store water, process chemicals, and waste streams. As NASA pursues manned missions to the Moon, lunar orbit, and Mars, the need for bladders that are reliable and stable for years-long missions will continue to grow.","The recent proliferation of unmanned drone aircraft presents a need for tanks that can supply fuel in any orientation and operate in high and low G maneuvers. We believe that our unique design may also find use in specialized commercial, industrial, medical, and military settings for applications such as fuel tanks, chemical transport, sample storage, and hydration bladders."

The FSA system is charged to a high pressure and slowly drains of water making up for cooling system evaporation during the course of an EVA. The system is required to cycle between a full state and an empty state many times with possibly long periods of time between uses delivering clean water to the cooling system. The existing FSA bladder design does not meet these needs. The design includes multiple regions where folds and stress concentrations lead to structural failures over time. Creare’s solution incorporates novel geometric design and advanced materials to remedy these failure modes and provide high cycle life, long shelf life, and clean cooling system makeup water. In Phase I, Creare plans to demonstrate key aspects of the design in a subscale prototype system. In Phase II, Creare plans to produce a full-scale prototype and develop plans to integrate the prototype into the existing xPLSS.","The FSA bladder system to be developed here offers a robust alternative to storing cooling water in the PLSS. Reducing the dry component volume and mass mean more volume devoted to cooling water, extending EVA mission duration. The robust, lightweight design could also be employed in other high reliability components like drinking water supplies. Future life support applications like hydroponics and aquaculture requiring water and other liquid feed supplies could also benefit from this lightweight, robust liquid storage technology.","Man-portable hydration systems and personal liquid fuel supply benefit from lightweight, robust bladders by reducing carry load.

To create these improvements, TRI Austin proposes developing a new polyurethane based coating for the Oxford-weave nylon currently used in legacy space suit pressure garment bladders. This new polyurethane will be developed in collaboration with experts at a local university, who have created FDA approved additives to make polyurethanes, as well as other polymers, persistently antimicrobial and resistant to forming biofilms. These new polyurethanes are expected to decrease or even eliminate the need for biocide use in next-gen space suit applications, without causing significant changes to the current production or processing methods. In addition, imparting self-healing properties and minimizing friction with surrounding materials will be investigated as these polyurethanes are formulated. TRI Austin will work with the current producer of pressure garment bladders to ensure the new polyurethane is a drop-in replacement for the legacy material. The new formulation will be iteratively developed until a polyurethane is created which satisfies or exceeds all of NASA’s desired requirements.","Potential NASA applications include new materials for pressure garment bladders for integration into the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) and used in a variety of space based missions including on the International Space Station (ISS), and in future missions to both the Moon and Mars. Additionally, this material could be used in other applications that require both flexibility and antimicrobial properties.","Applications could include use as persistent antimicrobial coatings and films, such as those used for marine diving, water containment, sewage treatment, CBRN protective suits, and creation of antimicrobial surfaces, at the industrial and consumer level.

The Sun Flower system architecture provides high duty cycle solar power by using low mass deployable towers to elevate solar reflectors above topographic features. The key objective of this focus area is to provide simultaneous power generation in PSRs. Each Sun Flower tower will support a reflector of a mass value optimized for the tower’s height, which redirects solar energy to the lunar surface to be collected. The Sun Flower system is flexibly designed, from a 10 meter tower prototype for testing in Earth’s gravity, to towers optimized for the lunar surface of heights ranging from 100 to 800 meters. The array will utilize UltraFlex technology for deployment. Our goal as a Phase I effort is to identify the key systems and hardware required to demonstrate the Sun Flower’s structural deployment. Our team proposes three primary technical objectives as proposed deliverables. First, a comprehensive design and analysis package will be delivered for a full-scale lunar power generating system. Second, a prototype build of a modular section of the tower’s design will be fabricated and assembled. Finally, we propose a functional test of the modular section’s deployment. Our goal for this demonstration as part of our Phase 1 effort is to construct a system capable of being tested in an Earth gravity environment to demonstrate the design concept’s deployment and retractibility.","The Sun Flower system will benefit the Artemis program by providing a consistent source of power generation, specifically in critical PSRs. This will be a necessity in supporting key operations of the program, including rovers, ice mining, and landers. This effort will advance the TRL of these technologies and provide a path toward efficient lunar missions starting in 2028 without dependencies on high cost, high mass power generation approaches.","The efficient power generation offered by the Sun Flower will be a valuable commodity to commercial operations on the Moon, including tourism and resource extraction.

The elimination of motors with the MELT array system can: increase weight efficiency to exceed 75 W/kg, increase volume efficiency to exceed 20 kW/m3, and be compatible with any array power module design (e.g., Dynovas’ MAD Energy array, NGC UltraFlex array, DSS ROSA array, etc.) while providing a dust resistant method of deployment. The MELT array system utilizes smart material actuators (e.g., piezoelectrics and/or shape memory alloys) in a “caterpillar” configuration to achieve both the necessary deployment force and translational distances for extension, rotation, and leveling. The actuation devices will be mounted to a bi-stable composite substrate. The bistable composite substrate will provide rigidity in the stowed and deployed state such that the force on the actuators is negligible except when actuating. Minimizing the force on the actuators except when operating will minimize the power draw and maximize the lifetime of the motorless system. When realized, the MELT array system will provide NASA and space exploration OEMs with a modular and scalable base system for the 10 m extension, 360° rotation for sun tracking, and 15° terrain leveling with a dust resistant universal motorless actuation package. The MELT array system smart material caterpillar also provides cross-cutting benefits to the array, including: inherent load limiting via voltage input, ability for integration of structural health monitoring capabilities within the composite, active vibration tuning for dampening and dust mitigation, and general applicability to other deployable structures.","The maturation of the MELT array aligns with critical NASA technology milestones for human exploration and operations, such as: asteroid redirect, lunar surface missions, Mars-to-moon missions, Mars surface missions. The specific market for lunar missions by NASA includes the Artemis, VIPER, CLPS, Moon-to-Mars, and Orion programs/missions. By aligning the maturation of the MELT array system with NASA’s lunar program, Dynovas estimates that up to 10s to 100s of arrays may be built to support landing, exploration, and orbiting of the Moon.","Non-NASA markets for the MELT array system include commercial spacecraft OEMs and power generation for satellite networks, orbiting debris removal, and experimentation satellites.

The design will be proven through a detailed 3D model, calculations, and physical models of specific details. This work will be the foundation for prototyping in Phase 2.","The Array could be used on any form of Human Lander, or future Lunar Outpost, Orbit Stations.

The first design utilizes Opterus’ high strain composite Trussed Collapsible Tubular Mast (T-CTM) booms and Recirculating Deployer system. The T-CTM boom is a High Strain Composite structure with a large diameter lenticular cross section and co-cured truss features. Testing has been done to ensure the boom meets load requirements and matches finite element model predictions. The T-CTM is designed to withstand high compression and bending loads while maintaining the ability to flatten and stow compactly by spooling tightly inside the Deployer. The Deployer is a compact mechanical system that contains the motor that actuates extension and retraction. It is currently being developed to withstand lunar dust build up for multiple operational cycles. Both the T-CTM and its deployer are easily scalable for larger systems. This Pedestal design utilizes three T-CTM legs terminating to a foot. The second proposed Pedestal design uses a simple 4 bar linkage. Each leg will be individually motorized for deploy and stow operations, with each leg fully extending to hard stops. Pinned joints will be tolerant to dust. The legs will stow by folding up and around the array while the feet package tightly under the system. Both systems have similar CONOPs in that an autonomous rover transports the system to the site of operation, the rover arm or crane holds the stowed system in place and level above the surface, the legs deploy into position, and the rover arm or crane transfers the load to the Pedestal and releases the system.

Hot structure applications such as blunt body reentry, unpowered atmospheric flight, and powered sustained atmospheric flight at hypersonic speeds are all areas that will benefit from improved material architectures and are key in a multitude of NASA programs. Currently, hot structures are limited to 2900 °F for extended operation and many material systems have limited reusability. The aforementioned applications would benefit from improved hot structures that can continuously operate at temperatures above 2900 °F and can survive multiple flight cycles. A major barrier to realizing advanced hot structures for hypersonic flight is the development of protective coating materials compatible with carbon/carbon (C/C) substrates. Due to their high specific modulus, high fracture toughness and thermal conductivity, good thermal shock resistance, and excellent high temperature strength, advanced C/C composites are the best choice for hot structures for hypersonic flight. Unfortunately, C/C composites start to rapidly oxidize above 370 °C, which restricts their engineering applications in air. Current protective coatings on C/C typically fail at elevated temperatures and/or under repeated cycles due to poor bonding with C/C resulting in poor thermal conductivity between the coating and the C/C substrate. Reactive solution infiltration processing offers a means to produce integrated bond layers that are reactively fused with the C/C substrate.

The same innovations that currently allow consumer devices to process large data streams in real-time will, in the future, enable spacecraft to do the same, make intelligent decisions, and achieve mission objectives that are impossible with current ground-in-the-loop systems. However, new algorithms must be developed to reformulate space-related mathematical problems into a form that can take advantage of these computer hardware advances. We propose to develop a framework for high-fidelity force fields to be modeled as artificial neural networks (ANNs). Force model evaluation is a fundamental limiting computational step in many astrodynamics algorithms, including mission planning, navigation, maneuver design, and operations planning. Engineers are typically forced to choose between accuracy and speed. Onboard implementations currently require the dynamical models to be greatly simplified to run within limited computational resources. The proposed innovation will be developed for use both on the ground and in space, benefitting space mission design, navigation, and operation. The innovation is relevant and advantageous for current computer systems, and it will become even better over time based on the direction of computer chip research and development. When used on the ground, the proposed innovation will improve the fidelity and computational performance of standard human-in-the-loop mission design and navigation. When trained on the ground and evaluated onboard a spacecraft, the innovation will enable higher-accuracy onboard operations for lower computational demand than existing capabilities. In the future, when neuromorphic processors are available onboard spacecraft, the framework created by the proposed innovation will allow spacecraft to retrain a dynamical model based on data received in-space.","The proposed innovation will provide capabilities to satisfy mission requirements for autonomous operations at the Earth, Moon, Mars, and throughout the solar system. These mission capabilities will benefit HEOMD and SMD as they provide for mission enabling capabilities related to space mission planning and operations. Tasks such as stationkeeping, constellation maintenance, collision-avoidance, and autonomous scientific operations will all be more accurate and require less computer resources.","Any current or future mission that needs to model gravity fields on the ground or onboard spacecraft will benefit from the proposed innovation.

To address this need, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Neuromorphic Enhanced Cognitive Radio (NECR) device based on neuromorphic processing and its efficient implementation on neuromorphic computing hardware. NECR is a low-SWaP cognitive radio that integrates the open source software radio framework with a new neuromorphic processing module to automatically process the incoming radio signal, identify the modulation types and parameters of the signal, and send the identification results to the controller module to properly decode the incoming signal. Due to its efficient implementation on neuromorphic computing hardware, NECR can be easily integrated into SWaP-constrained platforms in spacecraft and robotics to support NASA missions in unknown and uncharacterized space environments, including the Moon and Mars. In Phase I, we will develop the concept of operations (CONOPS) and key algorithms, integrate a Phase I prototype software in a simulated environment to demonstrate its feasibility, and develop a Phase II plan with a path forward. In Phase II, the NECR algorithms will be further matured, implemented on commercial off-the-shelf  neuromorphic computing hardware, and then integrated with radio frequency (RF) modules and radiation-hardened packaging into a Phase II working prototype device. The Phase II prototype will be tested to demonstrate its fault and mission tolerances and delivered with documentation and tools to NASA for applications to CubeSat, SmallSat, and rover flight demonstrations.","NECR technology will have many NASA applications due to its low-SWaP and low-cost cognitive sensing capability. It can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of space communication and networking, especially cognitive radio devices.

Given this context of computational hardware for obtaining architectures, it is necessary to explore and reinvent the operational paradigms of current computing platforms when performing matrix algebra, by replacing sequential and temporized operations to memory, with massively parallelized distributed analog dynamical units, towards delivering efficient post-CMOS devices and systems summarized as non-von Neumann architectures. Within this paradigm shift the ‘wave’ nature of light and related inherent operations, such as interference and diffraction, enable seamless mathematical  operations (e.g. multiplication) to be executed in the optical domain. Hence, photonic processors can play a major role in enhancing computational throughput and concurrently reducing the power consumption of neuromorphic platform. Future technologies should perform computing tasks in the domain in which their time varying input signals lay, thus exploiting and leveraging their intrinsic physical operations. There are 3 key innovations  that we are considering combining in this PTC AI system, these include the (1) PTC architecture itself, which allows for a modular and scale design and incorporates multiplexing schemes such as WDM offered in photonics [Sorger Appl. Phys. Rev. 2020], (2) Photonic nonvolatile but programmable memory (P-RAM), allowing to re-write the B-matrix of the VMM or, exemplary, the kernel of a CNN. The nonvolatility and retention of state in the photonic system allows for compute-in-memory functionality, thus bypassing the memory-access bottlenecks known in Van-Neumann architectures. And (3) If the data entering the PTC happens to be electronic and digital, then DAC is needed such as a photonic parallel binary-weighted DAC.","The Cognitive Communications Project, through the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program, is one potential customer of this to-be-developed PTC ML system.","Dual use is for DOD and National Security applications  (NSA) such as deep-surveillance, UAV navigation/ranging and data pre-processing at the edge of the network.

KFlow comprises a knowledge repository and an intelligent agent. The repository stores diverse knowledge objects that support mission operations, such as system models, planning models, flight rules/notes, and procedures. These knowledge objects are enriched with annotations to support concept-based retrieval and automated reasoning. They are linked to related objects from which they are derived and to supporting datasets, documents, diagrams, and engineering studies (i.e., their knowledge provenance). Using the TEAM toolkit will streamline KFlow’s development. The KFlow agent acquires knowledge (i.e., learns) by deriving models of system or crew behavior from data, using the models to assess situations and generate procedures, and posing questions to human experts, such as flight controllers, to elicit rationale for other knowledge and hypotheses. The agent applies knowledge to respond to crew requests for assistance; estimates crew mental state and intervenes when appropriate; and responds to system failures, hazardous conditions, or new priorities. KFlow is innovative because it provides a framework for managing the multi-step transformation and flow of source data, implicit knowledge, and unstructured data into more actionable knowledge that is used to provide automation and crew assistance. KFlow’s approach is pragmatic because it flexibly tailors its assistance to the depth of knowledge it possesses. During the project, we will identify KFlow functional requirements, develop a concept of operations & high-level system design, develop test scenarios to clarify requirements and design challenges, create a prototype that illustrates our approach and demonstrates feasibility, and develop a preliminary high-level design & project plan to be implemented during Phase II.","The primary NASA application will be the provision of autonomy and crew support during long-duration missions, especially when continuous and comprehensive Ground support is not feasible or economical. KFlow could also be used on Earth to capture and share expertise between back room and front room flight controllers or between more experienced or specialized controllers and less specialized controllers who handle multiple positions during periods of low activity.","On Earth, the resulting technology could provide a foundation for autonomous operations and user assistance for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Interactive Machine Learning (IML) is a human-centered paradigm in which end-users, e.g. crewmembers and ground-based Subject Matter Experts, iteratively build and refine the ML model through iterative cycles of input and review. Model refinement is driven by user input that may come in many forms, such as onboard data and communications, crew preferences, modified mission parameters along with a description of features and selection of high-level model parameters. IML is distinct from classical machine learning in that human intelligence is applied through iterative teaching and model refinement in a relatively tight loop. With this approach, our goal is to develop an architecture that provides end-users with the ability to interactively explore and adapt the training space with the goal of guiding the adaptation of the cognitive agent toward an intended behavior. This approach will allow crewmembers the ability to control how the cognitive agent learns and adapts during a long duration exploration mission, assuring that its performance improves and does not degrade over time. This work will present crewmembers and SME centered approach to applying IML methods to the design of a system that learns and adapts based on crewmembers inputs to the system. By leveraging IML we are able to address one of the primary challenges associated with the use of cognitive agents during a long-duration mission, the inability to adapt and learn from observation, instruction and interaction as missions proceed.","We expect the IML approach to developing training models for multi-agent assignment along with the ability for end-users to retrain the system will be of interest to a number of groups within NASA, e.g., Gateway habitat. Of course, future Mars expeditions could certainly make use of our cognitive agent, as those are the types of scenarios we’ve used in our development. In particular, our agent will be of interest at JSC to the EVA Exploration Office, the EVA Strategic Planning and Architecture group, and the Exploration Mission Planning Office.","The proposed cognitive architecture will benefit a number of TRACLabs commercial customers.

In an effort to resolve the critical problem of communication delays to and from Earth and provide the crew with the support they need to carry out their mission, nFlux proposes an autonomous cognitive agent built from the capabilities of Sigma to assist astronauts during deep space missions. Sigma is a cognitive architecture and an integrated computational model of intelligence that combines four decades of research in cognitive architectures, probabilistic graphical models and deep learning that can be used to build autonomous intelligent agents. In particular, Sigma leverages factor graphs towards a uniform grand unification of not only traditional cognitive capabilities but also critical non-cognitive aspects, creating unique opportunities for the construction of new kinds of cognitive models that possess a Theory of Mind and are perceptual, autonomous, interactive, affective, and adaptive. Sigma’s graphical architecture has recently been extended to handle neural networks. Sigma has quite general parameter learning capabilities, in that probabilistic, neural, and reinforcement learning capabilities all emerge from a local gradient-descent-based learning mechanism operating at the code of the architecture. The aspiration for uniform grand unification, plus this unique blend of capabilities, make Sigma a well-equipped candidate to tackle the challenge of intelligent agents for deep space exploration.","The proposed solution is applicable in other areas of NASA aside from deep space exploration. Such areas include research conducted at the Human Centered Design Group at NASA JPL investigating astronaut autonomy and the Michoud Assembly Facility where space systems are manufactured and assembled.

This enables space frame construction concepts where the unit members would quickly bond at the joints. Additionally, persistent asset structures that allow temporary or permanent rigid mechanical attachment at an arbitrary point on their surface at any time may enhance their long term utility. These would allow additional components to be held fast on the exterior surface of the deployed craft without the need for pre-built attachment points. A convenient method for producing this result would be an adhesive that could bond these structures following arbitrary lengths of time while in LEO, lunar, or deep space environments. ATSP Innovations has developed such a reversible adhesive concept based on solid state bond exchange reactions between polymeric interfaces composed of a novel thermoset resin system called aromatic thermosetting copolyester (ATSP). This concept has been successfully demonstrated on Earth including in radiation environments. ATSP Innovations proposes development of a flight package for a MISSE-FF experiment berth to validate these properties. A compact package that would be exposed to LEO would be designed and fabricated with exposed surfaces of the reversible adhesive for future testing on return to Earth. Prior to flight, mechanical, morphological, and chemical state of samples would be assessed via nanoindentation, 3D laser-based profilometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine upon return other notable changes in the samples.

A common example in aerospace construction where structure is used to modify the properties of a base material is honeycomb. This well-known material exemplifies how geometric design can reduce weight while retaining unidirectional load-bearing capabilities. Contemporary metamaterial design leads to geometric patterning with greater 3D complexity and a corresponding increase of multifunctional capabilities. Consistent with the ISSNL’s mission to conduct research for Earth benefit in space, this proposed SBIR effort seeks to conduct accelerated aging experiments to understand how products developed with metamaterials will perform over time. The insights derived from this research will have a durable commercial effect since it will enable us to quantitatively predict the expected lifetime of these metamaterial-enhanced products. The Phase I effort seeks to conduct all necessary on-ground preliminary work (including design, fabrication, and characterization) leading to Phase II in-orbit experiments. Phase II will utilize existing ISSNL assets and launch services to expose two batches of samples to the austere conditions of space for 6 and 12 months to induce accelerated aging. These samples will be characterized and compared to ground-based controls fabricated during Phase I to quantify how and over what time scale: (1) base material properties degrade; and (2) metamaterial properties degrade.  We anticipate the data will reveal distinct outcomes along two failure pathways, which ultimately will have broad impact on our commercialization of this advanced materials technology.",Mechanical metamaterials have potential NASA applications wherever lightweight multifunctional materials are needed. This includes: development of Lunar Rover technologies including ultra-lightweight lander system for protection from impact forces; development of materials-based solutions for physical protection during planetary exploration (Moon to Mars Campaign); and development of materials manufacturable in-space or on-site for protected habitable spaces on manned missions or for use in extreme environments (Moon to Mars Campaign).,Mechanical metamaterials have potential non-NASA commercialization opportunities in: lightweight structural materials for future mobility: advanced materials for defense (USAF/Lockheed Martin/Boeing dual-use applications); vehicle armor for US Soldier protection (US Army dual-use applications); and low-cost energy-efficient components in cyber-physical and IoT devices.

EMP is an instantaneous energy field set off by a high altitude nuclear explosion enabled by missile flight or from a satellite. A widespread EMP effect could lead to possible long-term disruption of the nation’s critical communication, transportation, and military infrastructure. NASA and US military in-space assets are also vulnerable to the effects of EMP. The current state of the art to protect against an attack is with massive shielding such as a Faraday Cage, concrete structures, and buried cables. These solutions are cost prohibitive and impractical for space assets and a multitude of terrestrial infrastructures. Specialized coatings will allow effective shielding of space assets and a more localized and cost-effective shielding for sensitive terrestrial hardware. Development of these coatings will be grounded in fundamental physics using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based deep generative design framework that is capable of evaluating novel materials on various substrates. The primary focus of this proposal is to provide shielding capability optimized using simulation, fabrication, and testing for 1) mitigating deleterious damage to hardware from both, EMP and the harsh space radiation environment, 2) increased bond strength between coating and substrates 3) improved durability for long term space applications as will be demonstrated on NASA’s MISSE platforms, and 4) light weight, low cost and ease of manufacturability. This comprehensive approach augmented by NASA’s on orbit test bed will lead to potential commercial opportunities relevant to NASA, DoD, and civilian infrastructure applications.","The technology will benefit NASA by protecting satellites, space transportation vehicles and large space structures including Orion, Commercial Crew, Landers, and Lunar Gateway. The lightweight EMP resistant architecture, coupled with low cost manufacturing can be a significant shielding advancement for Lunar nuclear reactors. The technology can also be extended to deep space radiation shielding against GCRs and secondary particles. The anticipated NASA market will include all applications related to long-duration human travel beyond LEO.",The proposed coating architecture has considerable interest from commercial entities supplying missiles and defensive kill vehicles. Their immediate need is for lightweight avionics boxes to protect against an EMP threat and the space radiation environment. This technology can also be leveraged into other commercial applications including neutron source containment and accelerator facilities.

In addition, the use of multiple apertures adds additional benefits such as the ability to mitigate atmospheric fading with spatial diversity, to use small aperture size to reduce or eliminate AO complexity, to increment ground station collection area over time, to reduce cost, to remove a single point of failure, and to enable support for simultaneous communications links by federating the array to multiple targets.

The prism sensor samples the edge of the beam. Carbon fiber composites have high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion. Continuous-carbon-fiber rivals beryllium in the key parameters of specific stiffness, and both transient and steady state thermal stability due to its much lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).

The proposed RIVA will have integrated launch locks and latching mechanism with a robust performance. Specifically, RIVA will be applicable to long-range optical telecommunications.  RIVA will reduce angular errors from vibration on low mass, high performance, laser beam control assemblies. While this project is focused on space version of RIVA, eventually, our solution will have two additional variants designed for a particular operating condition and platform, i.e., Ground and Air. It will meet qualifications of extreme shock and vibration attenuation during non-operating period and mitigates high frequency vibrations during laser operations while minimizing its weight meet requirements. Our innovative solution offers low size, weight, and power (SWaP) with improved efficiency, reliability, and robustness as related to its function, high frequency isolation. RIVA will utilize ShockTech proprietary elastomeric formulas which have been space-qualified and deployed upon NASA spacecraft.

They are high performance detectors in ground-based applications, however InGaAs detectors are not suitable for space-based applications because their dark current performance significantly deteriorates during exposure to ionizing radiation. Literature reports indicate that over a several year space mission, InGaAs detectors’ dark current can increase by a factor of 10 – 25 x, which increases power consumption and produces excess noise. An alternative to InGaAs is the semiconductor material GaSb. The two materials have similar bandgap energies leading to similar nominal performance characteristics, however GaSb has more favorably located fundamental defect energies than InGaAs, which will produce superior radiation tolerance through reduced defect-related dark current generation in the presence of space-based radiation. This program will develop GaSb detectors with nominal performance equal to conventional InGaAs telecom detectors, but with greatly improved radiation hardness. The key innovation in this proposal is to assess radiation tolerance by considering defect-related energy levels in the detectors' semiconductor materials. The main defect level in InGaAs is at an energy of 0.46 eV above the valence band. This is near the middle of the bandgap, which from a dark current perspective is the worst possible scenario. In contrast, the main defect level in GaSb is at an energy of 0.26 eV above the valence band, which is sufficiently far away from midgap to enable significant reduction in defect-related dark current generation. This can be seen from the well-known equation for Shockley-Read-Hall generation, which shows that the electron-hole generation rate, and thus also the radiation-induced dark current, of InGaAs defects are more than 40 x times greater than those of GaSb defects.","The radiation-tolerant NIR detector technology developed in this program is broadly applicable to any mission or application requiring the ability to detect 1550nm photons in the presence of ionizing radiation. Examples of planned activities that would benefit from such free-space optical communications technology include the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD), the Illuma -T Project, the EM-2 Optical to Orion (O2O) demonstration, and the DSOC Project technology demonstration hosted by the Psyche Mission spacecraft.","Amethyst predicts the technology will be disruptive in the NIR/SWIR imaging markets, where binary GaSb optical absorber material offers unparalleled pixel uniformity within a focal plane array.

Current state-of-the-art technologies in hazard detection typically use LiDAR data to address low/variable illumination conditions during landing operations, however the option to include image data can result in a hazard detection solution that is more frequently updated at a higher resolution. The proposed work applies a deep learning approach to this problem, as the highly parallelizable nature of learning-based computations naturally extends to hardware acceleration, enabling additional computational power to compute and combine hazard maps across both LiDAR and camera data. The output of this development will be a demonstration of the feasibility and performance of a deep-learning based hazard detection system that leverages both LiDAR and image data to achieve mission-speed performance on path-to-flight hardware. The proposing team is currently developing a LiDAR-based hazard detection module for Astrobotic’s Griffin Mission One to deliver NASA’s VIPER rover to the lunar south pole, planned for late 2023. Techniques developed in the proposed work will benefit from the V&V infrastructure developed for this and future missions. Additionally, Astrobotic will leverage the LunaRay Suite, which is capable of generating and verifying accurate terrain data, including terrain models, photometrically accurate image data, as well as simulated LiDAR data at input locations, times, and viewing positions. As such, a large and widely varied training dataset will be produced, enabling the training of a robust network. By providing a robustly trained solution on relevant hardware, the proposing team seeks to drive forward the market of applied deep learning technologies in the space industry.","As landing precision requirements continue to grow with increasingly complex mission scenarios, customers will look to a flexible solution which utilizes as much data as possible to produce an accurate solution.

Throughput and data capture in all cases is subject to the availability and performance of ground network equipment—commonly a parabolic antenna. Efficiency across designs of parabolic antennas is typically in the 50-60% range due to a variety of losses, resulting in a loss of roughly half its theoretical potential to send and receive signals. Our proposed innovation is the application of a metasurface lens which augments the performance of the antenna by compensating for the phase and amplitude errors, engineering a medium with specific refractive indices at specific points on its surface. Metamaterials, composed of periodic subwavelength metal/dielectric structures that resonantly couple to the electric and/or magnetic components of the incident electromagnetic fields, exhibit negative and near-zero refractive indices to correct for phase and amplitude errors. A metasurface lens, created from a single-layer or minimal-layer stack of planar metamaterial structures with subwavelength thickness, can introduce a spatially varying electromagnetic response, molding wavefronts into shapes that can be designed at will, correcting the phase and amplitude response of a signal. The metasurface antenna lens is expected to result in efficiencies of 80-80% or greater depending on the antenna design. In this Phase I effort the material characteristics required for the textile metasurface will be determined through analyses, as will the approach for mounting, installation, and integration of both a textile and planar lens. Performance will be characterized through modeling and simulation. The result of the effort will be an analysis and simulation-based recommendation for a prototype design and its expected performance.","Application of the Parabolic Antenna Lens (PAL) to NASA ground terminal antennas and supporting commercial service providers has direct benefit to communications performance for missions. PAL can be beneficial across the full spectrum of NASA projects and missions, but may be most impactful for missions working to overcome the challenges of communicating from deep space distances. NASA could apply this innovation to existing ground terminals, without investing in new expensive infrastructure.","Two non-NASA markets utilize antennas which could benefit from PAL: (1) consumer equipment, and (2) the network infrastructure market.

We have proposed approaches to address LEARN’s challenges including (1) the significance of temporal dimension (e.g., operating in different time regime), (2) new nodes entering or nodes leaving the network, (3) disruptions, anomalies and unpredicted behaviors and surprises, (4) diverse nature of nodes, their resources, and requirements, (5) periodic patterns (e.g., orbital info.), and (6) mission schedules. Our proposed solution is founded on our ongoing work to design and demonstrate a AI solution capable of outperforming traditional communication networking protocols. Finally, we propose to develop a MADRL (Ray RLlib)-CORE -based testbed to demonstrate our algorithms.","DTN exploits store-and-forward techniques in networks to compensate for delay and intermittent link connectivity. DTN is broadly used in various space missions: low-Earth exploration, Earth-ISS and Earth-Moon connections. Protocols are used to best suit the operation within each environment with a new overlay network protocol inserted between the applications and locally optimized communications stacks. Improving DTN by an autonomous AI engine will reduce latency deploying space missions.","SpaceX Starlink and Amazon Kuiper are recent programs for space-based broadband internet services. Our proposed LEARN is a step to intelligently route, schedule and control in such networks. It’s AI-based solution can benefit from deep learning advancements to account for all conditions and constraints, e.g. fuel, latency, orbits, and policies in such large constellations."

Systems & Processes Engineering Corporation (SPEC) proposes a Multi-Channel Long-Range Wind LIDAR system toward increasing the scan rate, and therefore the temporal resolution, of advanced Wind LIDAR systems. The proposed system scales up from an already-developed single-channel fiber optic based, eye-safe wind LIDAR, initially designed for UAV systems and brought to breadboard level through Army and NASA programs. The single-channel transceiver consists of a narrow band laser seed, acousto-optic modulator for frequency shift and pulse forming, a three-stage erbium-doped fiber amplifier, and a coherent receiver, all operating at an eye-safe wavelength of 1550 nm. The system electronics and computational stack are in PCIe/104 format, allowing miniaturized light-weight packaging suitable for small UAV applications and the entire range of commercial and military aircraft. This LIDAR allows air current Doppler detection beyond 3 km. The Wind Measurement LIDAR was originally designed to detect energy sources such as vertical uplifts, wind direction, wind gradients and transient gusts for optimal path determination for energy conservation in UAVs. By further developing the capabilities of this wind LIDAR system, specifically by increasing the channel count up to a targeted 32 channels, the overall system scan rate can be increased proportionately thereby improving the temporal resolution by up to 32x.

We propose to develop the Earth Compact lidar for Height and altitude Observations (GRAAL). GRAALis an ultra-compact time-of-flight ranging lidar for Earth observation from Low Earth Orbit (LEO), designed to address key observational priorities including ice sheet thickness, forest canopy thickness, and smoke and cloud cover. GRAAL delivers similar science performance to ICESat-2’s ATLAS lidar instrument using. a radically new optoelectronics concept with two critical advances: 1) a greater than 10x reduction in size, weight, power, and cost by using a novel optical architecture; 2) GRAAL's optical path inherently provides a dual-channel capability for multi-sensor configurations such as imaging + lidar or hyperspectral sensing + lidar. With these two advances, GRAAL will be a key enabling technology for the next decade of compact lidar systems tasked with providing high quality data while vastly reducing instrument cost, size, and complexity. We have designed GRAAL as a “stock” lidar system replacing expensive, long-lead custom designs such as ATLAS, which will enable new mission architectures that require cost-effective global coverage and improved responsiveness to dynamic events, for example in constellations of SmallSat-scale satellites.","GRAAL has applications in LEO Earth observation for ice sheet and forest canopy thickness, and cloud cover.

Methane is some 60 times more effective than CO2 in absorbing long-wavelength radiation, because the methane absorption lines in that part of the spectrum are less saturated and have less overlap with water vapor lines.  Natural and agricultural sources of methane continue to dominate, but are difficult to separate and quantify.  World-wide, rice cultivation, biomass burning, ruminant farm animals, and fossil fuel mining and usage have long been the most powerful drivers, but with climate change these sources could be dwarfed in the future by the release of enormous quantities of methane from melting permafrost and/or methane hydrates currently buried deep in ocean sediment.  Innovative new remote sensing technologies need to address the atmospheric methane concentration measurement problem for NASA and other applications. Beyond Photonics proposes to investigate specific very compact pulsed oscillator/amplifier designs near the 1.645-micron wavelengths of interest by NASA for atmospheric methane (CH4) and potentially coherent winds in the same nominal wavelength region.  Specifically, methane concentration measurement from operational platforms of NASA’s choice will be our focus; this application puts particular emphasis on decreasing size, weight, and prime power (SWaP) and eliminating active laser component cooling.  Particular emphasis will also be placed on ensuring that the laser/lidar designs are compatible with scaling to space qualification in future programs.  Emphasis will also be placed on technical approaches with good operational flexibility in terms of pulse energy and duration, frequency agility, and application to other IR and SWIR wavelengths.","Potential NASA applications include quantification of atmospheric methane sources and sinks on a finer spatial scale than currently possible, immediately valuable for climate model improvement and atmospheric sciences.

ISC seeks to innovate an interleaved ADC architecture by using multiple stacked die within a single package to provide next-generation sampling rates with ease-of-use for a range of applications such as radar, radiometry, spectrometer, and software-defined radio (SDR), which can take advantage of the ultra-wideband analog digitization to reduce front-end complexity by reducing down-conversion stages, intermediate frequency (IF) sampling subsystems, and other components that provide the system with reduced SWaP.  To improve interleaved ADC performance, reduce external componentry, reduce layout complexity, and provide excellent temperature and voltage matching of an interleaved ADC, ISC proposes a Stacked, Parallel, Analog-to-Digital, Electronic System (SPADES).  The stacking architecture can be applied to both commercial grade parts, achieving 20Gsps and beyond, as well as Space grade parts, achieving 12Gsps and beyond. Successful stacking of ADC chips can increase interleaving to achieve even higher rates.","Several earth science measurement based NASA programs continue to look for new devices to increase functionality within the same volume, weight and power constraints.  Many of these programs are utilizing SmallSats for these monitoring satellites.  Anticipated programs that can be supported by ISC’s SPADES ADC are Smart Ice Cloud Sensing (SMICES) IIP, Concurrent Artificially-intelligent Spectrometry and Adaptive LIDAR System (CASALS) IIP and possible future Landsat missions.",Possible non-NASA applications would be for military satellite use or unmanned vehicles (i.e. drones).

Second, for improved efficiencies, we are proposing to limit the MMIC power level to about 1 watt and use high-efficiency waveguide circuit combining techniques to achieve higher power levels. For this, we propose to use a high-efficiency, 4-way H-tee combiner. Computer simulations show that this approach is capable of realizing combining efficiencies of greater than 95%.

It is highly desirable to design a next-generation FPA to overcome the deficiencies of e-SWIR imaging sensors. In recent years, Antimonide-based Type-II superlattices (T2SL) represent the most promising material system capable of delivering more producible, large-format, reduced pixel pitch, e-SWIR focal plane arrays (FPAs) for global observation applications. We propose to develop T2SL-based photodetectors and FPAs for NASA imaging and spectroscopy applications in the spectral band from visible to extended e-SWIR (0.4–2.5µm) with a very low dark current density.

The “3D Winds” mission targets both coherent and direct detection Doppler wind lidars to complement one another in a hybrid lidar system in low Earth orbit. Optimum performance of a coherent Doppler wind lidar system necessitates the use of an optical beam alignment architecture, such as one of those previously described. In this proposal, Freedom Photonics outlines a path towards improved optical alignment within an existing coherent Doppler lidar system at NASA Langley Research Center through the development of an inexpensive alignment detector system with high bandwidth and quantum efficiency, which is responsive at target wavelengths between 1.9 and 2.2 µm. Prototype Germanium Silicon Tin (GeSiSn) PIN detector arrays developed on a synergistic program are already responsive out to 2.2 µm wavelengths. Critically, the GeSiSn material can be grown directly on Si substrates, which are inexpensive to process and allow for growth on large-diameter wafers and thus large high-resolution arrays and/or large detector apertures. This program will leverage Freedom Photonics’s extensive experience in the design, fabrication, and manufacture of complex photodiodes and systems, as well as existing materials to support a rapid development effort.

Detectors working at 1064nm wavelength are particularly important to work with YAG-based lasers, the main light source in operation. Therefore, NASA has identified the need of a 1064nm detector with enhanced photon detection efficiency (PDE), low dark noise, and low excess noise. To achieve the goal, Imaging Nanosystems proposes a device that employs the Cycling Excitation Process (CEP), a highly efficient carrier multiplication process to amplify the photocurrent. The device combines (i) a thin layer of disorder material as the CEP gain medium deposited directly on (ii) an InGaAsP light absorption layer, and (iii) using a conduction band offset epitaxial stack to produce the properties of self-quenching and self-recovering, thus saving the need for active quenching circuits. In this Phase I program, we will design a single photon detector based on the analysis of the absorption layer combined with the CEP gain medium by 1D and 2D simulations. The 1D simulation would complete the device structure with all layers, and the 2D analysis would consider the mesa height, field distribution, gain uniformity, and any field-crowding effect which may introduce early breakdown and gain nonuniformity. Additionally, a simple prototype device, integrating the gain medium layer with the light absorption layer, will be designed, fabricated and characterized to demonstrate single photon detection capability and low dark count rate.","The proposed detector is suitable for 1.064um space-based cloud profiling lidar applications. With high timing resolution and single photon detection it would find use in atmospheric profiling, planetary surface mapping, and vegetation/canopy lidar. Another application is 3D imaging flash lidar technology in NIR wavelengths, which can provide precision and hazard avoidance capabilities for landing missions to the planetary bodies and enable spacecraft autonomous rendezvous and docking with satellites or asteroids (e.g. in the Artemis program).","The high sensitivity, low noise detectors will serve applications in 3D sensing, LIDAR receivers, quantum communication and computation, night vision, deep space communication, and biological and medical imaging. The LIDAR receivers can be used for DOD (e.g. military autonomous vehicles, target identification) and commercial (e.g. autonomous driving, consumer devices) applications."

At the end of the Phase I, the goal is to achieve <1% reflectance over a prototype of 4-layers AR structures by stacking with precision alignment and bonding techniques that Cactus Materials, Inc. has developed. Phase II of the project is to develop a complete wide-bandwidth AR treatment for silicon optics applicable for vacuum windows and it can be used in the future for powered optics by integration with a gradient-index lens architecture (GRIN) using wafer bonding, circumventing the challenge of AR-treating a curved surface. Transmission (T) and reflectance (R) on bonded wafers are expected to be 100% and <1% respectively. A precision alignment of <2 micron between wafers will be employed using automated lithographically defined alignment marks.

In addition, bonding strength needs to be close to silicon bulk strength and withstand any vibration or stress as well as hold up as vacuum windows, so under deflection of 1.5-6 mm (depending on the diameters). For example, vibrational stress of a launch could damage the stacked Si lenses. A detailed testing and modeling will be incorporated to ensure the optics are robust enough for space platform.

Many of the currently used UV detectors are sensitive to longer wavelength (i.e. visible) light pollution, and so instruments employ filters to block wavelengths longer than those of interest; however, these filters also attenuate the UV radiation, reducing the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the instrument.  Visible wavelengths of light have energies less than the bandgaps of InGaN and AlGaN, and so are not absorbed by them, thus UV detectors based on (In,Al)GaN are insensitive to visible light (i.e. solar blind) and do not require any filters, which increases their EQE. A significant problem preventing AlGaN and InGaN-based UV imaging devices from realizing their true potential is the presence of dislocation defects that result from growing active layers of (In,Al)GaN on lattice-mismatched substrates.  The availability of a low-dislocation, lattice-matched virtual substrate would present significant benefits to the availability and performance of (In,Al)GaN UV imaging devices.  Other semiconductor technologies make use of lattice-matched virtual substrates that are created by depositing thick buffer layers on a suitable, although lattice-mismatched substrate.  This approach fails for (In,Al)GaN because the predominant dislocation types are sessile under biaxial stress and do not glide to interact and reduce their concentration.  We propose that nanometer-scale patterning of the substrate (e.g. AlN, GaN, SiC, Si or sapphire) can induce dislocations to glide and reduce in concentration within the buffer layer.  The resulting virtual substrate would have a dislocation density low enough to support the fabrication of high-performance (In,Al)GaN transistors and photonic devices.","Solar-blind UV imaging is important for heliophysics and astrophysics, as the Lyman series is used to observe hydrogen in stellar coronas and around dark phenomena, as planned to be used in LUVOIR.

(In,Al)GaN can be fabricated as linear-mode or Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (APD), enabling solar-blind single-photon detection of UV radiation from atmospheric fluorescence caused by cosmic rays, which is important to Physics of the Cosmos.","Solar-blind UV detectors aid in the early detection of ballistic missiles.

To fulfil this need, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a fail-safe field emission-based cold cathode ionizer for use in space-based instrumentation. The cold cathode ionizer features ultra-low electron extraction voltages down to 2 V, emission current densities up to A/cm2 across mm2 emission surfaces, instantaneous switching and negligible thermal load. A unique property of PSI’s proposed cold cathode ionizer is its extreme resistance to the most common failure modes associated with field emission devices. The device is designed with recovery from mechanical and thermal shock as well as resilience against exposure to debris or contamination that might be encountered during its service lifetime. The slow degradation of materials and surfaces encountered in space are inherently compensated for in the design. In Phase I of the program, PSI will demonstrate the principle of the ionizer, raising its technology readiness level (TRL) from 2 to 3. The cathode fabrication process will be developed and cathodes integrated into a demonstration device for evaluation of critical components and operating parameters. Phase I will culminate in production of a detailed preliminary design for a flight-worthy prototype ionizer. In Phase II, ionizer requirements and capabilities will be finalized. A flight-worthy prototype will be constructed and evaluated. The Phase II program will be exited with the ionizer at TRL 6 and with the prototype delivered to NASA for further evaluation.

To progress the study of the flow of energy that heats and accelerates solar corona and wind, a next generation Faraday Cup is needed. Extending the range of solar wind speed measurements to 2,500 km/sec or more requires a new, innovative power supply with significant high-voltage DC and AC modulation capabilities. We propose a variable sine wave power supply capable of delivering up to 40kV DC with a 2kHz AC modulation up to 4kV peak to peak. This venture will leverage Busek’s previous experience with delivering radiation hardened PPUs and developing a suite of Plasma Probes with custom electronics to deliver a prototype with a path to a radiation hardened flight system. The proposed architecture is based on a Cockroft Walton Voltage Multiplier to generate a high voltage DC offset and a Resonant Royer Oscillator to produce an AC waveform superimposed on the high voltage DC bias. The proposed architecture offers many advantages that will simplify the path to flight design process. The multiplier circuit contains simple passives and imposes equal voltage stress on each stage. This eases component selection, reduces BOM costs, and improves compactness. The Resonant Royer Oscillator is a self-resonating circuit used in many high voltage applications that offers user flexibility, simplicity, efficiency and low component count. By implementing high voltage design techniques and testing considerations, this Phase I effort will validate the feasibility of the proposed power supply in a laboratory environment to meet the needs of next generation Faraday Cup.","NASA applications include continued and extended research of space weather missions such as characterizing the dynamics of the plasma at the sources of solar wind.

These measurements can lead to inference of aerosol type with a temporal resolution of minutes. The MP2 follows from a history of polar nephelometers that illuminate suspended aerosol particles in a chamber and then measure the scattered light as a function of angle. With the MP2 we intend to modulate polarization at the source and then measure not the intensity but the polarization signal at the detector.  This can provide measures of six elements of the scattering phase matrix, at multiple scattering angles. Previous polar nephelometer technology has stopped halfway, modulating polarization at the light source, but then only measuring intensity at the detector. Thus, existing technology has achieved measurements of only two phase matrix elements (P11 and P12). The six phase matrix elements will contain unprecedented information about aerosol properties that can be retrieved from inversion software. Furthermore, the MP2 is designed to be modular with possible connection to an inlet with an aerodynamic sizer. This allows size selection, such as PM2.5, before characterization of the phase matrix. Multiple stacked MP2s, allow for phase matrix measurements for multiple particle size categories. There are two possible options to achieve the MP2.  Option (a) uses multiple light sources (LEDs) and a single polarimeter detector.  Option (b) uses a single light source (multi-wavelength laser) and multiple fiber detectors. Each option can achieve the technical objectives. The technical proposed work is to build a tabletop demonstration of both options and then evaluate the best option for Phase II.  Options will be evaluated as to technical feasibility, sensitivity, portability, durability and marketability.","The MP2 will support NASA’s future polarimeter missions:  PACE, MAIA and ACCP.

Otherwise, you have a situation where the “ground truth” is less believable than the satellite retrieval. The MP2 offers NASA the opportunity for cal/val activity for polarimeters and aerosols that will exceed any of NASA’s current plans.","Global interest in aerosol research in air quality and climate is in a growth phase. The MP2 with its aerodynamic sizing options fits well with the air quality monitoring of PM2.5 and need for particle characterization and source apportionment, internationally.

David Green,green@qpeak.com,"135 South Road, MA 01730 - 2307",(978) 689-0003,2,4,"To meet NASA’s interest in advancing quantum sensing technologies, the development and maturation towards space application and qualification of atomic systems are needed. Atom interferometers have unmatched precision for in-situ measurements of local gravity acceleration. The Size, Weight, and Power consumption (SWaP) of existing atom interferometers is a major obstacle for employing them in NASA missions. One of the main components of an atom interferometer is an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system. UHV chambers are typically the heaviest components of atom interferometers. A light, compact, and energy-efficient UHV system will be highly beneficial for NASA missions. In this proposal, Q-Peak is addressing the need for lighter, compact, energy-efficient UHV systems suitable for atom interferometer. In particular, we propose to use an aluminum alloy that is 30% lighter than stainless steel to reduce an UHV chamber weight. The aluminum alloy can be machined using a metallic powder bed fusion process that removes the constraint of traditional manufacturing considerations. Furthermore, Q-Peak will focus on developing passive pumping based on non-evaporable getter pumps. Passive pumping can reduce the energy consumption of an UHV system. Other aspects of the UHV system suitable for atom cooling experiment will be addressed: bonding vacuum windows to the aluminum alloy, energy-efficient and reliable alkali-atom sources, and so on.  The developed UHV system will find direct application to atom interferometers, drastically reducing their SWaP without compromising residual gas pressure and optical access.",Keeping track of the actual spacecraft position is a key part of navigation for any spacecraft. Accurate in situ gravimetry based on atom interferometry can be used for satellite-based global gravity field mapping. Atom interferometry is a potential technology to gather the type of data currently produced by NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On mission. Europa Clipper can use an atom interferometer for determining the most likely locations to gain access to subsurface material.,Stable and precise accelerometers and gyroscopes are required for navigation and can be used for ships and planes. They are especially advantageous in situations when GPS signal is absent and a high accuracy is required. Such devices can be of great value to the US Navy.

CIMMOS is a novel concept that incorporates a suite of five advanced optical spectroscopy technologies to give a comprehensive 3D analysis of target atomic and molecular composition variation of as function of location and depth in centimeter scale.  CIMMOS is innovative in being the first standoff in situ optical sensing facility capable of probing the broad vibrational response of molecules by acquiring Raman, IR and mid-IR LIBS spectroscopic signatures of condensed phase inorganic and organic samples. Combined with multi-elemental analysis of UVN LIBS emission, this novel system has the potential to offer a rapid, complete, and robust chemical characterization of surface targets. While the 3D composition mapping capability of CIMMOS make it an ideal in situ probe for ocean world missions, the modular design implementation of CIMMOS permits subsystem assemblies tailored to the application with cost-efficiency, resulting in a versatile instrument that can be optimized for size, power, and science objective requirements of a broad variety of Ocean World missions such as icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn.  With its versatility, we envision CIMMOS being deployed on landers of ocean worlds. The fore-optics will be designed to be fully reflective to support the modularity principle in our design.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems represent a class of instruments that have played a significant role in previous NASA missions in remote sensing and planetary surveying on Earth and other planetary systems. The HSI systems on these missions have relied on bulky optics that also require large system sizes to achieve high spectral resolution. The large size and mass of these spectrometers represent a significant barrier to widespread adoption due to the opportunity cost of the space, weight, and power consumption. Tunoptix proposes to utilize meta-optics in conjunction with computational imaging to drastically reduce the SWaP of HSI systems while maintaining high spectral and spatial resolution. A meta-optic consists of an array of subwavelength scatterers, which locally control the amplitude, phase, and spectrum of incident light with high spatial resolution. A metasurface is optically thin, with an active layer thickness of of less than a micrometer, and total optical thickness on the order of millimeters. Tunoptix will develop a HSI system based on an optical front-end and computational back-end. This approach leverages the unique ability of meta-optics to implement near-arbitrary optical functionalities to implement a well-conditioned wavelength-dependent transformation on incident light. This will then be decoded using a low latency postprocessing algorithm to extract a high-fidelity hyperspectral image. With this method, Tunoptix well demonstrate a compact, snapshot polarization independent HSI system with F/1.8, a 10 cm x  8 cm x 4 cm form factor, and a mass of less than 1 kg operating over a bandwidth of 350-1050 nm, and with over 40 channels.","A drastically lower SWaP snapshot HSI system would reduce the opportunity cost for their adoption in a wider set of NASA missions and applications. In particular, applications of a low SWaP, snapshot HSI system would include satellite-based and rover-based imaging and spectroscopy of planetary surfaces, airborne remote sensing of coastal and oceanic regions, and in-field inspection of mission-critical satellite systems.","The primary applications for an HSI system in the private sector would be in quality control and inspection for industrial settings, and plane-based or drone-based surveying. In these applications, the design would increase throughput of the customer's processes while maintaining spectral and spatial resolution and relaxing stabilization tolerances when compared to pushbroom HSI systems."

In this Phase I SBIR proposal for Topic S1.12: Remote Sensing Instrument Technologies for Heliophysics, we describe our research plan to design a CubeSat-compatible instrument for imaging the ionosphere and thermosphere in ultraviolet light. The purpose of this imaging is to derive several key ionospheric environmental parameters (including electron density and ionospheric irregularities) and thermospheric composition (column O/N2).  Images of the irregularities or “bubbles” are more useful than a single line measurement (or 1-D cut) through the same bubble feature because an image permits the geographic extent of the irregularity and its motion to be deduced. The proposed instrument, called Multichannel Thermosphere and Ionosphere Photometer Scanner (MTIPS), will allow us to image the ionospheric and column O/N2 densities to gain valuable insights into the solar and magnetospheric forcing of our space environment. The MTIPS design will be flexible in its ability to accomplish the mission science objectives over a range of expected NASA-sponsored LEO CubeSat launch opportunities. The proposed research will establish the feasibility of CubeSats for UV remote sensing and develop a conceptual design of the MTIP payload.","NASA has an interest in the accurate characterization of the ionosphere-thermosphere system for many applications, ranging from spacecraft charging to communications. We expect that the data from MTIPS instruments will provide complementary data to the NASA GOLD and ICON missions.

To reduce the cost of making x-ray mirrors, NASA is seeking manufacturing solutions to aid in cost reduction factors of 5 to 50 times.  One cost driver is the mandrel-based polishing process that impacts both the inside and outside surfaces of an X-ray mirror shell.  Current shells are created through a replication process utilizing an aluminum mandrel.  OptiPro is proposing to enhance process solutions to reduce the cost required for polishing both the mandrel and the outside shell surface by maintaining a constant force during polishing, developing new polishing tools, and optimizing the polishing algorithm.  The target platform for these improvements will be on OptiPro's bridge polishing platform that has a rotary A-axis to spin the part and a combination polishing head that can handle a range of polishing tools while making it easier to rapidly switch between tools.  These improvements will be directly applicable to the polishing being done at Marshall Space Flight Center on various equipment including OptiPro's 6-axis UltraForm Finishing platform. OptiPro Systems will focus on the process evaluation and the interface between the polisher and metrology platform to provide a cost effective deterministic solution.  A new force-measurement system will also be evaluated for its potential to provide in-situ process feedback during polishing.  New polishing tools will be designed, built, and tested along with the pellet tool developed at MSFC and other commercially available polishing tools.  Algorithm changes will be required for polishing the surfaces of the x-ray mirror mandrel and shells and will be demonstrated on a surrogate aluminum mandrel.  The results of this Phase I effort will enhance the fabrication at MSFC and provide the concept design requirements of a meter class finishing platform which could be built in a Phase II effort.","The proposed system will benefit all projects using x-ray shells and mandrels, both cylindrical and segments, that fit within the working envelope of the proposed machine.

As such, they are poised to impact many NASA missions from remote sensing and communications using small satellite constellations to future x-ray observatories like Lynx and AXIS to coronagraphs within HabEx and LUVOIR. However, free-form optics manufacturing is expensive and requires lengthy production time hindering the adoption of this new design paradigm.  A significant problem with modern optics manufacturing tools is the use of open-loop control which leaves the desired ultra-precise surfaces susceptible to malformation due to non-deterministic effects.  It is only through multiple iterations of machining and in-process metrology that is possible to reach nanometer precision. These manufacturing challenges are exacerbated by free-form optical designs that rely on difficult multi-axis sub-aperture machining or tool rastering and protracted 3-D surface characterization techniques. The technical objectives in this project open the opportunity for low-cost, free-form optics manufacturing by integrating an in-situ optical metrology system into a newly-developed laser-based machining tool to achieve nanometer (x, y, z) root mean square precision over a 160 cm^2 glass workpiece. The metrology system will overcome the current challenges of characterizing free-forms with large spherical departure (>1mm), small inflection points, and asymmetries.  The approach of measuring optical properties, in contrast to the – as usual – physical shape, will also ensure the parts are functionally deployable. The overall project outcome will be an optics manufacturing technology akin to the significance of CNC machining ushering in a new generation of rapid, cost-effective, and high-precision manufacturing that will be transformative to the optics industry.","-Affordable free-form optics with shorter lead-times for CubeSats. -Improved remote sensing with fast, free-form optics having a wider field of view (FOV), less stray light, and greater operational temperature stability. -X-ray telescopes will benefit from a reduction in assembly time/costs by, for example, fabricating mirrors with integrated spacers or monolithic mirror segments with slightly different grazing angles. -Compact coronagraphs with increased FOV, improved higher-order aberration correction, and fewer optical surfaces.","-Within the aerospace and defense industries, free-form optics can improve free-space optical communications, heads-up displays, and laser defense systems. -Free-from optics enable more compact sensors in consumer electronics (cell phones, AR/VR, fitness tech), the vision systems of automobiles and robots, and minimally invasive medical endoscopes and laryngoscopes."

The Sagnac effect induced shift in the resonance frequency of each of two counter-propagating lasers, for a given rotation rate, is amplified by a factor equaling the inverse of this group index, compared to that for a conventional ring laser gyroscope (RLG).  This scale factor enhancement coefficient (SFEC) can be as high as a million.  If the quantum noise limited uncertainty in the laser frequency for an FRLG is the same as that for an RLG for otherwise identical operating parameters, this would imply that the factor of enhancement in measurement precision (FEMP) for an FRLG is the same as the SFEC.  However, based on analogy with similar effects in a parity-time symmetric system, it has been suggested that the quantum noise limited uncertainty for an FRLG may be larger than that for an RLG, due to the so-called Petermann factor, thereby reducing the FEMP to a value smaller than the SFEC.  We will carry out theoretical as well as experimental work to establish the maximum possible value of the FEMP that can be achieved under experimentally achievable conditions.  In one track, we will carry out two new types of theoretical modeling for the FRLG to determine how the FEMP varies as a function of the operating parameters: one based on propagating the field using a quantum-enabled finite division time domain technique in the presence of random spontaneous emissions of photons, and the other based on re-ordering the operators in the temporal correlation function.  In the second track, we will use a robust version of a Rb based superluminal laser, which employs a cavity enclosed in a vacuum chamber and highly stabilized pump lasers, to measure the value of the FEMP.

Furthermore, the ring laser gyro and linear accelerometer can be used in aerospace navigation either stand-alone or as part of Inertial Measurement Units (IMU).  With reduced payload, these instruments could also be used in small satellites.","Non-NASA applications in existing markets are the uses in aerial and naval navigation, especially if included in IMU's.  Emerging market segments are for instance micro- and nano- satellites (SpaceX), commercial space flight (Blue Origin, Virgin), and autonomous road vehicles.

Developing autonomous and reliable Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking (RPOD) technologies will play a key role in the ability to build infrastructure in orbit by providing autonomous satellite inspection and servicing capabilities, among many other applications. Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh, PA-based space robotics company, proposes to further develop existing in-house technology to create the Astrobotic LiDAR-Inertial Navigation (ALIN) software package. This modular and versatile software leverages LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to provide navigation and mapping capabilities. ALIN will specifically target applications requiring high fidelity relative navigation solutions to non-cooperative dynamic spacecraft, such as the inspection and servicing of satellites. Phase I will yield a prototype system featuring a space-relevant compute platform capable of real time data collection from a terrestrial grade scanning LiDAR and analysis of the system to provide a clear path forward for achieving real time mapping and relative navigation on space hardware. Phase II, if awarded, would focus on optimizing algorithmic localization, mapping performance, and timing to meet RPOD-specific mission requirements. Specifically, development would focus on improving localization and mapping under the challenging circumstances of a very sparse scene with a single dynamic LiDAR-observable object being observed from a non-inertial reference frame, as is the case in most RPOD missions. The results of a Phase II will demonstrate the viability of the ALIN software package in simulation, and with follow-on investment the system could be infused into a flight program.","The proposed Phase I work will lead to a prototype LiDAR-based navigation and mapping solution geared toward the satellite servicing and inspection industry. Phase II will begin working towards the development of the sensor as a flight-ready module and conducting extensive testing on flight-ready hardware. The resulting technology could become flight ready in a Phase III, providing the opportunity for early mission infusion and to perform testing and data collection on smaller cubesat style missions or on the ISS.","Robust GPS-denied localization and mapping capabilities have strong potential in the private sector filling the need to inspect and understand the severity of damage in hard-to-access locations. A navigation system that can safely operate in dark, unmapped locations could advance understanding of the types of necessary maintenance in facilities where GPS is not available."

A balloon mission could closely study the chemical composition of trace compounds in the upper atmosphere and resolve ongoing scientific debate regarding the presence of specific gases having biological origins on Earth. The moderate Earth-like pressures and temperatures at such high altitudes on Venus allow for long-term operation of scientific equipment, unlike the very the high surface temperature and pressure which severely limit survivability of exploration vehicles. Prior lander missions to Venus survived just over two hours on the surface before overheating, while high-altitude balloons have operated for days (limited by battery capacity). Future balloon-based missions could far exceed previous mission durations, but balloons have an inherently limited lifetime due to loss of lift. Balloon platforms also have limited altitude operating range and do not penetrate the lower atmosphere. To address these balloon system limitations, Creare proposes the Venus Sonde, a drone-based ballast sonde with a mass of 5 to 10 kg capable of flying multiple missions and returning to the balloon prior to a final one-way flight to the surface. During the initial high-altitude flights, the Venus Sonde launches from the balloon platform under fixed-wing flight to profile the atmosphere in the vicinity of the balloon up to 70 km in altitude and then returns to land on the platform under vertical flight. The final flight occurs when needed to reduce the ballast weight of the system, thereby increasing net lift. The drone sonde includes thermal management systems needed to survive surface conditions for several hours to conduct image surveys and then transmit data from the surface.",The primary intended application for Creare’s Venus Sonde is to support NASA and its planetary exploration missions. The design resulting from this effort could be adapted to planetary exploration missions to other planetary bodies with an atmosphere. This design can also be adapted for terrestrial applications to help achieve NASA’s Earth observation objectives.,"The applications for Creare’s Venus Sonde are broad and far reaching for terrestrial applications. These could include routine commercial services such as drone delivery services, atmospheric profiling, and monitoring and surveillance activities for agriculture and utility companies. Each application would likely entail application-specific requirements and customization of the system."

In general, a heat pump provides the common extensibility for thermal control over the lunar diurnal. Active cooling systems or heat pumps such as mechanical cryocoolers and thermoelectric coolers are commonly used on spacecraft for small heat loads while vapor compression systems have been flown and, more recently, reverse turbo Brayton-cycle coolers are being developed for high load, high temperature heat lift. However, technology gaps exist for mid-range heat pumps that are suitable for small science rovers where internal heat dissipation may range from 20 Watts to 100 Watts. To address this limitation, Nanohomics Inc., in consultation with Dr. Bed Poudel at Penn State University, proposes to design a high cooling density and efficient V-shunt thermoelectric cooling (TEC) system (heat pumps) suitable for small science rovers. The V-shunt TEC will employ recently invented BiTe-based thermoelectric materials at Penn State University which have the best figure-of-merit (ZT) at the temperature of interest (< 100 °C) to meet the required 20 – 100 Watts of heat load and coefficient of performance (COP). Furthermore, the increase in effective TE fill factor would enhance the overall cooling power and efficiency as required for the lunar science rovers. The proposed TEC cooling system will be fabricated based on the Nanohmics’ recently developed modular and conformal TE technology and addresses the cooling need of small science rovers at lunar surface below 50 °C by lifting 20 – 100 Watts (at the rate of 230 W/m2) of heat to environmental sink temperature of around 75 °C, i.e., ∆T > 25 °C.","The proposed work will enhance the cooling power and efficiency of thermoelectric convertor (TEC) at the temperature of interest. These V-shunt TECs can be used in many NASA missions, which require localized cooling to remove heat or to achieve low temperature to replace currently available complicated multistage TECs. Furthermore, the highly efficient TEC designs will also enable to use thermoelectric technology for many other space cooling and power generation missions.","The efficient TEC systems would provide a means to meet next generation smart cooling systems which can reduce the CO2 and greenhouse gases emission compared to the competitive cooling systems. These mass-marketable TECs can replace most of commercial TECs and compression-based system in other applications such as automotive, defense and biomedical cooling applications of $1bn market."

For every gram of liftoff mass removed from the return vehicle, the incremental reduction in gross liftoff mass from Earth is several orders of magnitude greater. Consequently, any technology that can reduce the mass that must be lifted out of the target body’s gravity well will have a huge impact on the amount of mass that must be lifted off the Earth’s surface. For an ascent vehicle, regardless of whether a solid, liquid, or hybrid rocket is used, thrusters will be needed for the reaction control system. Studies have shown that above a certain threshold, monopropellant systems become more mass-efficient than cold gas systems. An in-house trade study has shown that for total impulses above 140 N·s, a traditional hydrazine system has less mass than a cold-gas system. The same study also showed that if a foam-based ignition system is used with hydrazine instead of a granular catalyst and external heaters, the breakeven point drops to just 44 N·s. Furthermore, as the total impulse requirement increases, the mass advantage of the foam-based hydrazine system increases significantly. In this project, Ultramet will design, fabricate, and hot-fire test a foam-based ignition system for hydrazine.","Virtually any spacecraft or launch vehicle using monopropellant hydrazine can benefit directly from this technology. Applications include attitude control systems on spacecraft, reaction control systems on launch vehicles, and primary propulsion systems on smallsats and cubesats. Because the technology is fundamentally propellant-agnostic, it can be applied to virtually any monopropellant or non-hypergolic bipropellant system. Other applications include air heaters for hypersonic wind tunnels.","Non-NASA applications include attitude control thrusters on satellites, reaction control thrusters on launch vehicles, and primary propulsion systems on smallsats and cubesats. DoD applications include missile propulsion systems and air heaters for hypersonic wind tunnels. Other potential applications include auxiliary power units and emergency power units on aircraft."

In previous work, large volumetric fractions of Au, Ag, and Cu nanoparticles (NPs) were incorporated into a porous aramid nanofiber (ANF) matrix to realize films that have high electrical conductivity, yet maintain superior mechanical strength, properties that are usually hard to achieve simultaneously. Furthermore, the composite films demonstrate excellent flexibility, which is superior to other related classes of reported flexible conductors including carbon based nanomaterials (CNTs and graphene) and other metallic materials. The unique network structure enables high electrical conductivity and robust mechanical behavior of the metal-ANF films. Most pertinently for mass-restrictive applications, we previously demonstrated that copper-ANF composites had ~90 % less mass density than solid copper, but with electrical properties (conductivity, ampacity) that were at least 33 % of the bulk value. During Phase I, we will extend the material system to aluminum structural components that are relevant to sample-return missions that require mass-efficient materials. We will first find the lower limits of achievable mass that still provides acceptable conductivity, ampacity, and strength in both cylindrical and polygonal cross-sectional solids. We will then characterize the conductive and insulating properties of self-insulated solids, in which the ANF can be functionalized with various levels of conductivity. We can control the optical properties of the Al-ANF composite by modifying the surface plasmon resonance of the aluminum NPs, knowledge that will be used to make solids of various optical properties. Finally, we will design manufacturing tools to scale-up the production of the solids.","The high-strength, reduced mass conductor material modality is multi-use and cross-cutting for a broad range of NASA mission applications, whether that includes hybrid electric aeronautical craft or spacecraft. For space applications, the innovation can be used for sample-return spacecraft bodies, planetary surface power, large-scale spacecraft prime power, small-scale robotic probe power, and small-sat power. For aeronautical applications, the low-mass wiring can efficiently distribute power to aircraft propulsors with minimal mass overhead.","Lightweight metals can substantially impact the terrestrial electric vehicle and power-transmission markets. Energy storage systems must be flexible, robust, lightweight, and exhibit superior electrochemical activity. Furthermore, robust, flexible conductors are needed to meet the rapidly growing demand in smart sensors, roll-up displays, and other applications with unconventional form factors."

Dragonfly will launch in 2026 and arrive in 2034 on Titan. Mars sample return is a proposed mission to return samples from surface of Mars to Earth. The Artemis program will land the first woman and next man on Moon by 2024. Conceptual landing probes for Europa have been proposed.  However, the missions would experience extreme conditions: temperatures ranging from -220°C on Europa, -200 °C on Ganymede to -180°C on Titan. In addition, the instrument will go through high cosmic radiation environments with long duration of the mission. At these extreme conditions, traditional oil lubricants and greases are infeasible, resulting in dry sliding conditions with significant detrimental effects on component performance. The reliable operation of moving parts and tribological components (e.g., bearings, gears, sealings, etc.) in the cryogenic environment is a key for successful accomplishment of future NASA missions. Therefore, selection and design of new lubrication and protection are imperative for each application. Tribological experiments are therefore necessary to simulate relevant environments to mitigate mission risk. This proposal offers a unique solution: aromatic thermosetting copolyester (ATSP) coating on ATSP coating sliding is shown to have low coefficient of friction (COF) and “zero wear” from -196°C to 300°C. This excellent tribological performance leads us to introduce ATSP-based coatings for Europa cryogenic environment conditions. we will investigate the tribological performance of ATSP-based composites using flat pin-on-disk experiments under conditions in combination with radiation effect.","ATSP-based tribological products have wide temperature range (-196 to 300°C) with low wear and friction and have applicability for devices used in future missions to Titan, Europa, the Moon, and Mars.

The reliable operation of moving parts and tribological components (e.g., bearings, gears, sealings, etc.) in such extreme environments is key for successful accomplishment of future NASA missions.","ATSP-based tribological products are applicable for Aerospace, Automotive, Space Exploration, and Energy.

Furthermore, in addition to being a basic rugged and rad-hard modulator, it is directly adaptable to be used as a stable frequency source for many applications including the local oscillator for critical navigation and also in the signal chain that is typically used in mobile and agile radar. The compact nature of the design stems from our capability to integrate smallest piezoelectric  crystals  in the same hybrid enclosure as the ASIC.

To address this challenge, the ATC-NY team will develop Response Abstraction and Model Simplification (RAMS), a decision-support tool that assists scientists and automates remote and deep-space data collection for known events.  RAMS operates efficiently on remote sensing platforms by quantizing samples of telemetry data to enable highly parallel processing of Quantized Neural Network (QNN) operations.  RAMS also applies transfer learning and active learning techniques to train effective event detection models that reproduce human data-selection processes using a limited number of examples.  Using RAMS, scientists supporting the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission identify several examples of target signals for magnetic reconnection events near the Earth’s magnetopause and magnetotail, which RAMS uses to automatically select such events in future data.","RAMS can be applied to improve data collection, as well as automate and enhance event detection in NASA missions involving remote sensing with limited data access. Applications of RAMS include Earth-observing, atmospheric, and magnetospheric survey missions, such as MMS, WIND, THEMIS, Cluster II, STEREO, and the Europa Lander.","RAMS has application in commercial and government Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

In Phase I we propose to apply modern machine learning (ML) methods to enable real-time flagging of integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar measurements using ancillary data collected inflight. In addition, during Phase I, we propose to leverage significant improvements in research forecast models to build tools to extract data relevant to same-day flight planning tools and inputs required for low-uncertainty, inflight, preliminary data analysis of IPDA measurements. In Phase II we will use ML methods to score the quality of research forecast inputs to preliminary column mole fraction (CMF) retrievals. The IPDA lidars used in the Atmospheric Carbon Transport - America NASA Earth Venture Suborbital Program, the Multi-functional Fiber Laser Lidar (MFLL) and the High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO), will provide the primary data for these retrievals. Ultimately, the goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using high-resolution rapid refresh (HRRR) models to enable improved NASA airborne science mission planning and to demonstrate application of the derived thermodynamic variables to near-real-time CMF retrievals with low uncertainty. Tools developed in this SBIR will provide a significant improvement for future airborne science missions in general through enhanced tools for flight planning, resulting in maximization of science return per flight hour. Additionally, science campaigns using active remote gas monitoring systems will be significantly enhanced through the ability to provide low uncertainty retrievals of column mole fractions for the gas of interest in near-real-time from the remote measurements versus the weeks- or months-long lag currently available for these systems.","The proposed work would support future NASA airborne campaign planning by developing 3D insights into the atmospheric state parameters in a manner that can inform decisions both before takeoff and inflight for maximization of science objectives. One example application will be demonstrated where forecast model data is used to enable simulated real-time column mole fractions, from two different IPDA lidar, with minimal uncertainties using the extensive data set from the Atmospheric Carbon Transport – America, Earth Venture Suborbital mission.","Real-time retrieval of column integrated mole fraction could be useful for disaster mitigation.  Example applications include forest fire plume tracking, toxic chemical plume tracking, and regulatory monitoring of key sources driving air quality.  The enhanced 3D flight planning tools could be adopted by other science agencies which conduct airborne science missions (e.g., NOAA, DOE, USFS)."

Analyzing this data in-orbit is becoming increasingly important for the purposes of accelerating scientific discovery and enabling opportunistic science. State-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data science applications require significant resources to run computationally intensive algorithms and models. To facilitate intensive data analysis in a resource constrained environment such as space, we need to utilize resources efficiently and at scale. Current solutions to this problem require downlinking full datasets to perform ground-based processing or running low computational footprint algorithms that are less effective than state-of-the-art solutions. In this proposal, we explore the capabilities and benefits of developing MAGE (ML Accelerated Grid Environment). MAGE is a software framework and API that facilitates ML training and inference distributed across a networked constellation or swarm of satellites to enable resource intensive ML models to run at the extreme edge. This solution makes complex data processing at the edge possible by running on AI accelerated hardware and distributing ML processing and storage across a grid of compute and storage nodes. Collectively, these nodes comprise a grid computing environment that can be tasked by spacecraft to run resource intensive applications. MAGE reduces the need to downlink full data sets, allows prioritization of data downlinking, enables proliferation of complex autonomous space-based systems, and provides a mission agnostic environment for processing and storage. Utilizing a system such as MAGE would allow NASA to perform efficient, scalable, mission agnostic AI and ML processing at the edge for any scientific mission.","The NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) downlinks ~2% of the data it acquires as part of its mission. MAGE would enable missions such as this to perform processing in-orbit to mitigate data loss, improve and accelerate discovery, and prioritize data for downlinking. MAGE also enables the proliferation of complex autonomous decision making systems including instrument calibration, attitude adjustments, object detection and avoidance, swarm reconfiguration, and reacting space weather events.","MAGE is a natural fit for swarm and constellation missions such as the Space Force Space and Missile Center's Space Combat Cloud where it could support constellation-wide processing, storage, and information dissemination. Our company also works with the Air Force Research Lab on constellation R&D where MAGE could support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications."

As demands have grown, so has the fidelity, complexity, and precision of spacecraft observations. In addition, modern spacecraft communications bandwidth allows for the transmission of more data than ever. These increased capabilities have placed extra demands on spacecraft science observations. Although creating observation plans is usually relegated to the flight operations period of a mission, teams can benefit by considering these observation designs during early stages of mission planning as well. Collaboration between science teams and operations teams requires a complex web of cumbersome technology for sharing and integrating observation plans and their resulting data. This significant complexity hinders the ability of responsible parties to make informed, sensible, and rapid decisions. Spaceline solves this problem with an application that every party involved can access. Additionally, Spaceline’s flexible access allows users of both browser-based GUI or WebAPI to work with Spaceline directly or link Spaceline to their own tools, maintaining a known provenance for every kernel. We propose to extend the core functionality of Spaceline from supporting only pre-compiled observation plans to allowing users to create observation plans directly within Spaceline. The expanded capability will require an additional user interface. Users will define a collection of components including points, vectors, and coordinate frames that define the explicit attitude targets of an observation plan.","Our proposed addition of observation planning in the Spaceline ecosystem will directly facilitate NASA in their goal of developing Mission Design Analysis tools to increase the accuracy of science modeling and enable design of future observing systems by predicting and optimizing their impacts on science data collection. By allowing users to experiment with observation designs earlier in the design cycle of a mission, teams have the opportunity to develop a more advanced ConOps, supporting mission success.",Spaceline would support commercial Earth orbiting constellations as well as Space Situational Awareness applications.

The WarpIV Kernel is a layered open-system architecture where each layer in the architecture is permitted to utilize (i.e., depend on) services from lower layers, but not the upper layers. With this hierarchical dependency structure, the architecture layers can be thought of as composable libraries that are ready for standardization by the international Modeling & Simulation (M&S) community. Any technology layer could be swapped out and replaced with a different (perhaps optimized for a particular hardware/network configuration) implementation developed by any other organization. The plug-and-play composability design strategy of the WarpIV Kernel promotes composability both for (1) technology insertion and (2) composable plug-and-play software models potentially developed by multiple geographically distributed organizations to facilitate collaboration. The software abstractions and overall composability methodology support both arbitrary and mixed levels of fidelity for systems and subsystems hierarchically composed of models. Support for plug-and-play model composability within the WarpIV Kernel simulation engine is essentially complete and could be used by NASA today to support MBSE. However, the set of tools used to (a) construct models and (b) specify their composite structure needs to support MBSE standards such as SysML. The model data, interface, and system-structure metadata that is captured by the WarpIV GUI tools have not yet been translated to SysML format and vice versa, so this step needs to first be evaluated for feasibility and then demonstrated with initial capabilities. This effort will also demonstrate a conceptual spacecraft mission executing with a set of simple composable models in parallel.",Any NASA M&S program that requires a usable MBSE capability that implements most (or all) of the major SysML capabilities needed to support MBSE. The discreet-event and entity-centric modeling constructs are ideal for space mission modeling.

The greatest potential NASA application would be the reuse of composable model code and creation of model and interface packages for use on future projects.,"The OpenUTF and its WarpIV Kernel open source reference implementation are being prepared for eventual standardization and widespread use across multiple DoD agencies and programs including ARL, DMSCO, MDA, and AMSCO.

These realities compound mission risks. In particular, mission control may not have accurate enough situational awareness to be able to provide timely decision support.

Our fault management solution fuses fault detection, diagnosis and mitigation with current mission primitives, priorities, and platform capabilities. It will respond to system degradation, faults, and lost platform capabilities in such a way that preserves mission-relevant capabilities by leveraging an expert system ontology for self-assessed capability analysis, adaptive search techniques for fault mitigation, and statistical and symbolic fault detection and identification.

HPC models of heliophysics can also support the development of space weather mitigation technologies and decision making. NASA currently employs HPC models, such as ENLIL, to model the physics of the Sun. However, ENLIL cannot currently fully exploit the parallel processing capabilities of the modern multi-core compute nodes, nor can it utilize the GPU accelerators now common on NASA’s HPC clusters. Maintaining a mission critical code like ENLIL can be a challenge, as both the number of man hours required to enable the code to properly exploit new hardware is non-trivial, and the HPC environment itself is continually evolving. A new Domain Specific Language (DSL), together with a source-to-source translator, is proposed that will allow mission critical NASA codes, like ENLIL, to be written in a form that allows for improved portability between various HPC environments and hardware (including GPU accelerators), and reduce the level of skill and effort required to maintain and extend such codes. A proof-of-concept prototype of the language and source-to-source translator will be developed in Phase I and demonstrated using an in-house CFD solver. The deliverable in Phase I is a report detailing the findings of Phase I, along with a plan for Phase II development. In Phase II, a fully working language specification and source-to-source translator will be developed and demonstrated by rewriting ENLIL. The deliverables for Phase II are progress reports and a rewritten version of ENLIL that can exploit modern, heterogeneous HPC platforms, and will be easier to maintain as the HPC environment continues to evolve.","The proposed work will result in the modernization of ENLIL, a mission critical code used by the NASA CCMC for modeling heliophysics. By improving the performance, portability, and ease of maintenance of ENLIL, the proposed work will support NASA’s role under the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, and have a beneficial impact on NASA’s space weather forecasting and mitigation capabilities.","The Domain Specific Language (DSL) and translator may be applied to any Cartesian grid based PDE solver. In addition to space weather modeling, the tools developed under this work will potentially have application in the financial industry. Since the proposed DSL reduces the skill and effort required to write portable HPC code, the tools developed here may be useful for academic teaching/research."

In the RFE, cold water propellant or hydrogen used as the heat rejection dump for a dynamic cycle heated by a nuclear reactor, enabling Carnot efficiencies as high as 0.79 for water or 0.99 for hydrogen. Some of the propellant that is boiled or sublimated off is then sent to an electric propulsion system, which ejects it from the spacecraft at high velocities to produce thrust. Potential RFE conversion systems include Brayton, Rankine, and Stirling cycles. The RFE can be operated in either steady state or in pulsed modes, with the later enabling very high thrust/mass ratios. Potential alternative RFE propellants include nitrogen, methane, CO2, and ammonia stored in either liquid or frozen phases. Because its thermal to electric conversion efficiency is about a factor of 3 higher than conventional NEP systems, and it does not require radiators for heat rejection, the RFE can achieve power to mass ratios an order of magnitude higher than conventional multi megawatt power systems.  Other advantages of the RFE include its ability to use cheap, dense propellants that are plentiful or producible in space. In the proposed program, the potential performance of the RFE will be analyzed, design options compared, technical concerns addressed, and the concept validated by means of computer analysis and laboratory tests.","The Radiator Free Engine (RFE) enables very high power to mass ratio NEP and solar thermal electric propulsion. RFE systems could be used to transport payloads from LEO to the Deep Space Gateway. RFE systems could use water as propellant, enabling the Artemis Moonbase to support both cis-lunar and interplanetary transportation. RFEs could enable fast trips between Earth and Mars. RFE reactor systems could also be used to supply power on surface of the Moon, Mars, and Titan. RFE lunar surface vehicles could go into shadowed craters to mine ice.","Solar thermal RFE space transfer vehicles could support LEO to GEO transfer of commercial satellites, and cis-lunar transportation.

Oxygen is one of the most valuable materials in space operations and is abundant in Lunar regolith (up to 40%).  Unfortunately, the lunar regolith beneficiation process for producing oxygen results in process gases that may be contaminated with sulfur (H2S) and halide (HCl, HF) impurities, all of which must be removed. TDA Research, Inc. proposes to develop durable, high-capacity regenerable sorbents that can remove sulfur and halide contaminants from the process gas containing the oxygenated species produced from lunar regolith.  We will use two regenerable sorbents, one of which will reduce the amount of HCl and HF, while the other will remove the H2S to parts per billion levels. In the proposed work we will synthesize new sorbent formulations and evaluate their performance under representative conditions.  We will explore the methods to prepare these sorbents on engineered structures to increase their durability and promote better heat transfer during the thermal regeneration process.  We will perform a minimum of 500 adsorption/regeneration cycles to demonstrate the life of these sorbents.  Finally, we will carry out a detailed engineering analysis and design to assess the technical viability of the concept.","The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact, and efficient gas purification system to enable the production of oxygen from Lunar regolith feasible.

The dust is highly charged and highly insulating in a low gravity, vacuum environment that makes terrestrial dust mitigation methods inoperable. Passive coatings that can mitigate lunar dust have been based on friction reduction and do not address the electrostatic charges associated with the lunar environment. To remove static charge from the dust particles, the Alpha Particle Emitter Coating System proposes to apply a thin coating of Americium-241 to the surfaces of interested. Am-241 is a long-lived alpha emitter (432-year half-life) used for ionization in smoke detectors. This coating will supply positively charged alpha particles that can neutralize negative charges on the surfaces of the dust particles that attach to the surface. Furthermore, the coating would provide ionization to air used to blow dust off of surfaces in the lunar environment. These coatings would provide the long-lasting protection from lunar dust accumulation needed for repeat landings and habitation.","The APECS has the potential to create passive dust mitigation surfaces that can enable long-term operations on the lunar surface. As such, it stands to play a crucial role in the current Artemis mission to the moon, as well as for future missions to Mars and beyond. For terrestrial applications, the APECS could improve mixing and efficiency for pharmaceutical powder handling equipment. Currently, the electrostatic charge built up on the surface of pharmaceutical powders impedes homogenous mixing, resulting in uneven efficacy and performance.","Although static charge neutralization systems exist for pharmaceutical powders, none are passive in nature, requiring dedicated, high-voltage systems for operation.

NASA is advancing multiple space exploration missions to planetary bodies with the near term goal of returning to the Moon and lunar dust is of particular concern. The lunar surface is, and has been, bombarded with a range of micrometeorites that create a relatively fine dust powder on the surface that is easily agitated, has sharp structural edges, and is charged by photons and solar winds. This combination allows for and even generates fine, charged clouds of dust that coat and obscure structures on the lunar surface. This includes the necessary structures for thermal regulation, thermal radiators. Thermal radiator systems are commonly cantilevered panel structures designed to extend beyond a main structure to increase the surface area utilized for the absorbance or emittance of thermal radiative energy. Dust buildup on thermal regulators can greatly decrease thermal performance by simultaneously increasing solar absorptivity by darkening the surface and decreasing effective emissivity by adding a low-conduction layer on top of the surface. To help with dust mitigation on structures like thermal radiators, Paragon proposes a Modal Optimized Vibration dust Eliminator (MOVE) as a low cost solution to NASA’s desire for dust mitigation on the lunar surface. The proposed innovation is a two-part lunar dust mitigation solution which utilizes autonomous, active vibration at modal  frequencies coupled with an anti-static coating to minimize the performance reduction caused by lunar dust accumulation on radiative surfaces and panels. The vibration system component is used to loosen and move lunar dust particles off of radiative surfaces to improve thermal radiator performance.","Direct NASA applications of dust mitigation techniques on radiators include human-piloted and autonomous rovers, Lunar decent and ascent vehicles, and surface-installed static equipment. Radiators are highly tailorable for different applications, which yields its use to nearly every application requiring the rejection of heat from electronics or power sources.","The challenges for NASA and commercial missions related to accumulation of dust on radiator surfaces are similar. Accepted and successful applications for NASA missions would be directly transferable to commercial lunar missions. Potentially, there will be more commercial applications due to diversity in mission objective and the nature of market competition."

The Artemis program will land the first woman and next man on the Moon by 2024, followed by manned missions to Mars. The Moon is covered by large amounts of dust particles, called regolith, which could cause serious problems for tribological components on the Moon, which makes dust as the number one concern in returning to the Moon. In addition to dust issues, the temperature has a large variation between day and night, from cryogenic temperatures of -147°C to upwards of 100°C. Therefore, the effect of temperature should also be taken into account in combination with abrasive dust. The reliable operation of moving parts and tribological components (e.g., bearings, gears, sealings, etc.) in the Moon environment is a key for successful accomplishment of future NASA missions. Therefore, selection and design of new lubrication and protection are imperative for each application. Tribological experiments are therefore necessary to simulate relevant environments so as to mitigate mission risk. This proposal offers unique solutions for these extreme conditions: ATSP coating sliding against ATSP coatings have shown low coefficients of friction and “zero wear” from -196°C to 300°C. This excellent tribological performance leads us to introduce ATSP-based coatings for the abrasive conditions and wide thermal demands of the Moon.

To meet this need, Lunar Dust Protection Devices will be designed to stop dust from reaching sealing surfaces or hydrophilic membranes within safety critical PLSS components. Self-sealing silicone covers will be developed to protect valves and quick disconnects until activated by crew force or venting gas pressure, while protective screens will be used to protect the membranes, which flow water vapor intermittently.

Current solutions to this problem include “hardening” a computer by altering the underlying semiconductor material and using non-standard circuit designs.  These approaches make these rad-hard computers expensive and with performance that lags commercial computers by ~20 years.  There is currently a demand from the aerospace industry for new computers that can match commercial performance while achieving the reliability needed in a space environment at a price that is not cost-prohibitive for the wide-scale adoption.  This project builds on over 10 years of NASA-funded research at Montana State University on a computer architecture called RadPC.  RadPC implements a comprehensive set of fault mitigation strategies on a commercial Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).  Various sub-systems of RadPC have been demonstrated on high-altitude balloons (8x), on sounding rockets (2x), on the International Space Station, and on two small satellite missions.  RadPC has also been selected for a lunar surface demonstration through the Artemis program.  Through this past research, the architecture of RadPC has been refined into one that achieves the performance, reliability, and flexibility to support future space missions.  However, the current prototype form of RadPC requires manual construction of the system at each step of the design process.  This manual and tedious construction of the current RadPC system makes it difficult for RadPC to be adopted as a commercial product.  The aim of this SBIR project is to investigate the automation of the development process for RadPC so that a developer can write programs for the RadPC architecture without being burdened with the underlying fault mitigation procedures that are being implemented.",,

The main system would have the ability to reconfigure this IPU device to scale up and down, specifying a specific state depending on the needs of the current task.  If one desires, performance limitations can be enforced on the parallel processing unit. For added performance and redundancy, multiple processors will be included on the same board, with the capability to stack multiple units together.

Both of these issues can be resolved with the use of high performance processors (Mou et al., 2017).

The RapidIO switch in RadRISC also provides a connection to the hardware root of trust and any connected I/O devices or peripherals.

Essential to this goal is servicing, assembly, and manufacturing outside of earth’s gravity. Upon completion of the proposed work, Temper hopes to provide proof of concept of a fast, low-energy and reliable method for welding thermoplastic composites both on Earth and on-orbit. Designs for robotic end effectors to automate the process will also be developed. While able to melt, re-solidify and weld like metals, thermoplastic composites have a higher strength-to-weight ratio and better thermostability. However, reliably joining thermoplastic components has proved difficult and costly. The work proposed in this SBIR will fulfil the objectives of performing prototype welding PEEK thermoplastic composites, validation of welded flat panels and tubular joints, identifying design concepts for robotic end effectors, and development of a method for manual repairs. Temper has developed a Smart Susceptor alloy that controls induction heating to weld thermoplastic composites without the risk of softening, overheating, or deforming the components. This alloy is drawn into wires and fabricated into a weld tape for placement between the materials to be bonded. Utilizing fast and energy-efficient induction heating through alternating magnetic fields, once the Smart Susceptor reaches its Curie temperature, the metal alloy becomes non-magnetic and induction heating stops. Only light pressure (10 psi) is needed to comingle the melted resin and form the weld. Controlled heating can be set for any length of time and cool-down or tempering profiles can be created to control the microstructure of the thermoplastic resin. This technology can be coupled with additive manufacturing so any type of thermoplastic component can be fabricated and assembled on-orbit.","Welding of thermoplastic composites has applicability across several of NASA’s planned missions. As Artemis plans for the construction of high value structures such as habitat modules, trusses, and solar arrays, space-based welding supports its mission goals.

One such “defect” is related to metal vapor condensate contamination. One of the benefits of the EBAM process is its efficient use of power as well as the high purity vacuum environment. These process characteristics allow EBAM to provide fast deposition speeds that in many cases lead the industry. One side effect of this high deposition rate with the vacuum is that the raw material is often vaporized at a high rate as well and this metal vapor condenses back into solid form on surfaces local to the process. Over time the condensate build up can become substantial and occurrences have been observed where the condensate gets dislodged and can fall into the melt pool. Sciaky has learned that in the case of EBAM deposition targeting Ti-6Al-4V, the condensate is made up of predominantly aluminum.  This issue is a well-documented concern when processing alloys with elements having various vapor pressures in a high vacuum environment.  If the condensate becomes entrapped within the molten pool, the local area no longer achieves the target chemistry or metallurgical properties.  There has been at least one instance where the condensate provided a crack initiation site that resulted catastrophic failure of a preform in response to residual stress buildup. Our phase 1 approach will target the real-time identification of metal condensate events, document the location of detected events and provide the basis for corrective action avoiding the scrapping of a part. This proof of concept shall provide the basis for a series of other identified defects to be addressed via a machine learning approach that may include material contaminants, process interruptions, gross lack of fusion type defects, large porosity and potentially others as the approaches get refined.","With the additional capability of in situ monitoring and real-time defect detection and identification being coupled with Sciaky's closed-loop control, EBAM can provide solutions for countless NASA applications.

New space vehicles and systems are being developed and tested, and a significant percentage of the structures in these spacecraft will be composite materials. Composites offer high stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios, but they also exhibit complex damage modes, including voids, delaminations, matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and combinations of all the above. This offers many challenges for ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM). A proper understanding of the physics of a given NDE/SHM method is critical for the meaningful characterization and quantitative assessment of structural health. A need therefore exists to fundamentally understand the interaction of interrogative ultrasonic wave energy with the complex fiber/matrix system and damage types in multi-layered composites. To address this issue, a predictive tool with quantitative computational NDE/SHM capabilities is necessary to the success of future space missions. In this project, it is proposed to develop a physics-based software package to model ultrasonic energy interaction with composite damage in both the frequency and time domains. The software package utilizes open source code and a fast and efficient Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) to solve frequency domain ultrasonic wave fields in multi-layered composite structures with and without damage. The objective of this effort is to expand the DPSM capabilities to obtain time domain sensor responses at any location. Parallel computing capability will be implemented to solve the problem at multiple frequencies such that the time domain signal can be computed at any point on the structure. The wave energy-material modeling software package will be an essential tool to optimize sensor locations and minimize the total number of sensors and weight of future NDE/SHM systems.","It is anticipated that the first application of the technology will be the integration into NASA’s digital NDE/SHM tools for large complex composite space structures, such as the Artemis program’s Orion crew module and Space Launch System. As NASA directs efforts into deep space flight, NDE/SHM systems will be needed to provide mission critical information about the structures. For these NDE/SHM systems to be viable, a computational tool, such as the proposed software package, to accurately model the energy-material interaction is essential.","Non-NASA applications include large, commercial space launch vehicles that utilize composite materials. The US Air Force, Army, and Navy also have a growing interest in simulated NDE with the concept of ‘Digital Twin’ and real time material state awareness.

These critical flaws can be volumetric or fracture-like in nature and are difficult to detect in the finished part. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a non-destructive method to not only detect and quantify these defects, but also to correlate the results to the expected strength and fatigue life of the part.

Fine grasping tasks such as plugging and unplugging electrical and fluid connectors will be difficult for current state of the art grippers. The connectors will be nestled among other connectors, wires and tubes. The HMA adaptive robotic gripper has narrow and flexible fingers that allow it to be easily maneuvered around obstacles to the connector. After grabbing the connector the fingers will stiffen so that they have a rigid hold on the connector. The two phase gripper can be easily maneuvered to the connector in its flexible phase and then wrap around the connector and become rigid in its second phase allowing the robot to rotate and push/pull the connector into position. The unique advantages of the HMA adaptive gripper is that it is a simple design that is easy to position and activate. Unlike a precision gripper with rigid fingers that move through a defined profile, the adaptive gripper has very flexible fingers that do not move through a defined profile. When actuated the flexible fingers conform to the profile of the object that it is gripping. Precise positioning of the adaptive gripper relative to the connector is not required. The adaptive gripper has the dual advantages of having flexible fingers that become very rigid when grabbing and moving the object.","NASA applications include IVA robots using the adaptive gripper for fine grasping tasks during general maintenance, in particular the plug/unplug of electrical and fluid connectors. The gripper will also allow IVA robots to perform payload operations and spacecraft caretaking. This includes housekeeping, stowage, surface sample aggregation, science measurements and operations. Beyond Gateway these similar applications are needed on robots in future lunar and planetary surface activity.","The adaptive gripper has many potential applications in the commercial markets. Currently, the agricultural industry is an area very interested in this technology with focus on picking strawberries. Nuclear power plant maintenance with its hazardous environment is another industry. The e-commerce is growing dramatically and has interest in automated pickers for order fulfillment."

While a number of NASA robotic systems such as Astrobee or Robonaut 2 have been developed to function as such potential caretakers, many technical questions remain on how to effectively coordinate their activities in conjunction with each other, with the spacecraft command and controls systems (environmental, power, avionics, thermal, propulsion, etc.), and with the activities of human crew (when available).  In response to this need, TRACLabs proposes to develop a software framework that draws upon principles of dynamical systems theory to ground ontological representations that can support autonomous caretaking and payload activities.  We call this system DISCO-RECOVERY (DISCrete-event Ontology for the RECursive Organization of VEhicular & Robotic activitY).  The goal of this work will be to investigate how these typically disparate formalisms can complement each other and support a common framework for expressing the behavior of the systems (robots and spacecraft) that must be coordinated to ensure proper operation.","The proposed effort will specifically targets the operations of spacecraft such as Gateway that may only be crewed as little as one month a year.  The goals of DISCO-RECOVERY have much synergy with the ongoing NASA Integrated System for Autonomous and Adaptive Caretaking (ISAAC) effort, though will generally be useful for further cislunar and lunar missions (e.g., Artemis). Having transitioned past SBIRs to a Phase III status, we are optimistic that this work will inspire similar investment by NASA programs.","We will market DISCO-RECOVERY first to existing TRACLabs customers in aerospace, energy, automotive, and defense sectors as autonomous maintenance, operations, and coordination between heterogeneous teams of robotic and electronic assets is a key goal in each of these sectors, including via ""lights-out"" factories."

The traditional approach to achieving switching speeds on the order of 100ns is to use an FPGA that interfaces to multiple digital to analog converters via a high-speed interface, resulting in a relatively large footprint and high power consumption (10s of watts not including the laser itself).  In our proposed approach, we suggest using our proprietary semiconductor devices that provide on-chip thermal compensation to remove the sensitivities to changing injection current, in conjunction with high-speed, low power consumption direct digital synthesis waveform generation integrated circuits.  This will result in a small footprint (approximately 2.7” x 3.4” x 0.54”) module that consumes less than 10W total (including laser and thermoelectric cooler).

Reducing hot gas ingress will reduce oxidation/recession of interior fibrous materials and reduce interior convective heating throughout the F-TPS.

The use of newer ablative TPS materials in the high-enthalpy flow result in complex processes such as decomposition of products, surface ablation, and spallation. Optical measurement techniques that can size and track particles in the flow would be of value for validation of facility operation and refinement of numerical models. Unfortunately, optical measurements of particles in an arc jet are challenging due to the strong emission from the test article and reacting flow which can saturate the camera. ISSI proposes employing an optical measurement technique known as Particle Shadow Velocimetry (PSV) that has been used to measure particle size, velocity, and acceleration a solid rocket motor at rates of over 10-kHz. PSV is accomplished by projecting light from an LED through the measurement volume onto a camera which allows the shadows created by the particles to be recorded. The individual particle shadow can be sized or tracked in time to compute particle velocity, acceleration, or trajectory. Utilizing an LED-based PSV system for measurements of the size and trajectory of spallation particles in an arc jet offers several unique advantages. First, the combination of a relatively narrow wavelength LED and a matching narrow-band filter on the imaging system can be used to suppress the broadband emission from the flow. This allows acquisition of distinct particle images, even in the presence of strong emission from the reacting flow. Second, the in-line illumination that is required for PSV measurements allows particles to be imaged very close to surfaces, within 50-mm of the ablating TPS surface. PSV is a high TRL tool that has already been demonstrated for acquiring particle size and trajectory measurements in a high enthalpy flow. This proposal offers a low-risk opportunity to acquire similar data on test articles in an arc jet.","NASA programs that utilize scramjets and solid rocket motors would benefit from the proposed low-cost, narrowband PSV system. Specific applications include the spray atomization process in supersonic combustion applications, such as scramjets, and particle dynamics in solid rocket motors. Characterizing the droplet vaporization process is essential for modeling the combustion process. Large particles in an SRM can ablate the nozzle and modify the thrust profile or the SRM.","High-speed PSV is particularly effective in biomedical and hydrodynamic flows such as water tunnels, heart assist pumps, and heart valves which benefit from kHz rate velocity measurements near surfaces. PSI is effective for in-flight droplet sizing in agricultural sprays and has also been used for ice particle measurements in clouds for environmental studies."

The concept creates photon measurements across each source observed in unique energy bands where signals are most beneficial, and blends the diverse signals into a single spacecraft position and velocity solution. Previous work by ASTER Labs has demonstrated concept feasibility of X-ray navigation (XNAV) and gamma-ray navigation (GLINT) as stand-alone architectures. The HYNAV instrument unifies the two individual concepts while adding radio observations into an operational prototype hardware instrument and software package. The advantage of the blended approach is it exploits both the periodic nature of the faint, stable radio and X-ray pulsars with the aperiodic, transient nature of bright, chaotic fast radio and gamma-ray bursts. Thus, the operational system would be capable of frequent measurement updates and continuous accurate absolute or relative navigation. The baseline instrument is designed for small spacecraft (< 180 kg) class vehicles, including larger CubeSats, facilitated by emerging detector materials capabilities, with near-all-sky detection configurations, very good energy resolution, lower energy thresholds for high photon counts, and precise onboard photon timing. Benefits include increased deep space autonomy and formation flight for distributed small spacecraft, while decreasing the burden on the DSN. Phase I will evaluate HYNAV feasibility for relevant NASA applications. System requirements will be developed based upon identified and characterized sources assembled into a catalogue. The instrument hardware design will be coupled with blended data processing navigation algorithms that fuse measurements in a single filter. ASTER Labs’ XPRESS software and a filter simulation will assess absolute and relative navigation performance under target mission scenarios.","This HYNAV system will be directly applicable to NASA’s distributed small spacecraft missions. The integrated instrument and software processing will enable self-navigation and coordinated relative navigation between cooperating spacecraft. The instrument can be integrated into proposed operational systems, such as LunaNet communications. Further deep space CubeSat scale exploration missions to planetary or small bodies, asteroids, comets, and planetary rings are enabled by this new technology.","The HYNAV system concept applies directly to commercial constellation systems for self-navigation. It applies equally well to newer commercial ventures to provide rideshare of instruments to explore planets or industrial mining and manufacturing applications to asteroids. Non-NASA applications include military covert space vehicle covert operations, especially with Earth not in view."

These new satellite designs offer many benefits not only for science but also for reduced mission costs and increased mission robustness for exploration of our planet and beyond. Further, the notion of a ‘swarm’ of smallsats is being considered as a novel and useful way to do science and/or support the attendant communications.  Swarm concepts—multiple satellites flying in formation near one another in similar orbits—are of growing interest, as a solution to the challenge of simultaneous measurement. However, communications for smallsats, and even more significantly swarms of smallsats, are challenged as a result of both the size limitations restricting available power for communications links, and the complexities of coordinating and collecting data from multiple spacecraft. JPL has explored the concept of an Earth receiver coherently combining the received deep space smallsat signals which each individually are too small to process. For the concept to succeed, each member of the swarm must phase its signal very accurately relative to all other swarm signals. This proposal not only seeks to address the deep space application but also expands to include swarm scenarios with higher dynamics – thereby involving signals that are much harder to coherently combine.  Our Swarm Array Coherent Combining (SACC) scenarios span the complete space of possible orbiting swarms and their links to include lunar and other planetary orbiting swarm.  Anticipated results of the effort include a recommended SACC architecture, modeling and simulation of the architecture that demonstrates viability of the concept, and prototype design for Phase II demonstration.","Within the scientific community, there is growing interest in smallsat swarm operations for simultaneous measurement and observation, and NASA efforts are being applied to enabling swarm operations concepts as demonstrated by the NASA Ames support tool being developed to address control of satellite swarm. The swarm array coherent combining concept proposed here, will address not only deep space, but higher dynamic LEO swarms, as well as lunar missions which are anticipated to increase dramatically in this decade under the Artemis Program.","The commercial space sector has grown rapidly, with a majority of spacecraft launched being commercial, and many new businesses being developed around data and applications that rely on space-based observations. Commercial companies in the remote sensing sector for example, often fly constellations of small satellites to meet data collection and could benefit directly from this capability."

We propose to adapt real-time coherent combining software for electronically steered arrays recently proven for ground-to-space communications to the computing constraints of small spacecraft. An electronically steered array antenna system must adjust the phase of multiple received signals so they coherently combine, with errors in the process rapidly degrading the output signal. The chief method of mitigating phase errors is to place the radio antenna elements into a robust, high precision mechanical structure. On a moving platform, another mitigation is also used, precise measurements of movement and/or cessation of all movement during antenna usage. The first is at direct odds with the need for small spacecraft to use lightweight, flexible, and deployable structures. The second is an extreme challenge for orbiting craft, especially those navigating in CisLunar or deep space where relative position knowledge is degraded compared to LEO satellite situations. Miles Space’s coherent combining software continuously adapts to phase differences in radio data streams allowing them to be combined successfully, nearly eliminating grating lobes. Doing so allows flexible, deployable antennas to be used on rotating craft, even those that may have residual antenna vibration due to recent propulsion and attitude control usage. There are corresponding cost and risk reductions in craft mass and machining tolerances with improved tolerance to deployment mechanism issues and on-mission antenna damage. Through a contract with ATLAS Space Operations, Miles Space demonstrated to the US Air Force its coherent combining software operating on a phased array ground terminal downlinking GEO and LEO satellite signals. The algorithm was used on digitized RF data before the data reached a commercial modem for decoding. As judged by the modem, real-time coherent combining eliminated grating lobes.","Dynamic coherent combining breaks constraints of phased array mounting. Arrays can be created from flexible structures, even operating while vibrating, tolerating off-plane rotation while still coherently combining signals, expanding mounting options on a mission. Scientific missions benefit from placement flexibility, letting the science needs dominate. CisLunar and deeper missions need high delta-v. Craft mass is lowered by using this algorithm to perform phase shifting on low mass, low volume deployable phased array antennas, raising delta-v.","Phased arrays let the commercial market obtain licensing in an ever more crowded orbit and this technology makes phased arrays far more economical and practical. Military projects will benefit from this technology as well. The dynamic aspect of the software responds quickly to changing signal conditions, tolerating sudden changes due to damage, increasing resiliency and overall advantage."

However, the effectiveness of these distributed vehicle swarms will be limited by two factors – the size of the individual vehicles (which will determine onboard data relay capabilities) and their distance from the command centers on Earth. The existence of flexible, rapid, low-cost platforms in the cislunar and translunar environments can increase the resiliency and effectiveness of exploratory mission designs by providing a localized area network capacity for communication, PNT, and data relay back to Earth. Nanoracks is currently developing a technological capability which will enable such an integrated solution by repurposing launch vehicle upper stages by attaching a modular hardware bus, or Mission Extension Kit (MEK). After primary payload deployment, the MEK takes over control of the upper stage, providing power, pointing, data down/uplink, and maneuver capabilities. The upper stage becomes an Outpost. Nanoracks proposes undertaking a study to pursue a new path of Outpost concepts of operations: localized data services for distributed space vehicles. This Phase I study will develop a theoretical framework for accomplishing identified and prioritized missions and will demonstrate feasibility for required technological development or integration. The study will provide research results which clearly depict metrics and performance of the technology in comparison to existing solutions. In a follow-on Phase II, Nanoracks expects to demonstrate a prototype capability onboard a suitable ground testbed, followed by a Phase III flight demonstration of the capability. The ultimate goal of this effort are regular flight missions of an operational Outpost capable of providing services in support of the identified missions","This study is designed to address specific Outpost capabilities which can support localized data services for distributed space vehicles to support NASA’s exploration goals, to inform the initial development of an Outpost as a robust orbital data relay platform. An Outpost with capabilities can also provide autonomous “carrier” capabilities to vehicles, including refueling, repair, component storage, cargo exchange, and localized PNT/command/data/communication relays.","Nanoracks’ MEK is designed to turn Outposts into key platforms for the future orbital ecosystem. Outposts located in LEO/GEO will provide payload hosting services, refueling, repair, and other robotically enabled services, and host OSAM activities.

Space-based telescopes have become an indispensable tool for exploring the universe, understanding the Earth’s environment, and monitoring and planning human activity. CubeSats have emerged as a rapid, affordable alternative to large satellites for the scientific community and industry to perform space-based observations. Despite cost and schedule reductions for CubeSat platforms and launches in recent years, the cost and schedule of precision optical systems for CubeSats remains prohibitive for many applications. This discrepancy is largely due to the long fabrication and testing times of extremely precise, stable, and often custom optical components and assemblies. Nanohmics, Inc. proposes to develop and test a low-cost adaptive optics system for CubeSat telescopes based on its passive wavefront sensor and a deformable mirror with the goal of improving imaging performance and enabling the use of components with previously unacceptable design and manufacturing tolerances. The system will be readily customizable to support a wide range of optical prescriptions and to support features relevant to deployable and segmented designs. Advanced deconvolution and super-resolution algorithms will further refine wavefront corrections and improve image resolution. During the Phase I program, Nanohmics will establish system requirements for representative low-cost CubeSat telescopes, perform a design trade study, and develop manufacturing and testing plans. The feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated by constructing and characterizing a breadboard adaptive optics system.","The initial target market is Earth orbit scientific research within NASA SMD, particularly remote sensing and astronomical imaging.

The freeform 3D-GRIN  optics are capable of implementing high order functions, including optical power and aberration correction, within a single achromatic monolithic element, making them ideal for reducing the size and weight of dioptric and catadioptric optical systems.

The costs targeted for such stage would enable dedicated interplanetary missions with CubeSats and Nanosats at a price measured in millions as opposed to high tens of millions. The proposed concept benefits from the extensive micro-pump technology developed at Flight Works for hypergolic, storable bipropellant propulsion systems, combined with space system-level know-how of its principals. With the technology, a pump-fed monopropellant system outperforms a high-performance pressure-fed biprop system; this performance is further enhanced here with a pump-fed biprop system. The result is a growth in payload capability of over 40%. The other benefit is a low-pressure set of tanks, reducing efforts associated with range safety compliance. The biprop stage also leverages the commonality with the avionics suite of the monopropellant stage. This approach allows reducing the development scope, costs and risks while providing a high-performance, high-thrust transfer stage optimized for deep space missions. The high thrust allows for rapid, efficient transfers, compared with electric propulsion systems which require many months to reach the targeted orbit. Also, the system can either stay attached to the small primary payload for long term mission operations or deploy it onto its destined trajectory, thus enhancing mission flexibility.","With a stage designed to provide over 3 km/s delta-V to a nanosat payload for deep space missions, it can be used for NASA lunar and interplanetary applications.

These new mission regimes are more challenging and require greater onboard autonomy capabilities to act and plan without a ground system in the loop. To address this need, we propose to develop an onboard planning capability for smallsats. This software enables constellations or swarms to respond dynamically to failures and opportunities independent of ground systems. The innovation addresses specific gaps in the state of the art identified in our subtopic to enable operation of swarms without the need for ground system commanding. We identify two critical qualities the planner should have. First is the ability to construct a plan that incorporates likely exception information as a safety check. This reduces the frequency of replanning and builds in robustness to exceptions that are well-understood by the operator. The second quality is a standard interface with specialized “subplanners” for functions like maneuvers, constellation design, and so on. This second ability ensures the planning software can interact flexibly with external software, which may be mandated for particular applications. Subplanners are also an appealing approach for decomposing a large planning problem into more tractable sub-problems. The proposed Phase I work will develop a proof-of-concept planner and demonstrate its operation in conjunction with Emergent’s flight software for autonomous mission execution.","NASA has expressed interest in missions involving cooperating small satellites above low Earth orbit, which will benefit from onboard planning.

During assembly, integration, and test (AIT) the SDPC can quickly interface an assortment of solar arrays, energy storage devices, and payloads into a complete EPS system within minutes, reducing NRE by a factor of 10 or more.  Digital control of the load supplies will also provide the ability to change the output voltage, allowing for the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) teams to have the ability to actively interleave power requirements for different loads while in flight – a task that is believed to have never been performed in space.","This Software-Defined Power Controller can be used by cubesats ranging from 3U to 12U and is scalable to ESPA class and larger satellites.  The technology developed within the control system is also applicable to other control systems in which NASA has expressed interest, including other SBIR solicitations including radiation tolerant point-of-load converters (S3.08), radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) (S3.02), and large power systems on the surface of the Mars and the Moon (Z1.05) with the Artemis program.","The Software-Defined Power Controller can be used in cubesats developed by the Space Force, Air Force, National Science Foundation, and commercial companies.  The education sector often has changes in power system requirements from mission to mission where system level modularity is important.  The solid state drive industry is also interested in using this tech for capacitive backup systems."

SmallSats/CubeSats are quicker/cheaper to develop than their larger predecessors. The primary bottleneck has been a lack of standards in the type of subsystems being offered in form, fit, and function. Standardization would go a long way to improve the mission success and reduce development time and cost of a CubeSat. Payload developers spend >50% of their time/resources on creating a satellite bus system instead of on development of the sensor/device, the data from which is the primary rationale for the mission. Attempts have been made to create standardized systems, interfaces, and even materials for SmallSats/CubeSats. However, there has not been a universal acceptance for these “yet to be finalized” standards. The perception exists that those involved in trying to establish certain requirements are focused on specific CubeSat architectures that are in their immediate portfolio. For this proposal, Vistacent is defining “standardization” of the modular units as the basic CubeSat structure to allow structural and electrical standard connectivity between modules. Vistacent proposes to 3D print modular “building blocks” for a complete architecture. This “standardization” will also allow COTS components to be “plugged-in” or “hot-swapped” to the modules. With the addition of rails or tabs, a CubeSat will be able to adapt to any current dispenser. NASA wishes to have a fabrication method to facilitate mass/batch production of CubeSats. The current market of SmallSat/CubeSat system components will be reviewed/assessed to determine system compatibilities. These components will be grouped together into building block functional groups. Modification of our existing 3D printing software will allow innovative solutions such as embedding electrical circuitry for each module in the module walls. This will allow effortless integration of COTS items with standardized CubeSat modules.","From first-hand experience three recent NASA CubeSats could have been developed for a fraction of their $30+ million budgets, if modular building blocks were available. NASA will benefit from Vistacent’s approach by mass producing modular CubeSat blocks using 3D printing, significantly lowering development cost and time for NASA CubeSat missions. The resultant reduction in cost and schedule will enable NASA to leverage more launch opportunities and put more mission-critical payloads in orbit.","Vistacent recognizes the effectiveness of the proposed modular approach for mass production. The military is becoming a strong user of CubeSats with the ability to fly large constellations. Our approach will be very adaptable and scalable to such military needs. Leveraging 19.8% growth expected in the future, Vistacent will facilitate payloads for the private sector and educational institutions."

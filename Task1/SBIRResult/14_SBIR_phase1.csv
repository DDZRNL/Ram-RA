The proposed effort builds upon an in-house developed inorganic solid electrolyte that has demonstrated high ionic conductivity at room temperature (1.5x10-2 S/cm). The primary objective of the Phase I program is to demonstrate that the recently invented solid electrolyte can be formulated into a useable form in a practical Li-ion battery, and that traditional challenges associated with the use of a solid electrolyte can be overcome. A key innovation is the use of a unique composite morphology for the solid electrolyte, wherein passive components, such as the binder and separator, are replaced by an active conductive electrolyte network. The proposed new solid electrolyte will fully eliminate the flammability issues of conventional Li-ion batteries, thereby leading to a safer device with high thermal and mechanical stability. The target energy density for the proposed solid electrolyte based Li-ion cell at the cell level are: greater than 500Wh/kg (gravimetric) and 2700 Wh/l (volumetric), while maintaining 80% of initial capacity after 500 cycles under full depth of discharge. The Phase I effort entails fabrication of the proposed composite solid electrolyte, and cell level testing with a suitably modified cathode and anode. A successful Phase I program will lay the foundation for prototype cell and cell-pack demonstration in Phase II, where Li-ion cells will be designed, assembled, and tested to meet the requirements of NASA for safety, cycle life and energy density. Prototype cells will be delivered to NASA at the end of the Phase II program.","Safe and reliable high energy density storage devices with wide temperature of operation are required for Altair-lunar lander, extravehicular activities (EVA space suites), rovers for missions to outer planet, moon and asteroids, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and International X-ray Observatory (IXO). With the proposed solid electrolyte material, a highly stable and safe Li-ion battery can be developed that meets NASA's high energy density (greater than 500 Wh/kg, C/10) requirements at operating temperature of T=0 to 100 degrees centigrade.","The non-NASA applications include laptops, mobile phones, PDAs, portable TVs, radios, camcorders, electric razors, digital cameras, energy storage for renewable power generation (e.g., solar panels and wind turbines), electric bikes, automotives, and a wide range of military and aerospace applications such as power for sensors, and army soldier conformal batteries.",Ceramics; Composites; Nanomaterials; Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Polymers; Storage,Advanced Space Battery Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The Phase I program aim is to design and fabricate initial prototype hardware, including power electronics and Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) modifications as to demonstrating such positional accuracy capability, power cost (peak and average power consumption), slew rates and mass/volume cost of the new solution.  A critical objective of Phase I will be to develop at the decoupled control architecture for the new multi-stage Attitude Control System ACS controller that will be modeled, simulated, and then converted to hardware prototype for Phase I assessments.  This goal is to integrate this prototype controller into a multi-stage (ACS) design hardware emulation testbed and evaluate actual performance before conclusion of the program.","Investment by NASA/NSF in SmallSats programs and projects is rapidly increasing.  As already identified in previous studies, the scope of these mission increase there will be a corresponding increase in demand for high accuracy Attitude Control System ACS capability.  This is especially true for cross formation flying, cross-link communications, and proximity, rendezvous operations, observational data, and onboard experiments.  Our goal will be to make available a near-universal low cost enhancement add-on that NASA users from academia to NASA Centers can purchase and easily install between the RWA bracket and a common attachment plate (possibly PCB) that can easily be linked into legacy, or to be developed, ACS controller design (e.g. PI or PID) as to substantially increase pointing accuracy of the SmallSat/CubeSat platform.","The US military is now involved in a number of initiatives to deploy and evaluate small satellites for a range of missions.  This includes initiatives by NRO, USAF, Navy and more recently Army, some of which are being undertaken tandem with NASA Centers.  QorTek is working closely with a prime contractor on the proposed technology, this contractor being among the single largest developers and suppliers of such SmallSats to the US military (ranging from 3U to 12U).  The relationship between QorTek and prime contractor will allow us to utilize their facilities in Phase II and transition the technology to some early platform assessments in a Phase III (which may be a contractor-led/funded activity).  There are a number of other military and non-military applications for the identical solutioins that include fast pointing systems for active and adaptive optics, most prominently Fast Steering Mirrors, which will be direct canidates for transition of the proposed new technology.","Actuators & Motors; Attitude Determination & Control; Command & Control; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)","Guidance, Navigation and Control   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

David Green,green@psicorp.com,"20 New England Business Center, Andover, MA 01810 - 1077",(978) 689-0003,3,4,"Virtually all optical information gathering instruments benefit from greater aperture. For space-based instruments whose geometries are constrained by the launch vehicle, increasing the aperture requires deployment of some aspect of the optical train and then the precise and dynamically stable latching of the deployed components into defined positions. Existing latching technology is too inaccurate, unstable, and expensive for use in many NASA missions.Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) will develop a simple, scalable latching technology by applying precision engineering approaches from previous developments that carefully manages the friction and strain energy stored internal to the latching mechanism. The result will be a small, low-cost latching system with sub-micron positional repeatability and dynamic stability.During the Phase I efforts, the PSI team will design, build, and test a latch for a cubesat-scale application. In future phases, PSI will fully qualify the device and demonstrate its performance when integrated into a complete deployable optical system","Precision latching of deployed, robotically-emplaced,  or astronaut-assembled optical components has long been a challenge for NASA observatories ranging in size from cubesat to Terrestrial Planet Imager. A family of low-cost but precise latch systems would have application to stellar and planetary observatories as well as atmospheric transmission measurement systems. In addition to data gathering, optical systems are also used for high bandwidth communications. Deployed, large area laser communications optics would increase data throughput from interplanetary missions as well as earth orbiting systems.","There are many Department of Defense and Intelligence Community applications of earth observing telescopes. The quality and quantiy of information gathered by these instruments would be greatly increased by larger, deployed apertures. As with the NASA instruments, these deployed telescope components must be precisely and stably locked into place when deployment is complete.The ground military also uses optical devices both for observation and communications. The proposed latch technology would also apply to rapidly erected telescope systems for ground soldiers, either for observations or for secure laser communications.In addition to government users, there are a wide range of commercial applications for precision restraint of optical components. As one example, PSI fabricates and sells ophthalmological diagnostic tools for retinal imaging. As different patients use the device, different headsets must be fitted to the front end of the device. A low cost means of precisely securing the different headsets would reduce the blurring of the retinal image and improve clinical outcomes.",Characterization; Deployment; Fasteners/Decouplers; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Structures; Telescope Arrays; Tribology,Precision Deployable Optical Structures and Metrology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

T/EBCs are envisioned to protect the surface of Si-based ceramics against moisture-assisted, oxidation-induced ceramic recession. Current T/EBC systems have been demonstrated in long time exposures at ~2400?F substrate temperatures. However, their use at elevated temperatures (i.e. 2700?F substrate temperatures) is limited by the low temperature stability and high diffusion activity of current T/EBC materials. One approach to increase the temperature capability of these systems is the incorporation of multi-layered T/EBC designs.  In this Phase I effort, enhanced processing techniques will be employed to demonstrate the manufacture of robust T/EBC bond coat systems using a physical vapor deposition based processing approach which enables improved coating adhesion and advanced coating architectural, compositional and microstructural control, as well as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) deposition. Scaled processing approaches will then be used to demonstrate the deposition of high temperature capable T/EBC bond coats onto components of interest to gas turbine engine manufacturers.  These bond coats will then be incorporated into full high temperature capable T/EBC systems planned in Phase II.  Finally, concepts to enable the deposition of T/EBC bond coat systems on NLOS internal regions of hollow components will be investigated. This work will significantly aid the incorporation of Si-based ceramic components in gas turbine engines resulting in reduced weight and increased operating temperatures.","This research is anticipated to the development of result in robust processing approaches for environmental barrier coating systems that enable higher temperature capability and improved durability than current EBCs. These advancements will help enable the use of Si-based ceramics in  high temperature capable gas turbine engines. These advances will potentially benefit all gas turbine engines requiring greater performance and efficiency.  In addition, this research specifically supports the goals of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) which seeks to expand the boundaries of aeronautical knowledge for the benefit of the Nation and the broad aeronautics community and in particular NASA ARMD's Subsonic Fixed Wing Project which has a goal of conducting long term research in technologies which promote, among other things, higher performance and higher efficiency gas turbine engines.","The development of high temperature T/EBC systems using DVTI's advanced coatings processing techniques will enable not only new T/EBC systems for use in future military and commercial aircraft platforms, but also new deposition processes to enable affordable coating application onto engine components.  DVD coaters are envisioned to be small with low capital costs and tailorable volumes so that small volumes of parts can be deposited at low cost. The soft vacuum required and the high deposition rates also have the potential to facilitate assembly line like part coating for some geometries. The non-line-of-sight capabilities of this approach enable coatings to be applied onto complex components thus expanding their use. The compositional and morphological flexibility of this approach would also enable other advanced functional coating systems to be applied such as thermal barrier coatings, wear and corrosion resistant coatings, thin film batteries and damping coatings.",Air Transportation & Safety; Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Processing Methods,Propulsion Efficiency-Propulsion Materials and Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

(ACT) is proposing a novel Phase Change Material (PCM) vapor chamber to ameliorate the temperature fluctuations encountered during planetary (or lunar) orbit.  The PCM vapor chamber will consist of a packed bed of micro-encapsulated PCM beads surrounded by a two-phase working fluid.  The PCM beads will act as both a highly efficient thermal storage medium, as well as a wick structure for capillary pumping of the two-phase working fluid.  The two-phase heat transfer by the working fluid increases the effective thermal conductivity of the PCM by a factor of 1000 or more.  This approach eliminates the need for embedding thermally conductive metal fins or carbon foam, which typically consume at least 50% of the system mass in traditional PCM heat exchangers.  The PCM vapor chamber not only has the potential to exceed a 2/3 PCM mass ratio using paraffin wax, but also provides several advantages over the state-of-the-art, water-based PCM heat exchangers.  The concept proposed by ACT will eliminate the need for metal fins and foams, and significantly reduce the mass of non-PCM materials.  In addition, the PCM vapor chamber can serve as either a stand-alone thermal capacitor or a dual thermal capacitor/heat exchanger.","The proposed PCM vapor chamber can operate as both a thermal capacitor and as a two-phase heat exchanger.  For NASA applications that have a need for a thermal capacitor, the PCM vapor chamber can provide mass savings to the system by swapping out the existing thermal capacitor with the PCM vapor chamber.  For thermal control systems having both a thermal capacitor and a liquid/liquid heat exchanger, the PCM vapor chamber can be used as an all-in-one solution.  This approach has the potential to provide significant mass savings.","MDA's Airborne Laser (ABL) program has significant cooling requirements that can only be addressed by mechanical refrigeration systems. These include cooling of the various high powered solid state lasers currently used on the ABL for tracking and ranging as well as standby cooling for the basic hydrogen peroxide (BHP) loops on the Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL).  To reduce size, weight and power consumption, the PCM vapor chamber could be integrated into the refrigeration system to reduce the temperature lift requirement during peak heat load conditions.  By using the PCM vapor chamber as a load-leveling device, the power requirement of the compressor can be significantly reduced.",Passive Systems,Thermal Control for Future Human Exploration Vehicles   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These applications require instruments with large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors and precision optical surfaces to gain a better understanding of how the universe works. The hard and soft X-ray mirrors have stringent surface requirements.  If awarded a Phase I our plan would be to combine previous knowledge of OptiPro's UltraSurf metrology system with newly developed software. Our goal would be to create a robust solution for combining the measurement data of the mirrors with corrective machine grinding and polishing process toolpaths.  This proposal includes the investigation utilizing non-contact probes on OptiPro's machining platforms to quantify the potential opportunities for in-situ mirror measurements.  Understanding these surface irregularities and what in the manufacturing processes causes them is critical for improving the current TRL's. OptiPro Systems will develop a metrology system and software, that would provide feedback for manufacturing these precision mirrors and include final metrology measurement of global form error and mid-spatial content. Comparison of in-situ and off-line metrology will be key for improving the manufacturing processes. We envision that the work performed in Phase I would lead to a software and metrology solution to be built and delivered to NASA if awarded a Phase II.  OptiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities along with our support partnership with the University of Rochester Mechanical Engineering Department, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards solving the difficult challenges for measuring these large complex mirrors and cylindrical shells. Our goal is to provide an innovative and complete manufacturing solution for the companies that are fabricating these optical components for NASA.","UltraSurf and in-situ machine metrology will be key technologies for advancing the state of the art for accurate and cost effective fabrication of many current and future NASA optical components. These applications may include the measurement of forming mandrels used to produce multiple segmented shell mirrors for the International X-Ray Observatory (IXO) and (NXGO). The aspheric and freeform optical surfaces required by LISA and WFIRST will also benefit from the metrology advances made with this endeavor. UltraSurf and in-situ metrology would also be very useful for measuring of the segmented types of telescope systems such as the Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST). As NASA space exploration requirements evolve so too will the need for better quality optical elements. The continued advancement of UltraSurf and the available probe solutions will be critical in keeping up with these requirements. As OptiPro (a U.S. machine builder) through this SBIR effort develops new metrology solutions there is the added advantage that many companies not just OptiPro, have the opportunity to benefit from a successful project. This has been well proven in our Navy Phase III SBIR commercialization results.","Since 1989 OptiPro has developed and refined conceptual technologies into robust deterministic machines and processes for the optical fabrication industry. Non-NASA commercial applications include the fabrication of flats, spheres, aspheres, and complex conformal shapes such as aerodynamic ogive domes. Commercialization of these technologies has developed into very cost effective solutions. UltraSurf has excellent potential for applications where mid-spatial-frequency and slope surface errors are an issue such as EUV lithography. Another application is for laser amplifiers, such as the Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, at the University of Rochester. For these types of applications, laser damage threshold and irradiance distribution are critical and therefore mid-spatial frequency errors need to be minimized after the polishing stage. UltraSurf advances will be critical for measuring these errors. In addition there are many new military optical systems requiring conformal and freeform shaped optics which also need these advancing metrology capabilities. UltraSurf has also proven invaluable for the non-contact measurement of stainless steel injection mold inserts for military optical visors.","In Situ Manufacturing; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Lenses; Mirrors; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Processing Methods; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Optics Manufacturing and Metrology for Telescope Optical Surfaces   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Many proposed solutions are not practical from a manufacturing/cost perspective: too complex or add weight to the aircraft that is not justifiable. CRG has already demonstrated feasibility of the ability to implement adaptive technologies into acoustic liners. The next step is to demonstrate repeatable liner control performance supported by more extensive acoustic testing runs to understand the initial shifting and increased suppression behaviors that have been observed. Also, automated cyclic testing of a given adaptive liner parameter will be executed to demonstrate the durability of the adaptive material and applicability to this application.

Many notable flight incidents can be wholly or partially attributed to crew error, either due to inexperience with the aircrafts automated control systems or in response to component failures or adverse conditions. Flight safety experts can piece together information and data from multiple sources to identify the cause after an accident or incident has occurred whether it is due to human errors, machine failures or a combination of both. It is therefore reasonable to expect that much of the information is already dispersed in various databases and, with the right tools, flight safety experts can identify deficiencies and factors that may provide indicators or serve as precursors of accidents. Such actionable knowledge will lead to better training, design and/or onboard systems to ensure safety. In response to this need, SSCI proposes to build Analytics to Improve Reliability & SAfety in Flight Environments  (AIRSAFE), a software toolbox that assists flight safety analysts in discovering key factors and their interactions among a large number of potentially relevant factors, testing one's hypothesis on the key factors to safety, and identifying previous incidents that support the hypothesis. The software toolbox is built on our previous and on-going efforts, such as DARPA's XDATA program, in BigData machine learning.","The AIRSAFE system will be most directly applicable to NASA programs whose goals is to improve the safety and reliability of air/space travel and transportation.

This represents a >70% increase as compared to similarly constructed cells using commercial off the shelf components.  Further, the use of lithium metal eliminates the need to produce the anode material and electrode, simplifying cell construction and thus reducing cost.  The Phase I work will build upon PSI's previous efforts focused on forming a high power cell design.  These efforts have demonstrated the ability to construct pouch sized cells that charge and discharge without the formation of dendrites.  During Phase I, PSI will build high energy pouch cells and demonstrate the cycling efficiency of its lithium metal cell design.  A specialized electrolyte will be developed that maximizes the cycle life and offers comparable performance to conventional electrolytes designed for graphite cells.  A composite separator tailored to efficiently operate with the electrolyte will be used to provide a reduced diffusion distance between the anode and cathode.  Phase I testing will demonstrate each component can be scaled to allow stable cycling of Ah pouch cells.  Phase II will focus on building multi amp hour cells that achieve the targeted energy density, 400Wh/kg.","The proposed cell technology could be utilized in all NASA battery applications.  In particular the rechargeable lithium metal cell technology could be used in any mission or application that requires low mass and low volume.  The absence of an intercalation component on the negative electrode allows for higher discharge rate capabilities.  Applications include EVA suits, landers, rovers, habitats, vehicle power, and power for payloads.","The initial market for the proposed technology is military aerospace applications where space is limited and battery energy density is critical.  In addition, the technology also would be well suited to powering microdevices, such as remote sensing devices, that would benefit from the increased runtimes and reduced battery size enabled by the increased battery energy density. The proposed technology could also be used in applications that need high power and energy, such as power sources for high energy laser systems.  The higher energy and power densities offered are required to meet the weight requirements of this application.

Market studies conducted by NASA and independent experts suggest that space-based biomedical and other research, which is enabled by high frequency small payload return, could be a multi-billion dollar industry. While the proposed effort is specific to application of the RED-4U to enable increased ISS utilization, the technology is readily extensible to other NASA missions. The technology is applicable to an asteroid or planetary sample return vehicle similar to Stardust, Genesis, and OSIRIS-REx; or could support sample return for long duration human exploration missions to an asteroid, Moon, or Mars. Finally, other potential NASA applications include serving as a host for suborbital payloads dropped from a high altitude balloon for short microgravity exposure times, upper atmosphere research, or hypersonic flight testing.","The Non-NASA commercial applications of RED-4U parallel those of the government applications. Small payload return capability complements the business models of the emerging commercial space industry and the rapidly expanding small satellite sector. RED-4U could be used to return scientific experiment samples and other payloads from commercial orbital platforms such as those proposed by Bigelow Aerospace and Orbital Technologies, or for intermittent return from free-flying commercial transportation vehicles such as the SpaceX DragonLab, Orbital Sciences Corporation Cygnus, or the Sierra Nevada DreamChaser. Sample return is also a key element of plans of commercial companies seeking to mine the Moon or asteroids such as Moon Express, Planetary Resources, and Deep Space Industries.","Biophysical Utilization; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In traditional systems, larger thrusters, specific to each mission, must be employed to counter the gravity field of the target. Also, throttling these larger thrusters for proximity operations and landing is not a trivial task. With the pump, the need for these larger, more expensive thrusters is eliminated. Instead the pump allows increasing (or decreasing) and controlling the thrust of the attitude control thrusters to the levels required for operating in the target's gravity field by modulating the pump RPM/power. Typically, only a few tens of watts are needed for pump operations. Flight Works is prepared to develop and demonstrate a low cost micro-pump capable of significantly increasing pressure and flow rate to the thrusters, to define a roadmap for larger increases if warranted, and to plan Phase II activities in order to reach a TRL 7 by the end of that phase. The technology builds on Aerojet Rocketdyne's work for NASA's on-going Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM) and use the non-toxic hydroxyl ammonium-nitrate (HAN) -based propellant AF-M315E which provides 50% greater density-ISP than hydrazine. The micropump leverages the Air Force Research Lab's (AFRL) investments in pump-fed technologies for small spacecraft propulsion applications, which have led to steady state and pulsed hot fire tests with hydrazine and demonstrations with other propellants.","The technology is an enabler for missions where the gravity fields of the targets are weak but need to be countered by propulsion while the guidance, navigation and control (GN&C) system performs the necessary analyses to determine suitable landing sites. The pump provides a simple mechanism for controlling that thrust which, potentially can be varied from thruster to thruster for accurate attitude control (if one pump is used per thruster). It also removes the need for a second set of larger thrusters needed to counter that gravity. As such, the low cost sample return missions envisioned by NASA and recently formed asteroid mining private companies could be direct benefactors of the technology.","The technology can be used to eliminate the pressurization system altogether and transform it into a low-pressure, low cost, more compact and lighter system. As such it has applications in any other government and commercial missions with propulsion needs. These extend to the multitude of projects relying on nanosat constellations that are currently being funded by the private sector. They include, to name just a few, Planet Labs, Skybox Imaging and Rapid, all focused on the imaging market. Many other potential applications are being considered, including low through-put communications, earthquake monitoring, etc. The list is becoming endless as the potential for Nanosats to become a commodity is being realized.","Attitude Determination & Control; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Surface Propulsion",Spacecraft Technology for Sample Return Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Each face of the pyramid includes a cutting blade which is independently actuated by redundant pyrotechnic actuators. Such sampler shape has a number of advantages. The pyramidal V shape acts as an arrow piercing into the comet surface at a steep angle. The 4 opposing blades offset tangential forces, meaning that only vertical forces would need to be reacted during impact. These forces could be minimized by making the pyramid height low (and in turn the pyramid would be more flat). In the latest Decadal Survey, the committee recommended selecting a Comet Surface Sample Return mission as one of the five New Frontiers 4 (NF4) missions, solidifying the importance of studying returned physical samples from a comet. Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return could also benefit from the development of this sampling approach.","The acquisition of surface samples from small interplanetary bodies, such as comets and asteroids, as well as small moons like Mars' Phobos and Deimos, holds great scientific interest. Under the NASA Authorization Act, Congress instructed NASA to ""plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object (NEO) Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of NEOs equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter, in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth."" In 2010, President Obama called for a new approach to space exploration, which would include human and robotic exploration of asteroids. In the latest Decadal Survey, the committee recommended selecting a Comet Surface Sample Return mission as one of the five New Frontiers 4 (NF4) missions, solidifying the importance of studying returned physical samples from a comet. Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return could also benefit from the development of this sampling approach. Another mission that the Decadal Survey considered to be strategic for the planetary exploration was Cryogenic Comet Nucleus Sample Return (CCSNR ) Mission. However, the committee agreed that that mission (mainly due to lack of matured technologies) should be left for the 2020+ decade, while in this decade the required technologies (incl. sampling system) should be developed to TRL 6.","Non-NASA applications for this technology include sampling of contaminated soils and liquid from hazardous environments (near nuclear reactors, oil spills, chemical spills etc.). Key subsystems, such as the sampling probes, would reduce the risk of sending personnel into these environments.In addition, commercial companies, such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, who are interested in asteroid mining for economic gains, would use this technology. It would be extremely useful to conduct reconnaissance of target bodies in order to determine their composition (e.g. fraction of water-ice, Platinum Group Metals, Rare Earth Elements etc.), and in turn evaluate economic potential for mining the bodies. The spacecraft would also be useful on the Moon for another company, wanting to process lunar regolith and water for economic gain: Shackleton Energy.","Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures; Tools/EVA Tools","Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Thus investigations into advanced fuel efficient designs have become inevitable. With increase in air traffic, environmental concerns of noise and emissions have also been brought to the forefront. This has resulted in NASA's ambitious N+3 vision, as exemplified in the Subsonic Fixed Wing projects's four corners of the design trade space. Also, the burgeoning interest in UAS platforms promises significant departures from traditional aircraft designs. To enable introduction of new aircraft into the inventory, the conceptual design of advanced concepts is critical. However, the aircraft design community realizes a need for introducing physics based analysis early in the design space. In particular weight estimates based on statistical relations are inadequate for new concepts, and there is a need for improved weight estimation. For this purpose, Intelligent Automation proposes VaC-CADO, a variable complexity conceptual aircraft design tool for the design of advanced airplanes by combining multi-fidelity optimization and MDO with FEM-based weight estimation. This is a novel technique leveraging on state-of-the-art in aircraft design and enhancing it using our extensive experience in this field.","We anticipate that by the end of Phase II, we will have matured the concept sufficiently to embed it and test it in NASA systems. An example program of interest is the Fundamental Aeronautics Program at NASA (including subsonic fixed wing, subsonic rotary wing, supersonics, and hypersonics programs). One of the major goals of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program is the inclusion of physics-based analysis in modern MDO tools, which is the particular innovation in VaC-CADO. This tool for design of unconventional aircraft will also enable NASA to analyze new concepts that revolutionize the aerodynamic performance and meet N+3 goals of NASA.","Several DOD groups, such as the AFRL conceptual design group under the Propulsion System Directorate, have been conducting research to develop novel conceptual design tools for analysis and design of new concepts.

Although the general features of this process are well-established, they are poorly quantified. This lack of understanding leads to significant uncertainties in the parameterizations used in numerical models of weather prediction, pollution transport and diffusion, etc. Improvement of the models is heavily dependent upon available data, increasing the need for improved remote satellite and terrestrial based measurements as well as affordable, capable, and easily operated in situ measurement systems. The complementary nature of these two measurement techniques ensure that recent work toward the revolutionary use of unmanned aircraft systems for in situ measurements has the potential to greatly enhance data gathered through remote sensing and significantly affect the study of the atmospheric boundary layer. Black Swift Technologies proposes the creation, testing, and validation of a new in situ atmospheric sensing instrument, the Coordinated Atmospheric Profiling System (CAPS).  This will be realized as a coordinated multi-aircraft system with each unmanned aircraft consisting of tightly integrated airframe, avionics and sensors specifically designed to measure atmospheric parameters (i.e., temperature, pressure, humidity, and 3D winds).  Each aircraft will be cost-effective, simple, rugged, and easy to operate while performing atmospheric experiments with the required level of accuracy for scientific missions.  Furthermore, the system will be designed with the intention of extending multi-aircraft functionality to other Earth observing missions through the use of a removable nose cone with well documented power and data interfaces. This further enables simple connection to the autopilot and on-board computer to enable intelligently optimized data gathering and coordination.","CAPS will enhance the performance and utility of NASA's Airborne Science fleet with its unique design and capabilities, and is specifically designed for missions in two focus areas of NASA's Earth Observing Directorate; (1) Weather and (2) Atmospheric Composition.  CAPS can provide data to augment satellite based measurement through validation and increasing measurement resolution in areas of high variance.  It is also capable of providing targeted, in situ measurements to complement ground based remote sensing.  The proposed payload will be immediately applicable for use in the proposed 3D-Winds mission as articulated by National Research Council in the most recent NASA Earth Science Decadal Survey, and can be used to complement the Goddard Lidar Observatory for Wind and TWiLiTE.  Support of additional programs is expected through the use of the CAPS modular payload system, which allows for simple transition to other sensor suites.  An intended future sensor suite would enable measuring atmospheric composition, specifically airborne particulates and trace gases which could augment MPLNET and AERONET as well as provide local CO2 measurements to be merged with global measurements from OCO-2&3.","The CAPS system is immediately useful for many aspects of meteorology from Climatology studies, to numerical weather prediction, to atmospheric chemistry and plume detection, to fire weather monitoring and even replacing the non-reusable balloon soundings that are launched across the nation daily. Many groups work in this arena including universities, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the US armed services.  Furthermore, the modular payload and open interface for creation of cooperative algorithms extends the use of the system to any application that would benefit from simultaneous observation by multiple aircraft.  This includes but is not limited to mapping, radio-frequency emission localization and mapping, glacial ice surveys, and persistent surveillance.",Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Development Environments; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling,Unmanned Aircraft and Sounding Rocket Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Given that current implementations of SysML are not particularly useful to perform analyses, and that SHM analyses are not identical to typical SE&I-related analyses, there will need to be connectivity between SysML representations and SHM models that perform SHM-related analyses.Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI), with Dr. Stephen Johnson as a consultant intends to explore and develop the integration of model-based systems engineering and Integration (SE&I) using SysML with system health management (SHM) modeling and analysis using QSI's Testability Engineering and Maintenance System (TEAMS). An overarching objective of this proposal is to reduce the duplicative and disjoint effort by NASA's subject matter experts in the development of systems engineering and design models as well as systems health management/fault management models. The intent is to leverage the success space or intent based system design models and transform them for developing fault management models and ensuring changes in design have a natural flow-through to the FM domain, thereby keeping FM models in sync with the design through a semi-automated process. This is one step in the larger set of issues that will need to be addressed in the development of the model-based Discipline of Systems Engineering and its concurrent integration with SHM to achieve higher-quality designs while reducing the costs of SE&I.","NASA's system design and engineering community especially those who are involved with Systems Health and Fault Management have a vision of ensuring that Fault Management design is an established rigorous discipline with well thought of consistent processes and methodologies that can be applied across all NASA platforms. The proposed effort is a small step in that direction and hence we believe have significant range of applications across various NASA multi-disciplinary engineering centers that are in charge of System Design where Fault Management is an integral part of the System Design process. Clearly establishing the relationships between the design goals/intents and the consequent sub-goals, and derived state variables all of which are in the goal or success space, with their complements in the Failure-space domain as practiced in the TEAMS set of tools that are widely used across NASA will be of tremendous value to the Systems Engineering and Systems Health Management (SHM) community of NASA. One potential application is for the Space Launch System (SLS) being primarily developed out of the NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Other immediate applications of this technology will be with the Orion Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program, managed by NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, and the Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, the operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla.","Among the other agencies who follow a strict system engineering and design process somewhat similar to NASA's such as the DoD including Air-force and Navy are the most potential customers for the resulting technologies. Design verification and validation of Complex military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), etc. for the purpose of reliable and cost effective system and fault management design can be ensured by using the targeted capabilities implemented in TEAMS. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets where the fault management aspects of system design is required to be highly efficient and cost-effective because of the natural budgetary pressures, could also be potential targets for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems where the vendors supply health management systems/schemes for them.","Diagnostics/Prognostics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Fault Management Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This product aims to improve the three largest user complaints with existing portable O2 concentrators, namely, that the systems are too heavy, too noisy, and they are too bulky restricting mobility. Reactive's medical oxygen concentrator will provide improved mobility for people that require O2 respiratory therapy enhancing the quality of their life.","NASA exploration mission planners have identified a need for an emergency medical oxygen system for various medical scenarios. It is desired to concentrate oxygen from the cabin air to directly provide an oxygen rate of 2-15 lpm at an oxygen concentration level ranging from 50 to 90%.  In this manner, the cabin atmosphere can maintain a relatively lower oxygen level minimizing fire hazards. An ideal system will operate off of spacecraft power and provide a closed-loop oxygen line for the crewmember where the blood oxygenation level is monitored and used as a feedback control signal to regulate the oxygen rate.

Future photovoltaic systems range in size from Cubesat-class to International Space Station sized arrays.  Operational domains range from low Earth orbit to interplanetary distances.  Power levels may reach 100's of kilowatts operating at several hundred volts.  Specific power of greater than 130 w/kg, and stowed volumes 4 times denser than the current state of the art are required.  These functional parameters drive the need for large flexible blanket arrays comprised of solar cell modules assembled in myriad configurations.  Manufacturers of flexible solar arrays currently use manual processes to accomplish final assembly.  NASA's cost and reliability goals require new approaches to manufacturing.  Building on recent successes in flexible substrate photovoltaics, our proposed effort creates a preliminary design for an automated final assembly manufacturing cell for flexible blanket solar arrays.  Modular, scalable, and flexible, the proposed system incorporates the latest in machine vision, material handling, laser welding, and automated test capabilities.  When fully implemented in Phase II, the system will deliver immediate return on NASA's investment through labor reductions and reliability improvements.  Missions from across NASA's entire portfolio will benefit from the significant cost savings, allowing fiscal resources to be focused on the primary scientific or operational goal.","NASA satellites require power to perform their functions.  The average satellite devotes 30% of its mass to the power system.  Complex missions operating farther from Earth and the sun require new developments in power generation to reduce weight and size, while providing increased power.  For this reason, NASA is a robust investor in new solar array technology, including flexible substrate solar arrays. Flexible arrays have been developed and used on high-visibility NASA mission for decades, including the International Space Station, Hubble, and the Orion CEV.  Flexible blanket arrays were also used on EO-1, Terra, and the planned ST8 mission under the New Millennium program.  Currently, NASA's is investing in flexible solar array technology under the Solar Electric Propulsion technology demonstration project.  Challenges remain.  As quoted in the Space Power and Energy Storage Roadmap published by NASA in April of 2012: ""Cost will be a major driver for large PV power systems. Cost reduction can be addressed through reducing cell cost, modularity of solar cell panels, improved manufacturability, and repairability.""  NASA  has stated that at least half of the cost of flexible substrate solar arrays derives from touch labor.   In this effort, we will focus on automatic robotic manufacturing of flexible substrate solar arrays to achieve large reductions in cost.","Numerous non-NASA commercial applications exist for the proposed flexible automation system proposed.  Companies like Ascent Solar, Natcore Technology and SoloPower have all demonstrated their ability to make and sell flexible substrate solar power systems.

The Naval Research Laboratory invests in flexible substrate solar power systems designed for tactical military situations.  The DoD sees huge potential logistical benefits from making better use of solar energy in forward locations.  Flexible substrate solar arrays are being investigated for integration into articles of clothing, which will certainly require an automated assembly manufacturing.  It is also worth noting that all commercial terrestrial solar power systems are currently assembled by automation.

By making thin foams and sheets, vibration isolation   sheets can be used for integration into composite materials. The technique is a radical departure from conventional ingot processing, and will enable applications in high and low temperature actuator and switches in engines, and for thermal energy recovery systems in commercial applications.","Jet engine applications are rich areas for applying actuators to both improve engine efficiency on take-off and landing, and also to suppress jet noise. In both drones and small aircraft, wing twist and active flight  surface reconfigurations have been well-established as providing the significant aerodynamic benefits.Why these actuators have not become more established in airframes is due to the low transformation temperatures of the SME alloys as compared to the service environment, fatigue and stability issues and slow transformation times.   These issues are solved by using this technique. Nacelle actuators are now flat SME plates, and can be modified by this technique to generate the required stroke with a responsive bandwidth by taking advantage of bleed gas from the jet exhaust.  Similarly wIng twist actuators can be made as a high fatigue life porous actuator, allowing for rapid actuation. The high transformation temperatures that TiNi-Hf demonstrates allows for application in the hot engine environment.  Finally, there is  a need for vibration isolation materials that are responsive at low temperatures. Fine porous TiNi weaves can be made o allow for damping applications down on -80C.","Waste heat to power is a challenging area to exploit commercially, especially at temperatures below 170C,  due to both thermodynamics and the lack of materials that can exploit these temperatures effectively. Shape memory alloy foams have been shown by Shape Change Technologies to effectively capture most of the waste heat from hot water/steam sources. What is needed is for a more tailored transformation temperature to capture and convert higher temperature steam and a long and reliable fatigue life.   This technique, if successful, will provide the enabling fabrication technique to provide long fatigue lifes, with tailorable porosity. The market for converting waste heat from Combined Heat and Power units and geothermal plants is large given the capacity of the plants and the opportunity to sell reclaimed power back to the grid.","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Generation; Heat Exchange; Metallics; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Propulsion Efficiency-Propulsion Materials and Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

NASA's current concept for an integrated radio and optical communications (iROC) system is being developed to provide communication technology that does not constrain the science yield of their deep space missions. iROC requirements include accurate navigation and pointing solutions so narrow optical beams are precisely transmitted directly to their Earth-based reception stations. X-ray source techniques and methods have been successfully demonstrated to determine independent position and attitude solutions for deep space vehicles. Therefore, ASTER Labs proposes to integrate the X-ray sensors directly into the iROC concept, such that the combined radio, optical, and X-ray system, referred to as iROX, can operate over a wide variety of applications and missions, increasing NASA's capability to explore the solar system. The top-level goals are to evaluate the integrated system and design a prototype detector system that augments the existing iROC concept, evaluate the performance of the integrated iROX system, and identify the feasibility and capability of such a system based upon the design architecture. The successful completion of the integrated navigation capabilities into the full iROX program will provide independent km-level position accuracies throughout the solar system and sub-arcsecond pointing capabilities, such that iROX data transfer will achieve high rates (Gbps-level) for NASA's unique deep space missions with improved capabilities over today's techniques.","NASA applications for the full iROX system consist of communication of science data to Earth and between exploration vehicles, where high-data rate transmission is desired. This includes high-resolution observations, inter-satellite communications, interplanetary video, and science high-data rate transmissions. For future crewed missions, iROX transmissions will include high-data rate video transmission and health and status monitoring data. The X-ray navigation technology developed here to complement the full iROX communication system can be applied to all deep space missions, and can increase NASA's capability of creating autonomous spacecraft operations, thus reducing the workload on DSN infrastructure. The X-ray navigation components can be used for ranging or relative navigation between vehicles that maintain accurate formations and for automated vehicle rendezvous and docking. The eventual development of an X-ray transceiver initially used for enhanced relative navigation between vehicles can be evolved to include a fully operational X-ray photon-based communication system. The advancement of modulated X-ray photon transmitters and receivers, sensitive detectors, and processing algorithms provides added capability for future X-ray astronomy missions, as well as diffractometry and fluorescence analysis.","Non-NASA applications for the full iROX technology include DoD and commercial satellite missions with high-data rate or precise pointing/attitude needs. Military in-space networks that require high data rate communications that are highly-secure and cannot be intercepted would show significant benefits with iROX communication integration, and those assets that operate above the GPS constellation would gain added utility with line-of-sight relative navigation. X-ray transceiver technology can be applied to re-entry and hypersonic communications during asset re-entry. Commercial telecommunication satellite providers that desire to transmit large data rate information between multiple vehicles, such as imaging or internet-like inter-satellite networks, could realize benefits through this enabling technology over current day radio technology alone. The technology developed in the iROX program is applicable to X-ray inspections, for manufacturing and production, security, safety, and evaluation purposes, including container inspection for the Department of Homeland Security. Medical diagnostics systems can also benefit with the insertion of the technology of modulated X-ray pulses.","Antennas; Attitude Determination & Control; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Lasers (Communication); Navigation & Guidance; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); X-rays/Gamma Rays",Advanced Celestial Navigation Techniques and Systems for Deep-Space Applications   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

They will transit through the deep space, but they may encounter warm transient environments such as low lunar orbit. Some spacecraft elements may be launched untended and would operate at relatively low power levels as they transit to their final destination. The combination of extreme environments and high turndown capability will be a major challenge for spacecraft thermal control systems.  Thermal switches are among the thermal control devices that are required and can dissipate a wide range of heat loads in widely varying environments while using fewer of the limited spacecraft mass, volume and power resources.  This SBIR project proposed by ACT will develop a low mass and high conduction ratio two-phase thermal switch as a thermal control system component for human spacecraft. The proposed device could work in thermal switch regime or in variable conductance regime while the set point can be changed remotely.  A trade study will be conducted to define the three features of the low mass two-phase thermal switch and demonstrate the feasability of the concept.  A preliminary full scale prototype will be designed, fabricated and tested at the end of the Phase I program.","A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft systems development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities using small, affordable spacecraft enabling a single spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of the limited resources. Another objective of NASA is to extend human presence in the solar system.  To accomplish these objectives, NASA is seeking for innovations in thermal control technologies to enable further scientific advancement at lower cost, lower risk, reduced power requirement, reduced volume, and/or reduced mass, while maximizing the lifetime, safety and reliability. The proposed low mass two-phase thermal switch (TPTS) technology shows great potential by reducing the complexity,  mass and cost of previous devices while increasing the performance. The program will demonstrate the feasibility of modeling, designing, optimizing and manufacturing of such a high performance TPTS. NASA Orion Crew Exploration and Deep Space are among NASA's programs to benefit from this innovation.","The Low Mass Two-Phase Thermal Switch developed by this program can be used for both space and terrestrial applications. It can practically be implemented and used by other military or commercial satellite applications that require infrared imaging and sensors on advanced telescopes, such as Air Force Space-Based Infrared (SBIR) surveillance and tracking system architecture. For example, through the use of cryogenic thermal switch technology, the infrared sensing capability can be enhanced by reducing the parasitic heat load.

In this respect, the annular engine, whose design inherently allows for significant increases in perveance by resolving the span-to-gap problem, can achieve the projected high current densities necessary for high thrust, high power applications. The case for high power gridded ion thrusters is compelling if not only for risk reduction in contrast to lower TRL Hall thruster variants such as the nested channel systems. This point cannot be over emphasized as there is now significant effort and resources applied to Hall engine development.  Yet there still remains some uncertainty as to how high power variants or magnetically insulated variants will actually perform in space. Interpretation of high power Hall engine operation in ground test facilities is also not completely well understood.  This is in contrast with gridded ion technology whose facility corrections are well understood.  The current investment in high power gridded ion thruster technology is minimal.

Proposed approach is based on optimal combination of unique techniques for highly efficient and yet robust power combining, circuit integration and innovative packaging methods.  This also leads to affordable products suitable for space, airborne as well as terrestrial applications.  Key features of the proposed implementation are: scalability of power output, compact, lightweight, flexible architecture and high reliability with very significant potential for performance improvement and price reduction as MMIC device technology matures further.  Initial objective of proposed effort is to achieve greater than 50 Watts of power output at 94 GHz at greater than 20% duty cycle and with 40 dB or more gain.  Phase I work will focus on innovative robust designs for power combining, packaging and select device/material s.  Phase I effort will lead to a producible and scalable design baseline that will be used in Phase II for manufacturing deployable products.","High power SSPAs operating at 94 GHz are needed for a wide range of radars and sensors for atmospheric measurements or environmental monitoring, specifically clouds profiling, mapping light precipitation and snow.  Many of these radars are airborne, often on high altitude UAVs.  Another application is for mapping super-cooled moist air and wind shear.  Dual-frequency cloud-profiling radar is being planned for deployment on the International Space Station.  Other ground-based radars for research also utilize high power SSPA.  Long-term objective is to completely eliminate the need for any tube-based power amplifiers from the transmitter of these instruments.

This novel technology, called the Advanced Wastewater Photooxidation System (AWPS) is designed to oxidize and remove recalcitrant aqueous organic constituents in the water recovery post processing system under ambient temperature and pressure conditions.   The basis of the innovation is the combination of high brightness and long lifetime UV LED light sources with efficient geometric illumination of a highly active photocatalyst immobilized on a high surface area support.  This combined approach leads to numerous performance benefits including high conversion efficiency, low temperature and pressure operation, compact footprint, high reliability and low crew maintenance, and decreased equivalent system mass (ESM).

As has been demonstrated by several NASA interplanetary missions, there is no replacement for in-situ observations, like spectral imaging, that prove critical for understanding the context of solar system bodies.  There is, however, a conflict between more capability at the target and the desire for minimizing mission cost.  Minimizing the mass and power of an instrument reduce the size, complexity and therefore the mission cost.   To enable more capable missions without high cost we propose to develop a hyperspectral/multispectral imager designed for a microsatellite platform that will function in a reduced light environment while minimizing the mass and power consumption.  This type of instrument is crucial to the study of small bodies such as near earth asteroids and for missions further afield by maximizing capability while minimizing the instrumental cost and complexity.  The Compact Hyperspectral Aberration-corrected Platform (CHAP) is proposed as a new, innovative instrument using an aberration-correcting holographic grating to make maximal use of two optical components, allowing for functionality over an optical bandpass (400-800 nm) with <100 microradian spatial resolution and 1.44 nm spectral resolution. The optical design of CHAP produces a white light zeroth order image from undiffracted light to be formed at the telescope focus, enabling the co-registration of spatial and spectral information, providing unprecedented context never before seen in an instrument for planetary and lunar science low-light observation. The CHAP spectrograph will be demonstrated in a 3U CubeSat-compatible form factor. Phase I activities will produce a proof-of-concept demonstration on an optical bench-top to a TRL 4 level. Follow on Phase II efforts will produce a CHAP with full capabilities for space environment qualification.","CHAP can benefit NASA's objectives in these specific implementations: - A low-cost next-generation mission within NASA's EOS program, such as follow-on to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi NPP mission. - A space-based complement to NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) mission - Follow-ons to in-situ deep-space science missions including: OSIRIS-REx, Cassini, and DAWN, and Curiosity - Integration into robotic precursor and manned science and exploration missions to small-bodies, Europa, and other highly mass-constrained opportunities. As CHAP has the capability to be used in the visible, near-infrared, and infrared, the US Departments of Agriculture and Homeland Security would find interest in utilization of its low-cost ability to support the following applications: - Agricultural crop health and moisture content monitoring, particularly in drought-susceptible regions - Identification, measurement, and monitoring of oil spill rates and concentrations - Monitoring of pollutants and hazardous trace surface and atmospheric constituents","The multi-Billion dollar mineral exploration and agricultural monitoring industries utilize remote sensing data derived from government and commercial platforms: - Government platforms: U.S. LANDSAT 7 and Japanese ASTER on board NASA's Terra - Commercial platforms: Worldview, GeoEye, RapidEye and adhoc airborne capability CHAP improves on the following limitations of currently available platforms: Government Platforms: Aging LANDSAT and ASTER platforms provide seven and fourteen spectral bands respectively within the near infrared, short wave infrared and visible spectrums. In comparison, CHAP can provide 400 discrete color bands at comparable spatial resolutions, enabling more refined observation Commercial Platforms: Utility of high spatial resolution commercial space platforms (Worldview, GeoEye) tends to be cost-limited with single imagery products costing upwards of USD $5,000. As a result, the ability to perform hyperspectral measurements with a simple, low-cost package will be a disruptive innovation of high interest to several large and mature industries. More specifically, CHAP's 3U form factor allows the instrument to be integrated onto standardized 27U, 12U, and potentially 6U cube-sat bus structures. This enables more sophisticated Earth observation missions within a small form factor and budget that were previously unreachable","Filtering; Gratings; Lenses; Mirrors; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Prototyping; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Visible",In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These signals have the potential to be used for many forms of both metrology and process control. While many material properties might be studied by using this interaction, our initial focus is an investigation into beam and sensor characteristics for geometric analysis of the deposition.Signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material, as it is being deposited. This is important, as the ability to monitor a parameter during deposition creates the possibility of controlling that parameter during the deposition process.As a further refinement, the ability to collect and store a spatially resolved pass-by-pass map of the deposition path geometry may have value in on-the-fly adjustments to subsequent build passes. Such mapping would allow working with the layer-by-layer nature of the deposition process to fine tune the deposition geometry. Such spatially resolved, layer-by-layer deposition mapping could also be stored, giving a three dimensional mapping of the as-built deposition path geometry. This could prove valuable for component quality assurance.","The commercial application for NASA will require the successful follow on development of the concepts proposed in this submission. That development would result in a standalone metrology sub-system package that would be made available to upgrade the EBF3 systems at Langley Research Center for further evaluation on the systems currently in use on program development work.This in situ metrology package would have the ability to collect and process signals derived from the electron beam-component interaction that could offer spatially resolved dimensional information about the deposited material and the possibility of a second tier of control over the fabrication process wherein process parameters are adjusted to achieve target deposition dimensions.The functional deliverable package would consist of detector(s) to be place in the EBF3 chamber, a set of detection electronics, power supplies, hardware controls interface, cables and module and system level software necessary for integration to the EBF3.","The Non-NASA commercial applications for this submission will also require the successful follow on development of the concepts proposed.

NASA is examining small fission power reactors for future space applications with the most recent being Kilopower, which provides roughly 1 kW of electric power. Kilopower uses titanium/water heat pipes to remove the waste heat from the cold end of the convertors.  Previous water heat pipe designs for space fission power are not suitable for Kilopower as they are either for surface fission power and use thermosyphons, or are grooved heat pipe designs, which are not suitable for ground testing.  ACT will develop heat pipes with two different designs that are suitable for Kilopower: Hybrid grooved/screen wick and Self-venting arterial wick. Hybrid wick heat pipes will satisfy the Kilopower requirements and ACT has already successfully tested similar hybrid wick heat pipes.  The self-venting arterial wick has not previously been tested in a vertical orientation but will be investigated as a higher performance, lower mass alternative to hybrid grooved pipes. The overall technical objective of the Phase I and Phase II projects is to develop a titanium/water heat pipe radiator suitable for Spacecraft Fission Power, such as Kilopower. During Phase I, ACT will investigate both a hybrid wick system, utilizing a screened evaporator and grooved condenser design, and a self-venting arterial wick design.  The heat pipe design will also include a small NCG charge, which allows the fluid in the heat pipe to freeze in a controlled fashion as the heat pipe is shut down, avoiding damage, and aids with start-up from a frozen condition. In addition to testing the heat pipes in different orientations, freeze/thaw tolerance will also be demonstrated.","The immediate NASA application is for space fission nuclear reactors that utilize Stirling converters or thermoelectrics for power conversion.

ACT believes that VCHP heat exchangers can replace the current heat exchanger and control system with a passive system.  The VCHP heat pipes passively adjust the heat removed, to maintain the output stream at a constant temperature.

By combining knowledge of sparsity in the model data with parameterizations of the target hardware, Kppa will generate code that is more computationally efficient than existing models and improve the performance of models executing on traditional architectures, an immediate benefit to existing programs and infrastructure.  Kppa will also improve user productivity and lower barriers to entry by providing a domain specific language for computational chemical kinetics that is easily understood by domain experts (chemists, etc.) and by providing the Kppa Cloud environment to facilitate the rapid development of new chemical operators for use in whole-systems models.

Such high accuracy tracker can be used for precision pointing of the large telescope, and can permit open-loop pointing of  narrow-beam laser signals. The latter can enable deep-space lasercom missions without the technical and operational complexity of a ground based beacon.  OPC has already built multiple versions of this star tracker for several applications for various DoD customers.  Current technical maturity of the star tracker is TRL 5- which is expected to advance to TRL 6 during the proposed Phase I project due to space readiness and flight tests under parallel efforts.During the proposed Phase I effort, OPC will first develop requirements.  This will be followed by design trades and formulation of a detailed design.  Phase I will conclude with a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  During Phase II, the design will be advanced to the Critical Design Review (CDR) level and a prototype will be built and tested.  Given that the existing baseline designs for OPC's visible and SWIR band interferometric star trackers are at TRL 5, OPC has a head start.","This high accuracy tracker can be used for precision pointing of the large telescope.  Its field of view is much wider than the fine guidance sensors (FGS) currently employed by HST and JWST.  The JWST FGS, for example, has a field of view of only 0.04 x 0.04 degrees.  With such a small field, fainter guide stars need to be used which then drives the sensor sensitivity and noise requirements.  For the interferometric star tracker proposed, the angular sensitivity is defined by the angular period of the grating LSI, which can be independent of the field of view.  This allows a wide field sensor to achieve similar level (milliarcsecond) of pointing performance, which then allows the use of brighter guide stars reduce the demand on sensor sensitivity.  Another application is as reference sensor for laser beam pointing:  A celestial reference based beam pointing eliminates the need for having a ground based beacon for return beam pointing which significantly reduces the operational complexity (power, pointing, regulatory compliance) and improves link performance (no round trip delay).OPC has also been funded recently for a study by JPL to investigate if its interferometric star tracker can be used for a spinning spacecraft. The study findings have shown the feasibility of adapting the interferometric tracker to provide accurate attitude information for a rapidly spinning spacecraft.","Application most relevant to this project is the use of star trackers for spacecraft. OPC is building a cubesat star tracker at this time to deliver to a DOD customer. The performance is power dependent - ranging from sub arcsecond to 2 arcsecond accuracy. The package is small - 250 cc in volume. Another visible band star tracker application was proposed to the Navy recently under the SBIR program. This proposal has been selected for award. The application involves space situational awareness, specifically to develop, build and deliver a version of the interferometric tracker capable of detecting and tracking dim objects. Another application is GPS denied navigation which has increasingly become a more acute need in the past few years. Customers are GPS denied navigation systems include virtually the whole armed forces. Our approach is primarily tailored to airborne platforms such as fighter aircraft, ground attack aircraft, next generation bomber, Tier II and Tier II  UAVs, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ICBMs, and missiles including hypersonic missiles.

ZBLAN glass and glass fibers, when produced on Earth, exhibit excessive insertion loss due to crystallization; however, this crystallization can be suppressed in zero gravity. Low down-mass and the high value of low-loss ZBLAN fiber make it an ideal candidate for commercial ISS utilization. In Phase I POC will design the processing unit for ZBLAN fiber manufacturing on the ISS based on a novel draw process without recoating. We will demonstrate the feasibility of battery-powered wireless operation for a TRL-4 prototype, achieving TRL 6-8 by the end of Phase II, followed by an opportunity to expand the UniMatPro module utilization for processing other prospective materials.","The primary NASA application of the proposed UniMatPro module is commercial product manufacturing onboard the ISS. Such commercial utilization of ISS capabilities will align the existing commercial manufacturing needs on Earth with ISS material science development goals and will ensure continuous expansion of critical manufacturing capabilities on orbit. Specific commercial model development for ZBLAN optical fiber manufacturing in combination with up-and-down the orbit delivery of materials and products in the UniMatPro effort will serve as a backbone for evaluation and implementation of the next generation of manufacturing capabilities on board the ISS. The resulting ZBLAN optical fiber product of UniMatPro development will have unique optical transmission, from ultraviolet to the midwave infrared, that will be utilized in NASA remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, atmospheric monitoring, and optical data communications.","The applications of the UniMatPro low-loss ZBLAN fiber will include infrared countermeasures for protection of military and civil airborne platforms from heat-seeking missiles, midinfrared lasers for medical, industrial, and military applications and next-generation optical communications. The immediate need of the U.S. Air Force and Navy for midwave infrared laser sources will be addressed through the active ZBLAN fiber manufacturing on orbit, which would allow fiber laser manufacturing for this challenging spectral range.  Low-loss midwave infrared transmitting fibers will enable fiber energy delivery for emerging quantum cascade lasers for remote optical sensing and material processing applications in the spectral range of resonant vibration absorption of a variety of essential materials, thereby expanding overall industrial capabilities in process control, safety, and environmental monitoring. The possibility of the insertion loss reduction in ZBLAN fibers beyond the existing state of the art can also revolutionize optical communications.","Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics)",International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

With growing demand for improved mission performance and reductions vehicle mass, advances in polymer systems with extreme thermo-mechanical properties are critical. The primary objective of ATSP Innovations' Phase I work will be to fabricate and test low cost aromatic thermosetting copolyesters (ATSP): (1) for high performance composite structures for high temperature applications, (2) with high resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperatures for use in next generation spacecraft missions. Our team partner, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will assist ATSP Innovations to perform advanced characterization and provide technical support for this project.  ATSP Innovations and UIUC have developed ATSP for high performance composites that are stable at high temperatures and have an intrinsic resistance to microcracking. The liquid crystallinity of the polymer results in a local matching of CTE between fiber and matrix yielding minimal thermal residual stress in composites and higher fracture toughness than current resin systems. These capabilities allow the ATSP to address a wide range of current and future applications (at both cryogenic and high temperature regimes) critical to future NASA missions. The synthetic development of ATSP was a major innovation in the field of polymer science. ATSP shows excellent performance as adhesives, flame resistant foams, and tribological wear coatings. ATSP resins possess the unique attribute among high temperature thermosets of solid-state bonding in a fully cured state to produce chemically contiguous specimens by Interchain Transesterification Reaction (ITR). This may open new modes of fabrication with relevance to NASA missions and the wider aerospace industry.","If successful, ATSP Innovations envisions that ATSP materials will be utilized in a wide variety of NASA spacecraft and aircraft applications, both as a retrofit and as a next-generation advanced composite material in future aerospace designs.  The high temperature ATSP can be used in the aerospace field as a replacement for metallic components in many propulsion applications where temperatures are beyond operating conditions of conventional polymeric resins. Such applications cover many parts on and around the aero-engine and several airframe structural components in high speed transport aircraft. In addition, use of a drastically lighter composite cryogenic fuel tanks, which are used on essentially all of the approximately 80 orbital launches annually, may make significant savings in propellant rockets. ATSP Innovations will contribute significantly to technological development for growing polymer composites for this wide range of applications.","ATSP Innovations would also work with the Air Force and other DOD agencies as well as major aircraft and spacecraft companies for this technology.  The impact of this new polymer could also extend into multiple areas and applications such as structural composites in commercial automobiles, low dielectric constant circuit boards for microelectronics, wear resistant coatings, rigid structural foams and ablative material for reentry vehicles. An attractive feature of this technology is the potential for recycling, which is very unique for a thermosetting polymer matrix.","Characterization; Composites; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); In Situ Manufacturing; Polymers; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Processing Methods; Structures",Advanced Fabrication and Manufacturing of Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Power for these missions is envisioned to reach from 30kW-300kW in the near term and to 1MW in the future. Conventional solar arrays are simply not up to the challenge for many reasons. High efficiency, space-qualified solar cells are in themselves costly, > $250/Watt, and there is considerable additional cost associated with the large number of piece-parts and labor needed to assemble the cells into the Photovoltaic Assembly. The current approach has many assembly steps, and has evolved with only minor changes from solar arrays fabricated in the 1970s, sacrificing cost because of risk adverse incremental development. If a very low cost solar cell could be implemented, while being complemented by economical automated solar array integration processes, and having environmental durability, then extensive cost savings could be realized, thus enabling energy intensive next generation missions. The proposed innovation is a very low cost durable PVA which has integrated construction designed for manufacturability, and active array management for voltage and current regulation. By utilizing mature thin film CIGS technology, along with Vanguard proprietary coverglass replacement technology (CGR), and automated integration and lamination processes, an extremely thin flexible lightweight and low cost solar array can be realized.","Low cost, lightweight, high power solar arrays with compact packaging and high voltage capability is an enabling technology for meeting the key NASA objective of implementing solar electric propulsion, which enables enhanced planetary, human exploration, and orbit transfer missions.  With these missions projecting prime power growth to 25 - 300kW, the automated assembly of THINC arrays with today's CIGS solar cells meets these needs with improved specific power by a factor of >3X, an improved volumetric efficiency when stowed for launch by a factor of >8X, and a PVA cost reduction of >70% compared to today's solar arrays.  These improvements, together with demonstrated high operating voltage capability exceeding 300V, allow an affordable high power system up to hundreds of kW to be packaged into a single launch. The THINC Array also has the advantages of improved high voltage stability and electromagnetic cleanliness because of surface continuity available from encapsulation, with similar technology developed at Vanguard already transitioned through a NASA Phase III SBIR to the Magnetospheric MultiScale MMS mission.","The trend towards Solar Electric Propulsion to supplant chemical propulsion for orbit-raising and station-keeping, and the advent of ""all-electric"" spacecraft which use SEP for orbital transfer and station-keeping, have driven the need for both higher power and higher voltage in commercial and DoD spacecraft.  Commercial spacecraft have trended toward higher power to also provide more capability (e.g. more bandwidth or coverage) which translates directly to increased revenue for the spacecraft operator. Additional functionality for military spacecraft, including enhanced communication, reconnaissance, and on-orbit computational capabilities, as well as the maneuverability afforded by SEP also drive to higher power requirements.

SEP which has already supported some missions (e.g., Deep Space 1 in 1998 and Dawn in 2007) will revolutionize navigation (i.e., velocity change, orbit revision) capabilities for spacecraft of traditional architectures.  However, to be powerful enough to support equipment on a scale necessary for the infrastructure behind human presence is space, SEP has to be scaled up which directly requires solar arrays capable of producing up to 1~MW of power, the long term goal targeted by this NASA solicitation.

Decades of research and flight missions (Hubble, GALAX and FUSE) have utilized metal fluorides such as, MgF2 and LiF, applied to Al to achieve FUVOIR coating requirements. While metal fluoride-protected Al remains the best option for meeting broadband reflectance requirements (90-nm to 2500-nm), ZeCoat offers a means to build upon the best known and proven coating recipe (the GSFC 3-step process) by: 1) utilizing ZeCoat's unique precision motion-controlled deposition system to uniformly apply a 5-nm layer (a requirement of the GSFC recipe) of coating material to a large coating area, 2) protecting mirror assemblies from damaging high temperatures by heating only the mirror surface using radiant heat (the GSFC process requires a 220C metal-fluoride deposition temperature), 3) using an FUV reflectometer (120-nm to 180-nm) integrated into the coating chamber to optimize the coating process for FUV reflectance and 4) investigating the feasibility of using a layer of Sn to protect LiF from degradation due to atmospheric moisture and organic contamination during ground storage and  re-evaporate the Sn once the observatory is placed in-orbit.","According to the NASA SBIR 2014 Phase I Solicitation, there are several different missions for which large aperture, light-weight mirrors with a broadband high reflectance coating is an enabling technology.

The LCO can impact handling qualities, ride quality and can cause structural fatigue, ultimately leading to structural failure. Due to the negative impacts of free-play induced LCO, very stringent absolute free-play limits have been established for control surfaces on both military and commercial aircraft. Systems Technology, Inc. (STI) and Boeing propose to develop an innovative, robust, and reliable active control concept that alleviates the adverse effects of control surface free-play, relieving costly requirements associated with manufacturing, inspection, and part replacement. The solution involves a novel linear fractional transformation framework for relevance to models of varying complexity and a robust control approach that exploits the piecewise-linear nature of the free-play nonlinearity. To aid in control design and to provide practical real-world relevance, a combined analytical and experimental approach is proposed by the STI-Boeing team. The proposed solution is minimally intrusive, providing for application to a wide array of existing and future aircraft (including both high speed fighters and transport aircraft), ultimately resulting in significant cost savings and increased pilot safety.","NASA is a research leader in aeroservoelasticity, including recent advances in innovative experimental excitation mechanisms for more accurate vibration data, signal processing, nonlinear system identification, and robust flutter boundary prediction.

The resulting LCO suppression control solution will benefit the many NASA programs that involve the design, analysis, and test of air vehicles. This includes flight test programs that use aircraft ranging from high speed fighters to low speed transports, encompassing both manned and unmanned platforms. NASA does not develop aircraft; therefore this solution is attractive due to the fact that it is minimally intrusive by design and can be applied to the existing aircraft systems in NASA's fleet. A control solution for free-play induced LCO will result in a reduction in certification requirements, providing for more concentration on the primary objectives of the flight test programs.","The resulting LCO suppression control solution will benefit both commercial and military aircraft that suffer from free-play induced LCO. This solution is applicable to both manned and unmanned aircraft. The initial target market envisioned for this product is the worldwide aircraft manufacturing industry and the civilian and military flight test facilities. A desirable and unique aspect of the proposed approach is the generalized applicability that is unobtrusive to existing aircraft flight control systems by design. This opens the market up to a vast number of existing aircraft that are plagued by free-play induced LCO. New aircraft programs will also benefit from this solution by providing relaxation to the stringent free-play requirements from the beginning.

The spars are the structural members that support the MegaFlex solar array deployed blanket.  When the solar array experiences a deployed load, the structural load path starts in the spars which carry the load to the hub assembly that then pass it on to the latched panel assemblies that act as the structural back-bone of the deployed array and carry the load to the solar array to spacecraft interface. Therefore as the MegaFlex blanket areas increase the spar loading increases which causes higher stress levels in the spars, unless they are appropriately scaled in size. However directly scaling the spars in size from their current design state is not the most optimized design for strength and mass. This is why AD proposes to develop a hierarchical set of MegaFlex spar designs with ATK. Successful performance of this proposed strategic plan has far reaching benefits which start with the scaling risk reduction of larger future MegaFlex solar arrays to support power demands beyond 50kW with high deployed loading requirements. The benefits continue with mass savings for these arrays obtained by the mass optimized future spars which will enable more payload for future HEOMD or other missions and or launch cost savings. Finally, development costs for future flight qualification of a MegaFlex solar array >50kW in size with high deployed loading requirements will be saved because this work will already have been completed. All of these benefits support future HEOMD missions and others, which therefore further validates the merit of the proposed innovation and work to be completed on this SBIR.","We expect direct commercialization after leveraging the demonstrated MegaFlex scale-up technology capabilities through building and end-to-end testing a 20m diameter 100kW class MegaFlex Technology Development wing.

The proposed Phase I and II work will reduce developmentcosts andrisksand provide an accelerated extensibility path to build and test testing a 20m diameter 100kW class MegaFlex Technology Development wing. This will enable the desired goal of commercial infusion and significantly expand the acceptance and potential applications of MegaFlex.","Department of Defense, foreign government programs and the commercial sector all have an interest in high power, low-risk, low-cost solar arrays. Risk associated with the MegaFlex design is being retired though ATK internal and NASA sponsored development work. However, MegaFlex's use of flight qualified UltraFlex components minimizes the risk present in this design as-is. The proposed spar development only further advances the TRLof MegaFlex andreducesscaling costs and risks for >50kW of power. This will therefore increase its future application potential. The ViviSat SEP platform is a current MegaFlex opportunity that looks promising.","Deployment; Generation; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

A typical passenger jet will have 100 to 175 high-valve bearings costing from $2,500 to $50,000 each for a total aircraft cost of $300,000 to $600,000.  All gas turbine engine bearings are inspected at overhaul and typically 30-40% of there are rejected. For each engine overhaul, bearing replacement costs on average $100,000.  Any process that increases bearing performance and reliability will have a commensurate effect on aircraft safety, reliability, performance and operating cost. Ormond is proposing to use a novel surface enhancement process, cavitation peening, to impart deep, high magnitude residual stresses without roughening the bearing such  as to significantly enhance bearing life, reliability and performance.  Cavitation peening uses ultra-high pressure water jets to generate intense clouds of cavitation bubbles that collapse on the work piece generating shock waves that cold work the material. No particles are used, the process produces no waste, adds no weight to the part and is very inexpensive. The new technology is currently being evaluated by Boeing, Sikorsky, Bell and Rolls-Royce for aerospace applications and is proving particularly effective for gears. A 20% improvement in bearing life is targeted. This project would generate the residual stress and fatigue data for bearings to convince stakeholders of the value of the technology for this application.","The target application for NASA programs is primarily aircraft gas turbines, particularly high performance engines where the added bearing rating could be utilized to increase engine output or reduce fuel consumption. Other NASA applications could be any rotating components where weight or power consumption is an issue.","Bearings are a fundamental mechanical component used throughout transportation, energy generation,and manufacturing. Improving bearing load ratings in a cost effective manner could have a significant impact on automobile fuel economy, wind turbine power generation, aircraft engine efficiency and reliability, manufacturing machinery reliability, and just about any other rotating component.

This environment integrates the user's personal computational environment with high performance simulation applications for materials and processes. The current state of the art for electrochemical device design utilizes empirical or highly simplified models, homogeneous materials, and relies heavily on experimentation. ICED will enable device researchers to utilize advanced models implemented in state of the art simulation software, taking advantage of modern compute hardware, providing a truly predictive and exploratory research and design platform.To demonstrate the feasibility of the system, Illinois Rocstar will develop a detailed three-dimensional model for nanomaterial electrode performance, including modeling of the electrode microstructure, electron conduction, and ion transport in the solid and liquid phases. This model will be integrated into a device-scale simulation with existing simplified models of all device components. The model and simulation tool will be validated against experiments conducted by our SBIR partner, Xerion Advanced Battery Corp.","This system will be generally applicable to a variety of battery structures and materials, will predict performance for classes of batteries, and will define guidelines for battery design optimization for NASA and industrial use. It is understood that general construction and potentially some government and industrial users of the system may not have the computational skills needed to operate, maintain, and interpret the results from the system. For these users we will provide contract-based engineering services along with a purchased, fielded system, and/or will contract directly to perform analyses for clients using our internal computational resources and staff.","The product described in this proposal will be an integrated computational environment and infrastructure for electrochemical device design and simulation: ICED.

Differentiated from currently marketed antimicrobials, selenium, is permanent, catalytic and does not leach into the environment. This will reduce the problems associated with biofilm growth and fouling in the water recycling system.. Thus, we could draw quantifiable conclusions about the system performance for long term missions in complex water treatment systems containing organoselenium coatings and provide the data to NASA engineers who may then make an assessment as to whether or not this is a viable technology to reduce the need for biocides, reduce ESM, and potentially impact NASA by decreasing the chemical burden for treatment which would decrease payload mass and downtime affecting astronauts' efficiency.The project will quantify the impact of an organoselenium surface coating within stainless steel pipes and fittings on product water quality and service life of the pipes and fittings over time.   Objective 1.  Optimize the attachment of organoselenium to the surface of stainless steel to achieve the greatest and most reliable reduction in biofilm growth and formation.Objective 2.  Assess performance of the organoselenium surface treatment of stainless steel pipes and fittings in a bench-scale system over varied periods of time (i.e. 1 week, 1 month, 3 months) against biofilm accumulation and service capacity.","If successful, the use of organoselenium coatings to prevent bacterial colonization and/or biofouling may be applied to potable and wastewater piping infrastructure and treatment systems. Additionally, these organoselenium compounds may be applied to any hard surface to achieve a permanently efficacious environment to combat the growth and proliferation of bacteria. These surface coatings may also be applied to medical instruments, devices and wound care products to combat infection. While this application focuses on a surface coating, the same organoselenium compounds may be modified to be applied as a polymer additive suitable for numerous plastic component applications which require protection against bacteria and biofilm colonization.","The uses for antimicrobial coatings are nearly limitless ranging from industrial to medical applications. While there are many antimicrobial technologies, the organoselenium compounds have several unique advantages including their ability to remain covalently attached providing permanence in their activity. Thus, applications which have a need for long term biofilm protection are most suitable. To date, the technology has been used in dental and orthodontic applications, medical device implants, water filtration spacer netting, plastic water tubing and reverse osmosis membranes. If the objectives of this grant are successfully achieved, the use of the organoselenium compounds on metal piping would likely lead to opportunities in oil and gas, water transport and other similar applications susceptible to biofouling.","Biomass Growth; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fluids; Lifetime Testing; Medical; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment",Development of Treatment Technologies and Process Monitoring for Water Recovery   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Over a 4-week period in July-August 2013, SAVDS was used as a decision support tool (DST) for NASA's Marginal Ice Zone Observations and Processes EXperiment (MIZOPEX) Project in northern Alaska. Integrated with a Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) Sentinel AN/MPQ-64 (FRP-5) radar data feed, SAVDS was housed in a UAV Ground Control Station and served the time-critical DST function of showing the real time location and altitude of NASA-supported UAVs and other airborne vehicles within and around a pre-defined safe separation transit corridor. It was within this operational framework that SAVDS served as a DST which enabled the first FAA-approved series of NASA-supported UAV science flights in the domestic National Airspace System without ground-based or chase plane-based visual observers. In this Phase 1 SBIR, SAVDS, Inc. seeks to further refine and improve its functionality by performing a feasibility test involving detailed analyses of SAVDS log files from the MIZOPEX Project and other past UAV missions equipped with the Sentinel radar. Advancements to SAVDS, as here set forth in this SBIR Phase I proposal, are envisioned as enabling future NASA Earth Science Missions that will ultimately involve fully autonomous UAVs. The long-term goal is to embed the data processing capabilities and sensor-and-avoid algorithms of SAVDS in the onboard flight safety systems of UAVs that will be collecting airborne earth science data beyond the range of visual observers.","The amount of high-resolution airborne Earth observation data that could be acquired using small low-flying UAVs is enormous. Over the next decade, it is envisioned that the future of UAV flight operations on the north slope of Alaska and other comparable locations will increase significantly for resource exploration and science investigations related to global climate change. Systematic high resolution monitoring of glacial ice pack dynamics and gas emissions from geothermal areas are other examples of the type of beyond line-of-sight UAV missions that could be readily integrated with NASA's current Earth science research activity. Within this framework, an upgraded version of SAVDS could serve as an important decision support tool (DST). Small low-flying long duration UAVs equipped with leading-edge payloads will only reach their full potential of supporting NASA's Earth science research goals when they can fly beyond the line-of-sight of visual observers.","The primary commercialization strategy that SAVDS, Inc. plans to pursue is offering SAVDS as a decision support tool (DST) to UAV service providers who operate small low-flying UAVs and plan to operate in the National Airspace System and abide by FAA regulations. It is these UAV service providers who will be providing high resolution airborne imagery to agriculturalists as well as Government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Offices of Emergency Services. High resolution airborne imagery that improves food production and water use efficiency addresses a near-term agricultural need, particularly in the state of California. Natural disasters, forest fires, and search-and-rescue operations are examples of the type of time-critical applications that will require the utilization of small low-flying rapidly-deployable UAVs capable of safely flying beyond visual line-of-sight. Another societal benefit of SAVDS serving as a critically important DST would be the future use of small UAVs for the time-critical delivery of medical supplies in high density urban environments where takeoff and landing, and non-linear flight lines will be a major flight safety challenge.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Data Fusion; Data Processing; Network Integration; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Earth Science Applied Research and Decision Support   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Current dropsondes are deployed with a free fall parachute trajectory, allowing no flight path control and requiring the deployment aircraft to fly close to the target.  Adding an extended, guided range capability to the dropsonde will allow much greater mission flexibility by providing significant geographic and temporal coverage of areas of interest.  Barron Associates, Inc. will accomplish this through an innovative winged dropsonde that launches from a regular dropsonde launch tube, and deploys wing and tail control surfaces, and a propeller, starts the engine, and executes the mission under horizontal, powered flight.  The Phase I vehicle will focus on avionics and sensor integration, vehicle prototyping and flight testing of a long-endurance version of the vehicle. The vehicle will be equipped with a pressure, temperature and humidity sensor and a wind sensor which is extended out the front of the vehicle to allow accurate measurement. The vehicle will also be equipped with gas sensors, a custom autopilot board and a long-range telemetry system.  High-turbulence operation is highly desirable and a portion of the Phase I effort will go towards researching the vehicle configuration and software enhancements necessary to support operations in a highly turbulent environment.  The end result of the Phase I will be a flight tested, long-endurance, guided dropsonde vehicle, and a feasible Phase II plan for enhancing the vehicle to support high-turbulent operations, allowing use for hurricane, volcanic plume, and wildfire atmospheric science.","The powered, guided, long endurance dropsonde will have immediate application as an enhancement to current dropsonde missions, providing extended geographical coverage of several hundred miles, and endurance of 5-7 hrs.  Applications include polar and oceanographic atmospheric science, satellite calibration/validation and airborne hazard sensing.  NASA's Discover-AQ program is an example of a program that could benefit from the availability of a low-cost, guided, dropsonde system.   The low per-unit cost also makes the system suitable for use in other atmospheric sensing projects, such as aircraft fume detection, and ozone level measurements.  In a low to moderate turbulence environment, path planning will be possible for a wide range of desirable trajectories, including loitering in a single location to examine temporal variations, flying a grid pattern for dense geographical resolution and flying a long-range trajectory to maximize the geographical coverage. High-turbulence capability developed in Phase II will further enhance the applications, enabling gas and ash sensing in volcanic plumes, and atmospheric science in and around hurricanes.  As the vehicle will be capability of being guided to a recovery zone, the potential exists to replace the standard sensors with a sample collection device, and return volcanic plume ash samples, or other particulate samples of interest to the recovery area for ground analysis.","Barron Associates' Wingsonde has significant applicability to other government agencies doing atmospheric research, such as NOAA/NCAR and the USAF Hurricane Hunters.  NOAA has a separate SBIR to develop a plug and play sea surface temperature sensor, and if this becomes available, the Wingsonde would be an ideal delivery platform. Other applications include wildfire atmospheric science (also of interest to NOAA) and atmospheric toxic release monitoring. International agencies involved in atmospheric science using dropsondes currently, or desiring high-turbulence atmospheric sensing are potential users of the system, as well.  Current users of the NCAR AVAPS system include the German space agency(DLR), AES Canada, the UK Met. Office and the National Institute for Polar Research in Japan. The high turbulence capability to be delivered at the end of Phase II will be applicable to a much wider field of users.  International agencies studying both hurricanes and volcanoes will be interested in the ability of the Wingsonde to acquire atmospheric data in the extreme environmental conditions.   The capability of being deployed from a tube, and potentially launched from the ground lead to a low total cost for putting the system into the field, which brings the technology within reach of universities and other small research programs, further broadening the applications.",Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Atmospheric Propulsion; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Command & Control; Deployment; Prototyping; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems),Unmanned Aircraft and Sounding Rocket Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The Lunar surface is a harsh and unforgiving environment. Perhaps most challenging is the drastic and length thermal cycle surface equipment will experience on the surface. Standard spacecraft electronics and batteries cannot survive the extremes of the Lunar thermal cycle and must be protected by a thermal control system (TCS) that often features Plutonium-238 which is an expensive, strictly controlled material that is not a viable option for lower cost or commercial missions. An alternative approach would be an extreme environment flywheel energy storage system that could supply enough power to heat the critical electronics during the Lunar night. Honeybee Robotics Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation (Honeybee) proposes to develop an extreme environment Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) system that enables a small spacecraft (e.g., 200 kg Lunar Rover) to repeatedly survive the long, cold Lunar night.   The FES system will also supply operational power during the Lunar day.","An extreme environment Flywheel Energy Storage system for small spacecraft capable of operating at the Lunar day/night temperature extremes could benefit future Lunar missions like the Resource Prospector Mission or Lunar Quest.  In addition, NASA will benefit from commercial ventures that employ this technology as science and technology demonstrations will be more affordable for NASA.  NASA Outer Planets missions would also benefit from an FES such as the one proposed.","Beyond NASA and ""Commercial Space"" applications, other potential applications exist on Earth.

It is desirable for them to utilize human tools when possible, rather than needing to build custom tools for each robot.  Control of robotic manipulators for tool usage generally requires a very precise Cartesian-space trajectory of the tool tip (e.g., moving a marker along the surface of a whiteboard or rotating a screwdriver about an axis).  Well-known techniques exist for manipulator control in Cartesian space, most of which necessitate solving a series of Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems.  Closed-form IK solvers work well for 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) arms with rigid tool attachments, but cannot handle non-rigid tools that slip in the robot's hands.  Numerical IK approaches are more generic and can handle non-rigid links to tools, but can be slow to converge.  More importantly, if any joints fail or become limited in their range of motion, the robot arm essentially becomes 6-DOF or lower.  IK solvers often fail in these lower DOF spaces because the configuration space becomes non-continuous and full of ""holes"".  As a result, a 7-DOF robotic arm in space might be rendered largely useless if a single joint fails or even loses mobility until it can be serviced.  TRACLabs proposes to investigate an alternative approach to traditional Cartesian control approaches, which rely on complex IK solvers that go from Cartesian space backwards to joint space.  We propose to leverage cheap memory and modern processing speeds to instead perform simple computations that go from joint space forwards to Cartesian space.  Such techniques should overcome common changes to a manipulation chain caused by tool slippage or the grasping of a new tool and to overcome uncommon changes to a chain caused by joint failures, reduced joint mobility, changes in joint geometry or range of motion, or added joints.","NASA's future robotics missions are expected to rely heavily on dexterous robots. These robots will need sophisticated control software in order to function. These robots will assist humans with tasks as well as work with no human presence to perform tasks such as assembly and terrain preparation. This work is directly applicable to current NASA robots such as Dextre and Robonaut-2, both of which are currently on-board ISS. Even under teleoperation, this software could overcome any failing or ailing joints to still get experiments performed or tasks completed. This work is also applicable to NASA ground robots such as Centaur andfuture exploration robots.","Dual arm manipulation robots are also becoming more common inindustrial settings.  Rethink Robotics and GM are making pushes formore generic humanoid robots to be use in factory settings.

Future NASA missions are expected to use COPVs in spaceflight propellant tanks to store fuels, oxidizers, and other liquids for launch and space exploration vehicles. However, reliability and reusability of the COPVs are of concern, especially in cryogenic temperature applications; this limits adoption of COPVs in future reusable vehicle designs. The major problem with composites is the inherent brittleness of the epoxy matrix, which is prone to microcrack formation, either from exposure to cryogenic conditions or from impact from different sources. If not prevented, the microcracks can grow into larger cracks, leading to catastrophic failure and loss of function of the composite. Accordingly, materials innovations are needed to mitigate, as well as self-heal, microcrack damage in composite cryotanks. In Phase I we propose to demonstrate microcrack prevention and mitigation in composite test panels through the use of a novel nanocomposite matrix containing engineered nanoscale materials which will also enable self-healing of microcracks. Phase II will build upon the Phase I program in order to optimize the material design and to characterize the long-term durability of the scaled-up composite test panels.","Future NASA missions will rely on the use of composite structures as main structural members of space vehicles and composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) for spaceflight propellant tanks to store fuels, oxidizers, and other liquids for launch and space exploration vehicles.  These COPVs must be able to operate at the cryogenic conditions imposed by typical propellants, liquid oxygen (90?K) and liquid methane (110?K).  NASA applications for the research proposed herein include: earth-based and space-based cryogenic storage vessels (e.g. cryogenic fuel storage for first stage and upper stage launch vehicles including Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicles); long system life cryogenic storage that is both reliable and safe and would perform well beyond the current vessel design life (e.g. orbiting space fuel depots); and space-based habitat structures that are manufactured using fiber-reinforced composite materials.","The aerospace and the commercial communities have shown significant interest in using COPVs for cryogenic and non-cryogenic applications.  Non-NASA commercial applications for the research proposed include the following: Liquid hydrogen fuel cells in terms of increased safety and reliability; vehicular cryo-compressed gas storage of hydrogen and natural gas which dramatically increases the fuel storage density thus increasing the amount of fuel that can be stored in a vehicle; environmentally-friendly and safer earth-based cryogenic fluid storage where the composite structures will not need painting, stripping, and repainting in order to prevent corrosion as does current metal/steel construction and are also easier to transport due to their light-weight nature; and interest in the marine transport of propane via tanker ships where very large (5300 m3) COPVs will be needed.","Composites; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fuels/Propellants; Nanomaterials; Polymers; Processing Methods; Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",Advanced Fabrication and Manufacturing of Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Specifically, we propose to develop a 20 W power amplifier with an associated PAE of 60% operating over the 31.5 to 34 GHz band. This will be accomplished by employing two major innovations. First, we plan to utilize wide bandgap Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) device technology. Operating at a higher voltage (typically 20-28 V versus 4-5 V for GaAs), GaN permits power densities which are 5-10 times higher than GaAs or InP. In addition to the power density, high-voltage operation results in lower matching and cell combining losses, making these MMICs more efficient. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a switching mode (Class F) to enhance the device efficiency. While this method has demonstrated PAE levels of >80% at 2 GHz, it has not yet been demonstrated at Ka-band. Computer simulations, contained in this proposal, indicate that by using this method, PAE levels ranging from 65% to 80% are possible. This was verified by device models from three different foundries. Finally, we will utilize our high-efficiency, H-tee combiner technology to combine 4 of these chips to achieve 20 W output power.","Future NASA robotic and manned space exploration missions require high-efficiency power amplifiers, operating at Ka-band, for high data rate, long range space communications. Ka-band is the frequency of choice since it 1) provides more available bandwidth for higher data rates and 2) offers a theoretical benefit of 16 (12 dB) in EIRP compared with X-band (8.41 GHz) for the same antenna aperture size. Current technology can provide efficiency levels typically in the 20-25% range, and with packaging, combining networks and power conditioning, the efficiency rarely exceeds 15%. Employing GaN device technology together with switching mode (Class F) device operation, our approach shows potential to achieve PAE levels of 60%. Since the transmitter SSPA is usually the largest consumer of spacecraft power, our high-efficiency approach represents a high-value proposition for NASA. In addition to this telecommunications application, NASA employs active (radar) Ka-band sensors for a wide variety of Earth science applications, including Ka-band radar for cloud measurements, weather and climate variability studies. Since these sensors are airborne or satellite based, they would also benefit from this high-efficiency SSPA.","Applications for high-efficiency Ka-band amplifiers abound in the commercial segment as well as DoD.  These include SATCOM applications for the Army in the 29.5 to 31 GHz band to radar applications for all military services in the radar bands (33 to 38 GHz). For radar, high efficiency is particularly important for airborne applications, such as UAVs and fire control radars, where the prime power is limited. In the commercial segment, a massive market exists for high-efficiency SSPAs to replace tubes in Satcom terminals. Additional markets include airborne terminals for commercial airlines using Satcom (27 to 31 GHz), emerging communications applications in the 38-39 GHz range, weather and environmental monitoring radars operating in the 34 to 36 GHz band, aircraft landing systems to enhance or replace Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) with EVFS at 35 GHz, Security and Surveillance radars for commercial, industrial and municipal applications and helicopter collision avoidance radars for brown-out and obstacle avoidance.  Further, this technology is scalable. By using power combining technology, we can provide high-efficiency amplifiers with output power levels well beyond the current goals of this program. For example, with the current 5 W chip and a 16-way combiner, power levels of 80 W are readily attainable.","Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Electromagnetic; Power Combiners/Splitters; Transmitters/Receivers",Long Range Space RF Telecommunications   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Though single pulse, AP/HTPB fueled solid rocket motors exist in the market, greater mission flexibility is to be had from a motor with the capability of a second ignition in the same volume constraints. Digital Solid State Propulsion (DSSP) proposes research into the technology to not only to enable a second pulse from a high thrust solid rocket motor, but also into a safer class of propellants called Electric Solid Propellants (ESPs). A barrier system, developed on other DSSP programs, would be the stepping stone for the dual pulse ability of the motor. The ESPs are a group of propellants that are electrically ignited, but safer to handle compared to standard solid energetic propellants. For in-space use, Aluminized variant of ESP would be improved and utilized for this application. Phase I funding would allow for the advancements of these technologies to a TRL 3. Then following basic research and design goals of a Phase I contract, a Phase II contract would allow the design and test of an integrated Delta-V and ACS propulsion into a 1U module at TRL 6.","The most obvious use of a dual-pulse solid motor would be for performing Hohmann transfer orbits from a lower altitude (higher atmospheric drag) to a higher (lower atmospheric drag) orbit, thus increasing the mission duration of the satellite. Note that such a maneuver requires two, nearly equal, delta-v maneuvers to complete. Such a maneuver would require two of the state of the art motors, but a single, dual-pulse motor that could be packaged in the same volume while being able to perform the same function as two current state of the art motors. A current market for this kind of motor would be a Cubesat secondary payload on an Orbital Sciences' Antares rocket. Such a rocket drops off CubeSats in a 250 km circular orbit, where they then have approximately one week on orbit before deorbiting due to atmospheric drag. The 1U+ dual pulse motor would be able to increase the orbit to a circular orbit altitude of about 465 km.  This kind of maneuver increases the satellites lifetime from a few days to a few months; so would become much more useful to any customer.","We have already teamed with the standard CubeSat bus manufacturer, Pumpkin Inc., and in-space propulsion manufacturer, Moog-ISP, for commercial introduction of our thrusters into the small satellite community.  Raytheon Missile Systems is also supporting DSSP for ESP related applications to kill vehicles and boost phase propulsion.

This will overcome problems that both technologies have when operated alone.  The cathode is currently the component which most limits performance and life in ion and Hall Effect thrusters.  Improved cathodes are essential for NASA's next generation electric space propulsion initiative.  The innovation will benefit both satellite and deep space missions.  We have successfully demonstrated both stand-alone reservoir and scandate cathodes in hollow cathode geometries.  Reservoir cathodes are known to provide unprecedented life and stability.  Scandate cathodes dramatically lower operating temperature.  By combining the two technologies, we incorporate extremely long life (greater than 10 years) and extremely low temperature (less than 850 degrees C) into a single device.  The result will be a revolutionary enhancement in electric propulsion.  Reservoir cathodes employ a chamber behind the emitter which contains a barium emissive material.  This greatly increases the amount of barium available to the cathode.  Scandate cathodes provide a scandium-containing cathode surface which lowers the work function.","NASA will use the cathode in ion thrusters for long-range space mission, such as Mars and lunar cargo missions.  It will use it for voyages to more distant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn.  The cathode may be used wherever long life and higher specific impulse are required.  The cathode may eventually enable manned long-range missions.  A higher emission cathode would enable higher power and frequency in klystrons and TWTs.  This would allow higher data rate transmissions.","The cathode will improve performance and life on non-NASA ion and Hall Effect thrusters, used in near-Earth missions.  Of particular interest is its use in geosynchronous satellites for circularization, attitude control and station keeping.  Also, many vacuum electron devices such as klystron, traveling wave tubes and even x-ray tubes would benefit from this work.  In particular, this proposal has significant effort devoted to improving the mechanical strength and geometrical stability of scandate cathode matrices.  The lack of these qualities has been one reason they are not used in linear beam devices where focusing stability depends on cathode dimensional stability.","Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Attitude Determination & Control; Lifetime Testing; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Metallics; Nanomaterials; Spacecraft Main Engine",High Power Electric Propulsion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The device uses simplified and robust techniques for loading the traps, and directly leverages hardware already developed by AOSense. The simplified architecture for PLUS makes it amenable to future space qualification. When paired with a sufficiently stable local oscillator, PLUS can be operated as an optical lattice clock. Alternatively, the lattice-trapped atoms could serve as a starting point for producing quantum degenerate Sr gases for use in future sensor technologies or fundamental science studies. In the latter case, possibilities span explorations of artificial gauge fields to quantum information processing. In Phase I, AOSense will optimize the expected device performance through extensive modeling, trade-space analysis, and technology validation of the highest risk hardware.

Based on an optimization formulation, the over-determined trim analysis can determine the optimum control surface scheduling of multiple control surfaces to achieve the best aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft using the high-fidelity Navier-Stokes (N-S) solver in FUN3D. At the critical loads flight conditions, the optimum control surface scheduling can minimize the design loads; leading to a lighter and more flexible structural design. At the cruise conditions, the optimum control surface scheduling can aeroelastically deform the more flexible structure to an optimum shape for induced drag minimization at cruise.One non-conventional design concept under investigation by NASA is the Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF) system that utilizes multiple advanced actuators such as shape memory alloys (SMA) to achieve an optimum continuous deformed wing shape for obtaining the best aerodynamic efficiency. The VCCTEF design concept for the aerodynamic efficiency improvement will be ultimately verified by wind tunnel testing. However, such a wind tunnel testing will be impractically without a viable wind tunnel test plan that can provide a guideline for seeking the optimum actuation scheduling in the multi-dimensional design space. This viable wind tunnel test plan for testing the VCCTEF concept can be established by the FUN3D nonlinear trim module.",The proposed Phase I effort is highly relevant to several on-going and future NASA projects in NASA's fixed wing project under Fundamental Aeronautics Program. Initiatives such as the elastic aircraft flight control and Truss-Braced Wing (TBW) development will benefit from the research conducted in the proposed Phase I effort.

Therefore, continued assessment and development of advanced prediction methodologies and tools is essential. Despite significant progress made in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in past several decades, some production unstructured CFD codes used at NASA for noise prediction are only 2nd order accurate at best. In this SBIR study, we propose to develop a modular high-order scheme with low dissipation flux difference splitting that can be integrated into existing CFD codes for use in improving the solution accuracy and to enable better prediction of complex physics and noise mechanisms and propagation.  The salient features of our proposed approach include: (1) high-resolution schemes with physics-based low-dissipation flux-difference splitting; (2) very low memory requirements; and (3) modular structure for easy integration into existing CFD codes. During Phase I, a module providing 3rd order accurate schemes will be developed and integrated into FUN3D code. Verification and validation studies will be conducted to demonstrate the improved solution accuracy. During Phase II, 4th order accurate schemes will be developed and implemented with FUN3D, and the performance of improved schemes will be assessed for realistic aeroacoustic problems. Adaptive use of high-order schemes near solution discontinuities (such as shocks) will be investigated. Phase II plans will also consider integration of the high-order module with other unstructured CFD codes such as USM3D and Loci/CHEM.","The work proposed in this effort will advance the state-of-the-art of unstructured CFD technology not only for aeroacoustics problems but also in other areas such as high-lifting surfaces, airframe design and propulsion. The developed high-order and low dissipation unstructured CFD technology for noise source prediction can also be directly applied to several of NASA's multidisciplinary noise and vibration programs such as the prediction of noise mechanisms and propagation for engine, fan, duct, propellers, and airframes, and for the analysis of wake/frame interaction induced noise and vibrations. It can be used for the design of revolutionary aircraft with innovative configurations and technologies for minimum noise signature, and for the improvement of current aircraft noise performance.","The FAA spends millions of dollars a year buying out homes, or making acoustic improvements to homes in accordance with FFA regulations. There is a huge market for efficient aeroacoustic analysis tools, which is driven by new aircraft, missile, and reusable launch vehicle design and by the need for multiple aeroacoustic analyses over time as a consequence of aircraft modifications and expanded/changing missions. These are important areas for defense contractors. The proposed technology provides a viable tool for several commercial applications such as wing-trailing vortex dynamics of large civil aircraft, analysis of noise generated by landing gear of civil aircraft, and others.

They could perform difficult and dangerous tasks such as fire fighting, border patrol, and search and rescue, and dull tasks such as surveying crops. The elimination of a cockpit and the pilots makes UAS operation attractive from an economic standpoint. In addition, much of the technology used for autonomy could benefit manned flight as a pilot's aid to help in tasks such as landing on an oilrig in the high seas.  Open questions remain, however, about how unmanned autonomous aerial vehicles can be safely incorporated into the NAS. UAS's operating in the NAS must sense and avoid other vehicles, follow air traffic commands, avoid the terrain and land without operator intervention, react to contingencies, and be reliable and cost-effective.The current approach for UAS integration relies on radio links and the operator's acuity to direct them. Lost links, however, are unavoidable. UAS's must have the capability to make their own decisions based on information available via databases and information discovered by onboard sensors. Near Earth Autonomy proposes to develop technologies and capabilities leading to fully autonomous systems that are able to discover and adapt to unpredicted changes in their environment, and yet still accomplish the mission, with minimal or no human involvement. The proposal focuses on developing autonomy in the form of sensors and computer software that will enable UAS's of the future to operate safely in the NAS. Additionally, the proposal addresses how the technical challenges can be met and how the technology developed can be shown to be both trustworthy and commercially viable for general aviation. This is aligned with NASA's current initiative for safe integration of UASs in the national airspace led by Langley Research Center.","NEA envisions the initial NASA market to be primarily units for testing and validation at both the system level and at the air vehicle level.  The autonomous capabilities that NEA proposes will contribute to NASA's testing and validation of the technologies and concepts for UAS operations in the NAS. Additionally, NEA's autonomous technology will provide an enhanced capability, enabling UAS more comprehensive flight-testing, for NASA's collaborative efforts with the FAA to accommodate UAS operations in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  As the autonomous flight capabilities mature and are integrated into air vehicles, they will be of direct use to NASA in their flight testing of ground-based air navigational aids and guidance systems located in remote areas, such as Antarctica. NEA's autonomous technology will enable greater utilization of UAS in other NASA areas, particularly for experimentation and testing in the various research centers.","Government agencies, both military and civilian, will comprise a much larger market for the technology.  The commercial sector will eventually be the largest market sector. A recent market analysis in Composites World magazine, drawing on work from both the Teal Group and AUVSI, indicates a global military market of approximately 57,000 UAS, with about 19,000 for the US military services–primarily in the reconnaissance and attack configurations, with growing utilization of utility and cargo configurations.  Additionally, the analysis forecasts a commercial market of as many as 160,000 air vehicles, most of which would be in the public safety and precision agriculture segments.

This application which will support RecurDyn Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) software, acquired by NASA in 2013, will increase efficiency and reduce errors, time and the need for advanced knowledge.  Currently, modeling complex flexible body non-linear structures can be time consuming and prone to error. Existing nonlinear structural analysis simulation software does not effectively simulate structural assemblies with significant motion. Creation of a custom vertical application for the simulation of deployable space structures would provide a large reduction in the specialized knowledge needed to develop models and would automate tedious tasks.   The proposed innovations of this Phase I SBIR project are:  1. A focused vertical software application for the dynamic simulation of the rollup, deployment and maneuvering operation of large solar array structures consisting of a set of functions that are layered on commercial Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) simulation software that also has the capability of the nonlinear simulation of flexible (Finite-Element [FE] or mesh-based) bodies; and  2. Development of an active, nonlinear controller that will reduce the deflection of a roll-out solar array (ROSA) during spacecraft maneuvers. This development includes the creation and use of a unique simulation environment that couples the controller simulation with the nonlinear structural response of the ROSA.  The Phase II project will add capabilities and improve integration of functions, including new support of the simulation of lanyards and tape springs. Additional type of deployable space structures can be simulated, including antennas.","NASA commercialization will follow a logical progression. The initial application will be a loose set of functions to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of ROSA structures. The initial target market would be appropriate NASA centers (NASA LaRC and NASA GRC) and their contractors. User experience from the Phase I applications will help guide the Phase II work.The addition of the Phase II capabilities (simulation of lanyards and tape springs) and the improved integration of functions will result in a set of software applications that will be appropriate to the broader market of deployable space structures. Other solar array configurations can be addressed as well as deployable antennas. Most NASA Centers could be approached with these Phase II applications, as well as their contractors. The addition of the Phase II capabilities will allow the software to be used more widely in each NASA Center.","A market investigation for the ROSA application would be done at selected international space agencies in order to understand their needs. The addition of the Phase II capabilities will produce a software application that can be sold to an international market of agencies and contractors who work with deployable space structures.

However, the reliable use of these exceptionally high capacity anodes in a commercial cell has not been achieved due to safety and reliability concerns resulting from thermal runaway and short-circuit issues due to dendritic growth on the metal anode from lithium plating during charge-discharge cycles.  Solid-state electrolytes (SSE) have been identified as one option to address this cell failure mode, but SSE technologies must be developed that combine high conductivity and mechanical properties conducive to smooth Li plating with feasible manufacturing processes.  Also, the Li anode must be combined with an ultra-high capacity cathode in order to reach NASA's aggressive cell-level energy goals.To address this need, Solid Power proposes to utilize a Li-metal-compatible solid-state battery design to far exceed the specific energies achieved by state-of-the-art (SOTA) Li-ion batteries in a format that also provides for intrinsic safety and abuse tolerance.

More specifically, a network of small Metal Rubber strain sensors would provide a non-invasive mechanism to monitor loading of the inflatable deceleration and landing systems.  The in-situ Metal Rubber strain sensors would be utilized to monitor drag and instability of the system at varying Mach flow regimes by analyzing dynamic structure forces and also billowing effects (or similar shape-change / inflation effects) of the inflatable system as it goes through EDL operations.  The novel Metal Rubber sensors have proven the ability to monitor aerodynamic events, particularly shear and normal forces, based on their response to applied strain. These previous sensor technological advancements will be modified to develop the proposed sensor system for monitoring dynamic loading of the inflatable structure.  Lightweight Metal Rubber sensor appliques can be attached onto the inflatable base material or integrated in/under the system coating matrix for in-situ non-invasive monitoring.","The proposed NASA SBIR program would develop an innovative, light-weight, low-modulus, and rugged Metal Rubber sensor system for inflatable/flexible entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems.

Of particular interest is a hybrid carbon/SiC matrix composite utilizing carbon fiber.  This class of composite, which utilizes Phenolic prepreg to form the initial composite structure, lends itself to the fabrication of large very complex structures.  Typically, these composites are densified via PIP processing.  However, there are deficiencies in this material system.  The nature of PIP processing results in an appreciable amount of open porosity, requiring a CVD SiC external coating for oxidation protection.  The application of CVD SiC to large structures is quite limited due to cost factors.   Also, since the composites are fabricated using 2D fabric, the transverse mechanical properties are typically low.   This proposal offers a highly innovative approach to alleviate the above mentioned shortcomings.  First, it utilizes nanotechnology at the composite molding stage, enabling enhanced in plane and transverse mechanical properties.  Secondly, it offers a highly unique, non CVD external coating technology.

The oldest solution, a mechanically steered parabolic reflector, does not provide a low profile.  The modern electronically steered phased array is an alternative that does provide a low-profile antenna solution, but the cost of these antennas has prevented wider use.  Hybrid antenna solutions that are partly mechanically steered and partly electronically steered are an approach to maintain the low profile of a phase array at much lower cost.  Although existing hybrid solutions offer potential, there have been limitations in scan speed and Field-of-View (FOV).FIRST RF has demonstrated the initial proof-of-concept capability of an innovative low-profile hybrid scan phased array antenna that reduces cost by nearly an order of magnitude relative to a conventional phased array for low profile applications and removes the limitations of previous designs in scanning and FOV.  This approach uses small mechanical actuators to reduce the parts count of the active components in the electronic steering portion of the aperture.  Unlike other hybrid scan solutions, which have asymmetrical fast and slow steering, this approach provides symmetrical fast electronic steering at angles near boresite with slower mechanical steering for large off-boresite angles.  The scan loss of this approach is actually lower than for fully electronic scanned phased array antennas, and the FOV is greater.  This technology is applicable for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) applications.","After development of a STAMPS type antenna terminal in this program, NASA SATCOM terminal antennas would become available and cost-effective.  These SATCOM antenna terminals would be applicable for both manned and unmanned aircraft, but other platforms may find similar benefits based on the reduced cost relative to conventional phased arrays and the modular assembly approach for other frequency bands of interest.A commercial Ku/Ka SATCOM system will provide greater flexibility in mobile applications by increasing data capacities and availability to airborne users.  The combination of electro-mechanical and active array pointing capabilities would allow for lower cost navigation units to be used in all applications of the system.  This can be accomplished by using the coarse pointing properties of the navigation system and the electro-mechanical positioner and the fine pointing capability of the active array and a signal strength feedback network.The market size can be viewed at around $50M for the NASA and government market, which is based on outfitting approximately 100 airborne platforms, of which there are several hundred currently in the DoD's inventory.  It is estimated that this system will sell competitively in this market. Initial deployment is expected to exceed 10% of this market size. Smaller systems could be used to support ground vehicles.

Consequently, a significant propellant mass will be required. Bringing that mass from Earth, while technically possible, would be impractical and grossly inefficient. Manufacturing propellant from the Martian atmosphere would be far more practical. Highly efficient electrolyzers for splitting carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2) have been demonstrated. These can be run off solar power and used to generate high-pressure propellant without the need for pumps. With a theoretical vacuum specific impulse (Isp) of 324 sec (1000 psia chamber pressure, 40:1 nozzle expansion ratio), an O2/CO propulsion system would provide higher Isp than a solid rocket, and only a small fraction of the propulsion system wet mass would have to be brought from Earth. Previous testing with O2/CO propellant at NASA GRC has demonstrated that ignition of this mixture is very difficult. In that work, spark igniters were used, and every test resulted in a catastrophic detonation and damage to equipment. In this project, Ultramet will develop a high-performance ignition system for use with O2/CO propellant that is based on resistively heated silicon carbide open-cell foam. Previous testing has demonstrated that by passing an electric current through it, the foam can be heated to 1300 C in just 2 seconds. By flowing the non-hypergolic bipropellant mixture through the foam, ignition will take place in a pseudo-homogeneous manner as the gases enter the foam rather than only in the isolated vicinity of the arc in a spark igniter. This will prevent propellant accumulation in the chamber and subsequent detonation. Safe, reliable ignition of O2/CO is an enabling technology for the use of in-situ manufactured propellants on Mars.","The primary NASA applications will be for Mars sample return missions where O2/CO can be generated from the Martian atmosphere. Other applications for resistively heated foam igniters include ignition of other non-hypergolic propellants (e.g. LOX/CH4), ignition of ionic liquid monopropellants such as AF-M315E, AF-M315A, and LMP-103S, and ignition of hydrazine.","This technology can be used for igniting non-hypergolic bipropellants, ionic liquid monopropellants, and hydrazine in commercial and military spacecraft main and attitude control engines, as well as reaction control engines on boosters.

Intrusive probe type devices disturb the flow field while traditional particle-seeded techniques are not feasible in shock layers or stagnation regions.  Seeded molecular tagging approaches can not only alter the mean flow, but also introduce unsteady disturbances and requires sufficient upstream seeding in order to diffuse into the boundary layer.

On the other hand, if a system-level health management solution could identify the individual degradations and indictors associated with those degradations, and thereby decouple the problem into smaller pieces, the existing prognostic techniques could still be used to predict time to failure, and could therefore drive an effective Condition Based Maintenance and Decision Support System (CBM+).Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) and Vanderbilt University team seeks to develop a system-level diagnostic and prognostic process and a ""sense and respond capability"" which first uses error codes and discrete sensor values to correctly diagnose the system health including degradations and failures of sensors and components, and then invoke appropriate prognostic routines for assessment of remaining life and capability. Thus, QSI's Testability Engineering And Maintenance System (TEAMS) real-time reasoner will enable the use of many existing prognostics techniques in the broader context by decomposing the complex system into local datasets of degradations and associated sensor data sets, thereby limiting the problem-space for the prognostic techniques to their limited design scope. Indeed, it is well established in the contexts of parameter estimation and model-based fault identification (i.e., fault isolation and severity estimation) that feature selection and diagnosis, respectively, followed by parameter estimation provides major improvements in estimation performance (measured in terms of computational time as well as the standard deviations of the estimated parameters) when compared to full parameter estimation which provides biased estimates for all the parameters.","NASA is developing increasingly autonomous systems that can perform missions with a high degree of certainty with minimal human intervention. Examples of such mission include rovers operating in Mars, where the missions are extremely long, and therefore multiple components and subsystems will degrade and fail over the duration of the mission. However, due to the long communication delays between Mars and Earth, these systems can be monitored and diagnosed by mission control like any other near-earth mission. The proposed capability will be invaluable to NASA for such operations by (a) Predicting failures before they disrupt the mission, (b) Reducing false positives of such prediction with the proposed diagnosis-driven prognosis, and (c) identifying the remaining useful capability of the system. This will enable NASA to focus on the mission planning and recovery aspects, and manage the health of the system, rather than being blindsided by unexpected failures.","The potential applications for DoD and Commercial users are even larger. This is because they are likely to operate multiple systems, a fleet of vehicles for example, that have the opportunity of periodic preemptive maintenance. To address these customers' needs, we will develop a decision-support module on top of the proposed capability here that will allow the customer to define his own business rules. Such business rules will help the customer answer questions like ""if the system has a scheduled downtime window of 2 hours tomorrow, what pre-emptive repairs should I perform within that maintenance window so as to minimize the chance of unscheduled downtime (due to failure) in the next 10 days"". For enterprise-wide logistic planning, this decision-making capability will also help optimize the cost of additional opportunistic maintenance versus the cost of additional downtime if such maintenance were not performed.

This bidirectional DC converter offers an extremely high power density and will utilize a novel hybrid resonance and PWM technique to achieve.  It will also offer NASA the flexibility for many power system topologies, including: distributing large single cells throughout the vehicle, use of smaller cells in a centralized location, or a combination banked smaller cells distributed throughout the system.  This is accomplished through independent charging and discharging control of state-of-charge and state-of-health for each battery module, inherent active maximum current limit and short-circuit protection, and ease of module balancing.","Highly efficient modular DC converters are coveted throughout numerous applications due to the increased flexibility and reliability they offer to the power system. In terms of flexibility, the modular DC converters offer the ability to design a centralized or decentralized power system topology.  This is certainly relevant within electric propulsion systems of vehicles and is therefore a primary target application.  The benefits related catastrophic containment and mass distribution can be analyzed, each benefiting from the availability of a modular DC converter.   Additionally, cost avoidance is important.

Immediate assessment leads to immediate action, so the System Map is useful for any spacecraft reconfiguration task, spacecraft repair task, or mission decision assessment.  It can be used in a fully autonomous, decentralized fashion by implanting on an FPGA as investigated in this proposal, or as a decision aid for a human crew.","Responsive spacecraft:  Spacecraft will benefit from subsystems which can modify its own survivability based on environmental conditions and mission needs.  This can have a high impact on the resilience and survivability of Deep Space missions.  A generic controller board can work with nearly any subsystem.Earth based satellite ground stations:  Spacecraft controllers will benefit from the intuitive handling of telemetry and the assistance of statistics based predictions.  Models will assist controllers in troubleshooting and sometimes preventing problems.Deep space missions:  Spacecraft with long duration missions at long distance from Earth require a high degree of autonomy.  Autonomous subsystems which are reactive to its local environment will greatly reduce mission risk while optimizing science return.Habitation modules:  Dormant habitation modules also require a high degree of autonomy for long periods of time, to ensure proper health in preparation of human occupation.","Commercial spaceport ground stations:  All of the product's benefits are equally useful in assisting the commercial space satellite market conduct safer and cheaper operations.Resilient commercial spacecraft: Commercial spacecraft will have greater ability to support multiple missions and dynamic space environments.Manufacturing Sector:  Many of the methods in this proposal are finding use in ""BigData"" complex systems problems.

Unfortunately, contemporary analysis methods are unsuited for aeroservoelastic analysis of such configurations suffering from accessibility, usability, fidelity or resource constraints.  Design tools have typically been developed using configuration dependent low-fidelity approaches that are unsuitable to reliably analyze advanced configurations.  Contemporary aeromechanics solvers (i.e. viscous compressible Computational Fluid Dynamics coupled to Finite Element structural models) can analyze advanced concepts, but require significant user input to support advanced configurations, not to mention extensive computational resources.  What has long been needed is an approach that bridges the middle ground to enable aeroservoelastic analysis at the ""appropriate level of fidelity for the problem at hand"", while reliably permitting the novel application of aeroelastic knowledge to new concepts, in addition to supporting wind-tunnel and flight tests by enabling the efficient investigation of flight dynamics, flutter, stability and control.  By exploiting Continuum Dynamics Inc.'s extensive experience developing fully-coupled aeromechanics methods, we propose the development of a new rapid, reliable, variable–fidelity first-principles physics-based aeroservoelastic analysis to support concept evaluation, wind-tunnel/flight testing and design.","The proposed effort directly supports NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program's work on structural efficiency by developing a variable–fidelity first principles physics-based aeroservoelastic analysis tool for concept evaluation, design and wind-tunnel support.  Specifically, this proposed tool would directly address the program needs by being able to evaluate new concepts to provide insight into state-of-the-art advances into aeroelasticty, to undertake aeroservoelastic analysis ""at the appropriate level of fidelity for the problem at hand"" and to efficiently undertake the development of mathematical models of wind-tunnel test articles to predict flight dynamics, stability, flutter, control issues and how to predict and alleviate gust loads.

During this Phase I effort ESAero will progress the development of the hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) TOGW tool developed in the previous Phase I SBIR (NNX13CC24P) by producing a physics-based wing structure analysis and weight estimation module. The layout of the structural members will be estimated using heuristic trends and top-level design assumptions, and the members will be sized according to classical beam theory. The interaction between HEDP configuration and aircraft weight is important to understand, as one primary advantage of the configuration is the ability to place smaller propulsors at virtually any location on the aircraft, leveraging pre-existing airframe supports. By delving into the structural analysis of HEDP designs, progress can be made toward determining how sensitive aircraft structural weight is to propulsion configuration. This new module will replace the modified, empirically based equations used in the current TOGW framework. By incorporating this capability, the novel architectures and configurations of HEDP systems, as well as other advanced aircraft concepts, could be analyzed and sized with greater fidelity. Furthermore, this effort may start to unravel concerns over other structural members paving the way for further investigation in a Phase II. Other potential Phase II tasks may include integrating this structural analysis and weight estimation into other conceptual design tools, such as OpenVSP.","The potential NASA applications for this proposed effort will focus on integrating this module into the TOGW framework developed in ESAero's 2012 Phase I SBIR (NNX13CC24P). The tool itself is part of a larger MDAO framework for hybrid-electric synthesis, benefitting multiple NRA projects, and other direct NASA efforts, both internal and external. This effort further chips away at the various nuances native to hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) configurations, developing some sense of how distributed propulsion effects structural weight. These new hurdles have not been addressed in previous textbook methods or efforts, but play a significant role in determining the feasibility of these new aircraft configurations.  As one of the major benefits to a decoupled energy management system is the freedom of placing propulsors, this tool would show, with higher fidelity, how sensitive wing weight structure is to that distributive freedom. The wing weight module can be utilized by other tools written in the MATLAB language as it is capable of operating independent of the TOGW framework. In Phase II work, more of the structural group could be studied to show similar sensitivities to hybrid-electric architectures, and the tool could potentially be integrated into OpenVSP, creating a more comprehensive conceptual design tool for HEDP.","As with ESAero's other conceptual design tools, the obvious commercial application of this wing structural weight module is to use it and the TOGW framework it is associated with to support conceptual design groups in their research and development of hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) aircraft. This tool will be among the first conceptual design tools to study the effects of propulsion system integration options on structural design and weight. The tool may be used to guide aerospace primes and AFRL toward the identification of feasible HEDP configurations and support component manufacturers who are interested in how their technology would affect the leading edge in HEDP design and performance. AFRL would benefit as they are conducting in-house studies and supporting ESAero in other related areas. IARPA and the FAA will also benefit, as the tool will be distributed within the government FOUO. ESAero has indentified the government and industry partners to develop this type of technology near term (Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed Martin) and longer (NASA, AFRL, IARPA etc).","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Development Environments; Distribution/Management; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures; Verification/Validation Tools",Physics-Based Conceptual Design Tools   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The first feature is a 95% porous electrode architecture. This electrode is an open-cell, nanostructured conductive foam whose internal structures are conformal coated with lithium metal. Dendrites growing outward from an internal pore surface will propagate until they come into contact with an opposing wall inside the foam and further growth is mechanically frustrated. This prevents dendrites from propagating external to the anode, as the dendrites would be trapped within the structure of the foam. The second feature is a five micron mask that, when applied to the surface of the 3d foam, prevents electrodeposition of lithium metal near the surface of the electrode, hence preventing growth of lithium dendrites near the surface. The third feature is a novel, highly conductive ionic fluid rigid-rod polymer composite expected to achieve a conductivity of 8.3x10^-3 S/cm^2. This polymer has already demonstrated protonic conductivity of 8.3x10^-3 S/cm^2 and must be modified for use in a lithium ion battery. Rigid-rod polymers have a tensile modulus that is 37x – 62x stronger than a standard polyethelyene solid polymer electrolyte. This strength may physically deter or altogether prevent the growth of lithium dendrites. XABC believes that the novel combination of these three unique features will enable the stable cycling of lithium metal in a secondary cell. For Phase I, XABC proposes to fabricate and test the effect of both the polymer and masked 3d foam on dendrite suppression. For Phase II, XABC proposes to fabricate fully functioning negative electrodes with the features above.","NASA is unique to the government in the fact that its mission takes it into a celestial operating environment that is inherently difficult to navigate. This environment is extremely hazardous, contains a variety of reactive oxidants, highly energetic radiation, rapidly moving debris and the like.  This places stringent requirements on all components NASA chooses for its missions, and these components govern or limit the extent to which NASA can operate in such an environment. A secondary battery with a net energy density greater than 500 Wh/kg and stable performance past 500 cycles would significantly extend NASA's mission capability. Given design constraints, an energy dense battery would be smaller and allow for the deployment of larger, more complex sensors. More importantly, the use of a strong solid electrolyte would significantly increase the safety of the battery, allowing it to be deployed as a critical component. Should the battery fail, the solid polymer would help prevent damage to other equipment and reduce potential for personal injury.  NASA is currently planning on deploying lithium ion batteries onto the ISS to replace its aging nickel-hydrogen cells (Clark 2013). The Hubble telescope also uses nickel-hydrogen cells. Li-ion batteries w/ 500 Wh/kg would increase lifetime, which would result in significant cost savings to due a reduction in space walks. Such a cell would also reduce operational risk when deployed on probes, rovers and the like.","There are many potential markets where XABC can have an impact, which include consumer electronics, server farms, power tools, grid backup, military, medical, robotics and others. From a value perspective, XABC will try to satisfy as many of those markets as practical during product design decisions. XABC cannot focus on all markets initially, so it will create products for markets that stand to benefit most from StructurePore™ technology. Considering this, XABC will focus on applications of high desirability in three of the many potential market segments: 1) Military, DoD and NASA applications where enhanced performance at a much lower weight is highly desirable. 2) Portable electronic devices especially in the rapidly growing mobility market for laptops, netbooks, tablets and phones. 3) Automotive application for electric, gasoline hybrid, and fuel cell hybrid vehicles.Many secondary battery applications, like PHEVs, consumer electronics and NASA, are very sensitive to safety and reliability. To enter into such markets with a secondary lithium metal battery, the product must first be refined and adopted by markets that have more inherent risk tolerance, like the DoD, robotics and hobby markets. XABC is working with leading members of the remote control vehicle market to supply them with high power, high-energy batteries.

This measurable performance loss has led to a number of design revisions, but barehanded performance with an EVA glove on is still far from achievable.  Exoskeleton concepts have also been considered to add some of the lost dexterous capability, but technology and design challenges have limited their practical utility.  As such, InnoVital Systems, Inc., in collaboration with the Space Systems Laboratory of the Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Maryland, proposes to develop an innovative EVA glove exoskeleton for increased performance capability.

With the current EVA gloves, each astronaut has a custom-fit pair, so it is reasonable to assume that the accompanying exoskeleton device would also be custom-fit to each astronaut.  To facilitate technology transfer, we will work in Phase I to address top-level hardware and software integration issues from a systems engineering perspective.

This variant of the proposed technology can reach several markets including patients recovering from musculoskeletal injuries, those experiencing permanent loss of functional capabilities in the hand, and sufferers of stroke and other neuromuscular diseases.  Given the scalability of pneumatic artificial muscles, successful transition of the technology to hand orthoses would also naturally lead to exploring applicability to other multiple degree of freedom joints.

Phoenix Integration has produced a commercial tool (MBSE Pak) which allows engineers to link SysML diagrams (in MagicDraw and Rhapsody) to ModelCenter, a general-purpose engineering integration framework. As a result, from SysML parametric diagrams, engineers can execute actual engineering analysis tools for the purpose of systems architectural design, requirements compliance, trade studies, etc. This proposal would extend this MBSE product in several specific ways. First, it would develop a systems analysis capability for improved management decisions including the ability to perform what-if studies of technology options, simulation of schedule and cost, and probabilistic discrete event simulation for risk analysis. Second, it would improve verification and validation of models through improved requirements compliance analysis, handling of time series data, and traceability of data pedigree for modeling artifacts. Third, it would connect SysML models to executable model libraries in which components can be executed in an ad-hoc manner (on any capable computer) from the library itself and include rich support for multi-fidelity modeling tools on  the backend. A representative system model would be developed as an example problem to illustrate the developed features and would be demonstrated to NASA throughout the course of the work.","A major benefit of the proposed software toolset is that it can be applied at the conceptual and preliminary design stage for complex projects across the entire spectrum of NASA Science, Human Exploration and Operation, and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorates. The proposed technology will provide for management decision support, verification and validation, and the use of standardized model libraries in MBSE. It is likely that these improvements will be most significant early in the design process where impacts on lifecycle costs are the greatest. Initial applications will be in the Science mission area dealing with advanced telescope systems, satellites, or robotic exploration. Additional applications will be pursued within the NASA directorates as case studies and models are developed.  NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics program has been a strong user of Phoenix technology and would benefit from the development work advocated here. JPL is also heavily investing in MBSE technology (e.g. the Europa Clipper program) and is a strong candidate for the deliverables described here. In general, satellite programs, space transportation, and air vehicle technologies can benefit from this technology. Government agencies that partner with NASA on joint programs such as DOE, NSF, and FAA would be natural extensions for commercialization.  In addition, prime NASA contractors in support of the ISS such as Boeing, Space X, Orbital Sciences, and Sierra Nevada are strong possibilities.","Beyond NASA, Phoenix Integration's commercialization efforts will be focused primarily on the aerospace and defense sector where companies such as Lockheed Martin are already actively using the base level MBSE technology discussed in this proposal. Phoenix Integration is well positioned to introduce this technology to leading organizations in this business sector such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon since they already utilize the company's products.  Phoenix Integration software tools are widely used by domain level engineers to analyze, design, and optimize the subsystems, components, and processes that make up complex aerospace systems. By leveraging this existing installed base, it will be possible to quickly achieve initial sales and establish a core user base for the new technology. After establishing penetration in aerospace and defense, Phoenix Integration will build upon these successes to pursue secondary markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, green energy, shipbuilding, transportation, and process industries. Some of these industries have begun using Phoenix products and MBSE tools in general. The growing market and interest in this technology has been robust and bodes well for future development.","Analytical Methods; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Knowledge Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Integrated Science Mission Modeling   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The reactor array enables nearly complete single pass carbon dioxide reduction using the Sabatier reaction, allowing efficient recovery of oxygen from in situ carbon dioxide resources on Mars or other Near Earth Objects.  Arrays of microchannel reactors with decreasing temperatures and increasing residence times can be optimized to maximize reaction kinetics and overcome thermodynamic limits (85% conversion at 400 C)of the Sabatier reaction resulting in 99% conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to water and methane.  Alternatively, monolithic graded temperature reactors can be developed that will optimize reaction kinetics with respect to the thermodynamic limitations of the Sabatier reaction in a compact and efficient design.  The Phase I efforts will focus on design and construction of the microchannel reactors.  The Phase II effort will build upon the feasibility demonstration resulting in the development of a prototype MSRS consisting of a microchannel reactor array and a graded temperature microreactor capable of 99% single-pass, carbon dioxide conversion to methane and water capable of processing 1 kg hr-1.","The NASA application for this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future, long duration exploration missions to Mars or other Near Earth Objects (NEOs) where reclamation of in situ resources and reduction of the logistics burden will be highly valued.  The Microchannel Sabatier Reactor System will efficiently reclaim oxygen (as water) and produce a propellant (methane) from atmospheric or frozen deposits of carbon dioxide on Mars or other NEOs using only hydrogen.  The Microchannel Sabatier Reactor System (MSRS)provides a fundamental starting point for planetary habitats where precursor robotic staging can prepare the road for subsequent human missions by reducing the logistics burden.","The MSRS technology can be used in the mitigation of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.  In a broader sense, in any situation where reaction kinetics and the thermodynamic driving force of a reaction are in thermal conflict, a graded temperature reactor or reactor array can be utilized to efficiently drive composition closer to the desired products.  Additionally, a fully developed microchannel reactor technology will enable greater thermal control over highly exothermic/endothermic chemical reactions, which will improve selectivity and catalyst stability.  A monolithic microchannel reactor with two parallel paths can also be used to mate exothermic and endothermic reactions eliminating costly and wasteful external heat transfer components.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients)",In-Situ Resource Utilization - Mars Atmosphere/Gas Chemical Processing   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The CERES mission depends on an aerosol assimilation system to augment information from MODIS-based aerosol inversions and allow for the creation of datasets such as surface radiative fluxes. This project will enhance the existing CERES aerosol assimilation system in several ways.(1) We will construct assimilation functionality for VIIRS aerosols,merged MODIS and VIIRS aerosols and potentially aerosol retrievals from other instruments.(2) To facilitate multi-sensor data assimilation we will create an IDL toolkit, SatelliteDL, for the analysis of satellite Earth observationsfrom a diverse set of platforms and sensors. The design will feature an abstraction layer that allows for easy inclusion of new datasets in a modular way. The core function of the toolkit will be the spatial and temporal alignment of satellite swath and geostationary data.(3) We will construct an ensemble Kalman filter aerosol assimilation system. This will allow for robust statistical uncertainty estimates in aerosol quantities of importance to the radiative forcing of the climate.Two recent advances have made such an approach possible.First, the MODIS mission has quantified aerosol retrieval uncertainties based on extensive comparisons to surface measurements, and second, the international AeroCom collaboration has established the feasibility of generating aerosol ensembles based on statistical model emulation.","This project will directly support the generation of NASA CERES mission data products.It will provide continued MODIS-based aerosol analysis for the CERES Edition 4 surface flux datasets that are currently in production,as well as VIIRS-based aerosols for post-MODIS and future CERES editions.Emphasis will be on data continuity between MODIS and VIIRS and the effect of the switch on the climate record.CERES instruments are presently in operation on the Terra, Aqua and Suomi NPP satellites.","CERES and VIIRS instruments are scheduled for launch on the NOAA JPSS-1 satellite in 2017, when CERES aerosol and flux products should be based primarily on VIIRS.The SatelliteDL software package and its multi-sensor cloud and aerosol datasets, as well as the ensemble aerosol analysis, will contribute to the international AeroCom collaboration.",Data Fusion,"Algorithms and Tools for Science Data Processing, Discovery and Analysis, in State-of-the-Art Data Environments   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

No additional lithium salt such as LiPF6 or LiTFSi is required. The ionic liquid and the ionomer are electrochemically stable at 5 V vs Li/Li+ for many charge-discharge cycles, therefore will enable a lithium ion battery with high voltage and high energy density.

Additionally, low-temperature motors like the MAV are often tested at room temperature, since testing at temperatures of -40 Deg C or lower is both difficult and expensive.  Since testing at higher temperatures results in higher burn rates for typical propellants, and thus higher working pressures, ambient tests result in a motor case that is heavier than required for a low temperature mission, because ambient testing results in a higher maximum expected operating pressure.  Our proposed technology alleviates that problem by using a plateau-burning composite propellant that will substantially lessen the burn rate sensitivity to temperature.  As such, the MAV operating pressure in ambient conditions will more closely resemble those on the Mars surface, allowing for a lighter motor case resulting in reduced weight, smaller volume and greater propellant mass fractions.  Additionally, our plateau burning formulation will include a low temperature binder with a high density fuel additive, in order to alleviate the loading stresses at low temperatures and further increase the motor density-Isp.  This may allow us to eliminate the need for the MAV launch erection equipment currently baselined for the MSR mission.","The primary benefit of using a plateau-burning composite propellant formulation on the MAV is an increase in solid rocket motor (SRM) propellant mass fraction.  Further, using a low temperature binder with a high density fuel will increase the overall motor performance, as well as its capability to withstand stresses at low temperatures.

High yield and moderate cost of Si fabrication dramatically reduce mission size-weight-and-power and cost (SWaP-C).  IBM's 90-nm state-of-the-art 9HP SiGe BiCMOS platform delivers higher performance and lower power, and enables highly integrated (sub-) millimeter wave applications not possible with earlier 180-nm or 130-nm nodes. It is therefore, a prime candidate for designing future mixed-signal/RF electronics for NASA. Currently, however, there are few wide-temperature/radiation data and models, and no radiation/wide-temperature tolerant circuits in this platform. Advanced Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools are also essential for in-depth analysis to optimize design, predict behavior, and assess performance of 9HP-based electronics.  CFDRC and Georgia Tech will perform laser-based and heavy ion irradiation testing on the newest generation 9HP SiGe HBT devices and circuits, and develop new models and upgraded CAD tools. The wide-temperature/radiation experimental data will help validate the models and understand associated failure mechanisms. This new knowledge, data, and upgraded CAD tools will be used in Phase II for development and optimization of novel RHBD mixed-signal/RF circuits and systems, which will be fabricated in the IBM 9HP SiGe process, extensively tested at low temperatures and radiation, and delivered to NASA.","Radiation-hardened and wide-temperature mixed-signal/RF electronics development is aligned, per NASA OCT Technology Area TA08, with the major flight programs within the Planetary Science Division: Discovery, New Frontiers, Lunar Quest, Mars Exploration, Outer Planets Programs, and Europa Jupiter System Mission. Components based on state-of-the-art, 90-nm SiGe technology will help reduce the volume, mass, and power requirements of instrument electronics, essential to maximizing the science return for future missions. Electronics technology capable of operating in extreme environments will enable science missions currently thought to be impractical due to the requirement of bulky protective housing. Electronic parts are getting smaller with technology evolution and the radiation/temperature effects are becoming more severe. A robust physics-based capability to predict the behavior of electronic circuits increases mission confidence. Radiation-hardened and wide-temperature analog, mixed-signal, RF and digital circuits are essential for ALL avionic systems used in NASA exploration projects. The RHBD designs from this project will add to the NASA ""components library"". The physics-based mixed-mode tools will help NASA better evaluate the wide-temperature performance and radiation response at an early stage, and design rad-hard low-temperature electronics with better understanding and control of design margins, thereby reducing the test time and cost.","Various critical analog, mixed-signal, RF, and digital circuits are used in all space-based platforms, including DoD space systems (communication, surveillance, ballistic missiles, missile defense), and commercial satellites. Since modern electronics technologies and components are becoming increasingly sensitive to extreme environments, the capability to predict their behavior can dramatically increase mission confidence and reduce risk. The new RHBD designs and circuit/cell libraries, based on the best-in-class SiGe technology, offer reduced size-weight-and-power and cost (SWaP-C) to all aerospace applications. The physics-based computer aided design (CAD) tools can also be applied to cryogenic electronics for high-sensitivity, low-noise analog and mixed-signal applications, such as metrology, infrared (IR) imagers, sensors (radiation, optical, X-ray), radiometrology, precision instruments, radio and optical astronomy, infrared and photon detectors, and other high-end systems.  For all such devices and systems, predictive and accurate modeling and design tools reduce the amount of required radiation/temperature testing, thus decreasing their cost, and time to market or field application.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Extreme Environments Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Elimination of traditional control surfaces such as flaps can lead to smoother wing surfaces which are especially important in reducing electromagnetic signature of the wings in military aircraft. In this research and development program, Materials Technologies Corporation (MTC) and its team members propose a three-dimensional warping concept in which the typically closed airfoil section is cut open to create a torsionally compliant mechanism that acts as its own amplification device without needing additional mechanisms whatsoever. Deformation of the airfoil is entirely controlled by out-of-plane warping, a purely geometric effect.","The proposed 3D warping actuation concept has potential application to all fixed wing and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Applications of 3D warping include both civilian and military aircraft. 3D warping can reduce the empty weight of aircraft by lessening the weight dedicated to vibration suppression, thus allowing more payload and/or flight range. Additionally, to the extent that variable airfoil twist can improve L/De, the proposed warping concept will result in further improvements in payload/ flight range.","The proposed concept will have applications in the Worldwide Wind Turbine industry for power generation. An effective camber/twist change is needed to benefit most from the dynamic airflow through wind turbines.

A cascade impactor will be used to classify aerosol sample into 8 uniform bins on a logarithmic scale, covering an aerodynamic size range of 0.01 to 10 microns. In each of the 8 stages aerosols will be deposited on a MEMS microbalance that will record aerosol mass in real-time. The proposed device incorporates state-of-the-art MEMS microbalances from the subcontractor femtoScale in the applicant MSP Corporation's advanced cascade impaction technology. With the help of a consultant, who has decades of experience in airborne aerosol measurements, we propose to adapt this device to unpiloted aircrafts, like Black Hawk for NASA's Airborne Science Program. During Phase I, we propose to design a miniature cascade impactor with a low flow rate of 0.5 liters per minute or smaller. A prototype will be built with 8 stages pertaining to 8 aerosol size classes. MEMS microbalance on each stage will measure the deposited aerosol mass with a frequency of 1 Hz. This prototype will be tested and validated in Phase I and the final flight-worthy deliverable will be built in Phase II. The proposed device is expected to weigh less than 5 kg and consume about 100 W electrical power. Besides being valuable for NASA's airborne science program, this instrument will have numerous R&D and industrial monitoring applications that need real-time aerosol measurements down to 0.01 micron.","Our proposed instrument has applications in NASA's Airborne Science Program.

According to NASA Webpage https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/instrument/aircraft/Global Hawk, multiple instruments are being used for atmospheric research on this unpiloted aircraft including aerosol spectrometers based on optical signals and condensation nuclei counting. Our proposed instrument will complement the existing suite of instruments with its unique capability of classifying particles by aerodynamic size and providing a true mass distribution. Further, it will save the size-classified aerosol samples for further analysis after the end of the flight mission.","Atmospheric research programs of non-NASA government agencies would also benefit from the proposed product. Some of these programs are (i) Atmospheric System Research Program, DOE, (ii) National Center for Atmospheric Research, sponsored by NSF, (iii) Earth System Research Laboratory, NOAA, DOC.

Past rotorcraft studies have been conducted in conjunction with Electricore, Inc. and an industry prime, to develop hybrid propulsion system trade studies and develop databases for hybrid propulsion system worthy components. This knowledge will be leveraged to investigate potential areas of improvement including energy consumption, weight, overall efficiency, and safety. Implementing hybrid-electric systems could potentially remove redundant systems, reduce turbine size and allow for electrically powered emergency decent. In addition, decoupled energy management has shown potential benefits for fixed wing aircraft, allowing propulsors to be placed virtually anywhere around the aircraft. The potential benefit specific to rotorcraft may mean a broadening of configuration possibilities.","This Phase I effort adds breadth to the body of knowledge for hybrid-electric propulsion considerations specific to rotorcraft designs. These designs may have potential in benefitting NRA projects and direct NASA efforts, both internal and external. The nuances of adopting hybrid-electric propulsion have already been somewhat identified, and this efforts seeks to gain some ground in developing the same sensitivity for rotorcraft. With the development of the processes that enable the hybrid-electric rotorcraft to be analyzed and compared to baseline configurations, the potential direction of future design tools will be narrowed. Once the basics of hybrid-electric rotorcraft design and analysis are better understood, a wider variety of propulsion architectures can also be investigated. Once the analysis is better understood, more ground can be broken for investigating sizing methods, structural analysis and health monitoring considerations that have already been initiated for fixed wing designs.","The knowledge gained from this Phase I effort can help to support other companies in their hybrid-electric designs studies. As the industry pushes towards investigating hybrid-electric and all-electric designs, with the development of new technologies for electric components and batteries, an understanding of how these technologies are to be integrated and analyzed is required. The results of this effort may also guide aerospace primes and AFRL toward the identification of feasible hybrid-electric and all-electric rotorcraft architectures. The trade studies can serve to inform component manufacturers on how their technology would affect the leading edge of hybrid-electric and all-electric rotorcraft designs to guide future development.","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Development Environments; Distribution/Management; Heat Exchange; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Rotorcraft   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Relying on just one methodology for RUL prediction is unsuitable because certain methods of prediction perform better for certain use cases and conditions. Approaches must be combined to maximize accuracy. Encoding these hybrid methods is challenging because their models are complex, change frequently, and represent a wide range of devices, components, and systems. The algorithms associated with these models also require deep mathematical understanding.We propose using probabilistic programming (PP) to integrate physical models and data-driven methods into a probabilistic model that can predict RUL under the Programming Useful Life Prediction (PULP) project. We will use Charles River's Figaro™ probabilistic programming language (PPL) to fuse physical models of critical fault modes and data-driven methods in a hybrid approach to accurately predict the RUL of critical flight systems. Figaro is an ideal solution because it eases construction of Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs). PRMs can represent a wide range of complex, constantly changing domains that involve uncertainty and require flexibility. Figaro also contains a vast library of reasoning algorithms that can be applied to models, so users do not need deep mathematical expertise.","The mature research developed under PULP will provide NASA with the ability to accurately predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL). PULP will provide analysts the ability to easily integrate model-based and method-based approaches in their predictions, taking full advantage of available data and leveraging the strengths of both approaches. Primary NASA commercial candidates include many projects led by the Prognostics Center of Excellence in support of potential NASA systems health management work. Other applications cited by NASA's Discovery and Systems Health (DaSH) may also become candidates as this technology matures.","We expect the full-scope PULP framework to have immediate and tangible benefits for a number of military prognostic and health-monitoring applications.

We envision a number of commercial applications, particularly in the aerospace, aviation, and transport industries. We also plan to incorporate new PULP technology into our Figaro probabilistic modeling and analysis framework, which will enable us to use the tool to provide consulting services based on Figaro to customers within NASA, the DoD, other Government agencies, and commercial markets.

QP is an affordable, scalable, patented edge-interconnect technology for joining microchips of disparate materials and/or process technologies into monolithic-like systems that perform electrically as if they were one chip. QP enables sub-micron chip-to-chip alignment, extremely small (< 10 micron) chip-to-chip gaps, and can be implemented in multiple substrate materials, including SiGe, GaAs, Si, InP, GaSb, SiC, GaN, and more. Quilt Packaging can enable extremely low-loss, wide-bandwidth integration of MMIC modules comprising disparate material systems and/or process technologies. QP has demonstrated less than 0.1 dB insertion loss up to 100 GHz, and under 1 dB out to 220 GHz. Initial reliability testing of QP chipsets have demonstrated no degradation or mechanical issues, having undergone thermal cycling from -40 C to 125 C for over 350 cycles and counting. In addition to excellent microwave performance, QP has the potential for decreasing system size, weight and power. The proposed effort will leverage previous work in GaAs and Si QP to demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated ""quilted"" chipset of SiGe, GaAs and/or InP chips. Resulting data from this Phase I will directly apply to the design, fabrication and demonstration of a functioning MMIC module in Phase II. Throughout Phase I consideration will be given to NASA system needs and transition to production-level Quilt Package chip fabrication with commercialization partners Research Triangle Institute and Northrop Grumman Corp. for manufacturing scale-up of Quilt Packaging enabled MMIC modules.","Quilt Packaging (QP) technology advances microwave chip packaging beyond the current state-of-the-art by enabling extremely wide-bandwidth, low-loss heterogeneous integration of disparate material and/or process technologies. Implementation of QP can increase system performance while decreasing cost, size, weight and power of MMIC modules. Quilt Packaging has demonstrated chip-to-chip less than 0.1 dB of insertion loss up 100 GHz, and under 1 dB up to 220 GHz. This extremely high level of performance reduces or eliminates the need for complex ceramic substrates, additional passive devices for tuning, and eliminates tradeoffs between choosing on substrate or another due to packaging limitations. With fewer and lower losses in the MMIC chain, the overall power budget of the system can be reduced while still maintaining an acceptable signal-to-noise ration. These benefits directly address the needs of microwave and remote sensing systems for present and future NASA science missions. Given the ""across-the-board"" improvements Quilt Packaging brings to microwave and remote sensing systems, this enabling technology is anticipated to enhance the capabilities of a wide spectrum of future NASA programs.","High frequency systems are increasingly important for both aerospace and commercial applications.

NLPs allow the solution of complex optimization problems, and there exist today a number of capable NLP solvers typically used within the astrodynamics community.  Unfortunately, none of them take into account the capabilities of a high performance computer with thousands of processors, nor use the recent advances in graphics processing unit (GPU) calculation.  Many NASA optimal trajectory packages (OTIS, MALTO, EMTG) have already streamlined and optimized their own code to run as fast as possible, and it is now the serial-execution nature of the existing packages that represents the largest bottleneck.The new parallel NLP solver to be developed by CU Aerospace in partnership with the University of Illinois will represent a novel, ground-up redesign of this kind of solver.  It will be built to be transparently usable by the existing optimal trajectory solvers used at NASA; however, it will also take advantage of high performance computing and/or GPU processing to reduce the run time by orders of magnitude.  This has strong implications for NASA's mission design groups, as the time to solution for the trajectory teams will be significantly improved.  Further, an improved optimization tool will have applications across all fields at NASA which user optimization, from engineering design to cost analysis.  CU Aerospace is uniquely positioned to develop this new parallel NLP solver, with a team of experts, and the nearby proximity to the high performance computing resources at the National Center for Super Computing.","NASA currently utilizes SNOPT, IPOPT, and WORHP software packages for non-linear optimization as a plug in for tools like OTIS, EMTG and MALTO. These astrodynamics applications allow solving complex spacecraft trajectories and optimal control problems, but could greatly benefit from introducing a new parallel large-scale, nonlinear, sparse optimization solution. This new parallelized NLP technique, as introduced in this proposal, would result in a reduction in execution time, thereby reducing the optimization's turn-around time and improve communications between both designers and scientists. The integration of this new NLP solver technique will be transparent, and NASA trajectory optimization tools can be easily augmented to take advantage of this approach.Further, many non-astrodynamics NASA research initiatives depend on non-linear optimization.  This technique has applications across the entire space program, and also to much of the aviation design and research.  Optimization is a tool used in almost all design processes, and this new tool will reduce the design time spent on running simulations, using existing NASA high performance computers, saving overhead and improving the speed at which new designs can occur.","Optimization is a general tool used across government, academia, and industry alike.  The potential non-NASA applications are boundless as everyone can benefit from improved time-to-solution.  Within the astrodynamics community, companies such as Boeing, Aerospace Corp, AGI, etc. will be able to immediately replace their current non-linear optimizers with this new approach.  They will have few reasons not to, given it will be demonstrably faster and competitively priced against their current solutions, with very little necessary hardware improvements to run the solver.  Further, the optimization is not a unique field to the aerospace community, and this software will have applications in the other engineering disciplines, in economics, in marketing, in agriculture, allowing for solutions to trajectories, design problems, network configurations, portfolio analysis, etc. This is the kind of technology that will be developed because of cutting edge space-related needs, but will have far reaching benefits and appeal to all aspects of society.","Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Flight Dynamics GNC Technologies and Software   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The main problem is that failure-prone processes are often employed to overcome unfamiliar microgravity fluidic phenomena using artificial buoyancy-inducing methods. The most obvious example is a mechanical centrifuge for liquid-gas separations aboard orbiting spacecraft. To improve NASA's spacecraft fluid systems design, InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop Superhydrophilic Coatings for Embedded Capillary Systems (SPHIL-EMCAP) with anti-microbial properties. In Phase I, ISL will design and fabricate a complex capillary solution for spacecraft fluid management. The geometric design will exploit the current state of the art in analytical and computational capillary fluidics. Devices will be coated with SPHIL-EMCAP and evaluated for substrate adhesion, water contact angles, wear, and environment robustness, before testing in the relevant low-g environment to assess the improved capillary control afforded by the superhydrophilic coatings. In Phase II, ISL will downselect materials and applications, and optimize SPHIL-EMCAP's performance by refining the prototyping process and optimizing the superhydrophilic coating formulation. We will perform extensive characterization toward manufacturing a miniaturized SPHIL-EMCAP.","Long-duration space flight on ISS and on flights anticipated for the moon, Mars and other planetary missions will require hardware that is less prone to failure and generally more sustainable than the current state of the art. The spacecraft fluid systems that could benefit from control of wetting are manifold and include systems for air revitalization, water recovery, water management, habitation, cryogens, and propellants. Important and historically challenging applications include phase separations common to waste water treatment facilities (i.e., urine), condensing heat exchangers, and many other contaminating systems such as those related to plant and animal habitats, laundering and hygiene, food rehydration and dispensing, and others that are necessary to close the water cycle.","The major commercial market for SPHIL-EMCAP is micro-fluidic based lab-on-a-chip diagnostics, which is part of the larger biochip market.  Another potential market is biofilm prevention on medical and dental devices.  A number of approaches, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings, are being looked at to help solve this problem. Modification of the SPHIL-EMCAP coating for this type of application falls into the anti-microbial coatings market.  The proposed innovations offer the potential for abrasion resistant anti-fog and anti-reflection coatings on both glass and plastic surfaces. The coatings are made by industrially viable coating method suited to forming conformal coatings.

GMAT is an open source project, periodically releasing code on publicly accessible repositories.  The tool has recently been operationally certified for use planning maneuvers for the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE).The current implementation of GMAT is built on an architecture that was originally designed to support multiple parallel runs of space flight problems on a distributed processing platform.  The implementation of GMAT, to date, has not exercised the features of the design that make parallel processing available to users.  The GMAT program in its current implementation runs on a single execution thread on modern computer systems, even when those systems contain multiple processing cores that allow for parallel execution of operations.  Thinking Systems is equipped to undertake the task of coding components that plug into GMAT's base code libraries in order to produce an efficient parallelization of GMAT's capabilities.The parallelization of GMAT will be built by building replacement elements of several components of GMAT's core control engine and by implementing user scriptable elements that capitalize on these core components to provide processing on multiple threads simultaneously.  Thinking Systems will construct these components in a way that allows the parallel processing engine to run using GMAT's core library code.  The parallel engine will be built to work alongside existing GMAT code, and will be accessed using a separate user interface tailored to the parallel engine.   Examples of the types of problems that benefit from the proposed system areParametric studies using systematic changes in one or more parameters, Monte Carlo analysis problems, Large scale targeting problems, and Dispersion analysis studies","The system resulting from the Phase I and II stages of this work will provide the aerospace community with a tool designed to capitalize on evolving computer hardware systems.  The system will scale to anticipated state-of-the-art multicore technologies, run on commonly used portable and desktop based hardware and operating systems, and enable the rapid processing of compute cycle intensive analyses.NASA users of this system will benefit from a software solution incorporating GMAT's proven software components running efficiently on evolving computer platforms, capable of scaling as needed to address compute intensive pieces of analysis like: (1) Launch window analyses, providing tuned solutions over large sets of potential launch epochs,(2) Dispersion analyses, allowing modeling of many trajectories at once based on varying orbital parameters from maneuvers, environmental factors, and insertion errors, (3)Large scale targeting problems, involving many variables and goals that need to be evaluated in order to find and optimize viable orbital solutions to mission goals, and (4) Mission analyses that require precision numerical propagation of many objects simultaneously for collision avoidance in Earth orbit.Since the new components are built on the existing GMAT architecture, NASA users will also have access to the extensibility features of GMAT, including the ability to build plug-in components that can run in the parallel processing environment created by this work.","The benefits described above for NASA users of the system also benefit other users in the aerospace community.  In addition, Thinking Systems regularly receives support requests from GMAT users at industry and educational institutions.  These users ask about potential new features for the tool, including options for adding optimization algorithms, targeting of deep space missions, modeling of attitude, and parametric studies for missions to asteroids and other bodies.  This work will create a tool designed for efficient parallelization of proven GMAT capabilities for these users as well.One side benefit of the work proposed here is the cross platform approach we plan to take for the system user interface.  The current GMAT graphical user interface is only tested and debugged on Windows based computers.  Thinking Systems plans to build the parallel processing user interface using a much more stable user interface tool than is used for the current GMAT GUI.  The teams requesting GMAT support from Thinking Systems usually operate in a Linux environment, and the development of a stable and tested multiplatform GMAT interface will address the needs expressed by those teams, along with the needs of users of Mac computers.","Navigation & Guidance; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Flight Dynamics GNC Technologies and Software   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Complicating the environment in which these technologies operate is the shortage of available and interference free radio spectrum.  While the incremental advances in equipment design and performance in X, Ka bands requested in this topic may meet some of these future needs, MaXentric believes that developing equipment to provide high bandwidth communication services in as yet underutilized spectrum, namely the Inter-Satellite band 59-71 GHz, offers a higher return on investment and a more significant capability enhancement. The recent rapid commercialization of the E and V Bands (71-76, 81-86 and 60GHz) for terrestrial use  has driven the development of a large, cost sensitive market place for RF components that didn't exist even a few years ago. In this proposal MaXentric suggests revisiting the utility of these frequencies for space based high data rate communications by developing and demonstrating a high data rate transceiver for the range 59-71 GHz. As a Phase 1 and 2 participant  in Darpa's Fractionated Satellite (""F6"", 60GHz, 1Gbps) , Mobile Hotspot UAV (""MHS"", E Band, 1Gbps) and Microscale Power Conversion (""MPC"") programs, MaXentric is in a unique position to design, develop and demonstrate a small, low SWAP, high data rate, power efficient,  59-71 GHz transceiver  that could be incorporated into NASA's SCaN Integrated Network Architecture in the future.

Pump-fed systems are potentially low-mass, but a suitable high-pressure nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO/MMH) bipropellant rocket engine remains to be developed. The state of the art in NTO/MMH combustion chambers is iridium-lined rhenium (Ir/Re) manufactured by Ultramet and used by Aerojet in its HiPAT engine. In previous and current work, Ultramet has demonstrated the potential for fabrication of refractory metal and ceramic matrix composite (CMC)-lined carbon/carbon (C/C) components, thereby combining the benefits of the refractory liner with the substantially reduced weight and cost of C/C. The shortfall of using C/C as the lightweight structure is the disparity in thermal expansion, causing highly stressed components. In this project, Ultramet will demonstrate a processing route to integrally bond liners of a zirconium carbide (ZrC) CMC and of rhenium to C/C that will be applied to the fabrication of a Mars sample return ascent engine combustion chamber. Phase II will culminate in the design and fabrication of a 1000-N, 500-psi refractory-lined C/C chamber that will be delivered to NASA. To facilitate testing within project funding resources, a 22-N 500-psi refractory-lined C/C chamber will also be designed, fabricated, and hot-fire tested at one of the major propulsion system integrators (Aerojet, Moog-ISP, or Northrop Grumman), all of which have expressed interest in teaming on the project.","Successful development and demonstration of CMC- and rhenium-lined carbon/carbon for advanced liquid rocket engine components will result in a streamlined manufacturing technique that costs less and yields lighter components than current techniques. Less rhenium would be needed for a given strength, which would decrease propulsion system mass and cost. The increase in allowable operating temperature limit would improve performance and capability on future satellites and enable new missions. Application to advanced combustion chambers will result in less expensive, lighter, and more capable components than are available currently. The proposed material can be used in any NASA systems that rely on rhenium, such as NTO/MMH bipropellant iridium/rhenium apogee kick motors and advanced green ionic liquid monopropellant (HAN- and ADN-based) thrusters for satellites and planetary probe in-space propulsion and planetary and other large body ascent vehicles.

It provides a non-iterative procedure to compute, with mathematically proven guarantees even near voltage collapse, the correct operative power flow solution, to the desired accuracy. Unlike iterative methods, which are inherently prone to non-deterministic convergence failures, HELM can be used as the fundamental block for building reliable real-time network applications. The most advanced applications, which rely on optimal search techniques in the state-space of the power system and perform thousands of exploratory power flows, would be unfeasible with any of the iterative methods. This proposal addresses one of the needs of Topic S3.03, namely the need for intelligent, fault-tolerant PMAD technologies to efficiently manage system power for deep space missions. It does so at a foundational level, as it lays down the algorithmic technology that will enable a new class of real-time intelligent algorithms based on reliable, model-based computation. An example of this in terrestrial grids, which has been proven in actual deployments at some large utilities, is a Restoration plan builder, able to compute detailed restoration plans in real time, equaling or surpassing the abilities of human operators. The approach for Phase I consists in applying the new HELM power flow technology to the relevant models for the micro-grids present on current and projected spacecraft power systems, validating and benchmarking the simulation results against other current power flow technologies. This will demonstrate how this technology is better than the state of the art. By highlighting the mathematical properties of the method (unequivocal results, 100% reliability) on the models specific to autonomous DC spacecraft, we will establish the validity and also the status of HELM as the building block of future intelligent applications.","The project, when completed (Phase I, II & III) will provide NASA with: (1) Reliable and fast State Estimator that will improve grid observability; (2) Optimization algorithms for load management under variable load demand and constrained capacity, yielding reliable results that have been power-flow checked; (3) Auto-healing modules providing optimal (power-flow checked) action sequences for reconfiguration, in order to minimize brownouts and blackouts; (4) Modules for training, system design, forensic analysis, and diagnostics and identification of errors in modeling.These applications are the basic ingredients upon which a truly intelligent autonomous power system can be built. Such a system is undoubtedly a pre-requisite for successful Deep Space missions requiring long-term complex PMAD operations with minimal or no human intervention.","The achievement of managing electric power systems with minimal human intervention, with the ensuing reduction in costs and improved operational efficiencies and grid stability, will place these products as an appealing technological option to grid operators whether large or small. The technology developed for spacecraft micro-grids, with the necessary adaptations, will easily be transferred to the Smart Grid environments.

Furthermore, any on-board propulsion system capable of providing sufficiently high delta-V is likely to impose constraints on handling, storage, operations and safety that may limit consideration as a secondary payload. Ventions proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a compact, light-weight and low-cost 3U cubesat propulsion system that uses non-toxic propellants to provide approximately 125m/sec of delta-V within a 1kg and 100mm x 100mm x 100mm mass and size budget.","Currently, since all NASA cubesats are manifested as secondary payloads on launch vehicles carrying a large satellite, their deployment location is limited by the orbit characteristics of the primary payload.  This greatly constrains the ability to deploy a highly-functional cubesat in a desired location to obtain ""high-value science"" from low-cost small spacecraft.  Availability of the proposed on-board propulsion system is expected to enable significant post-deployment maneuverability, thereby allowing for much-needed orbit phasing and drag makeup capability to achieve several application-specific goals (e.g. science return).","The proposed on-board propulsion capability is also expected to allow for controlled re-entry and recovery for cubesats from orbits as high as 450km, and to enable orbit changing maneuvers in very small NRO-class missions (e.g., rapidly distributing a constellation around an orbital plane, changing overpass time of a given location in a sun-synchronous orbit, or lowering the perigee of an orbit over a particular latitude ""on-demand"" to enable improved resolution for reconnaissance missions).",Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices,Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To correct this situation, in Phase-I, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of augmenting these algorithms so that they run in real-time, with the full complement of available data for ingestion. In Phase-I we will establish detailed system performance requirements and conceptual designs that will drive the development efforts to be performed in Phase-II. This will include constraints such as the size and resource expectations for the codes, as well as the necessary interfaces and resources for the collection and storage of data sets to be used in the assimilation, and how to respond to missing or corrupted data. An assessment of costs to build a real-time assimilative modeling capability using IDA4D and AMIE, and the cost to maintain and upgrade in the future will also be provided. The research conducted in phase-i will show a clear path towards a phase II prototype demonstration.  In future Phase-II work, ASTRA will implement the augmentation of the existing IDA4D and AMIE algorithms to real-time operations, based on the conceptual designs and requirements established in Phase-I. Each requirement will be associated with a method of verification to be implemented in Phase II. The resulting data assimilative algorithms will be transferred to NASA, where they will be transformative for space weather operations. This innovation will enable the development of near real-time data-assimilative models and tools, for both solar quiet and active times, which allow for precise specification and forecasts of the space environment, beginning with solar eruptions and propagation, and including ionospheric electron density specification.","Pay-off from this SBIR investment is enormous because it utilizes already-developed and validated space weather algorithms to solve the urgent problem of ionospheric nowcasting and forecasting. The IDA4D/AMIE products will be delivered to the NASA CCMC, our first customer, in Phase-II. NASA has declared their interest in running these codes in real-time as part of a near real-time data-assimilative model, for both solar quiet and active times, which allows for precise specification and forecasts of the space environment, beginning with solar eruptions and propagation, and including ionospheric electron density specification.  We expect that NASA will ask ASTRA for help transitioning the software from TRL-5 at the end of Phase-II, to TRL-9 during a Phase-III effort. The resulting data assimilative algorithms will be transformative for space weather operations at NASA, especially for ionospheric nowcasting and forecasting. High-fidelity specifications of the ionospheric electron density, like those from IDA4D, are required by NASA for many applications, including scientific analysis, communications system operations, and mission planning. Knowledge of the electron density is relevant for projects like electrodynamic tethers, and satellite radar interferometry.

Compared with alternative UAV-deployable greenhouse gas sensors, the proposed instrument offers a 1-2 order of magnitude reduction in mass, size, and power consumption, while still maintaining sensitivity and time resolution needed for scientific missions. This drastic miniaturization is enabled by TLSC's recently patented miniature multipass gas cell and patented, proprietary low-power-consumption control, acquisition, and processing electronics for tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS).   The analyzer will feature a robust, simple design optimized to provide high stability. The instrument will be designed for deployment in the 0.1-2 km altitude region, where it can probe the planetary boundary layer and remotely investigate point sources of methane in-situ with high accuracy.","NASA's Earth Science Division leads major research efforts to understand the earth's atmosphere and its relationship with the changing climate.  These efforts include in-situ sub-orbital airborne missions to benchmark satellite measurements, provide data for modeling, and to investigate point sources of emission.  The proposed miniature CH4/H2O analyzer can be deployed on NASA UAVs such as the SIERRA and Dragon Eye to investigate point sources of methane emission.  Low altitude, high spatial resolution measurements can be used to benchmark satellite data.  Thanks to its size and low power usage, large area wireless networks of the sensor can be set up to complement coordinated NASA monitoring programs such as DISCOVER-AQ campaigns and the Los Angeles Megacities Carbon Project.  Technology developed for the instrument, such as the ultra-compact multipass cell, can also be valuable for planetary exploration.  For example the next generation Mars rover could incorporate the cell design in TDLAS gas analyzers to reduce instrument footprint.","The proposed sensor has numerous promising non-NASA commercial applications. In the oil & gas sector, the sensor can be used for UAV-based pipeline monitoring and monitoring fugitive methane emissions from drilling sites.

For observations >2 THz, technologically mature microwave sources typically have microwatt power levels which are insufficient to act as LOs for a heterodyne receiver.   LongWave Photonics is proposing to develop a compact, frequency agile, frequency locked, single mode quantum cascade laser (QCL) system.  The distributed feedback grating (DFB) QCL arrays pack multiple devices on a single semiconductor die with individual devices lasing at different frequencies.  The source will be frequency agile over 150 GHz with center frequencies ranging from 2 to 5 THz range.  The DFB QCL array will be packaged in a high-reliability Stirling cycle cooler.  The source will be frequency locked to a gas reference cell which has multiple absorption lines.  The lines are much more closely spaced than the IF bandwidth of the detector, allowing continuous frequency coverage over the tunable range.  Phase I LO power is expected to be > 1 mW with > 10 mW in Phase II.  Methods for amplitude stabilization will be investigated.","NASA applications include the use of the QCL as an LO for >2 THz receivers on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) as well as for future remote sensing missions.  Here the narrow line width (<100 kHz) of the QCLs can be used to resolve Doppler-limited low pressure gasses (~MHz linewidth).  The DFB QCL array LO would be a frequency agile, compact replacement for any gas-laser LO.  The utility of this work is enhanced by the tunable range, which is expected to be ~150 GHz, allowing for a wide range of gasses to be detected with a single instrument.","Applications for this technology include non-NASA-funded remote sensing instruments.  Applications include gas absorption spectroscopy in fundamental research.  In this application, there are currently no available frequency agile QCL sources above 2 THz with sufficient resolution to measure Doppler-limited linewidths.  Long-term applications include industrial uses for trace gas detection.

We first propose to apply techniques such as flat-field to obtain the reflectance signature (fire damage signature, for example) from the target radiance signatures in a given hyperspectral image. The target reflectance signature is then saved in a target reflectance signature library for future use. After that, to detect targets (fire damage, for instance) in new images, we will expand a hyperspectral image processing system developed by the Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL).","Automated damage assessment can be quite challenging using hyperspectral images because of influences due to weather.

The thermal management associated with these systems has been recognized as a major challenge to be overcome. ESAero's recent 2012 Phase I SBIR (NNX13CC24P) identified the radiator as a driving component within the thermal management system (TMS). Its design has profound first order effects on the weight, performance, and aerodynamic drag of the TMS, and second order effects on the weight and performance of the overall propulsion system. During the proposed Phase I SBIR, ESAero will upgrade the existing physics-based radiator design, analysis, and weight estimation conceptual design tool by improving the flexibility and fidelity of thermodynamic analysis and predicting the effects of integrating the radiator core within a well-designed duct. ESAero will call upon existing techniques to design a robust tool that more accurately predicts the ""as-built"" behavior of the component. These modifications are expected to dramatically improve the predicted weight and performance of the radiator and negate nearly all of the radiator drag by employing the Meredith Effect, as seen on the P-51 Mustang.","This tool itself is part of a larger MDAO framework for hybrid-electric synthesis, benefitting multiple NRA projects and other direct NASA efforts both internal and external. This effort further chips away at the various nuances native to hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) configurations by developing a sense of how distributed propulsion relates to thermal requirements. By developing conceptual design tools that are sensitive to coupled relationships between multiple disciplines, faster design cycles with increased depth and breadth of detail can be achieved. This module can be utilized by other tools written in the MATLAB language as it is capable of operating independent of the framework, thus allowing it to support non-HEDP aircraft designs as well. Phase II options include full HEDP integration studies including TMS considerations and potentially integrating these components and features into OpenVSP to create a more comprehensive conceptual design tool for HEDP.","As with ESAero's other conceptual design tools, the obvious commercial application of the improved radiator module is to use it and the TOGW framework it is associated with to support conceptual design groups in their research and development of hybrid-electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) aircraft. The tool may be used to guide aerospace primes and AFRL toward the identification of feasible HEDP architectures and support component manufacturers who are interested in how their technology would affect the leading edge in HEDP design and performance. AFRL would benefit as they are conducting in-house studies and supporting ESAero in other related areas.

These are comprised of well-known shapes such as horns and feathers but also include other shapes such as the scallops that are associated with swept wing icing. The development of the larger ice shapes is generally believed to be influenced or built up from smaller scale surface structures such as roughness elements which can grow into the precursors of feathers or scallops seen on larger swept wing ice accretions. Feathers and scallops are often comprised of complex interlocking geometries that can contain a large number of voids. Hence it is important to characterize the geometries of these ice shapes, not only to ensure an adequate representation of the geometry for subsequent aerodynamic effects studies but also to provide data to validate icing codes, understand the basic physics involved with the ice accretion, and provide a basis for modeling the ice accretion. To address the above issue, we propose to use an X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging method to demonstrate that X-ray CT scanning can be used to measure 3D ice features of the form seen in aircraft ice accretions. We also propose to conduct a preliminary trade/design analysis to establish directions for a more detailed Phase II study that would address specific recommendations to integrate X-ray CT imaging with icing wind tunnels which can be used at NASA Glenn and commercial aerospace companies. It is anticipated that the proposed imaging method could provide a radically new way to visualize and characterize extremely complex 3D ice shapes.","X-ray CT imaging will provide a potentially revolutionary capability to characterize and measure complex three-dimensional ice shapes. There are a number of technical questions and potential hurdles that need to be overcome. However, if successful, this technique will provide a means to measure the exterior and interior details of extremely complex over-lapping feathers and scallops. This would provide unique measurement capabilities that, to the best of the authors knowledge, have never been available in any other icing facility. It should also be noted that the authors believe that there is no fundamental limitation to operating an X-ray CT scanner in cold temperatures, down to -25C.","If the X-ray CT imaging techniques prove to be successful and if a reasonable path can be identified in Phase II to create X-ray testing devices that can be adapted for use in icing tunnels then X-ray CT imaging could impact a wide range of government and commercial testing facilities. This technique would provide an alternate means to characterize complex 3D wing icing, engine icing and icing on more complicated three-dimensional geometries that are difficult to characterize by other methods. If materials can be identified that are suitable for tunnel testing and are transparent to X-rays then the X-ray CTs could also provide a unique means to measure icing within confined geometries (such as the blade passage of a compressure).",3D Imaging; Air Transportation & Safety; Atmospheric Propulsion; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Surface Propulsion; X-rays/Gamma Rays,Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

AdvR's design is enabled by capitalizing on robust, well-commercialized, low-noise telecom components with high reliability and declining costs which will help to drive the widespread deployment of this system.  The key innovation is the combination of current telecom-based fiber laser and modulator technology with periodically-poled waveguide technology to produce tunable laser light at rubidium D1 and D2 wavelengths (and expandable to other alkalis) using second harmonic generation (SHG).  With this technology, multiple channels can be independently tuned to produce the fields needed for addressing atomic states in atom interferometers and clocks.  In addition, this technology could be useful in the development cold-atom inertial sensors and gyroscopes.","Several NASA applications include the use of a frequency doubler module to generate fixed or tunable radiation from the visible to near IR.  Poled materials offer a wider array of functionality including robust, multi-element platforms for combining tasks like frequency conversion and modulation without losing power due to additional components.  The primary beneficiary of the proposed system is NASA's GSFC team working on atom interferometry.  Atom-based inertial sensing and free space communications are other exciting new technologies that could benefit from highly efficient frequency conversion devices in this wavelength range.  Remote sensing missions like ACE that require such platforms will also benefit.  AdvR will maintain communications with these NASA groups during this Phase I effort to stay current with the present needs and remain flexible towards meeting specific application needs as technology progresses.","Nonlinear poled materials play an increasingly important role in photonics applications that may be in nonstandard wavelength regions, some of which include microwave photonics, up conversion, infrared detection, IR generation, and bio-photonics.  In addition to its use with NASA's nonlinear optical material based photonic applications, the technology will be of use for military applications, sensing and environmental monitoring, and basic research.

(ASC) has developed a number of 3D Flash LIDAR systems.  Flash LIDAR sensors are 3D video systems that return range and intensity for each pixel in real time.  ASC's Flash LIDAR has been used for autonomous berthing with the International Space Station and is currently under development for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid rendezvous mission.  Flash LIDAR is also being evaluated by JPL and NASA for Entry Decent and Landing for ALHAT and Mars. All of these applications use avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays in the camera focal plane array. APDs are complex epitaxially grown structures and biased at relatively high voltages (50-70V).  These arrays have a poor fill factor that is compensated by micro-lenses. These micro-lenses are restricted to F/#s greater than about 3.3 which in turn limits the effective receive aperture. If micro-lenses were unnecessary, an F/1 receive aperture could increase the collection area by a factor of 10 with no increase in noise.  This should result in an increased SNR of approximately 40% but, because of the simplicity of PINs compared to APDs, an increase in reliability as well.  PINs are more radiation hard than APDs, are more operationally stable (therefore do not require individual fuses to protect against the development of high dark current pixels), inherently have lower dark current (lower noise), and are inherently more uniform. In addition low-voltage FPA drive electronics is easier to design than high voltage circuitry.  These improvements will result in a more reliable higher performance array. ",This development will increase the readiness and effectiveness of 3D Flash LIDAR for NASA Commercial Applications requiring 3D navigation and situational awareness.  Some of the commercial applications that are being developed currently include ISS resupply missions.  ASC is working with the Boeing Corporation to develop a space qualified eye safe 3D Flash LIDAR for ISS rendezvous and docking.

Leveraging our SOE/ESR technology, Paragon can offer a carbon deposition resistant system capable of internally steam reforming CH4 and generating power in fuel cell mode. Minimal water is required at start up; operations are sustained by recycling water from the affluent using Paragon's spaceflight-qualified humidity control membrane technology. The system is gravity-independent and compact with no moving parts and a high single-pass utilization of feedstock. Leak-tight operations are improved by employing a new 3D glass seal approach. The system will tolerate 100s of thermal cycles in high differential pressure environments.Our Phase I effort includes laboratory tests to determine the feasibility of employing new sealing features at high differential pressure and multiple thermal cycles. Tests will also confirm simultaneous internal CH4 reforming and fuel cell operation without carbon deposition. The SOE/ESR Internally Reforming SOFC integrates cells that operate as either an electrolyzer / Sabatier reactor or a fuel cell. This simplifies operations, lowers hardware complexity, and increases reliability. The proposed system can perform multiple functions without modifications, making it a readily deployable technology for various missions from ISRU on the Moon and Mars to regenerating 100% of a crew's oxygen in habitats and space crafts.","The SOE/ESR system can be used to regenerate 100% of a crew's oxygen with only metabolically produced H2O and CO2. The SOE/ESR system can also be used in various in situ resource utilization (ISRU) processes for O2 and CH4 propellant production, for example hydrogen reduction of lunar regolith, carbothermal reduction of lunar regolith, and Martian CO2 atmosphere and ground water electrolysis. In all applications, this SOE/ESR unit can be operated as a fuel cell to, for example, power nighttime operations when solar power is not available, and provide auxiliary power to devices in the vicinity. Smaller units can be operated as a dedicated fuel cell in rovers or habitats fueled by larger in situ O2 and CH4 production plans.","The development of a SOE/ESR Internally Reforming SOFC system would allow its inclusion in several of the commercial and civil space vehicles under development. Also, it can be used in underwater research facilities, submarines, high altitude aircraft, or emergency bunkers. SOFC systems powered by easily storable hydrocarbon fuel could extend the window in which scientists perform remote field research in latitudes that don't provide sufficient sun light during winter months. The silent nature of SOFC power generation also lends itself to powering scientific equipment during wildlife observation or other sound sensitive operations.A SOE/ESR Internally Reforming SOFC could provide relief power during high energy-use periods of the day. During low energy-use periods, the system could make its own fuel in preparation for the next high energy-use period. Internally reforming hydrocarbon SOFCs present a means to generate electricity from natural gas or gasified coal. CO2 produced by terrestrial fuel cell installations is more easily captured than emissions from traditional hydrocarbon power generation equipment which presents carbon sequestration capabilities. The development of CH4 reforming catalysts can be used for the industrial scale generation of CO+H2 (syngas) which is a feedstock for the production of synthetic liquid fuel via the Fischer Tropsch process.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Storage",Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Advanced System and Technologies Inc. proposes to develop a dual-function, non-contact sensor designed to support simultaneous dynamic Doppler imaging of flow-induced structural vibration (FISV) and flow-field visualization (FFV). The ability to capture full-field non-stationary structural dynamics and correlate these data with the unsteady flow fields which drive them could elucidate, for the first time, the complex mechanisms involved in limit cycle oscillation and transition to flutter in the transonic regime. The comprehensive spatio-temporal content of data captured by the dynamic Doppler imaging system (DDIS) will be compared with predictions from computational models in the transonic regime in support of efforts to more fully address the complex interdependent relationship between structural, aero-dynamic and aero-acoustic phenomenon. We describe the core technology behind the DDIS, provide a detailed description of a practical design for deployment and show experimental data which conclusively demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. A structured work plan is presented leading to practical implementation of a demonstrator prototype in a robust and compact instrument architecture suited to ground testing, wind-tunnel and ultimately flight-test deployment.","The fusion of FISV and FFV offers a new tool for application in fundamental aeronautic studies related to ground testing, wind tunnel tests, and flight experiments. The data provided by the DDIS could provide new insights related to unsteady aero-elastic phenomena, flutter boundary prediction, computational model refinement and thus rapid evaluation of new design concepts. These empirical data are required to aid development of more accurate models for transonic aero-elasticity and flutter clearance prediction. In addition to fundamental aeronautics, the DDIS offers a diagnostic tool which would aid identification of vehicle specific aero-elastic instabilities by elucidating the spatial dynamics under operational conditions, highlighting the flow of energy between vehicle sub-structures. The computation of dynamic structural intensity (DSI) supported by the DDIS architecture permits identification of transient sources and sinks by mapping the structural energy flow in real-time.","Many wind tunnel test facilities as well as all branches of military aerospace organizations concerned with aircraft flight stability, stores deployment, and fleet airworthiness are expected to benefit from the DDIS dual functionality described in the current proposal. However, the separate functional components of the proposed system could be successfully developed as stand-alone instruments for unsteady flow-field visualization or non-linear and transient full-field vibration measurement. By adding a parallel imaging modality to laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV), the core DDIS is anticipated to find applications across a broad spectrum of industries where existing commercial LDV's are currently employed. Numerous industries (automotive, aerospace, medical, computer electronics and industrial plants) employ LDV for modal vibration analyses. In addition to modal analysis, the DDIS would target the market represented by non-destructive testing in the marine, aviation and space industries and, in particular, the non-destructive inspection in manufacture and maintenance of deployed military systems.",Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics),Ground Test Techniques and Measurement Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Amorphous cells that are in production for terrestrial application have $/Watt cost less than 10% of space cells, at about the half the efficiency.   This SBIR develops the Photovoltaic Assembly with Reconfigurable Array Structure - PARASol - a centripetal force deployment and tensioning approach that enables affordability of multi-100kW arrays with commercially available thin film CIGS cells, which can be adapted for space environment compatibility.  PARASol implements CIGS cell modules using Vanguard's THINS solar cell encapsulation technology to achieve high mass and stowed volume metrics (>500W/kg, >200kW/m3), and mount the CIGS-THINS modules onto a Membrane Solar Array (MSA) that can be rolled and folded into a compact envelope and deployed without cumbersome external deployment structure.

A variety of NASA missions being considered, including missions to asteroids, Mars, the Lagrange points, lunar surface, or outer planets need very high power to enable space mission capabilities, and for electric population, for manned spaceflight needs, and for sufficient aperture to collect sunlight in low illumination outer planet environments.  A reduction in solar array cost from $100's/Watt to $10's/Watt will make more missions affordable, and enhance their capability and reliability.  Very high power levels available affordably with such solar arrays could also enable improved space habitats, better In-Situ Resource Utilization, power beaming for terrestrial and extra-terrestrial applications, and reduced dependence on energy storage batteries.","Solar array power availability drives the capabilities and costs of many commercial spacecraft.  New ""all-electric"" spacecraft using electric propulsion to enhance mission life while reducing launch mass are driving prime power requirements to ever higher levels.  Additional power provides more transponders and improved signal strength, and allows for longer life because of the affordability of oversizing and redundancy.  The trend on commercial spacecraft being developed by Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Loral, and Orbital Sciences, among others, is for larger, higher power GEO spacecraft growing beyond 20kW.

Portable Life Support Systems for these future space suits face daunting challenges, since they must maintain healthy and comfortable conditions inside the suit for long-duration missions while minimizing weight and water venting.  We propose to develop an innovative, multipurpose garment for thermal and humidity control inside a space suit pressure garment that is simple, rugged, compact, and lightweight.  Our approach is to make simple modifications to a conventional liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVG) so that it can directly absorb latent heat as well as sensible heat.  This hybrid garment will prevent buildup of condensation inside the pressure garment, prevent loss of water by absorption in regenerable CO2 removal beds, and conserve water through use of Creare's lithium chloride absorber/radiator (LCAR) technology for nonventing heat rejection.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach by sizing the critical components for the hybrid garment, developing fabrication methods, building and testing a proof-of-concept system, and demonstrating by test that its performance is suitable for use in space suit life support systems.  In Phase II we will optimize the overall design for integration with space suit systems, produce a full-size prototype garment, and demonstrate operation in a prototypical environment.","The proposed system can be used in any future space suit, with applications that include near-Earth asteroids and Mars moons as well as lunar and Martian surface missions.  The basic technology can also be used to provide rugged, nonventing thermal and humidity control for spacecraft, manned rovers, and habitats.","There are numerous commercial and military applications for the proposed technology.

Our solution is motivated by the Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) community in commercial aviation, where the CDMnet was created back in 1997 to facilitate collaboration between airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The CDMnet continues to exist today to allow airlines to collaborate on Traffic Flow Management (TFM) decisions that are made by airlines and FAA Air Traffic Service Providers (ATSPs) every day.  Today, with the introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) flying in the National Airspace System (NAS), there is a need for collaboration between UAS, ATSP, and AOCs in UAS Traffic Management (UTM) in order to share airspace resources.  Thus, the focus of this SBIR effort is to build a network that allows UAS GCSs to share information and collaborate with airline AOCs in order to create a shared situation awareness and to share and coordinate NAS airspace resources.","NASA is tasked to explore the challenge of integrating UASs into the NAS. Part of that integration challenge is ensuring that UASs can fly in the NAS in the same airspace as civilian aircraft, without segregation through Special Use Airspace (SUA) or Special Activity Airspace (SAA). Furthermore, the FAA has stipulated that they do not want to create any new airspace classes to facilitate UAS flight in the NAS.  In order to achieve this goal, UAS will have to share airspace resources with other stakeholders; mainly commercial airlines in Class A airspace, and General Aviation (GA) in lower altitudes.  The introduction of UAS in Class A airspace is likely to cause pushback from the airlines, who already find airspace resources congested in many parts of the NAS.  NASA and the industry must find a way to share resources with UAS, Airlines, and GA in a way that they all can pursue their flight operations in a fair and equitable way.  The emphasis of this SBIR effort is to form a basis for the sharing of resources by a collaboration between AOCs and GCSs.","Airline dispatchers are in need of situation awareness for UAS flying in the NAS.  Furthermore, UAS operators will benefit from collaboration with the airlines in order to find a collaborative solution to flying in the NAS.

Currently the plastic filament materials that most 3d printers use are produced with screw-based extruders that are fundamentally designed for high volume terrestrial production from uniformly pelletized resin feedstock.  These require relatively large continuous batch sizes with significant operator inputs and have generally poor control over the produced filament geometry.  Existing extrusion machines also tend to rely on separate facilities for fully drying the material beforehand, and do not inherently provide tight flow-rate control.   The proposed effort will develop a filament extruding machine that uses a process called Positrusion that is designed from the ground up for optimally producing small batches of positively controlled round filament directly out of arbitrarily shaped scraps of ABS plastic, while meeting requirements for operation on the ISS.  The machine will accept miscellaneous ABS parts, it will dry and degas the input material before melting and extruding it through a die, and the cross-sectional dimensions and feed-rate of the cooling extrudate will be tightly controlled in a continuous analog of closed-die molding.","By enabling reclamation of materials used by NASA's on-orbit 3d printing facilities, this effort will minimize the requirements for resupplying and/or storing excess feedstock for orbital and deep space missions that utilize 3D printing for replacement parts, unforeseen needs, and planned sequential repurposing of components for progressive phases of a given mission.  The proposed effort supports the ""In-Space Assembly, Fabrication and Repair"" technical need identified in NASA Technology Roadmap 2012 TA12; WBS 2.4.1.d.","This novel process that is fundamentally better suited for reclaiming scrap material on the ISS will also be ideal for private consumers and professional users to recycle scraps from many commercial 3d printers.  Several small companies have advertised bench-top extruder machines for making filament, some even being designed to recycle scraps, but all of those we are aware of are emulations of the traditional industrial process and are not sufficiently reliable for the average user.  The Positrusion process would not be suited for high through-put industrial purposes, but it will be marketable to a large portion of the growing population of household and workplace 3d printer users to enable individuals to efficiently practice a self-sustaining 3D printer material cycle.",In Situ Manufacturing; Processing Methods,Recycling/Reclamation of 3D Printer Plastic for Reuse   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This RPS represented a continuation of 30 years of development that began in the Thermoelectrics Division of General Atomics  in the 1960's.  This system is the most efficient of its size to this day, and has been validated by extensive life testing.  We now propose to devise improvements to the design giving it increased resistance to mechanical shock.  In the Phase I we will conduct simulations to inform a trade study examining multiple options of up to 10,000 G of shock tolerance and up to 40 mW of output power.We will also build TEM modules for destructive testing to measure mechanical properties.  In Phase II, we will fabricate prototypes that use electric heaters and weights to simulate an RHU.  These will be subjected to shock testing at NASA Ames.  After iterations of design, build and test, we will present a new RPS design that offers valuable new mission capabilities to the space program.","The proposed system is a power supply about the size of a soda can which can reliably produce electric power in the 40 mW range for in excess of 20 years.  It will be hardened against mechanical shock to survive launch and impact on the surface of planetary bodies.  This will be an enabling technology for dozens of small, low cost missions for data collection throughout the solar system.","Because this RPS system relies on a plutonium-based heat source, it cannot be sold anywhere in the private sector.  However, the thermoelectric module (TEM) at its core could have widespread commercial application as an energy harvesting power source for wireless sensors.  These devices would use temperature gradients from their environment to scavenge energy and convert heat flows into electric power.  This could be a huge benefit in any application where the sensor's location makes it difficult to access for periodic battery replacement.  For example, wireless self-powered sensors and controls along air ducts in large HVAC systems could enable more energy efficient heating and cooling.  There could also be implanted medical applications using differences between skin and core temperature to produce electric power for a sensor or therapeutic device.","Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)",Power Generation and Conversion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed concept is founded on FARADAYIC® Through-Mask Etching of metallic (e.g., stainless steel and titanium) substrates to form suitable microchannel electrodes, and on pulse-reverse FARADAYIC® Electrodeposition of copper for uniform coating of the cathode surfaces.  The electrocatalytic efficiency of the copper layer will be enhanced through the use of a literature-reported oxide-reduction process. Inclusion of a suitably large density of channels should result in substantial active area in a compact form factor, while entirely avoiding the complications of packed-bed type reactors.  Faraday plans to focus development toward the ultimate use of room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs), as they afford such advantages as negligible evaporative loss, generally high CO2 solubility and low CH4 solubility, and a broad potential window of electrochemical inertness.  The particular challenge of gas-liquid separations in microgravity, where buoyant effects cannot be exploited, will be addressed through a novel centripetal application of an established spiral-channel microfluidic concept.  The envisioned system described in this proposal consists of three distinct unit operations: (1) an absorber which ""getters"" gaseous CO2 from the atmosphere using a wet room temperature IL-based electrolyte, (2) a microfluidic electroreactor which efficiently converts the CO2 to CH4 with oxygen being generated as useful by-product, and (3) a spiral-channel gas-liquid separator to remove the CH4 and O2 from the IL stream which is recycled to the absorber.","The proposed technology will create low cost, compact, robust, high-efficiency microreactor systems for conversion of CO2 to CH4, with integrated centripetal microchannel separators for gas-liquid separations in microgravity.  NASA applications would benefit from the capability for in-situ generation of hydrocarbon fuels from CO2 sourced from, e.g., crew exhalation gases or the Martian atmosphere.  The compact form factor of the proposed stackable-plate is anticipated to integrate readily into NASA space vehicles.","The proposed technology not only addresses the desire for ""ISRU processes associated with collecting, separating, pressurizing, and processing gases collected from in-situ resources including the Mars atmosphere, trash processing, and volatiles released from in-situ soil/regolith resources, into oxygen, methane, and water,"" but also provides a manufacturing route to ""highly efficient chemical reactors … based on modular/stackable microchannel plate architectures"" for efficient, low-power, in-situ conversion of carbon dioxide to methane.  Reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including CO2, is a well-established governmental and business target.  In the Sixth United States Climate Action Report, for example, the goal of ""reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020"" was noted.  Broader interest in the developed world also exists for reductions in GHG emissions.  Electrical power generation by fossil fuel combustion and industrial production all entail large amounts of generated CO2 at present.

The key characteristics include excellent mechanical properties, excellent thermal shock resistance  and ability to survive cyclic oxidation environments.  Among the CMC composites carbon fiber-SiC matrix composites offer excellent high temperature capabilities.  The highest specific strength C-SiC composites are fabricated via conventional Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI) SiC method.  There are several limitations to SOTA CVI SiC technology.  First, fixturing is required during the processing.  Secondly, transverse mechanical properties are quite often design limiting criteria, thirdly manufacturing times are very long and fourth the fabrication of very large parts is limited due to huge capital investments required for very large equipment needed to operate at very low pressure.  This proposal addresses all the above stated limitations of classical CVI.  First it offers unique 3-D preform capable of increasing transverse properties with minimum degeneration of the in plane properties.  Secondly the proposed processing eliminates the need of fixturing.  Thirdly, modified CVI SiC significantly reduces processing time.

Our plan in this Phase I effort would be to combine our UltraForm Finishing (UFF) (a sub-aperture compliant wheel and belt type polishing process for rapid material removal from the ground state to a finished optic), with our newly developed UltraSmooth Finishing (USF). USF is our sub- and mid- aperture conformal pad polishing process capable of larger area finishing and smoothing of mid-spatial frequency errors. The UFF rapidly removes residual grinding marks and sub-surface damage, while providing a robust solution for surface corrections on the required X-ray mandrels and cylindrical shells. Our USF process was initially developed for high speed finishing of hard ceramic plano components and is now producing impressive test results for smoothing of critical aspheric components. OptiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities, along with our strong university and industry partnerships, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards developing and commercializing the platforms which solve the difficult challenges associated with the fabrication of these large complex mirrors and cylindrical shells.The proposed Phase I plan will include fabrication, test and delivery of a 0.25 meter precision mirror. The part geometry will be measured with OptiPro's ""UltraSurf"" a non-contact free-form measurement system. We envision that the work done during Phase I will be extended during Phase II to hyperbolic or elliptical shaped mirror surfaces with dimensions ranging from 1 to 2 meters. This research will position us with the information needed to develop the machine platforms needed for the fabrication and test of these large NASA mirrors, which could also be a Phase II deliverable.","UltraForm Finishing (UFF) and UltraSmooth Finishing (USF) are CNC processes designed to remove grinding sub surface damage as well as mid spatial frequency errors for both relatively ""soft"" glasses as well as ""hard"" metals and ceramics for many applications. These applications may include the fabrication of forming mandrels used to produce multiple segmented shell mirrors for the International X-Ray Observatory (IXO) and (NXGO). The aspheric and freeform optical surfaces required by LISA and WFIRST will also benefit from the fabrication advances made with this endeavor. By integrating finite element analysis (FEA) tools with the UFF and USF computer aided manufacturing (CAM) interface, we will be able to optimize the fabrication process and subsequently reduce and/or completely eliminate mid spatial frequency and slope errors. The UFF has the capability to work with a wide range of traditional optical mediums (i.e., combination of belt materials and loose abrasives) in addition to a variety of sizes of wheels. The USF with its variety of pads, pad shapes and durometer is capable of smoothing a wide variety of materials for other segmented types of telescope systems such as the Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST). The wide variety of loose and bound abrasive slurries make the UFF and USF ideal for finishing hard ceramics, Silicon and SiC. The UFF has shown promise for grinding as well as polishing these hard ceramic surfaces.","Since 1989 OptiPro has developed and refined conceptual technologies into robust deterministic machines and processes for the optical fabrication industry. Non-NASA commercial applications include the fabrication of flats, spheres, aspheres, and complex conformal shapes such as aerodynamic ogive domes. Commercialization of these technologies has developed into very cost effective solutions. The combination of UFF and USF polishing tools can be used to polish a variety of materials, removing grinding marks and subsurface damage. This makes these processes excellent candidates for applications where mid-spatial-frequency and slope surface errors are an issue such as EUV lithography. Another application is for laser amplifiers, such as the Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, at the University of Rochester. For these types of applications, laser damage threshold and irradiance distribution are critical and therefore mid-spatial frequency errors need to be minimized after the polishing stage. These processes are also being utilized for many new military optical systems requiring conformal shaped optics in the very hard optical ceramics and the softer optical glasses. Producers of stainless steel injection mold inserts for military optical visors have also adapted UFF technologies.","In Situ Manufacturing; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Lenses; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Mirrors; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Processing Methods; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Optics Manufacturing and Metrology for Telescope Optical Surfaces   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Also, conventional astronomical telescopes are not compatible with operation within 5 degees of the sun, but such near-sun operation is required with the Ground-based Telescope Assembly to provide consistent and reliable wideband communications with interplanetary spacecraft. BEAM Co. proposes to develop a telescope based on diffractive optics that is expected to be far less expensive to manufacture than a telescope based on conventional reflective optics. Our approach takes advantage of the well-defined wavelength of the optical communications beam, thus allowing a high-efficiency design that is expected to be much lighter than a conventional design, thereby reducing the cost of the system that will be used to point the telescope.

Parts of this Assembly not addressed in our program are the pointing system and the optical receiver.

The main expected advantages of using the technology developed in our program, compared to other possible approaches, is much lower weight and cost of the telescope subassembly.

The sensor probes and cables must not restrict the suit or human subjects' mobility, and must not disturb the gas flow. Intelligent Optical System proposes to develop luminescence-based sensing patches for non-intrusive monitoring of critical life support gas constituents and potential trace contaminants in spacesuits. Flexible sensitive patches inside prototype spacesuits will be interrogated via optical fibers, and will not disturb the gas flow or the human subject. This will give suit engineers great flexibility for choosing multiple sensing points, fitting the sensor elements into the spacesuit, and cost effectively relocating the sensor elements as desired.","The proposed technology will apply directly to accomplishing the objectives of the NASA Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program, facilitating the rapid and effective development of novel EVA systems, and the demonstration of key capabilities for future human missions beyond Earth orbit.

The Linearized FUN3D solves a linearized Euler equation with a transpiration boundary condition using the FUN3D steady N-S solution as the steady background flow to efficiently generate a Reduced Order Model (ROM) in the form of the frequency-domain Generalized Aerodynamic Forces (GAF) matrices due to the structural modes, control surface kinematic modes and gust excitation.  The Linearized FUN3D can generate an accurate unsteady aerodynamic solution in the small perturbation sense about a nonlinear steady flow condition.  It also can avoid the moving mesh problem associated with applying the exact N-S boundary condition which requires additional computational resources, and becomes very complex in dealing with the discontinuous displacement in mode shapes such as the control surface modes for which generating a computational mesh could be a very tedious effort.  In order to enable the Linearized FUN3D to perform frequency-domain open-loop and closed-loop aeroelastic analysis and to generate a plant model in terms of state space equations, several modules in ZAERO, ZONA's flagship commercial software for aeroelastic, ASE, and gust analysis, will be incorporated into the Linearized FUN3D.  One can directly import such a plant model into MATLAB to design a flutter suppression and Gust Loads Alleviation (GLA) control system using the modern control design schemes available in MATLAB. The accurate flow field prediction of the wing pressures when a spoiler is deployed is currently beyond the capabilities of the existing aeroservoelastic codes.  The wind tunnel measured unsteady pressures on the Benchmark Active Controls Technology wing will be selected to validate the proposed Linearized FUN3D for unsteady aerodynamic prediction due to spoiler oscillations.","The proposed Phase I effort is highly relevant to on-going and future NASA projects in NASA's fixed wing project under Fundamental Aeronautics Program.  NASA's fixed wing projects involving several non-conventional design concepts such as the Truss-Braced Wing (TBW), Blended Wing Body (BWB), and Supersonic Business Jet (SBJ). Because of the BWB's flying-wing-type and the SBJ's slender fuselage designs, these designs are prone to the BFF (Body Freedom Flutter) problem. In addition, it is expected that the gust loads, on the high aspect ratio wing of the TBW configuration, will be one of the critical design loads. The proposed work will offer a computational tool to the NASA designers for early exploration of technologies and design concepts that exploit the trade-off between the passive and active approaches for mitigating the potential aeroelastic problems associated with those non-conventional configurations.","The design of an efficient maneuver, and Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) as well as flutter suppression controller requires an enormous amount of wind tunnel testing and flight testing to tune the control laws. An accurate aeroservoelastic model based on the Navier-Stokes flow equations would greatly enhance the early design of the controller and reduced wind tunnel and flight test time.  The Linearized FUN3D can provide accurate steady and unsteady aerodynamics and can be applied to many categories of flight vehicles including blended wing-bodies, joined-wings, sub/supersonic transports, morphing aircraft, space planes, reusable launch vehicles, and similar revolutionary concepts pursued.

However, it's low power throughput and poor conversion efficiency restricts the usage in practical applications.  One solution for resolving these issues is to utilize a metamaterial emitter whose thermal emission band is spectrally matched to the energy conversion band of the TPV cell.   However, typical frequency selective emitters (SE) emit only in a narrow frequency band, limiting the total power throughput of the TPV system.  This proposal thus aims to experimentally investigate wideband metamaterial emitters, whose emission band is spectrally matched and utilizes the entire energy conversion band of the TPV cell.  The innovative aspects of the proposed research are (1) to develop robust electromagnetic numerical simulation capabilities that incorporate experimentally measured material properties as a function of frequency, and device operation temperature into the design of the metamaterial emitter; (2) incorporate novel metal-nitride materials into the metamaterial structure, enabling optical property tunability through stoichiometric control, and wideband, spectrally matched thermal emission; (3) to fabricate and characterize a metamaterial emitter whose thermal emission band is spectrally matched to the energy conversion band of the target TPV cell.

A TPV-based generator will be competitive with ICE-based power generators in terms of overall fuel efficiency. The technical discussion in this proposal details why a metamaterial selective emitter will offer sufficient overall efficiency gain to enable TPV systems to be competitive with internal combustion engine generators.

Creare proposes to develop a compact, integrated dust separation and measurement system that is capable of measuring dust size distribution and removing 99% of all dust particles larger than 0.3 micron.  The two-stage separator is robust and scalable, combining the strengths of inertial and electrostatic precipitators with a novel Mie scattering sizing sensor.

For this NASA Phase I project, NOHMs Technologies will optimize our proprietary ionic liquid electrolyte and demonstrate how the electrolyte provides safe, non-flammable high-energy performance and provides Li-metal protection. NOHMs will provide full cell data and analysis to demonstrate the feasibility of our system to meet NASA's 'Far Term Mission' specific energy and energy density goals. The battery technology under development by NOHMs is capable of delivering batteries with specific energies that are three times higher than today's state of the art Li-ion battery systems. For NASA missions, this can be translated into increased operational range, functionality, or payload capabilities and significantly reduced operational cost. NASA applications.","Advanced batteries are required for future space missions. These uses include batteries for astronaut equipment and EVA suits, crew exploration vehicles, in-space habitats, surface habitats, humanoid robots, landers, ISRU, ISS astronaut equipment, life support systems, and photovoltaic energy storage.

Advanced batteries with 2-3 X performance capability are required and will enable a number of future NASA space missions listed above. Successfully deployed safe lithium-sulfur batteries would result in significant mass and volume savings and operational flexibility. For example, Astronaut/EVA equipment require high specific energy rechargeable batteries (>500 Wh/kg, >1000 cycles) that are not readily available today; 2) Human habitat power systems will benefit significantly from batteries with large storage capability and high specific energy (>500 Wh/kg); 3) Human/robotic landers and rovers require high specific energy (>500 Wh/kg) and ultra low temperature rechargeable batteries; 4) Crew exploration/rescue vehicles require high specific energy batteries (>500 Wh/kg); 5) Earth/planetary orbiters require long life (> 20 years) and high specific energy rechargeable batteries (>300 Wh/kg)","This project can provide an opportunity for the widespread adoption of high energy, safe Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries in the consumer, automotive vehicles and grid energy storage market. Li-Sulfur batteries have a theoretical storage capacity of 2.3 kW/kg and offer one of the highest theoretical energy densities among rechargeable batteries and can yield a dramatic 3-4x reduction in weight, size, and cost to present day Li-ion batteries. Mobile consumer devices require faster performance and smaller sizes for greater portability. The principal limitations for these mobile devices, battery size and weight, are functions of energy density, and the basic chemistry of lithium-ion batteries for these devices has not changed in a decade. NOHMs lithium-sulfur batteries represent a 3x improvement over the state-of-the-art and 33% improvement over next-generation lithium-ion batteries, an attractive value proposition for the company's partners and prospective customers. If the potential of these batteries can be harnessed, they are expected to disrupt current lithium ion cell technology because of their higher energy density and the low cost and wide-spread availability of sulfur.

By combining Ultramet's decades of experience in refractory metal deposition by CVD with the computer control of directed laser energy, nearly unlimited expression of part shape and metal alloy composition can be realized for next-generation rocket propulsion component fabrication. 3D additive manufacturing is currently revolutionizing many industries by offering unconstrained complex build geometries, reduced cost, reduced lead time, and reduced material usage compared with conventional manufacturing techniques. By developing laser CVD technology for refractory metals, Ultramet will bring these inherent benefits to a class of materials that are notoriously difficult to form and thus are expensive to implement. By depositing successive layers of metal directly from reactive parent gases, the system will be able to build components from rhenium, tantalum, niobium, tungsten, and their alloys with complex internal features and assembly part count reductions. In this project, Ultramet will design and build the required laser-directed CVD reactor, achieve layered deposition, and map the process conditions for the formation of rhenium metal structures.","The proposed manufacturing technology has the potential to revolutionize the fabrication of engine and hot gas path components for liquid and solid rocket propulsion. By providing the capability to build free-form parts in refractory metals, system designers will be free to pursue optimized designs for increased performance and reduced weight while simultaneously reducing the manufacturability constraints, cost, and lead time associated with such hardware. The technology will be directly applicable to the fabrication of prototype and production propulsion components.","The proposed manufacturing technology will be directly applicable to the fabrication of propulsion components for attitude control and apogee engines for commercial and government satellites and for solid and liquid divert and attitude control systems for kinetic kill vehicles.

NASA requires high power (1W) diode lasers at certain alkali atomic lines. Princeton Optronics proposes an approach to develop such lasers for NASA in this SBIR using the VCSEL technology.

The measurements of the local shear stress has long been a difficult measurement in an air-flow environment due to the interaction between the sensor and air flow. In order for modern researchers to further improve the efficiency of aircraft and other aerodynamic bodes, sensitive measurements in the smallest scale possible are required. To achieve this goal, the measurement community has turned towards micro-electrical mechanical systems which utilize microscopic moving parts to directly measure the shear stress. Unfortunately the cost, sensitivity, and packaging have proven to be insurmountable challenges in sensor development. Our company proposes a paradigm shift in shear stress measurements that will take advantage of the complete sensing package offered in MEMS without the need for moving mechanical parts or expensive manufacturing. Our patent pending sensor will allow us to measure the shear stress at a wall using microfluidic principles and fluid-structure interactions.  In our proposed sensor, highly sensitive electrochemical measurements measure the vibrations induced in a membrane by the external shear stress.  Because of the nature of electrochemical measurements, the relationship between size and sensitivity is reversed compared to MEMS sensing methods. As our sensor decreases in size, the current change induced in the system increases, resulting in a sensitivity limit imposed only by manufacturing limits. We believe that this sensor will have the ability to obtain real-time shear stress measurements across the range of external air flows. Due to the absence of moving parts within our proposed system, we believe that the sensor will be significantly more robust and durable for many different applications. At the conclusion of this project, we expect to move this technology from TRL-2 to TRL-4.","The principal application to this sensor is in a wind tunnel environment.  To date, there has been no other shear stress sensor that has offered sensing at the micron scale, while achieving accuracy independent of air quality and environmental factors.  Our proposed sensor will help experimentalists measure and minimize important design considerations such as skin drag.  Additionally, the increased information at the surface of aerodynamic bodies will help the computational fluid dynamics community validate and refine their models. Another possible application could be real-time shear stress measurements for morphing wing control systems. Wing designs which change shape depending on conditions are a new branch of research in the aerospace community. Real time shear stress measurements could become an integral part of these wing's control systems. With the proposed designs and our proposed sensors, wings could change their aerodynamic characteristics based on real time information from our sensors. Skin drag accounts for over half of airplane efficiency losses and a 5% increase in efficiency could have billions of dollars in fuel savings. Historically, skin drag has been difficult to measure locally due to measurement interference with important variables.  Our sensor has little to no interaction with the external air flow, therefore giving the most pure measurement of shear stress as the smallest scale.","Once our sensor concept has been proved, we expect to be able to extend the shear stress measurements to watercraft. This could have a profound effect on ship and submarine design and ultimately increase their efficiency.  As with the aerospace community, a small increase in efficiency could save billions in fuel costs. Another possible application could be in the energy industry. Coal, gas and nuclear power plants could benefit from pipe flow optimization or real time shear stress measurements. The monitoring of shear stress at a wall of a pipe could be the first indicator of corrosion or other fouling within the cooling system.","Acoustic/Vibration; Aerodynamics; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport)",Ground Test Techniques and Measurement Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Light enters through the top of CropGlass and is reflected back upward.  Total internal reflection keeps the light inside CropGlass and the majority of the light is directed laterally through CropGlass and then downward onto the overlapped cell area.CropGlass is a very low risk technology, as it is made from entirely flight heritage materials, it is low profile and it has no moving parts.  Additionally, CropGlass leverages mature nano- and micro-fabrication techniques which will result in a low cost for high volumes.CropGlass offers the ability to increase power or decrease cost without influencing other solar array design parameters.  Very large solar arrays will benefit most because of the huge power levels and cost of these programs.  Because CropGlass can be added to a complete array, this innovation will also be beneficial to completed solar array programs that experienced less than anticipated power or increases in needed power late in the manufacture of the solar arrays.Competing approaches include reflective concentrators such as panel edge reflectors.  What makes crop glass unique is that it is flat, requires no deployment of optics and does not require a custom solar panel or blanket design.  No existing concentration technology offers such a low cost, low risk and flight heritage-based path to higher power and lower cost.CropGlass concentrates light at less than 3x.  Past industry attempts at concentration above 10x have shown many engineering challenges at these high concentration levels.  These challenges include heat rejection, outgassing of concentrator material and power loss in off-pointing.  Conversely the industry has heritage of successful concentration at lower levels.","We expect direct commercialization after Phase II for this technology, by leveraging the flight-heritage of CropGlass materials and the experience of our commercial partner.

The system can be used in both ground and flight test facilities.  The proposed system uses a very robust and proven sensor technology combined with a novel mounting and manufacturing technique.  The sensor array is reusable and can be produced in a configuration that requires no external power, acquisition or viewing, for flight test applications.  The system combines an array of small, surface flush, sensors embedded in an extremely thin, flexible polyimide strip.  The system operates by sensing changes in local heat transfer within the boundary-layer.  Variations in heat transfer coefficients due to the state of the boundary layer (laminar, transitional, turbulent, separated regions) produce changes in the sensor output.  Other flowfield features where heat transfer is affected will also be discernable, such as shock waves.  The flush mounted sensors, embedded in a smooth, thin polyimide sheet, conform to the local surface contour and produce minimal aerodynamic interference, allowing non-intrusive measurements.  The system will be quantitatively accurate across the low-speed through supersonic flow regime.  After testing, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  Compared to current systems designed for similar measurements, the proposed system promises to provide a significantly more robust and efficient system in a relatively simple, cost effective package.","A robust measurement system capable of determining transition location, separation, and shock locations for both flight and ground test facilities has significant potential application at several NASA centers, and across a wide range of NASA facilities.  The accurate determination of boundary-layer transition and separation locations can be used to validate computational fluid dynamics models, transition prediction, and multidisciplinary analysis and optimization tools.  The system could be used in boundary-layer ingestion and optimization efforts.  In a more permanent set-up, the robust measurement system could be used as input for vehicle adaptive control in uncertain environments or adverse conditions, or for closed loop flow control for aircraft, rotorcraft, or high lift technologies.  The measurement system's relatively simple, robust technology, coupled with its reusable nature make it a very attractive, cost effective system.

Research to date has focused on propulsion, batteries, sensors and autonomous control laws, but little attention has been paid to acoustic characteristics.  The generation and propagation of noise associated with small VTOL UAVs are not well understood and prediction tools have not been developed or validated for this class of vehicles.  Since public acceptance of these vehicles is crucial to their future in civilian roles, it is imperative that NASA acquire the analysis tools and an adequate understanding of the acoustic characteristics associated with these aircraft.  The objective of the proposed effort is to create a base of experimental data to characterize the noise generated by this class of vehicle and then to use this data to evaluate and enhance existing rotary-wing design and analysis tools in this area.","The proposed effort directly responds to NASA's SBIR solicitation goal to ""develop and validate tools, technologies and concepts to overcome key barriers for rotary wing vehicles"" citing in particular an objective to ""develop design and analysis tools for the prediction of acoustics for small vertical lift UAVs.""  The proposed effort will provide valuable test data characterizing the acoustics generated by small VTOL UAVs – an area where current test data is sparse.

The Venus Drill and Trencher will be hybrid systems capable of acquiring surface and subsurface regolith as well as pulverized rocks (i.e. cuttings) from depth (the exact depth will be driven by the science requirement). The drill and the trencher unique sample delivery system will be able to transfer samples as they are being acquired, directly into the science instruments. Hence, these systems could be a single deployment system – it will have to drill/cut down once to deliver samples, and never retract. If the Venus Drill and/or Trencher will be deployed from a robotic arm, the system could be used multiple times. If the Venus Drill or the Trencher will be body mounted or mounted to a single degree of freedom system (spring deployable single action arm), it would be deployed once. Depending on the deployment requirements, the Drill and the Trencher could require just one actuator, while the remaining degrees of freedom (lowering the system to the ground and/or deploying the system some distance from the lander) could be achieved by a set of springs and hinges.","NASA applications for this technology include sampling of surface regolith (i.e. 'vacuum cleaner suction mode') as well as the subsurface soils and rocks on Venus. The sample delivery system is an integral part of both the drill and the trencher. Hence, there is no need for any additional sample transfer hardware e.g. a robotic arm with a scoop, etc. The successful completion of the proposed effort would be essential to a New Frontiers Venus mission proposal as it would offer significant new opportunities for improved science, data gathering and operational life. In addition to Venus applications, the drill and the trencher with the sample delivery system work in any other environment that has an atmosphere (e.g. Titan with the atmospheric pressure of 1.5 atm). Because of Titan's lower temperature (~100K), there will be no need for HT motors and associated HT materials, and hence the system would have to be redesigned for lower temperature (e.g. actuators would need heaters, etc.).","Non-NASA applications include any scenarios that require acquiring a sample from hot and often hazardous locations. For example, the proposed sampler could be used to robotically acquire samples from walls of nuclear reactors to determine the extent of radiation damage. Since the proposed drill is small, it could be mounted at the end of COTS robotic platforms such as iRobot's PackBot, Qinetic's Talon, or Remotec's Andros. Samples of topsoil are also required in war zones to determine if the location has explosives or other contaminants. The drill with sample acquisition and delivery system could be packaged into a stand-alone sampler-analyzer system (e.g. XRF/XRD or a GC/MS could be integrated with the drill). Hence, the robotic device could drive to a location of interest, acquire surface and subsurface samples, and analyze them in situ to determine if the location has buried explosives.

Novel, linear drive, eddy current methods are proposed that incorporate innovative sensor array constructs, physics-based models, and multivariate inverse methods to nondestructively assess temperatures for carbon-based TPS materials such as felts and PICA.  The sensors can be mounted behind the TPS material or embedded within the TPS with sensing fields that are projected through the material to the far surface interface.  Thermally induced changes in the electrical properties of the TPS material are then used to determine the temperatures.  In Phase I, the focus is on establishing feasibility by demonstrating correlations between electrical properties measured by the eddy current sensors and the TPS temperature.  It will also investigate adaptation of the sensor materials to support sustained and transient operation at high temperatures compared to typical operating conditions for standard eddy current sensors.  JENTEK's physics-based methods for diagnostics of layered media using MWM-Array technologies have been demonstrated in scanning configurations for coating characterization, corrosion detection and sizing with and without interference layers, and condition and thickness assessment of felt-based TPS materials.  These methods have also been extended to surface mounted sensing applications such as torque, fatigue, and heat treatment condition monitoring.  JENTEK delivered the MWM-Array solution used by NASA KSC on the Space Shuttle leading edge to detect damage of the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) thermal protection tiles; thus after establishing the property correlations with temperature, JENTEK is well-positioned to deliver a novel method for temperature monitoring of TPS materials and material condition monitoring at elevated temperatures.","If the program is successful, it will demonstrate the capability of the MWM-Array technology to monitor electrical conductivity and temperature of materials that are exposed to high temperature conditions.  This type of monitoring tool could support monitoring during ground-based tests of thermal protection system materials; later versions with dedicated instrumentation designed for reduced size and weight with a potential implementation on spacecraft is also possible.  Other structural applications that could take advantage of this type of projected-field, high-temperature, monitoring solution includes carbon-carbon rocket nozzles, Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, exhaust nozzles, and space probes.  Other NASA customers which could use this technology include the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) spacecraft manufacturers and other interplanetary programs such as science exploration mission vehicles and human crew vehicles.","There are numerous applications that could use a high temperature monitoring capability.  One is manufacturing quality control and high temperature process monitoring.  This includes heat treatment or annealing processes that are commonly performed on metals.  In-situ monitoring of the electrical conductivity and/or magnetic permeability would offer a real-time assessment and process control capability.

The Phase I effort will focus on developing several key engines, including parameter-varying aerodynamic ROMs (AeroROM), structural dynamics ROM, as well as a scheme to integrate the AeroROM, structural ROM, sensor, actuator, and control law for integrated ASE analysis in the entire flight envelope. A modular software framework will be established for automated data exchange, PV AeroROM and structural ROM generation, ROM integration, computation, and verification. The feasibility of the proposed technology will be demonstrated for several ASE test problems of NASA interest (e.g., Aerostructures Test Wing and X-56A MUTT). The Phase II effort will focus on: (1) ROM engine optimization in terms of functionality, execution efficiency, and automated parameter selection; and (2) software environment enhancements with direct interfacing to NASA-relevant simulation and controller design tools, and fully automated ROM process for technology insertion and transition; and (3) extensive software validation and demonstration for ASE and flight control analysis of realistic aircrafts of current NASA interest.","The proposed technology will provide a fast and accurate analysis tool for aeroservoelastic simulations of aerospace vehicles and aircrafts. NASA applications of the technology include: (1) rapid and computationally affordable analysis for optimal aerodynamic and structural design of aerospace vehicles; (2) development of advanced, reliable aeroservoelastic control strategies (such as controlled maneuver, and aeroelastic instability control, e.g., buffet, flutter, buzz, and control reversal); and (3) arrangement of test procedures for rational use of instruments and facilities.

The loss of reliable information for even a single state feedback signal can easily initiate a chain of events that leads to an accident.  Even when hardware redundancy is employed, common-mode failures are a significant hazard that can make hardware redundancy ineffective for achieving the desired system reliability. For example, multiple pitot tubes can experience a common-mode failure during an icing event, depriving the pilot of vital airspeed information. The proposed virtual redundancy approach can significantly improve flight safety by identifying failed sensors and estimating the correct output values as replacements for those failed sensors.  Estimates are based on a rigorous statistical formulation that makes optimal use of all available information including feedback from all remaining physical sensors, nonlinear models of vehicle dynamics, and models of actuator and sensor responses. The proposed research will also develop strategies for enabling pilots to make effective use of the virtual sensor outputs, including guidance algorithms that identify a trajectory that maximizes the likelihood of maintaining safety of flight and cueing techniques that allow the pilot to follow the resulting trajectory while minimizing the increase in workload.","The proposed innovation directly addresses several key needs identified under the Aviation Safety Topic, particularly with regards to safety assurance under unanticipated conditions. The proposed technology is designed to assure the integrity of information required for safe aircraft operation in the presence of multiple sensor failures. It utilizes information from all available sensors and high-fidelity models of the aircraft system to detect, isolate, and mitigate sensor failures in real time. In addition, it incorporates real-time flight safety management components to evaluate flight safety risks associated with the particular failure scenario, determine an optimal response to ensure a margin of flight safety, and provide pilot cueing to enforce those safety margins.","For potential non-NASA commercialization, Barron Associates will pursue additional development funding from other agencies and DoD to help further advance the technology.  Then, once high TRLs are achieved, we will team with industry partners, makers of unmanned air systems, large airframers, and sensor manufacturers to develop integrated software/hardware sensor suites that include the developed virtual sensor tools.  This will lay the foundation to pursue marketing avenues of the technology in the aerospace industry, including manufacturers of unmanned aircraft, military aircraft, and both commuter and large commercial transport aircraft.

The operating margins on these flight systems are limited by non-linear unsteady phenomena such as stall, flutter, gusts, limit cycle oscillations, vortex roll-up which exhibit strong coupling between the aero-loads and structural deformations. The use of high-fidelity time domain methods such as CFD/FEM during the design phase has been limited by the cost of computing the unsteady physics. In this proposal researchers from CRAFT Tech and Georgia Tech offer a collaborative inter-disciplinary design optimization approach to aeroelasticity problems with high fidelity aerodynamics analysis and structural dynamics. This approach is primarily feasible because of the development of a novel unsteady analysis procedure that reconstructs the unsteady dynamics with high accuracy and nominal cost. The reconstruction procedure combines CFD and FEM with a modified Proper Orthogonal Decomposition method and an Artificial Neural Network to simulate the unsteady aeroelastic features associated with different shape designs with good reliability. Furthermore, the process of reconstructing the unsteady solution permits the incorporation of control strategies and time variant system responses making it appealing for the aeroservoelasticity class of problems.","The design tools developed have wide applicability at NASA. The primary focus of the proposal is related to the design of flexible wing configurations used in HALE class of flight vehicles. However, the technology can have a significant impact on NASA's fixed wing program in guiding design of ultra-high bypass ratio engines and open rotor propeller systems from an aeroelasticity perspective. The smaller blades that are used in the ultra-high bypass ratio engines have very different aeroelastic characteristics and threshold criteria for fatigue and structural failure from traditional engines. The modern open rotor propeller systems are designed as a twin rotor configuration where there is significant interaction between the forward and aft rotors making the blades susceptible to flutter.  Lastly, boundary layer flow distortion in BWB configurations can result in large dynamic pressures on fan blades in the embedded engines resulting in the increased risk of flutter.","One of the biggest beneficiaries of this technology would be the wind energy industry. Wind turbine blades are susceptible to aeroelastic effects and the problems are compounded in wind farms and sites close to the ocean where wind gusts are prevalent. The rotorcraft industry directly benefits from this technology as it can be used in the design of rotor blades where retreating blade stall is a big concern. Other commercial applications include gas turbine technology, commercial pump companies and the aerospace industry.","Aerodynamics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Structural Efficiency-Aeroservoelasticity   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

TDA Research Inc. proposes to develop a compact, lightweight, advanced sorbent-based compressor to recover high-pressure, high purity CO2 from the Martian atmosphere. The system eliminates the need for a mechanical pump, increasing the reliability with relatively low power consumption. TDA's system uses a proprietary sorbent that selectively adsorb CO2 at 0.1 psia and regenerates by temperature swing, producing a continuous, high purity CO2 flow at pressure (> 15 psia).  The objective of this Phase I research is to develop a high capacity, regenerable CO2 adsorbent that maintains its CO2 capacity and mechanical integrity over extended adsorption/desorption cycles. We will optimize the sorbent formulation and conduct a minimum of 100 complete adsorption/regeneration cycles for our best sorbent formulation.  We will carry out a design of the adsorbent-based CO2 compressor and demonstrate the technical feasibility of the concept and quantify the logistics savings.","The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact and energy efficient adsorbent based solid-state CO2 compressor system to collect and pressurize CO2 from the Martian atmosphere.

By reducing or eliminating the need for a conventional gas compressor, both the crew habitat noise level and required storage pressure for important Air Revitalization (AR) gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, are reduced by using this technology.  In addition, with slight modifications, the same concept can be used to serve as a regenerable hydrogen gas purifier.  In either application, the penetrative nature of microwave heating is utilized to efficiently drive gas desorption from physical sorbents.  For the compressorless gas storage application, the microwave desorption step supplies pressurized gas to downstream processes.  Similarly, for application as a hydrogen purifier, microwave heating drives off captured contaminants from the sorbent bed (which is held at relative vacuum) during regeneration.  Potential contaminants present in the hydrogen stream include water vapor, carbon monoxide and various hydrocarbons (including methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene).","The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future manned missions.

In addition to manned exploration vehicles, this technology could be used as the thermal control system for any spacecraft or satellite designed to operate in deep space.  The flexibility of the proposed concept allows for thermal control systems that can meet specific mission needs by varying the configuration of the LHPs.  The proposed VHR/mLHP radiator is well-aligned with the NASA Strategic Roadmap (TA14 Thermal Management Systems) as it can be applied to a broad range of spacecraft and satellites that need variable heat rejection.","The technology developed in this SBIR is directly applicable to military, scientific or commercial satellites where precise temperature control is required.  The proposed concept is commercially attractive, as it builds upon proven technologies and offers high-reliability, minimal mass and low power.

Our proposed SCAN tool is designed to provide an on-orbit analysis of suspension samples to support studies of bone and muscle loss, multi-generational species studies and cell and plant tissue per NASA SBIR topic description H.10.02. The SCAN tool technology would function as follows: A disposable cartridge specific to a targeted biomarker is inserted into the SCAN tool.  The user introduces a cell suspension sample into the cartridge. Cells presenting target antigens bind specifically to corresponding antibodies fixed within the cartridge flow path.  The number of bound cells is detected optically by the SCAN tool and is reported to the user on a display screen within several minutes.  The cartridge is removed, disposed and replaced after each measurement.We propose to heavily leverage our experience gained from the On-Orbit Immuno-Based Label-Free White Blood Cell Counting System with MEMS Technology (OILWBCS-MEMS) Phase I and Phase II SBIR contracts (completed August 2012) for this effort. The OILWBCS-MEMS benchtop evaluation setup will be used as a test platform, and the hand held SCAN tool design will use OILWBCS-MEMS as a point of departure.  The major difference between the two is the surface chemistry required to target the biomarkers of interest.  By building upon a successful project, we continue to make use of NASA's considerable prior investment.  Our prior effort also enables us to quickly mature this technology to high TRL (proposed TRL 6-7) by the end of Phase II.","In general, any existing immuno-based cell biomarker detection desired for on-orbit research and development could be accomplished with the SCAN tool.  The SCAN tool offers the ability to quantify differences between samples in the concentrations of cells presenting specific biomarkers. For example, it could be used to detect concentrations of differentiated adult stem cells over time using cell biomarkers (on cells cultured on beads or in suspension).  It could also be used detect cell viability during on-orbit drug transfection and toxicity testing.  In addition it may be possible to use the SCAN tool for enrichment purposes by capturing and releasing cells with specific biomarkers.  Unlike methods such as qPCR, immunohistochemistry or ELISA requiring disruption of cells by lysis and fixation, the SCAN tool operation offers detection of biomarkers without cell disruption.  SCAN tool is conducive to on-orbit operations because it requires minimal crew time and expertise, and small sample size.","Besides NASA's on-orbit application, the SCAN tool could be used by biotech and medical industries to perform non disruptive immuno-based cell biomarker detection, similar to that done by flow cytometry.  In general, any existing immuno-based cell biomarker detection required for research and development, could potentially be accomplished with our proposed approach which offers compact size, low power consumption, low cost, and full automation.  The required modification for each new application would be development and verification of surface chemistry for different biomarkers. Advancement of the SCAN tool to additional cell types could potentially reach into the flow cytometry market.  We believe we could offer significant cost savings: given that this is a cartridge-based system, mass-production of these cartridges (after initial development of the surface chemistry) could bring costs to as little as $10 per test, compared with approximately $250 per test for flow cytometry.The SCAN tool would be particularly suited as a tool for increasing efficiency of biomarker detection in a research lab where, rapid accurate diagnosis is highly desirable, as are, portability, ruggedness and containment, all of which are also required features of the SCAN tool.",Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors),International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Specifically, one of the key interests in Topic A1.04 are proposals for Remaining Useful Life prediction techniques.  In response, Nokomis is proposing to develop an Electronic Health Monitoring (EHM) Sensor Unit which would be able provide accurate estimates of the Remaining Useful Life of avionic systems.  This sensor module would identify changes in the unintended electronic emissions of various flight-system electronic components to determine the current health state and predict the future reliability of the scanned system.  Designed as a handheld unit which would allow for system scans of components while installed in the aircraft, the EHM Sensor Unit would be capable of scanning and returning results in as little as 3 seconds per system scanned.  This speed would allow for frequent maintenance monitoring, including during the brief turnaround periods experienced at the gate.  This technology would allow NASA, as well as flight-system and aviation maintenance providers, to better monitor the electronic health of these critical avionic components, as well as better predict their future lifespan, allowing for systems to be repaired or replaced prior to an unanticipated failure.","The intended application is to augment the Aviation Safety Program's (AvSP) ability to improve upon overall aviation safety throughout the industry.  These sensor systems would meet the AvSP goal of seeking capabilities furthering the practice of proactive safety management.  This technology would provide the AvSP with a powerful useful tool for the determination of Electronic Health and prediction of Remaining Useful Life of avionics.  Additional applications within NASA extend to the Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) and Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD).  Both the  IVHM and ESMD applications for this technology would extend to the monitoring of Electronic Health of systems in both manned and unmanned space vehicles.  For unmanned vehicles, the proposed technology can be adapted as an integrated sensor, while manned vehicles could support both an integrated and the handheld systems.","Other potential applications outside of NASA and the aviation industry include any industry where premature detection of potential electronic failure would be of benefit.  Specifically, high-reliability industries, such as the defense, space, medical, and automotive electronics industries would be able to immediately apply this technology.  Defense applications extend to the periodic monitoring of long-term storage weapon systems, as well as maintenance monitoring of avionic systems.

From these individual particle characteristics the total liquid water content (LWC) and the total water content (TWC) of the flow may be found. This non-intrusive, laser-based, point measurement diagnostic will operate in an off-axis, backscatter configuration at a range of working distances appropriate to characterize laboratory-scale experiments, icing tunnel flows, free jet test facilities, or flight conditions at altitude.The proposed instrument will apply phase-Doppler interferometry, polarization ratio phase discrimination, droplet rainbow thermometry, and cross-polarization imaging to each particle measured. This will provide joint measures of liquid/solid phase, velocity, diameter or particle size, and droplet temperature. Furthermore, there is redundancy built into the measurements. For instance, the droplet diameter can be measured both by phase-Doppler interferometry and by rainbow thermometry and all four measurement techniques can discriminate solid ice from liquid droplets. While no single instrument can measure all possible cloud droplets, the proposed instrument can be configured to measure droplets from as small as 3 um to larger than 3 mm in diameter.","This SBIR effort will lead to a fully-developed instrument capable of simultaneously and redundantly measuring multiple physical properties of droplets and ice crystals. NASA's research into flight safety and aircraft propulsion would benefit from the successful commercialization of this instrument. Other governmental, academic, and industrial research groups in the areas of aircraft and flight safety, air-breathing and rocket propulsion, transportation, spray drying, and other industrial processes would all stand to benefit from a diagnostic capable of exceptional phase discrimination and/or remote droplet diameter/temperature measurement.There are several possible paths to commercialization of this work either as improvements on our current commercial products as entirely new products.","This innovation will be offered as an option to our current PDI products.  We believe there will be demand in industries such as spray drying and deposition, painting and coating, and general multi-phase flow research.  While of obvious interest to meteorologists and icing researchers, we believe that the larger market is that of spray combustion, propulsion, and transportation. Moreover, there are a wide range of food processing applications using spray drying. Efficient energy utilization and product quality are key concerns in these applications.Within the meteorology and icing research markets there is potential to create two separate product lines. Some researchers will prefer an in situ device that can be placed in a large wind tunnel flow or mounted to an aircraft exterior. Others may prefer an ex situ instrument that canbe placed outside of the flow – the solicitation specifically mentions the profiling across the span of an engine duct. The proposed diagnostic methods are all suitable for both styles of measurement. Furthermore, since the proposed layout involves the use of backscatter collection,such an instrument could be deployed from within an aircraft's fuselage and pointed out a window with no impact on the flow or external mounting requirements. Such an instrument configuration could move beyond a research tool and be used as a real-time flight safety instrument to characterize the icing threat to the airframe.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Lenses; Mirrors",Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In the proposed program, we will develop an unobtrusive wrist worn monitor that places minimum burden on the crew in operating the device. The device, once worn, requires no action from the crew and automatically records and analyzes actigraphy and sleep data. The device will have battery life of about one year and wireless data transfer so the crew will not be burdened with recharging the device and downloading data from the device. The monitoring device will provide real-time feedback on the level of activity and duration and quality of sleep. The proposed device is based on an existing sleep and activity monitor which we will modify and enhance to make it suitable for use in spaceflight environments. Data format, including epoch length and sleep statistics provided by the proposed system will conform to formats currently used in sleep research. In Phase 1, we will deliver a set of fully functional devices that can be deployed in spaceflight analogs. We will also perform feasibility studies of a Phase 2 unit, which will measure, in addition to sleep, activity and heart rate, other physiological parameters such as heart rate variability, blood pressure, vasoconstriction, pulsewave velocity, and electrodermal activity.

From the mission designer perspective, this process is divided into two primary tasks: (a) the identification of candidate startup arcs, and (b) the subsequent refinement of those solutions, via targeting or optimization processes, to meet some pre-defined mission requirements. The work proposed here seeks to address the first aspect directly, while addressing the second indirectly, using NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) as the underlying demonstration platform. Phase I of this effort is focused on developing a prototype for an Interactive Visual Analytics Tool (IVAT) for GMAT. The goal of the IVAT module is to provide a modern, interactive, preliminary design tool that allows analysts to more efficiently explore and mine the space of candidate solutions prior to selecting a specific mission for the refinement phase. The development leverages GMAT's Advanced Path Planning (APP) and Dynamical Systems Analysis Toolbox (DSAT), developed by DECISIVE ANALYTICS Corporation (DAC). IVAT is envisioned as a preliminary design tool that can be readily integrated with gradient based optimal or sub-optimal refinement tools, such as but not limited to those provided by GMAT. However, for this effort we focus on GMAT as our selected technology demonstration platform.","IVAT's goal, over the course of Phase I and II, are first to facilitate the process of simultaneously considering and analyzing large data sets of candidate solutions by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space and displaying them on a versatile and navigable interactive map and second to allow the analyst to map selected points back to their corresponding trajectory arcs, and assemble a coherent arc for subsequent refinement based on the selected candidates. Our technology demonstration integrates IVAT with GMAT, but IVAT is generally designed to further support stand-alone operation. The flexibility of the software architecture provides two paths toward commercialization of the software itself: Leverage our existing partnerships with well-known software vendors to integrate into commercial-off-the-shelf astrodynamics planning tools, and/or seek direct program dollars to further enhance the tool as a component of GMAT to meet the needs of specific NASA missions. We will also seek services revenue to provide subject matter expertise in the application of the tool directly through dedicated Phase III contracts or through partners with existing support contracts.","Through partnership with vendors of well-known commercial-off-the-shelf software tools in this technology area, we expect that we can access at least three key non-NASA markets: 1. United States Department of Defense, which will have its own mission planning needs in parallel to NASA's; 2. Foreign sales (subject to compliance with all appropriate ITAR restrictions); and 3. Private sector space operators. DECISIVE ANALTYICS Corporation has existing business campaigns in each of these areas that will further support commercialization of the technology developed under this solicitation including relevant performance with the U.S. Air Force and an International Sector with active contracts in Asia and strong ties to NATO. As in the NASA market, our overall commercialization approach will consist of a mix of sales of software itself with labor hours provided as subject matter experts in the mission planning area. In addition, we will explore markets beyond space mission planning specifically leveraging the fact that the Poincare mapping approach is a mathematical technique applicable to any dynamical system. This will include specific applications of dynamical systems theory in other problem domains in addition to the potential to provide it as a general tool as, for example, as third-party product for Matlab.","Analytical Methods; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Flight Dynamics GNC Technologies and Software   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

With this approach, sensitive trace gas detection in a robust, compact and low-power package has been achieved. In work to-date, we have demonstrated the capability of this TT-FMS concept in a single channel. In the proposed project, we aim to demonstrate multiplexing of TT-FMS to provide simultaneous, real-time measurement of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In addition to demonstrating the extensibility of TT-FMS, the Phase I project would address key performance limitations encountered in early feasibility work. The objectives of Phase I are to: - Implement and test polarization management during phase modulation to reduce baseline variation induced by observed in previous work, - Build a two-channel TT-FMS with breadboard components, - Establish baseline (single-channel) performance of TT-FMS when polarization maintaining phase modulation is included, - Calibrate and evaluate the full AMGUS (two-channel, TT-FMS) apparatus.Accomplishment of Phase I objectives would yield a benchtop technology ready for transition to a UAV-compatible AMUGS prototype in Phase II.","AMUGS will meet NASA's needs for airborne measurements of carbon dioxide and methane.

The compact wrist-worn device includes sensors to collect sleep metrics and will also serve as a wireless hub to collect real-time physiological data from other body-worn sensors (e.g., heart rate, EEG). It will use standardized wireless communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth) to automatically uplink data to the ISS network (no astronaut time required). Data will automatically be integrated into medical operations support systems (e.g., BHP-Dashboard) to provide immediate feedback to astronauts and flight surgeons to aid in decision-making relative to astronaut medical, behavioral health and performance issues. During Phase I, we will develop an enhanced STARwatch, integrate data from other body worn sensors (e.g., heart rate sensor), demonstrate automatic data streaming using approaches compatible with the ISS network environment, and develop a plan for operational validation and spaceflight certification that will be implemented during Phase II (Phase I TRL of 4-5).","STARwatch will provide a minimally obtrusive, objective measure that evaluates astronaut sleep-wake activity and light exposure.

The lidar is being developed as part of a dual-wavelength remote sensing system for high precision CO2 measurements.  Active laser-based spectroscopic remote sensing can map changes in CO2 concentration over the entire globe.  However, the measurement of CO2 concentration varies depending on properties such as humidity, temperature, and pressure.  To remove these variables, measurement of a stable, well-mixed gas such as oxygen is required as well.

The ELF-160A thruster creates a high-density, magnetized plasmoid known as a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) employing a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF). The RMF driven azimuthal currents, coupled with the enhanced axial magnetic field gradient produced by the FRC inside the flux preserving conical thruster, produce a large axial JxBr force that accelerates the plasmoid to high velocity.The ELF-160A is completely electrodeless, the propellant is magnetically isolated from the thruster body, quasi-neutral, and there is zero contact between high temperature propellant and the thruster. Combined with a high ionization efficiency and rapid formation and ejection sequence, the ELF can operate on any gaseous propellant, and do so with a very long lifetime and with low thruster specific mass. The AFOSR-funded 200 kW ELF thruster was designed and testing using Nitrogen, pure Oxygen, and Xenon as its primary propellants and demonstrated no life limiting or erosion issues. The NASA developed 1kW class ElectroMagnetic Plasmoid Thruster (EMPT) demonstrated steady operation on a variety of propellant with over 100 Hrs of operation.The focus of this proposal is to take the results from the ELF and EMPT programs and develop a new 30 kW-class thruster that is capable of long duration operation on any gaseous propellant. Phase I will develop the new systems required to transition this technology to a 30 kW, thermally stable, high temperature thruster and PPU system.","The ability to capitalize on In Situ Resource Utilization for electric propulsion on next generation Exploration class missions has dramatic implications for mission success, scale, and cost. Electric propulsion enables the ability to perform Martian and NEO cargo and science missions at high specific impulse and therefore high payload fraction. At higher powers, EP enables rapid orbital transfer and reduced cost manned interplanetary missions. The ability to use Martian, Lunar, and NEO resources for return propellants and multiple mission profiles will reduce the required launch mass and propellant exponentially. The Adaptive Plasmoid Ejector is also lighter, highly scalable in both power and specific impulse, and can be tested at full power in existing facilities. The ELF-160A technology enables ISRU in-space propulsion from 10 kW – 10 MW at 2000-6000 seconds Isp on Any available propellant and has the potential to open up the solar system to low-cost interplanetary travel.","Modern lightweight solar panel technology, such as the DARPA FAST program, has created a unique need for lightweight, efficient, and highly variable power electric propulsion.

However, the ability to use complex propellants such as Air, Nitrogen, or Hydrazine would allow a dramatic shift in the capabilities of DOD spacecraft. An EP system operating at high specific impulse on Hydrazine could be retasked indefinitely between station keeping and rapid orbital maneuvers using a single propellant. Additionally, the ability to use ambient atmospheric gases would enable highly-eccentric orbits that use ambient Air for orbit raising and drag reduction for very low orbits.

CIT works by acquiring two-dimensional (2D) images of Compton-scattered X-ray radiation produced by multiple slice views of the object, with subsequent three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the inspected structure for high-resolution detection and localization of defects. The MCIT incorporates new features and modifications of the CIT, which permit it to operate in multiple modes with enhanced functionality, smaller form factor, and smaller weight. The proposed MCIT will allow noncontact, single-sided inspection of various spacecraft structures (such as micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shields, pressure vessels, ISS modules, and thermal protection of visiting spacecraft) from either within the pressurized habitable compartments or open space. In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of using MCIT for NDE of spacecraft components by fabricating and testing a TRL-4 prototype, with the goal of achieving TRL-6 by the end of Phase II.","The primary NASA application of the proposed MCIT system is a compact NDE system that can be used for in situ nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of the integrity of spacecraft components and structures onboard the International Space Station (ISS), with the capability to provide reliable, high-resolution assessment of the location and extent of damage within micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shields, pressure vessels, ISS modules, and thermal protection of a visiting spacecraft. Additional NASA applications include NDE of lightweight spacecraft materials used in the development of advanced aircraft and spacecraft, such as porous ceramics, carbon-carbon composites, metal honeycomb layers, fiberglass, Kevlar®, and aluminum alloys, providing accurate identification, localization, and measurements of all types of internal and surface defects.","Military applications of the MCIT system will include in situ NDE/NDT of large-area nonuniform multilayer aluminum/titanium/composite structures with complicated geometry in military aircraft.

In response to NASA solicitation H13.01 for Advanced NDE Techniques for Complex Built-up Structures, Advanced Systems and Technologies Inc., propose a collaborative program which seeks to combine an advanced sensor technology for rapid wide-area capture of ultrasound wave-field data with recent advances in NDE guided wave signal processing. This proposal describes how the Spatially Coherent Optical Vibrometer Array (SCOVA), combined with chirped ultrasound excitation and narrow tone-band decomposition provide deep data sets for application of new spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral analyses to address a broad range of NDE functions pertinent to NASA spaceflight structures. In form and function, SCOVA offers a sensor geared towards practical deployment of guided wave NDE. The ability of SCOVA to capture swept ultrasound data at hundreds of points simultaneously, offers a major advancement in the practical application of guided wave NDE targeting multiple defect modalities in current and future complex spaceflight structures.","SCOVA facilitates multi-tier search and damage assessment for NDE and structural health monitoring of complex spaceflight structures employing composites, thin light-weight metals and hybrids. Guided wave techniques offer a viable means for composite NDE to identify foreign body impact leading to hidden damage in the form of delaminations, disbonds, crushed core, kissing bonds, matrix cracking or for incipient micro-crack accumulation due to fatigue or thermal damage. In addition to corrosion and fatigue cracking in metals, guided wave inspection is also being actively investigated to meet the urgent NDE demands arising from the increasing deployment of titanium diffusion bonds and bonded joints in metal composite hybrids employed in spaceflight vehicle construction. In form and function, SCOVA is geared towards rapid deployment of guided wave inspection to a broad array of structural NDE tasks.","The application of the proposed NDE system is anticipated to be of immediate benefit to all branches of military and commercial aerospace organizations concerned with aircraft maintenance and general fleet airworthiness. A broad range of application is anticipated by virtue of the sensors integration of advanced fiber optic component technology with very large scale integrated (VLSI) digital electronics which provides a robust instrument architecture suited to both flight-line and field deployment.  In particular, the scope of application is further enhanced because the same SCOVA technology in conjunction with different modes of acoustic and ultrasonic excitation, offers an NDE instrument which is broadly applicable to detection of delamination, disbonds and hidden crushed core damage resulting from foreign body impacts and, potentially, bond line adhesion failure.

The bond between the CMC and single crystal will be primarily mechanical in nature, and enhanced with clamping arising from thermal expansion mismatch.  Two single crystal root sections will be bonded to each other using diffusion bonding and/or transient liquid phase bonding at temperatures near 2200 0F.  The single crystals will form a clam shell around the CMC, with little or no gap between the metal and ceramic.  Upon cooling, the metal will shrink around the CMC spar to firmly clamp it.

IOS will use unique pigments whose fluorescence depends directly on absolute ambient pressure, not on the partial pressure of oxygen in the flow field, to develop coatings that will allow ""legacy"" (oxygen-based) visualization equipment to characterize flows in oxygen-free atmospheres. The new pigments will also be completely compatible with temperature indicating materials and binders currently used in temperature-compensated pressure sensitive paints.In Phase I IOS will create two different oxygen-insensitive pressure-sensitive pigment materials, combine them with a suitable binder, and apply the resulting paints to stainless steel test coupons. The fluorescence of these test samples will be measured under varying static pressures of pure nitrogen, and imaged in a low-speed flow environment at varying angles of attack. This will set the stage for Phase II development and delivery of a complete temperature-compensated true ambient pressure sensitive paint system that can be used to characterize flow around structures in hypersonic wind tunnels and other facilities where oxygen-independent pressure mapping is needed.","True ambient pressure sensitive (TAPS) paint will be immediately useful in wind-tunnel based studies of hypersonic flow, where working fluids other than oxygen are often used to achieve Reynolds numbers characteristic of air flow at higher speeds, particularly in the study of real gas aerodynamic effects. TAPS paint will be rapidly adopted by other aerodynamic test facilities where oxygen-independent pressure mapping is needed; for example in the study of combustion-related phenomena (where the partial pressure of oxygen clearly does not depend exclusively on the local ambient pressure). Once the advantages of oxygen-free pressure mapping are demonstrated in these applications, TAPS-based PSPs will rapidly displace the conventional oxygen-sensitive paints currently used in lower speed wind tunnels as well.","One very obvious advantage of TAPS-based PSPs is that they can be used in ""water tunnels"" for testing hydrodynamic structures. Thus ship designers (including both the U.S. Navy and commercial naval architects) will be able to use the whole-surface image-based pressure mapping techniques hitherto available only to aerospace engineers. A large class of industrial and commercial structures that emit oxygen-reactive species – from tailpipes to smokestacks – that has hitherto been unaddressable by PSPs can be studied using TAPS-based paints. Pressure mapping of other non-aerodynamic structures (e.g., automobiles, trains, buildings) can be accomplished with conventional PSPs, but the increased shelf-life and stability of TAPS-based paints will make them attractive for these applications as well.

In such high speed vertical lift configurations, even though the aircraft may be cruising at compressible Mach numbers, incompressible flow pockets can occur in the wake of the fuselage. Hence, in contrast to most helicopters currently in use, these configurations need to be analyzed across a wide range of speed regimes including incompressible, compressible and mixed regimes.The present proposal offers to extend the design tool ``RotCFD'' to viscous all-speeds with mixed incompressible and compressible regions. In general, the algorithms used in CFD are designed for incompressible flow or compressible flow, depending upon the primary usage. RotCFD, being an Integrated Design Environment (IDE) for rotors, can be developed to seamlessly work in both regimes without additional input besides the operating speed from the design community. Additionally, this proposal offers to extend RotCFD to include grid generation with bodies in relative motion, such as tilting nacelles and wing tips, which happens in transitioning flight. The proposed extension of RotCFD for all-speed regimes and flows with mixedregimes, if proven successful, will offer the vertical flight scientific community a moderate fidelity, robust and efficient design tool.

This approach provides a novel path to addressing NASA's need for lightweight radiation shielding materials that can also serve as structural members and provide protection from micrometeoroid impact.  Polybenzoxazines are organic thermosetting polymers that can be tailored at the molecular level to optimize characteristics that are particularly advantageous for radiation shielding applications, such as high hydrogen content.  Polybenzoxazines are also easily synthesized from inexpensive raw materials and the precursor, either monomeric or polymeric, can lead to cross-linked, lightweight, and thermally stable polymers.  Our project will address the radiation shielding needs identified by NASA by developing lightweight composites containing a high hydrogen content polybenzoxazine resin matrix and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) reinforcing fibers.  UHMWPE fibers are the preferred reinforcing fiber for radiation shielding applications due to their high hydrogen content.  Recent developments in PBZ chemistry now allow for crosslinking at lower temperatures that will not be detrimental to the polyethylene fiber structure.","- An innovative, tailored material for lightweight radiation shielding of humans.- An innovative, multifunctional, integrated, and multipurpose structure for lightweight radiation shielding of humans, structural components, and micrometeoroid protection.-An innovative approach for developing radiation shielding materials.",The proposed materials also have aerospace applications where radiation shielding could be provided for selective areas of aircraft that fly at high altitudes.

In an effort to minimize risk and expedite development, the proposed software tool will utilize two previously developed in-house robust toolsets for rapidly generating finite element models and constructing stochastic response surfaces.","Potential NASA applications will include the use of the developed technology for estimation of weight and loads for any new generation aircraft system including the blended wing body (BWB), truss-based high lift wing, and any other unconventional configuration.","The proposed development has the potential to dramatically improve the weight and loads predictions capabilities within NASA for unconventional applications.  Phase II development will result in a commercial software package including a user friendly interface.  In addition to being offered as a commercial software package, this software tool will strengthen M4's engineering services offering. The current demographics in the engineering workforce make this a very attractive market. Due to the aging workforce and the relative shortage of excellent talent, the engineering services/consulting market is very active, and is expected to remain so for years to come.

These features are achieved by a combination of an innovative loop configuration and Creare's proven enabling components.  In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of reliable refrigerant circulation through building and testing a proof-of-concept pumped loop with key features, optimizing the pumped loop design and predicting its performance.

The higher the temperature and pressure, the higher the thrust and specific impulse. For ground test facilities that will be heating the gas to temperatures up to 4400 F (2425 C), the number of materials that can be used is severely limited. The need for compatibility with hot hydrogen limits the field even further. In this project, Ultramet will design, fabricate, and test a system for heating high-pressure hydrogen up to 2400 C. The system will comprise a resistively heated open-cell refractory carbide foam heating element and an oxide-lined rhenium tube to contain the heater. By passing an electric current through the foam ligaments, they can be heated to arbitrarily high temperatures, and the carbides are stable in hot hydrogen. In previous work, Ultramet has demonstrated the ability to make robust electrical connections to foam heaters that will tolerate high temperature operation. Unlike most other refractory metals, rhenium is both ductile and non-reactive with hydrogen. It is also very strong and creep-resistant at high temperature. Consequently, rhenium is the material of choice for the pressure vessel and other hydrogen-washed surfaces such as the convergent/divergent nozzle. In the immediate vicinity of the heater, a thin layer of zirconia or hafnia (both of which are compatible with rhenium up to their melting point) will be used to electrically insulate the rhenium from the foam heater.","Beyond ground test hardware for nuclear-thermal propulsion technologies, the resistively heated foam technology can also be used as an ignition system for ionic liquid advanced monopropellant rocket engines, as well as non-hypergolic bipropellant engines. The former application is being actively pursued by the Air Force.","The most lucrative commercial application for this technology would be ignition systems and catalyst preheaters for turbine engines used for terrestrial power generation.

There is a need to maintain a high degree of insulation on the surface of the metallic bearings. Current methods to preserve the insulation feature include the use of anodized coatings and polyimide films. However, they are easily damaged and are hard to replace or repair. Innovations are needed to provide a protection method that is easy to maintain. Working with a developer and supplier of systems to NASA, we propose to demonstrate the feasibility of a self-healing insulative polymer coating on the metallic parts that will allow the coating to repair damages under normal operational conditions of the spacesuit. The self-healing capability is afforded through a novel polymer morphology. In Phase I, we will coat 17-4 PH stainless steel flat panels, test coating properties, and evaluate the self-healing performance under near ambient temperatures. In Phase II, the self-healing coating will be applied on a prototype metallic bearing and the coating composition and morphology will be optimized so that it meets all the functional performance requirements.  A functioning prototype metallic bearing will be delivered to NASA. The goal is to achieve TRL 6 by the end of the Phase II program.","In addition to the specific application identified above, the self-healing coating can find applications in different components of expandable structures for lunar and Martian missions in the future. Expandable structures could benefit from use of the coatings as it would enhance the functionality and reliability of the inflatable structures. The self-healing coatings can be applied to fabrics and films that will be used for lunar habitats. The use of self-healing can help reduce the loss of consumables in the lunar habitat and advance the design of smart structures. Nanostructured coatings could be extended to use to different components of Space Suit Assembly like imparting self-repairing the gloves used for Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) since the gloves are exposed to possibility of damage.","Potential commercial applications for a self-healing electrically-insulating adhesive are various. The adhesive can be applied to automotive or industrial electronics which may be difficult to access, but would require lower maintenance costs due to the self-healing capability. Similarly, electrical/optical cables and communication devices that are in hard-to-reach or hazardous locations can use this adhesive as a means to improve the safety of technical repair personnel. By extension, these adhesives can be used in protective equipment for technical personnel who work in environments where electrical shock is a concern. Another huge area of potential interest is chromate free self-healing corrosion resistant coatings for metals, an example of which is aluminum alloys used for aircraft components and fuel tanks. Current non-chromate coatings cannot match the performance of chromate coatings. Introduction of a barrier coating with near ambient temperature self-healing function will provide another tool toward establishing a chromate-free system with performance equivalent to that of a chromate-containing coating.",Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Metallics; Nanomaterials; Polymers; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Textiles,Space Suit Pressure Garment and Airlock Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Even on the space station, where there is a continuous human presence, traditional non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is impractical due to complexity of necessitating a space-walk, not to mention the training required to obtain meaningful results. These structures are subject to damage caused by the extreme launch environment, micrometeorite and orbital debris (MMOD) impact, thermal cycling and even atomic-level corrosion.  Nevertheless, it is desirable for space structures to be designed with as small safety margins as possible due to the significant cost of placing objects into space.  Therefore, NASA seeks reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques to be able to remotely inspect space structures.  Such a system could be used as an early warning system for manned space missions, to indicate when a critical repair may need to be conducted, or an emergency abort event is necessitated.  MDC proposes the use of a conformal CNT applique for providing SHM capabilities to space structures while only adding 10 GSM mass and 100 micron thickness.  Four separate detection methods will be demonstrated using the multi-physics properties of this unique material.","This method will have the greatest benefit for composite manned space vehicle applications, however will also have applicability to metallic and unmanned structures.

When measuring the performance of an application that contains concurrent processing on both the CPU and GPU processors, attributing time spent to the proper processor can be difficult - a difficulty exacerbated by the potential presence and usage of multiple accelerators concurrently. Accurately measuring the interactions of multiple accelerator devices is necessary in order to accurately report the application's performance to the user, but is difficult with the current set of accelerator interfaces.

Inappropriate pilot action for healthy aircraft, control failures, and vehicle impairment are frequent contributors to LOC accidents. These accidents could be reduced if an on-board system was available to immediately guide the pilot to a safe flight condition (including cases of control failure or vehicle impairment). Barron Associates previously developed and demonstrated (in pilot-in-the-loop simulations) a system for finding appropriate control input sequences to recovery from upset conditions, and for cueing pilots to follow these sequences.The proposed work would add several innovative capabilities to the existing architecture.  One of the most significant proposed enhancements is the addition of adaptation to address off-nominal vehicle responses.  Off-nominal vehicle responses can occur for a number of reasons including adverse onboard conditions (e.g., actuator failures, engine failures, or airframe damage) and external hazards, especially icing.  The addition of adaptation capabilities will allow the proposed system to provide appropriate upset recovery guidance in cases of off-nominal vehicle response. The proposed system is also specifically designed to be robust to variations in pilot dynamic behavior as well as provide enhanced robustness to pilot deviations from the recommended recovery strategies.","One of the overarching goals of the NASA's Aviation Safety Program is to improve aircraft safety for current and future aircraft. As loss of control accounts for a significant percentage of the fatal accident rate, developing systems that improve the response to upset conditions in flight are critical to achieving this goal. The proposed research addresses three of the top ten challenges for the AvSP including: (1) ""Assuring Safe Human-Systems Integration"" (2) ""Improve Crew Decision-Making and Response in Complex Situations"" and (3) ""Assure Safe and Effective Aircraft Control under Hazardous Conditions."" The DAGUR system is explicitly structured around pilot acceptance by providing robust performance in the face of variations in pilot dynamic behavior (Challenge 1). The closed-loop guidance provided by DAGUR will aid pilots during upset recovery preventing a high stress situation from developing into a full-blown loss of control event even in cases of vehicle failures and impairments (Challenges 2 and 3).","The immediate application for the proposed technology is in the civilian aerospace sector to improve aviation safety and security. However, the technology will readily extend to military aviation and space exploration. The increasing prevalence of remotely-piloted UAVs for military and homeland security applications, their consideration for terrestrial science missions and planetary exploration in the near-to-mid term, and the likely ubiquitous commercial roles of these vehicles in the longer-term, provide numerous opportunities for the transition of the proposed SBIR technologies.

NASA and many others have a direct and critical need for high quality free-form optical components. Free-forms can improve the optical performance of many types of optical systems when compared to aspheres.MSF error is a major concern with free-form optics as the standard method for manufacturing free-forms (sub-aperture tool polishing) can lead directly to large MSF error. Simply, MSF error is a height error on the surface in the spatial regime between roughness (micro) and irregularity (macro). MSF errors dramatically degrade performance in optical systems.Our free-form manufacturing process is differentiated by full-aperture polishing step, called VIBE, and by the proposed smoothing step. The VIBE step does not create MSF error as the sub-aperture process does. The smoothing step will reduce any inherent MSF error. In this manner, we will manufacture free-form optical surfaces without MSF errors. Our technical objectives are three fold: 1) Determine most feasible smoothing parameters, 2) Determine feasibility of smoothing for free-forms for reduced mid-spatial frequency error, and 3)Determine the effectiveness of using a computer generated hologram (CGH)  for free-form measurements. To accomplish these objectives we have set out the following work plan. First we will design the free-form surface and the associated CGH (with feature for easy alignment).  Next, we will perform a study on smoothing to determine the optimized smoothing parameters to remove mid-spatial frequency errors on free-form surfaces. Then, we will manufacture precision free-form surfaces using the optimized parameters. During each step in the manufacturing process (generation, VIBE polishing, smoothing, sub-aperture figure correction, and something) we evaluate both the irregularity and mid-spatial frequency errors.","Free-form optical surfaces with limited mid-spatial frequency error have many applications in NASA's optical systems. Specific examples of NASA optical systems that are improved by free-form surfaces are x-ray and UV imaging instruments on weather satellites, the IRMOS spectrometer at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, and three mirror telescope systems. Three-mirror telescope systems specifically have found significant improvements with free-form surfaces. In addition, many NASA applications require tight mid-spatial frequency specifications to reduce flare in the optical systems. Specific NASA programs that have tight mid-spatial frequency specifications are the International X-ray Observatory (IXO) and the Javian planet finder. The current budgeted error for the IXO mandrels is 1.4 nm rms over the 2 mm","Like with the NASA applications, almost any optical system can have better performance with free-from surfaces with limited mid-spatial frequency errors.High energy laser applications, such as National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors.  The MSF errors are a source of damaging intensity, specifically in the region of interest for high energy laser systems.In EUV lithography, flare is a significant problem, where flare is the optical effect of MSF errors in optical components. The MSF errors cause light to scatter into small angles and reduce image contrast.  The MSF errors scales dramatically as lambda is less, which causes a worse problem as the lithography industry heads toward shorter and shorter wavelength systems.Detailed modeling by Youngworth and Stone of MSF  errors in diffraction limited imaging systems showed that the variance of the MSF errors strongly affect the imagery of an optical system.  Their model was specifically focused on both radial spoke errors induced from ring-tool grinding and rotational polishing marks from CNC deterministic polishing.Similar to X-Ray telescopes, the optics in X-Ray Synchrotron's are grazing incidence also suffer from degraded optical performance from scatter from MSF errors.

This innovation is relevant to NASA's need for compact, quiet, efficient, and long-lived sources of pressurized oxygen for atmosphere revitalization (AR) and EVA oxygen storage recharge.  Present AR equipment aboard International Space Station (ISS) consists of power-intensive, noisy compressors that have service lives less than 2 years.  Proton's proposed electrolyzer stack will eliminate the need for these compressors, by developing a cell stack that can produce 3600 psia oxygen via electrochemical compression.  This innovation results in a quiet, efficient solid state device with no internal moving parts to service or fail.","Based on Proton's unique experience in commercializing PEM-based products, transitioning to NASA, DOD, and developing civilian commercial applications are important outcomes of this technology development effort.  The NASA applications for this technology are clear:  providing pressurized oxygen refill capability to a number of scenarios including ISS, EMU, and future lunar surface systems.  Civilian commercial derivatives of this technology would be enabling technology for a variety of energy storage applications.  High pressure electrolysis provides the key capability for volumetrically dense hydrogen and oxygen storage.  Impacts of this technology on military operations include enabling high altitude unmanned aerial vehicle operations and a variety of underwater vehicle operations, especially unmanned underwater vehicles.  The similarity between the high altitude and undersea applications is that both require the storage of oxidant in addition to the storage of fuel.  High altitude UAV's can be used for missile defense, surveillance and communications.  Undersea applications include long-term distributed data gathering with long endurance buoys, transport of special forces personnel, and mine neutralization among others.

The NONA infusion and cure of autoclave prepreg materials allows the manufacture of large primary composite structures without the expensive and energy-intensive capital equipment currently required for fabrication. The NONA process enables the remote fabrication of complex, integrated structures, dramatically shifting the composites manufacturing paradigm. Qualified autoclave or OoA prepreg tapes can be applied simultaneously with dry unidirectional (UD) tapes in an automated process. The presence of dry fibers throughout the layup before infusion allows improved breathing, removal of volatiles from prepreg, and improved compaction with only atmospheric pressure, mimicking the double vacuum debulk (DVD) process without the added equipment. NONA resin is then introduced to the evacuated layup at ambient temperature to wet out all available contact surfaces and cure itself and the prepreg in place. The NONA epoxy resin uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure with no external heat required. With a high degree of crosslinking, the baseline NONA resin provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 degrees F. Pairing NONA resin with a compatible prepreg, such as IM7/Cycom 977-3 or Hexcel IM7/8552-1, a cure of both systems can be achieved at room temperature. Because the cure occurs at room temperature, the NONA resin locks in its shape near room temperature, thus allowing the use of low-cost tooling materials, typically avoided because the of high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).","Supporting NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, this project's technologies directly address requirements for new manufacturing processes and advanced materials for creating lightweight structures for heavy lift launch vehicles. This project's technologies offer the benefits of qualified aerospace prepreg systems combined with the low-cost tooling and low-capital curing of NONA manufacturing to reduce overall manufacturing costs and enable larger primary structures.","This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.

The all-fiber amplifier design concept for power amplification of a lower power commercially available tunable laser seed source (master oscillator) uses a single gain stage architecture based on germanosilicate (GeO2-SiO2) fibers specifically designed to suppress stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), one of the main factors limiting the maximum output power from narrow linewidth cw fiber amplifiers. The amplifier will be pumped by a fiber Raman laser whose spectral output can be tuned by compressive fiber Bragg grating technology. For this proposal TIPD will demonstrate power levels beyond what has been previously demonstrated for this technique, necessary for pumping the SBS suppressed gain fiber amplifier stage to its maximum potential output power.  By implementing techniques for suppressing SBS in highly doped germanosilicate fibers it is anticipated that the amplifier wall-plug efficiency will reach 10%. In addition, the single gain stage architecture is compatible with distortion-free amplification of a phase/amplitude modulated seed source, useful for sensors that rely on sophisticated signal processing for detection.  During Phase I, we will validate the broadband FRA proof-of-concept through modeling and benchtop demonstrations of both the power amplifier and tunable pump laser stages. Furthermore, appropriate designs for both the tunable laser source and SBS suppressed germanosilicate gain fibers will be formulated and assessed in terms of performance that best meets the target technical specifications for the FRA for a potential Phase II effort.","The broadband fiber Raman amplifier (FRA) proposed is applicable to future NASA missions where tunable high power cw lasers are needed at infrared wavelengths not currently available by other commercially available sources, in support of applications such as LIDAR, spectroscopy, and communications. Specifically, high power tunable laser sources are relevant to trace gas and atmospheric constituent measurements in future planetary exploration (e.g. Mars, New Frontiers missions to Saturn and Uranus) and earth-science (e.g. ASCENDS) missions as outlined in the NRC Decadal Survey Reports ""Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022"" and ""Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond"" respectively. Such lasers can provide more power for increased measurement sensitivity and can easily be integrated into absorption LIDAR and tunable laser spectrometer instruments (e.g. Mars Curiosity rover) currently using bulkier free-space solid-state lasers. Not only are all-fiber lasers more robust, but they can reduce the overall instrument footprint in the ever-precious real estate of space science payloads, making room for additional instrumentation and adding value to the overall science mission. Broadband FRAs could also be useful in the relay of data at optical wavelengths which provide greater bandwidth than existing RF channels as deemed important in the NRC Planetary Science Decadal Report.","Fiber Raman amplifiers offer the potential to realize high power laser sources at wavelengths beyond those currently found from existing solid state and fiber laser technology. As such, the development of efficient and powerful broadband FRAs will enable new sensors for science, industry and defense. In addition, new multi-wavelength sources can be developed for pumping solid state and fiber lasers where high power semiconductor diodes are currently unavailable. Further development of fiber Raman amplifiers will also be beneficial to the telecommunications industry where increasing demand for bandwidth will require fiber amplifiers beyond what is currently available with erbium doped fiber amplifiers in the C- and L-bands of the optical spectrum. Recent advances in medicine such as photodynamic therapy used in cancer treatments can also benefit from tunable shortwave infrared fiber-laser sources at wavelengths outside of the traditional 1060 and 1550 nm spectral bands. Finally, advances made in terms of SBS suppressed fibers can be valuable to other fiber applications where SBS is a limiting factor. In particular, fiber laser power levels could be significantly increased for industrial and defense applications while maintaining excellent beam quality, a parameter not found in other high power fiber lasers which use large mode area fibers to avoid the onset of SBS.","Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Given the hazards of exploring these destinations, robotic landers will most likely precede human mission, as they can significantly cut mass, size and cost relative to human-relevant landers without compromising human safety. However, a reduced lander size equates to reduced hazard tolerance, placing a strong demand on precise autonomous hazard detection and landing.The proposed research innovates safe, precise navigation for autolanding for sample return missions to a distant asteroid, planet, or moon. The technology suite developed will be packaged as a commercial product","Precise navigation and hazard avoidance for flight and landing are essential to meet the goals of future  space exploration. This program offers a dramatic improvement over state-of-art in cost and performance of hazard avoidance and landing precision. While robotic exploration missions to distant surfaces cannot rely on remote human operators for real time landing decisions, automated missions that depend on probabilistic guarantee of hazard-free landing are limited to regions of benign terrain. Autonomous hazard detection and precise visual navigation enable targeting of planetary landing sites with the highest interest – those near hazards. It enables future missions to exploit localized resources such as peaks of persistent light, planetary caves, and volatile-rich regions. It also enables serial missions to build Martian or lunar infrastructure and reduces cost of sample return. This program delivers sensing and algorithms for precision safe landing and integrates them into planetary landers. Development is scalable and adaptable to enable rapid integration with any robotic vehicle. Results will be publicized and transferred to NASA for internal use and use by government support services contractors.

In particular our innovation will leverage prior NASA developments to focus on system miniaturization and increased performance.  It will also support NASA's airborne science missions by utilizing long-endurance unmanned aircraft such as the Ikhana or the Global Hawk.  These platforms become directly relevant due to the often remote nature of regions of interest, particularly as one considers the cryosphere.  The Phase I will result in a system design that can be realized in a Phase II effort. During the Phase I, measurement requirements will be revisited and key technologies will be identified and incorporated where advantageous into a revised design.  Data volume and system automation will be specifically evaluated and a plan for on-board data storage and compression/processing will be proposed.  An accommodation feasibility study for the Ikhana will be evaluated. The Phase II effort will realize a prototype of this sensor. At the end of the Phase I, a technology readiness level of 3 will be achieved.","For radar interferometry, the high frequency (Ka‐band) of operation enables improved accuracy with a constrained antenna and baseline size and as such has been proposed as a potential solution for interplanetary ice mapping missions (e.g. Europa) and planetary topography mapping missions. mini-KASM componentry, integrated subsystems and techniques including the compact, low-power implementation and calibration methodologies could readily be integrated, or adapted for the specific system requirements.

It is also aligned with NASA's initiative to expand the utility of Ikhana to Arctic missions, as the Marginal Ice Zone Observations and Processes Experiment exemplifies.","Mini-KASM and its technology also fill technology gaps that exist in several other commercial and governmental applications. A wide area, long-duration, day/night surveillance capability independent of cloud cover as provided by mini-KASM could provide a powerful coastal integrity monitoring capability.  Identification of shipping and detection of debris or pollutant spills and transportation are potential applications relevant to the integrity and health of our coastal environments. Prior to landfalling ocean storms that threaten populated areas, a mini-KASM system could be flown to provide spatial measurements of the storm surge that may threaten these areas. As the storm makes landfall and passes, a mini-KaSM could be deployed to map the flood state over large regions when such information is time critical. Recent work has shown that the velocity width of a river can be used to relate its discharge rate to stage level. US Coast Guard and USGS have expressed interest in using mini-KASM to build such a data base for high use (recreational and navigation) rivers. This would improve the performance of models used to predict discharge rate and flow patterns of rivers that use stage level data from in situ river gauges, and in the future, from SWOT elevation. A mini-KASM system could be used to provide 3D terrestrial imaging. Such data would be of interest by providing topography data sets to emergency planning, land management and resource monitoring.","3D Imaging; Air Transportation & Safety; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Interferometric (see also Analysis); Microwave; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Ranging/Tracking; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Transmitters/Receivers",Airborne Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

It has been estimated that over 90% of future UAS flights will be low altitude (less than 6,000 feet above ground level).  At such low altitudes, the conventional air traffic management systems are ineffective, primarily because both communication and surveillance coverage is limited at those low altitudes, and communication latencies among the controller, remote pilot, and UAS vehicle will be higher than controllers are accustomed to today.  Therefore the current approach of treating low-altitude piloted  flights distant from a major airport with Visual Flight Rules (delegating separation to the pilot in visual meteorological condition) may lead to unacceptably low levels of safety (high probability of accidents). In part because of these concerns, NASA is considering developing a low-altitude air traffic control system specifically for UAS flights—what is called here a system for UAS Traffic Management, or UTM.   But how should such a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system be structured?  What are the fundamental requirements?  How can different proposals for handling such traffic be evaluated?  A UTM evaluator, which is the system proposed herein, will help answer these questions.","NASA researchers can directly use UTME to evaluate tradeoffs when designing a UAS Traffic Management system.  For example, in considering whether a UTM system should be sector-based or based on something else (such as UAS mission), researchers might consider the number of controllers that would be needed for both systems.  UTME could provide an estimate that NASA researchers can use to compare the two systems. UTME could also be used by NASA to pinpoint areas  of UAS operations where current research has not considered, thereby helping define the future NASA research program.Some of the tradeoffs that can be investigated by NASA researchers include: should communication between a UAS flying in a remote area and its pilot be relayed via other, higher-flying UAS aircraft?  Or through a network of ground stations strategically located in different parts of remote regions?  What latencies are observed with these two designs, and if the error rates are different, how large should the protection bubble be to ensure safe separation?  The answer to these questions can help evaluate different UTM designs and provide direction for further research at NASA.","Once a UAS system is defined, UAS manufacturers would need an evaluation system to determine how their designs might perform in a UTM environment.  UTME could therefore be used by commercial companies to determine whether changes in their design would be necessary, or, at the minimum, to identify the operating characteristics of their systems early enough in the design cycle to allow them to modify the design if needed.As a communication medium, UTME results could be shared with the public, members of Congress, or other decision makers to show the safety, performance, and environmental compliance of the proposed UTM system.As a commercial product, UTME could be configured with whatever UTM system NASA and FAA finally decide upon, allowing industry to vary the flight data (including flying their own aircraft in the virtual world), in order to understand the impacts of the UTM system on their aircraft.  They can then use the results to modify their aircraft design in one or more dimensions to improve its performance vis-a-viz the UTM system.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Research   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Also, by incorporating recent advances in consumer camera and display technologies we can produce a new class of digital focusing schlieren (DFS) systems that drastically reduce the manufacturing costs as well as the size and weight, while maintaining sensitivity, improving robustness, making it more user friendly, and over all a much more powerful instrument. The digital schlieren concept represents the first major improvement in schlieren imaging in over 150 years, a true quantum jump in the technology. Conversion to digital obviates many of the long-standing problems with focusing schlieren systems that are associated with precisely matching the cutoff grid to the background light pattern. Because the system is digital, the control software can perform real-time image enhancement as well. Consequently, the most severe hardware production and alignment restrictions are now software problems that are solvable continuously, quickly, and inexpensively in real time.

The proposed system uses a network of true passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) temperature/strain sensors that can be interrogated wirelessly from a distance of several meters. SAW sensors are lightweight, passive (battery-less), simple, reliable, scalable, sensitive, do not disturb the operating environment, can be permanently placed on the critical components, allow quick and inexpensive acquisition of data to diagnose structure performance or failures, and transmit the relevant data to a remote data processing center wirelessly. A low cost software radio approach will be developed to overcome a strategic bottleneck in SAW sensor system development. In Phase I Albido will demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the proposed sensor and the transmission capability in an adequate laboratory environment (TRL 3). Based on a successful completion of Phase I, we will develop a product prototype in Phase II that will be validated in a relevant environment by comparison testing against conventional instrumentation on a test article indicated by NASA. At the end of Phase II, the sensor system will be at TRL 6.","The proposed technology allows sensors to be placed on critical aerospace and other components without disturbing the aerodynamic flow. That means they can be left in place and be used for monitoring the health and usage of the components in actual operation of the aerospace vehicles. The sensors are relatively inexpensive and a multitude of them can be used and monitored simultaneously. The technology is ubiquitous, that means it is applicable to a wide variety of components such as space launch vehicles, gas turbine and piston engine components, transmission parts, etc. The proposed wireless technology is easy to install and reconfigure, which makes it very adaptive to any specific application. Passive wireless SAW sensors have many Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) applications within NASA such as: continuous assessment, life of vehicle, thermal protection systems, accelerometers, harsh environment operation, radiation hard operation, ground and in-flight testing, space applications, structural health monitoring (SHM) of spacecraft and launch vehicles, aircrafts, Orbiter Wing Leading Edge Impact Detection System, impact sensors, NASA's ATP facilities, and many others. Of particular importance is to Maintain Vehicle Safety (MVS) between major inspections.","There are two major market segments for non-NASA applications: military and commercial. Since the proposed sensors are small, wireless, conformal, lightweight and suited for harsh environments, the main military application is for structural health monitoring in harsh environments such as measuring strain and temperature on turbine blades inside a jet engine in operation and also for other military systems such as helicopter blades, Army tanks (e.g. M1). In the commercial field Albido's sensors are attractive for structural health monitoring of commercial jet engines, power plant turbo generators, wind turbines and more. However, since Albido's sensors are also low cost, many consumer applications are attractive. For example, they can be placed on critical sections of fragile objects transported by truck. The truck driver can monitor in real time the structural health of his/her cargo. Parameters to be measured are, for example, temperature, strain, pressure, humidity, and location (identity) of the sensors. Automotive and construction industries can also benefit from this type of sensors. Such system can be also used to drastically reduce the cost of vehicle maintenance by performing Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). The estimated size of the combined military and commercial market available for Albido's products is about $4 billion per year.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Thermal",Advanced Structural Health Monitoring   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This technology is also highly flexible so that cells with an even greater number of junctions or cells with different spectral divisions could be measure by producing a ssLAPSS with a greater number of LEDs or a different spectral mix of LEDs in the illumination array.In addition to providing 3-, 4- and 6-junction cell capability at lower systems costs than the SOP LAPSS, the ssLAPSS also has many other benefits: it requires minimal clean room floor space, it can provide low light levels (LILT), it can measure arrays in horitozontal orientations, it can scale to any bus voltage or string length, it uses proven standards and test methods and it provides for easier calibration than the SOP LAPSS.Four- and 6- junction LAPSS technology is necessary to evaluate, test and fly advanced solar cell technologies.  The ssLAPSS extends an essential, proven measurement method to the future of space power conversion technologies.","The LAPSS is critical to the study of solar cell performance at the string and array level.  NASA can use the ssLAPSS to measure solar array performance on current and future solar arrays.  Because of this need, it is very likely that other labs at NASA beyond GRC would benefit from ssLAPSS capability as well, including:  - LAPSS testing of 3-, 4- & 6-junction solar cells, strings and arrays  - LILT and deep space testing  - On spacecraft and on rocket remote testing  - Solar cell science, including spectral sensitivity measurements  - High voltage (>300V) and long string measurements","The potential non-NASA applications are any organization that currently uses a LAPSS and plans to fly state of the art solar cells in the future.  This includes the Department of Defense, other US government labs, foreign government programs and commercial sector companies.  All have an interest in LAPSS for 3-, 4- and 6-junctions.","Characterization; Manufacturing Methods; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Support",Power Generation and Conversion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The current NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan states NTP is a high priority technology needed for future human exploration of Mars. In order to perform component testing in support of NTP engine development, an efficient means for delivering high-flowrate, high-temperature hydrogen is required. Non-nuclear generation of the desired hydrogen flowrates and temperatures for ground test of NTP components and subsystems is problematic.  ACENT Laboratories is proposing development Hydrogen Wave Heater (HWH) for this application. The HWH is an innovative embodiment of a wave rotor. Wave rotors can be used as a primary compressor/heater or as a topping compressor/heater to multiply the temperature and pressure of an existing compression or heating process. These highly-scalable continuous-flow devices are capable of flow rates upwards of 100 lb/s and temperatures over 5000 F.","The anticipated benefit of ACENT's Hydrogen Wave Heater (HWH) is to allow efficient, low cost component testing for the Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) program.

The HWH will not only allow these conditions to be reached, but the device has room to grow if the program requirements change in the future.","Demonstration and development of a Hydrogen Wave Heater will lend itself to other applications where high-temperature, high-flowrate gases are needed.  One area that has documented the need for this capability is hypersonics. The hypersonic community has identified high-enthalpy (high temperature) clean air ground test capability as an enabling technology for high speed vehicle system development. The work proposed here will lead directly to the ability to deliver continuous, high-enthalpy, clean test air that can simulate flight Mach numbers of 10 and higher.

The advantages of using an interferometric star tracker for beam pointing are numerous, these include the following: 1. Celestial reference based beam pointing eliminates need for having a ground based beacon for return beam pointing.  2. Precision star tracker can be part of the spacecraft attitude control subsystem, thus allowing a single high performance instrument to support both attitude control and lasercom beam pointing functions.  3. By allowing the lasercom system to point with a faint beacon and/or weak stars, the same lasercom system architecture can be employed for both deep space flight terminal and the near-Earth terminals operational from near orbit to very deep space mission.The Phase I effort will be a firm foundation for Phase II:  We will not only have developed the concept and the design of the Precision Pointing Platform but also validated the functionality and performance using detailed simulation that includes models of the active isolators and the jitter environment with high fidelity.  The simulation will use a realistic star background.  Furthermore, Phase I work will also produce a pointing error budget that takes into consideration effects of SNR, unrejected platform jitter, alignment errors and optical fabrication errors.","The most immediate application of this technology is in deep space optical communications with the main customer in this area being NASA.   NASA Draft Communication and Navigation Systems Roadmap Technology Area 05 dated November 2010 states in reference to optical communications that ""longer term, reliance on beacons should be eliminated.""  Our technology offers the ability to communicate from a near Earth or deep space (up to 40 AU) spacecraft platform using a narrow beam aimed precisely at a beaconless receiver.  We can consider both near Earth and deep space applications for the proposed technology.For applications in deep space ranges (up to 40 AU- which is the radius of the solar system), we can name the JPL project called deep-space optical terminals (DOT) as our primary customer at this time.  This project was initiated in 2009.  DOT involves concept and design of terminals that can handle higher data rates with lower mass and power than the Mars Laser Communication Demonstration (MLCD).  OPC has also been funded recently for a study by JPL to investigate if its interferometric star tracker can be used for a spinning spacecraft.   The study findings have shown the feasibility of adapting the interferometric tracker to provide accurate attitude information for a rapidly spinning spacecraft.","Application most relevant to this project is the use of star trackers for spacecraft.  OPC is building a cubesat star tracker at this time to deliver to a DOD customer.  The performance is power dependent - ranging from sub arcsecond to 2 arcsecond accuracy.  The package is small - 250 cc in volume.  Another visible band star tracker application was proposed to the Navy recently under the SBIR program.  This proposal has been selected for award.  The application involves space situational awareness, specifically to develop, build and deliver a version of the interferometric tracker capable of detecting and tracking dim objects.Another application is GPS denied navigation which has increasingly become a more acute need in the past few years.  Customers are GPS denied navigation systems include virtually the whole armed forces.  Our approach is primarily tailored to airborne platforms such as fighter aircraft, ground attack aircraft, next generation bomber, Tier II and Tier II+ UAVs, airborne early warning and control aircraft, ICBMs, and missiles including hypersonic missiles.

To increase cell efficiency while reducing weight and maintaining structural integrity, we propose an approach to cell design that involves the use of quantum dots and epitaxial lift-off.  In the near term, this approach will allow us to improve on what are currently the best space solar cells available in terms of efficiency and material properties for space utilization.  In the proposed Phase I project, MicroLink and its collaborator, Rochester Institute of Technology, will incorporate InAs quantum dots (QDs) in the InGaAs subcell of an InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs triple-junction solar cell to increase radiation tolerance and efficiency, thereby improving end-of-life performance of the solar cell by >5%.  By incorporating quantum dots into the InGaAs third cell, we will also extend the wavelength absorption range of InGaAs cell to beyond 1,250 nm, thereby increasing the current produced in the bottom subcell.  The quantum dot-enhanced subcell will be the last grown solar cell in an inverted metamorphic (IMM) format on GaAs and will be compatible with MicroLink's epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process.  Innovative light management techniques such as reflective metal back contact will be employed to increase absorption in the solar cell by promoting photon recycling.","The improved radiation tolerance and temperature coefficients will open the design space for NASA-specific missions such as low-light-intensity missions to the Jupiter system or high-light-intensity missions near Mercury and the Sun. Solar panels made up of quantum-dot-embedded triple-junction epitaxial lift-off (ELO) solar cells are lighter than those containing conventional solar cells, and the high specific power will make them suitable for the requirements of solar electric propulsion (SEP) applications.

Unlike conventional internal combustion engines or high speed turbine engines, the high power-to-weight ratio and energy efficiency of electric motors is conserved when the motor is scaled to a smaller size.  A distributed electric propulsion system for a VTOL aircraft can exploit aerodynamic benefits increasing the lift to drag ratio by 4 to 5 times (Fredericks et al, Intl Powered Lift Conf., Aug 2013) compared to that of convectional helicopters.  This can yield a 4x increase in range while maintaining the VTOL and hover capabilities of a conventional helicopter.  Using LaunchPoint Technologies' brushless electric motor optimization software, controller expertise, and battery technology, LaunchPoint proposes to design a hybrid propulsion system for a VTOL aircraft that has an extremely high power-to-weight ratio, to demonstrate the validity of a concept VTOL vehicle.  LaunchPoint Technologies will seek robust system solutions for this hybrid electric propulsion including specifications for motor (propeller) distribution, motor power, lift, drag, a heavy-fuel combustion engine, alternator, battery pack, vehicle range and hover duration.  LaunchPoint will then produce a detailed design of the Auxiliary Power Unit (combustion engine and alternator), motors, electrical systems, and power control systems for the aircraft.  LaunchPoint will also further develop their dual-Halbach array brushless motor technology by building and testing a carbon fiber composite rotor to increase the specific power density of this propulsion system.","NASA has multiple uses for long range rotorcrafts with VTOL capability.  We are in contact with NASA research groups developing concepts for fixed-wing distributed electric propulsion (DEP) and VTOL vehicles which would be enabled by our lightweight, efficient, and reliable hybrid electric propulsion system.  Demonstrations of these technologies are planned in the next 2 to 3 years, and we expect that these programs will be customers for our hybrid electric propulsion system technology.  A LaunchPoint Technologies hybrid propulsion system could directly be applied to long range UAVs that monitor the environment, survey landscapes, are used for telecommunication, or missions that have limited space for take-off and landing.","The technology of hybrid electric aircraft propulsion is a transformational technology that could have impacts on aircraft design for decades to come.  However, as with any new technology, it will take some time for the technology to mature and the applications to be adopted.  This is especially true in the field of manned aviation where there are relatively few and infrequent new designs being implemented due to the high cost of manned systems.In the short term the technology will be more readily adopted by smaller, less expensive and faster moving programs, including UAVs.  These programs may use this hybrid propulsion system if VTOL or long range is important to the mission. The system could then be adopted by general aviation applications and possibly commercial jets and rotorcraft.  Mark Moore and Bill Fredericks have shown that the range of the majority of daily rotorcraft flight segments is less than 200 miles.  Helicopters have very poor flight efficiency while airplanes require a runway to take off.  Therefore, creating a highly efficient VTOL aircraft that could hover for short periods of time, but has a longer than 200 mile range, will meet a need currently met by no other commercial aircraft.  For example, almost all of the daily flights out to oil platforms would be much more efficiently met with VTOL rotorcrafts instead of helicopters.",Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion,Rotorcraft   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In response, innovative solar array structural concepts have been proposed including flexible thin-film solar arrays which roll like a carpet for stowage.  These systems are simple and reliable while also exhibiting high performance.  Rollable solar arrays have not yet reached a high enough technology readiness level (TRL) to be utilized as the primary solar array in a high-stakes mission.  The TRL of the current rollable solar array systems is hindered by their reliance on a particular manifestation of deployable slit-tubes which utilizes an open and unsupported slit and high-performance fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials.  The FRP slit tubes are high performance and ideally suited to the ROSA system, but do not have sufficient test-heritage or widely accepted engineering tools to enable reliable and efficient structural predictions such as buckling strength or design optimization studies.  A slit-tube optimization loop including comprehensive testing and analysis as well as the evaluation of novel design features and manufacturing methods is proposed to improve roll out solar array technologies being considered for SEP.  The proposed technology will result in a library of slit-tube test data with analytical correlation, will increase the deployed strength over the state of the art by 4X and increase the state of the art TRL.","The value proposition for the proposed technology is to enable the next-generation of space deployable structures with considerably higher performance (e.g., reduced mass, increased mechanical properties, increased packaging efficiency and increased scale-ability) at reduced system complexity and cost. As the technology proposed herein is largely focused on the development of fundamental deployable structural elements (i.e., as opposed to a specific system), the proposed technology has broad applicability within the space deployables market.  More specific, the proposed technology could serve as the primary structural elements for a broad array of space deployable structural systems including booms, solar arrays, sun shields, solar sails and antenna systems among several others.  As a result, successfully maturing the proposed technology to spaceflight qualification would have a cascading effect on future space exploration and communication applications, most notably by reducing the cost of future spacecraft systems (by greatly simplifying these systems while also reducing mass) and ultimately improving access to space.","Our focus is on those markets where specific technology advancements would have strong revenue growth potential.  For example, Roccor has identified two markets where advancements in reconfigurable/deployable structures could have considerable impact: a) portable and man-packable deployable antennas for military ground troops and b) deployable structures for communication satellites and space exploration vehicles.",Composites; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Simulation & Modeling; Structures,Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Marshal-enabled planning and scheduling systems will maintain task models so that they are in tighter correspondence with the current operating context. Marshal will provide a simple dialogue based interface to update models and affordances for incomplete or imprecise user inputs.  Marshal will actively diagnose user created plans to identify and rank queries so that users can maintain the most relevant task model constraints. Marshal's capabilities will stem from how it represents and reasons with a family of possible task model interpretations. As users add new constraints that may be incomplete, imprecise, or temporary, Marshal creates interpretations of the constraints. With user feedback, Marshal updates the interpretations to more closely match their intended task model.  With a family of models, Marshal can compute the expectation that user plans are consistent. Marshal also computes diagnoses explaining which assumptions about the user's intended model lead to inconsistency. From the diagnoses, Marshal populates a queue of potential plan flaws that the user can address at their convenience through natural and informative dialogues. As users interact with Marshal, it automatically maintains task models so that they can better serve mission planners as missions evolve.","We will target Marshal as a key technology for handling evolving and changing task models for all NASA missions.  Many NASA missions evolve and grow as they are occurring. For instance, the Mars Exploration Rover mission has expanded greatly beyond its original mission parameters.  As a general-purpose model evolution tool, Marshal will be capable of handling complex domain constraints in such domains. Marshal has high applicability to analog missions where operations methodologies are evolved (i.e., Desert RATS and NEEMO).  Further, any mission for geologic centric (i.e., planetary surface or asteroid) exploration and ISS crew planning will require occasional on-the-fly modification of procedures and tasks. Finally, as the possibility of long distance spaceflights draws ever closer, NASA will require technologies capable of duplicating or replacing current ground control tasks.  We will work toward making Marshal a viable candidate for increasing the autonomy of astronauts during these flights.","We will develop Marshal technologies to be applicable across a variety of domains, beyond those at NASA.

In Phase I, we propose to design the compressor and perform benchtop testing.  In Phase II, we propose to design and build a full-up multistage system.","The primary application for the compressor proposed is to compress Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide to feed a solid oxide electrolysis system for oxygen production as part of an ISRU plant for the Mars 2020 mission.  Furthermore, the same technology will be applicable for larger production plants for a Mars sample return and an eventual Mars human mission.  This space qualified compressor may also have applications for other planetary missions to Venus, Enceladus, and Titan, as well as for NASA efforts in the area of atmospheric sampling and climate research.","The commercial potential for a small, high efficiency compressor are numerous.

Currently, NASA uses different sensing technologies such as Pyrolysis–GCMS to analyze planetary samples. These instruments require complex sample handling and can process only a limited number of samples.  It is critical to develop an effective instrument with extended and enhanced capabilities to enable future planetary multiple-mission needs. We propose to develop a new nonlinear Raman spectral sensing technology for trace organic detection at the sub ppm level.  The proposed technology will provide significantly increased sensitivity based on nonlinear Raman detection with Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). It eliminates the sample preparation process, contamination and other related accessories. Our test samples will be soils from the Mojave, and Antarctic Dry Valley deserts which have measured organic concentrations of 10 to 250 ppm. We will mix unaltered soils with organics removed soils.  The detection of organics at the sub ppm level without sampling will be applicable to several future NASA missions, in particular future rovers for the upcoming Mars 2020 mission.   These mobile, fast and agile rovers are focused on collection for sample return and require non-sampling analytical instruments.","The successful development of the proposed sensor system will have extensive NASA's applications. The proposed system will create an opportunity to extend and enhance the capability of traditional NASA Earth and Planetary detection efforts in current platforms. It meets NASA's multiple-mission requirements for the best use of limited resources by reducing the risk, cost, size, weight as well as power consumption. It will also enable new measurements with enhanced sensitivity for the planetary study.

Due to the small physical size and high frequency response of the sensors (resulting in excellent spatial and temporal resolution), the technique has been widely used for studies of turbulent flows. Even with the advent of nonintrusive techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), hot wire anemometry is uniquely capable of extremely high frequency response and fine spatial resolution measurements.ViGYAN proposes a fundamental change to the anemometer configuration, with two related aspects. First, the circuitry to power the sensor and establish its operating point is packaged immediately adjacent to the sensor, i.e. in the typical probe holder, removing the effect of the cable connecting the sensor to an external anemometer. Second, modern analog-digital conversion hardware will be employed to the maximum extent possible, potentially including directly driving the sensor. Data transmission will then be fully digital, immune to environmental variations or electrical noise. Further, direct excitation would permit the choice of operating modes (not just variation of operating point) by changes in software. The ultimate objective of the research is therefore referred to as a ""Digital Bridge"".","A primary objective of the Digital Bridge design is, of course, to improve the performance of thermal anemometry in demanding aerospace applications, particularly large transonic wind tunnels. Assuming success, the miniaturized, localized and substantially digitized electronics package could be used for acquisition and processing of signals from hot film arrays, often used for boundary layer studies in both wind tunnel and flight environments. Other potential research applications could include planetary atmosphere measurements.One of the key issues here has been the large number of sensors, but the digital bridge approach lends itself to effective multiplexing of a large number of sensors across a smaller number of anemometers. Such an approach would allow for the use of hot wire sensors analogous to the shift to electronically scanned pressure (ESP) transducers widely used in wind tunnels.","Looking to broader markets, the majority of air mass flow sensors for automotive applications rely on thermal anemometry in one way or another. The monitoring and control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is also done with thermal anemometry systems.  A digital bridge approach will offer improved environmental tolerance and greater reliability for both applications, with its digital outputs being easily integrated into the overall automotive or industrial control systems used.","Aerodynamics; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Processing; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Ground Test Techniques and Measurement Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The commercial medical oxygen generators based on pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are large and highly power intensive.  TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a small, lightweight, portable oxygen generator based on a vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) to produce concentrated medical oxygen.  The unit uses ambient vehicle cabin air as the feed and delivers high purity oxygen while meeting NASA's requirements for high flow capacity, closed-loop tissue oxygen control and operation in microgravity/partial gravity.  TDA's VSA system uses a modified version of the lithium exchanged low silica X zeolite (Li-LSX), a state-of-the-art air separation sorbent extensively used in commercial Portable Oxygen Concentrators (POCs) to enhance the N2 adsorption capacity.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the oxygen concentrator module (OCM).  The concentrator will have an adjustable pressure output to produce 2-15 lpm of O2 at 50 percent to more than 90 percent purity from ambient cabin air.  The OCM will be capable of self-regulating the oxygenation of the patient using a closed loop feedback system that senses tissue oxygenation level. We will evaluate the sorbent performance in a breadboard bench-scale prototype under simulated microgravity/partial gravity exploration atmospheres and carry out a 10,000 cycle test (at a minimum) to determine its long-term performance and mechanical durability.  Based on the experimental results, we will carry design the demonstration unit, optimize its power draw over the range of flows and oxygen levels, and determine its weight, volume and heat rejection requirements.

Successful implementation will reduce gas compressor power by over 50 % and required maximum tank pressure by over 80 % while maintaining storage tank footprint and total standard volume of gas.  This is accomplished through the use of our high gas capacity physisorptive support architecture employing tailored zeolite sorbents. Added benefits include facile regenerability, equal applicability to other gases including oxygen and nitrogen, improved thermal management to control heats of desorption and adiabatic cooling during filling and empyting cycles. In addition to the energy savings, we expect that more compact, efficient, and less intrusive compression devices can be utilized.  This approach is based on a novel regenerable high capacity physisorptive media storage system that will adsorb CO2 from a compressor system and store it at a relatively lowered pressure. On demand, the CO2 can be desorbed at a constant rate and released.  For example, we can store an equivalent volumetric amount of CO2 at about 500 psi, compared to the current 3600 psi.  There is a potential for substantial weight savings as well – while we add the mass of sorbent and support, mass reductions from use of thinner wall tanks and smaller compressors are likely to be larger, specific savings will be addressed as part of the proposed task plan.At the end of Phase I we will have demonstrated our approach in our in-house bench scale equipment, bringing the technology to TRL 3 with detailed performance information needed to go to TRL 4 in Phase II, including the delivery of suitable equipment to a NASA facility.","The proposed technology will provide a novel regenerable high capacity physisorptive media storage system capable of accepting CO2 obtained from a compressor system, storing it at a relatively lowered pressure, and desorbing the CO2 on demand at a constant rate.  The lower pressure of the system as compared to conventional technologies will have superior advantages in energy savings and reduced system noise. Even more, the lower pressure gas storage vessels and more compact compressor offer to reduce the system mass and volume. Also, extended service life and lower maintenance improves mission flexibility and reduces the need for spares. Overall, the approach offers a safe, compact, quiet, long-lived, and efficient way to compress, store, and deliver gaseous carbon dioxide within an AR subsystem.","NASA spin-off applications include adapting this relatively low pressure gas storage system first to oxygen and other reactant or inert gases. Non-NASA applications include replacing high-pressure gas storage tanks with a lighter, safer, and more reliable low pressure storage solution. The advantages of reduced energy costs and lesser burden on equipment associated with commercial gas compression would be attractive for a number of business concerns that can utilize a lower pressure supply of portable compressed gas.

A completed unit would be comprised of several airfoils with microphones placed in a linear fashion along the leading edges. Functional Beamforming is a breakthrough algorithm that will allow for much better beamform mapping with much smaller arrays than what is currently available. Because of the potential small size of the array, it would be easy to install and implement. Placing the array in the tunnel also allows for numerous viewing angles of the test models as opposed to a single view provided by wall arrays.

The structure consisted of an ablator-filled foam front surface backed by Ultramet's highly insulating aerogel-filled foam. Arcjet testing was performed at NASA ARC to heat flux levels exceeding 1000 W/cm2, with the results showing a significantly reduced ablation rate compared to conventional chopped fiber ablators, and ablation behavior comparable to FM5055 at just one-third the density. It is apparent that the foam helps retain the char layer by physical reinforcement and/or that the network of interconnected passages allows pyrolysis gases to escape with less disruption of the char layer. In 2008, NASA ARC contracted ARA to perform initial development of a new TPS design involving integration of fully cured mid-density ablator blocks within a structural honeycomb reinforcement. The block ablator-in-honeycomb heat shield is envisioned to provide high atmospheric entry reliability due to the structural attachment integrity provided by the honeycomb lattice in the ablative material layer. Any ablator failure such as cracking or char layer delamination is anticipated to occur within individual honeycomb cells rather than over large areas. The architecture is anticipated to have broad potential application for missions that involve large-vehicle entries into planetary atmospheres. Multiple block layers can be used within individual honeycomb cells, such as an outer high-density ablator layer with lightweight insulation underneath. This concept was analytically shown to have significant mass advantages over a traditional through-thickness ablator approach. Ultramet's ablator/aerogel-filled foams have very good potential for this application, and the Ultramet-ARA team will establish initial feasibility in this project.","The proposed block foam-reinforced hybrid ablator-insulator is anticipated to meet NASA requirements for increased TPS heat flux capability and reduced mass.

Sometimes, the noise level can exceed 80 dBA. There are 2 challenges to meet the above needs. One is to generate an anti-phase (180 deg out of phase) signal in real-time to reduce the loud cabin noise in a small area. Another one is to minimize the spillover of the anti-phase signal to other places. We propose a novel and high performance approach to suppressing background noise in noisy cabins. Our system utilizes a patent pending adaptive algorithm that can generate anti-phase signals in real-time to suppress background noise. Our system is portable and easy to set up. Most importantly, our system can suppress background noise in a small area and will not spill the anti-noise signal to other places.","Our proposed technology can be extremely useful for spacecraft and, ISS where noise levels can exceed 80 dBA. A quiet environment will allow astronaut to rest well. Our approach creates a quiet environment while still allows astronauts to communicate among themselves.","Our proposed active noise reduction systems can be used for pilots and maintainers working in aircraft carriers, naval ships, tanks, and aircraft.

LMM will yield even more astonishing results with the addition of enhancing subsystems. Techshot is developing one such subsystem, the LMM-Dynamic Stage (LMM-DS), which will satisfy a host of new experiments. However, GRC has many more researchers awaiting enhancing subsystems for conducting experiments that could lead to new materials with significant commercial potential. Capitalizing on Techshot's rapid progress with the LMM-DS, its vast array of mixing and separations technologies, and its experience with microfluidic systems, Techshot proposes development of a Finite Internal Temperature Slide (FITS)— a hollow microscope slide capable of taking temperature measurements of a sample along the length of a slide without significant optical interference. Additionally this technology will apply heating to the sample by passing a current through the resistive path used for temperature measurement. This allows for more accurate, varied and controlled temperature gradients to be applied across a sample volume while maintaining optical clarity. FITS is a direct result of a need expressed by current NASA funded Principal Investigators  who intend to use the LMM for experiments in which temperature, and/or temperature gradients, must be precisely controlled.","Techshot has a 25-year-history of developing and integrating spaceflight hardware, and serves as an Implementation Partner to NASA and CASIS for enabling space flight experimentation on ISS. The company's success with microgravity facilities such as the Avian Development Facility, the Advanced Space Experiment Processor and the Bone Densitometer, position it as a leader in offering these unique services. When coupled with the innovative capabilities of LMM and LMM-DS, FITS will give NASA an even greater ability to serve the investigator community it supports.  Furthermore, with the ability of commercial launch vehicles to get more experiment samples into orbit, the economics of transporting and processing materials in microgravity should become far more compelling. Eventually, given sufficient economical commercial launch vehicle transporting capacity, when coupled with Techshot's cadre of space processing equipment, FITS could become an important element for processing larger quantities of high-value materials for NASA customers aboard ISS.","Techshot is committed to investing in the commercialization of FITS.  Beginning with this Phase I award, Techshot will build a technology demonstrator with internal funds. Furthermore, the company will self-fund the development, integration and qualification of several of the company's SBIR-derived technologies (including FITS), and then lease that flight hardware to NASA, and other government (e.g., NIH) and commercial entities for their use in conducting advanced scientific research and processing in space. FITS technology would be included in the compliment of Techshot payloads that SpaceX envisions for its autonomous DragonLab free flyer.   Researchers from Procter & Gamble recently visited Techshot headquarters to discuss using Techshot technologies such as FITS to advance several of their consumer products by learning more about how materials behave in microgravity.

The resulting building block procedure is theoretically based but is verified experimentally at several output stages. Noise source models for rotors, lift-fans, engines etc. are developed and validated through specially designed experiments and stored in a component digital library.  For a given small lifting UAV configuration, these noise source models are combined into a hemispheric representation of the total radiated noise.  The total radiated field is governed by the operating state of the vehicle as described by the governing performance model for the chosen configuration.  Standard propagation effects and subjective weightings are used to radiate hemispheric noise levels to ground observers. The resulting computer program can be mathematically flown along prescribed trajectories to estimate ground noise radiation of several small UAV aircraft.","The development of a validated external noise prediction code for small vertical lift UAVs will have a large impact on the potential commercial uses of these vehicles.  Vehicles that are noisy are likely to have restricted operations because of their acoustic intrusiveness.  Designing and operating small vertical lift UAVs so they operate quietly will help facilitate their application potential.  When fully developed, the acoustic prediction tool can be used to help determine the best vehicle performance design within acoustic constraints and/or the quietest design within performance constraints.  The prediction tool can also assess quiet methods of flying the small vertical lift UAV to minimize annoyance to surrounding communities.  The tool will also be useful to the government in assessing how small UAV aircraft can quietly operate within the United States air transportation system.","The development of a validated external noise prediction code for small vertical lift UAVs will have a large impact on the potential military uses of these vehicles.  Excessive and distinct small UAV noise radiation reduces the mission effectiveness by alerting the enemy that a UAV is in the area.

However, the best prediction result achieved by Falconer et al. for major flares, CMEs, and solar proton events (SPEs) is a probability of detection of 39%, meaning that only 39% of the events are correctly predicted. Existing flare prediction algorithms are mainly based on a combination of data, statistical analysis, and pattern recognition algorithms. A serious deficiency of these algorithms is that they do not include the constraints and predictive power of the basic equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that describe the dynamics of the plasma atmosphere. We propose a new approach to flare prediction based on combining a detailed data based description of the solar atmosphere with the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this approach, a subset of the MHD equations take data as input, and then predict physical quantities that are not measured but may be important for predicting flares. Since the MHD equations must be obeyed by the plasma, when combined with data they also provide new constraints on pattern recognition algorithms that search for correlations between the occurrence of a flare and the values of observed and MHD model predicted quantities that describe the pre-flare plasma.","We will develop data products for NASA in extracting useful information out of several data sources such as HMI, SDO, etc.","We plan to develop a commercial software product for flare forecasting and integrate our software into the Air Force's space weather prediction system in Phase 3.

Typically, fuel forms would be developed and tested in separate tests of mechanical, radiation and thermal testing, and, in the NERVA program, the fuel elements were assembled in a rocket engine and tested.  The fuel did not perform to expectations, and the engine needed to be disassembled, the fuel examined and fixed needed to be determined; then the process would repeat itself.In the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Program, individual fuel elements were tested, but they could not be tested to full power density due to test reactor limitations.  Nevertheless, this was a far less expensive approach that full engine testing to determine whether the fuel elements in particular would withstand the rigors of the NRE (Nuclear Rocket Engine) mission. This proposal outline how LPS and its team members plan to integrate the latest in multi-physics model to simulate a fuel element based on a particular NRE design built up from designer parameters.  The multi-physics modules can determine fuel integrity and fission product retention as a function of temperature and operating times, determine micro-structure evolution including cracking and grain growth.

State-of-the-art technology for active thermal control relies on sublimating water ice and venting the vapor overboard in very hot environments.  This approach can lead to large loss of water and a significant mass penalty for the spacecraft.  We propose to develop a Space Evaporator Absorber Radiator (SEAR) that uses heat pumping and energy storage by LiCl/water absorption to enable thermal control without venting water even in the most adverse thermal conditions.  The LiCl absorber technology has the potential to absorb over 800 kJ per kg of system mass, compared to phase change heat sink systems that typically achieve ~50 kJ/kg.  Successful, subscale tests have already shown the potential for significant mass savings and radiator size reduction.  We propose to develop an experimental package that will enable SEAR testing on ISS.  In Phase I we will prove feasibility by assessing thermal environments for future exploration spacecraft, designing the thermal control system, and producing a conceptual design for an ISS test package.  In Phase II we will design, build, and test a prototype experimental package suitable for demonstrating SEAR performance in an ISS internal rack.","NASA can use the SEAR in active thermal control systems for future, manned exploration spacecraft.  A key application will be manned lunar orbiters, which will experience extreme, cyclic thermal environments.  The SEAR can save hundreds of kilograms of water and store more thermal energy than conventional systems that employ sublimators or phase-change materials.  The SEAR technology can also be used as a heat rejection system for future exploration space suits.  SEAR systems can save a tremendous amount of water compared to conventional venting systems.","SEAR technology can be adapted for use as a compact, regenerative, heat-driven dehumidification system for terrestrial applications where small size and light weight are critical.

The new lens enables a full blanket-level specific power > 1,000 W/kg, including lenses, the complete PV cell circuit (including cells, encapsulation, high-voltage insulation, and heavy radiation shielding), and waste heat rejection radiator.  The new SLA array is cost-effective, with the most expensive array cost element, the IMM solar cell, contributing less than $50/W to the array cost.  The new lens is novel in configuration, enabling single-axis tracking for the array even in the presence of large beta angles (e.g., 50 degrees) between the array and the sun.   For future high-power arrays (e.g., > 100 kW), including Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions, the new SLA will offer a unique combination of high efficiency (e.g., >35%), ultra-low mass, high-operating voltage (e.g., >300 V), and low cost.   SLA technology is a direct descendant of the SCARLET array used to power NASA's Deep Space 1 SEP mission in 1998-2001.  SLA recently completed a flight test on TacSat 4 in a very high radiation orbit, and the lessons learned from TacSat 4 led to the new SLA, the subject of this proposal.  The new SLA is scalable to multi-hundred-kW array sizes using blanket deployment and support platforms such as DSS's Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) or ATK's SquareRigger.  The new SLA will typically operate at 4-8X concentration, saving substantially on solar cell area, cost, radiation shielding mass, and dielectric isolation mass.  The new SLA will enable the early use of state-of-the-art cells, such as inverted metamorphic (IMM) cells with 4 or 6 junctions, and will enhance the production capacity of cell vendors (e.g., 100 kW per year of 1 sun cells = 700 kW per year of 7X cells).  The feasibility of the new SLA will be firmly established in Phase I, and functional prototype new SLA hardware will be fully developed and tested in Phase II.","The new SLA will apply to a wide range of NASA missions, most of which use solar power. The new SLA's superior attributes include scalability to high power, radiation hardness at low mass penalty, reliable high-voltage operation, outstanding power metrics (specific power, areal power density, and stowed power volume), and low relative cost per Watt.  These attributes will be especially important for high-power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions. The high unit cost (e.g., $15/sq.cm.) of advanced multi-junction solar cells (e.g., IMM cells), may make conventional one-sun solar arrays too expensive for very high-power NASA missions, such as, for example, 300-600 kW SEP tugs to carry large amounts of cargo from low earth orbit (LEO) to GEO, the Earth-Moon Lagrange Points, lunar orbit, Mars orbit, or beyond.  For such high-power missions, the new SLA could be mission-enabling because of its much lower cost per Watt, combined with its superior performance attributes, compared to one-sun arrays.  Because of its typical 4X-8X concentration, the new SLA also offers much better low-intensity, low-temperature (LILT) performance than one-sun arrays for outer planet missions.  The new SLA is also high-temperature-capable, allowing inner planet missions or slingshot trajectories to the outer planets.  Potential NASA customers of the new SLA therefore include the Space Technology Directorate, the Science Directorate, and the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate.","The new SLA will apply to a wide range of non-NASA space missions, most of which use solar power. The new SLA's superior attributes include specific power (W/kg), stowed power density (kW/cu.m.), areal power density (W/sq.m.), high-voltage operation, radiation hardness, and cost per Watt, all of which are critical to non-NASA customers including established space companies (e.g., Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Space Systems Loral, Orbital Sciences, et al.), the U.S. DOD (USAF, MDA, et al.), and newer entries into the space business (e.g., Planetary Resources, Bigelow, Ad Astra Rocket Company, et al.).  The U.S. DOD is particularly interested in rad-hard arrays, which led them to fund the SCARLET array that flew on Deep Space 1 in 1998-2001 and the Stretched Lens Array Technology Experiment (SLATE) which flew on TacSat 4.  The new SLA will offer excellent rad-hardness as well as hardness against other potential threats (e.g., ground-based lasers), and will be more widely applicable to more DOD missions with its new high-beta-angle-tolerance. The new SLA will also be ideally suited to Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions, including orbit-raising (e.g., LEO-to-GEO for communication satellites), asteroid mining (as planned by Planetary Resources), drag compensation (for inflated space stations in LEO as planned by Bigelow), and multi-hundred-kW spacecraft (as planned by Ad Astra).","Conversion; Generation; Lenses; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Polymers; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine",Advanced Photovoltaic Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

At the same time the heat acquisition areas have trended downward, thereby increasing the incident heat flux. Current incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2. This is a severe limitation for axial groove aluminum/ammonia constant conductance heat pipes (CCHPs). The maximum heat flux in a CCHP is set by the boiling limit, which typically start at 5 W/cm2 for axial grove wicks, and 20-30 W/cm2 for powder metal wicks. The innovation is to develop CCHPs with either a sintered wick, or a hybrid grooved and sintered wick. A hybrid grooved and sintered wick CCHP will allow operating at higher heat fluxes as compared to axial groove design and can also operate against gravity on the planetary surface, operate in space, carrying power over long distances, act as a thermosyphon on the planetary surface for Lunar and Martian landers and rovers, and demonstrate a higher transport capability than an all-sintered wick.","Hybrid wick CCHPs for high power electronics on spacecraft, and NASA landers and rovers is the immediate NASA application. Conventional grooved aluminum/ammonia CCHPs are heat flux limited and are only suitable for operation in space, or when they can be engineered to operate on a planetary surface in a gravity aided mode. The hybrid wicks developed on this program will remove this design constraint, and expand the design space to include higher heat flux operation and operation against gravity on future missions. Wicks developed on this program will enable the use of 3-D CCHPs for some NASA applications: with a hybrid wick, 3-D pipes can be fabricated and ground tested. Additional applications for the hybrid wick were identified, such as heat collecting and spreading for space based and planetary applications. Heat generating electronics are typically buried within an enclosure: the electronics will be mounted in various configurations on circuit cards and aluminum mounting planes. The goal is to accept and isothermalize the thermal load within the enclosure from the individual electronics components and transfer the energy to a location for heat. Strategically embedding heat pipes with hybrid wicks within these planes relevant to the high power components can increase the effective thermal conductivity by 2 to 4 times. These high conductivity plates are essential in the overall Thermal Management System for NASA electronics enclosures applications.","The maximum allowable evaporator heat flux in a grooved pipe is relatively low, typically 10-15 W/cm2. As spacecraft electronics increase in power and packing density, this can present a thermal control problem. Sintered wicks have much higher evaporator heat flux limits, typically four times higher than grooved wicks. The main non-NASA application will be for CCHPs that remove waste heat from high power components on commercial and military spacecraft. Several interested commercial customers in this technology development have been identified, for cooling of laser based components to high heat flux components on-board commercial satellites. Due to the intensive requirements on Military systems for electronics, there are also severe high heat flux cooling requirements. A hybrid wick CCHP with high heat flux capabilities would be highly beneficial.

The rapid expansion of available UAV types and increased mission capability (payload, flight duration, and system cost reductions) offers wide range of potential applications.  The instrument package to be developed in the program will adapt low cost and low power chemical microsensor technology which has been demonstrated for fire detection and exhaust emission monitoring to airborne measurements.  The fast time response and miniaturized system will provide a lightweight, low cost instrument for package for a wide range of deployments including aerostats (balloons and kites) to UAV such as Dragon Eye and SIERRA. Phase I of the program will fabricate and test a prototype system to demonstrate capability of the instrument.","UAVs will see an expanded role in support NASA science missions.  Recent applications for the UAV based chemical sensing currently include the study of volcanoes to validate atmospheric models and to gain new insight into mechanisms. Near term application of the technology would be to assist NASA's work studying volcanic activity such as tracking volcano emissions.  The lightweight, low cost, flight capable chemical detection instrument also has application to a wide range of non UAV related NASA applications including (1) propellant leak detection propulsion systems and ground test facilities, (2) environmental monitoring in spacecraft and aircraft, (3) portable or remotely deployed early fire detection.  The addition of sensors for CO, NOx and ozone would make the system suitable for monitoring aircraft onboard oxygen generation systems (OBOGS).  An aircraft's OBOGS supplies proper oxygen partial pressure to the pilot and crew by conditioning and concentrating oxygen from engine bleed air.  In addition to concentrating the oxygen levels, this system effectively filters out contaminants from typical bleed air supply. Problems arise when bleed air composition is substantially out of spec with elevated levels of contaminants, such as due to exhaust ingestion or oil leaks.   While there are safeguards in place to ensure proper flow and pressure of the breathing supply, there are currently no warning signs or measurements indicating the concentration of toxic contaminants.","There is a large commercial market for low cost deployable atmospheric monitoring systems. Air quality management districts could use the instrument for air quality monitoring.  The ability to potentially deploy monitoring equipment on aerostats or UAV could provide means to improve air quality forecasts and to monitor for out of compliance emissions.An extension of this system could be used to monitor indoor or cabin air quality in mass transit systems or aircraft.  As commercial and civil aviation transition from traditional high pressure gaseous and liquid oxygen systems to on board oxygen generation systems, there will exist additional commercial opportunities for MEI's ACMI to be adapted for monitoring such on-board systems. .

As a result, a more complete picture of crewmember circadian rhythms and the environmental factors that entrain them will aid in determining adequate sleep levels and the countermeasures necessary to achieve them. In order to maximize safety, performance, and research value, crewmembers are in need of a device that unobtrusively measures sleep-wake cycles alongside environmental factors. This device must measure and communicate these signals while requiring very little crew overhead, a low energy budget, and a radically long battery life. Orbital Research Inc.

A consumer fitness device marketed by Orbital's commercial partner that makes use of upper-arm positioning has proven to be comfortable and inconspicuous to tasks involving the hands. The Orbital CRMS effort will focus on extremely energy-conscious design and minimally obtrusive user experience. The final product will measure sleep/wake cycles alongside heart rate, skin temperature, and light exposure without required intervention for 2 weeks or longer, transmit daily (or more frequent as needed) reports to an ISS computer automatically, and will provide feedback to the user upon request. Orbital will heavily leverage its existing technology and expertise to achieve these design goals.",The proposed design would be of immediate utility to ISS crewmembers. The CRMS would allow astronauts to free the task of self-reporting sleep from their workloads. The rich dataset available to flight surgeons and mission planners will aid in designing fatigue countermeasures. The greater understanding of circadian rhythms gained by the research community from this rich dataset will enable more intelligent design of circadian entrainment strategies for low earth orbit missions and beyond. Orbital will partner with BodyMedia to manufacture units that will be sold to NASA.,"Consumer devices that measure and report personal physiological data represent a significant recent increase in consumer electronics demand. Orbital will work with its commercial partner BodyMedia to incorporate improved sleep analysis and battery-extending technologies developed during this program in commercial personal fitness devices.

The innovations of the proposed MF-CRA system consists of:  (i) meta-cognitive radio engines that learn which Cognitive Engine (CE) is more appropriate to provide the adaptation needed for the application scenario; and (ii) robust, computationally efficient RF sensing, signal detection, and classification algorithms compliant with the Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture and specification.   CE is an intelligent agent who observes the radio environment and chooses the best communication settings that best meet the application's goals. We propose a novel concept and design of meta-Cognitive Engine (meta-CE) which has several learning and optimization algorithms in its disposal and is learning which one is more appropriate for the application goals and the radio environment scenarios at the time of operation. To this end, we propose to develop and demonstrate the meta-CE concepts tailored for STRS applications where a meta-CE autonomously manages and controls its STRS radio waveforms and their communication parameters configurations. Our meta-CE features a dynamic RF mapping module, which will sense and record the RF signal levels as a function of the coordinates of the transceivers, the earth's atmospheric conditions, space weather, and trajectory of the transceivers so that it can anticipate the signal changes and seamlessly switch among the available links, waveforms, and parameter configuration settings. Enabling technologies for MF-CRA have been demonstrated through prototype testbed utilizing USRP radios and successful over-the-are tests.","The practical constraints of using space-qualified electronic components while meeting size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements prevent realization or approximation of idealized software-defined radio (SDR) concepts such as ""hardware independent"" or ""hardware agnostic"" SDR waveform applications.  The proposed MF-CRA technologies are expected to bridge this mismatch by providing computationally efficient, automated adaptation for maximizing the probability of achieving and maintaining high-performance communications despite the computational limitation. In particular, the MF-CRA technology is expected to provide three critical applications for future NASA missions involving autonomous communication systems based on software defined radio technology. First, when fully developed and matured, the framework of meta-CE will eliminate the need for manual configuration of a large number of communication parameters or waveform choices available for ""adaptation"". Second, the RF mapping capability within the meta-CE will significantly increase the robustness and bandwidth needed for high-data-rate communication more reliably. Finally, in collaboration with the ""mobility autonomy"" provided by BioComm capability proposed for the STTR project, the joint autonomy of both communication parameters configurations and formation flying/driving will achieve much greater and powerful autonomous end-to-end communication capabilities.","Our non-NASA commercialization plan begins by completing our proof of concept prototypes of meta-CE and its components on the commercial-off-the-shelf software defined radios (especially for the military applications).  With sufficient system testing conducted for the feasibility and reliability of the prototype systems, we will seek protection of our inventions by filing patents. Then, EpiSci will spinoff a new company dedicated to the development and commercialization of MF-CRA product line with key University of Arizona (UA) members. Dr. Bose, co-PI, agreed to become one of the key stakeholders of this new spinoff, and will work with EpiSci to set up a facility near UA so that the UA team members can continue to develop and mature MF-RCA platforms for various DoD and other federal communities, thus paving the way for a direct transition to federal communications radio market (DoD warfighters, law-enforcement officers, etc). In addition, we anticipate a new market to emerge in the area of Dynamic Spectrum Exchange whereby commercial spectrum holders can buy and sell their spectrum units according to market dynamics: It is inevitable that spectrums will be ""trade commodity"" in the future in one form or another. Naturally, the commercial potential of MF-CRA-enabled products such as RF sensors is huge.  The new spinoff will be well positioned to lead this market by providing low-cost MF-CRA-embedded RF sensors.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Intelligence; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Network Integration; Prototyping; Radio; Simulation & Modeling; Transmitters/Receivers,SCaN Testbed (CoNNeCT) Experiments   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

UAS growth is a function of locational based businesses and public use needs, in addition to increases in UAS uses and future aircraft types. Being able to forecast this growth requires time consuming and highly detailed configuration and model development, consensus between different organizations, and flexible tools tunable to changing perspectives. Availability of a common cloud based application integrating varying growth curves and linking geospatial aspects of UAS operations will greatly enhance and stabilize system level analysis of issues such as: radio spectrum usage, safety case analysis, economic forecasts, etc. Individuals and organizations would benefit in using a community centric tool with the ability to shared data and projections while still allowing individual researchers to set up paradigms for their own, unique forecasts.  The overall project objective is to design, develop, and study the feasibility and potential benefits of a UAS Demand Generator for Discrete Airspace Density (UAxpan) system which allows for common solutions in complex forecasts of growth and uses of numerous unmanned systems and mission/operational types. This will be accomplished by developing and testing a prototype system and performing the key functionality objectives using real industry, UAS, geographic, and NAS data.","UAxpan is an innovative concept for a UAS Demand Generator that is directly related to fostering NASA's achieving results in driving UAS integration in the NAS. Our UAS demand forecast system will provide valuable input to the R&D being performed by the NASA UAS Program. The Control & Communications Project (NASA GRC) and the Certification & Safety Project (NASA LaRC) will directly benefit by having the number UAS forecasted operations  soundly based upon real world constraint knowledge and industry SMEs – and based upon industry markets, UAS types, use by mission, and discrete airspace classes associated with geographical location and time. This forecast data is needed to validate the communication systems engineering work on channel bandwidth sizing, signal-in-space specification (especially for shared channel access techniques) and for planning of spectrum reuse.  Without this UAS demand data the selection of differing approaches to form consensus on standards for civil aviation will be delayed. The UAxpan project will also be essential in the development of another NASA emerging project for the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) System which is targeted to enable low-altitude civilian applications of UAS. The UTM will greatly benefit from accurate forecast of planned UAS use in low altitudes as input data to traffic flow and control simulations.","The UAS demand tool, UAxpan, will provide valuable forecast data to non-NASA users in the Federal Government (FAA, DHS, DOT, EPA, DoA, DoI), Armed Services, state and local governments, universities, standards organizations (RTCA, ICAO, AEEC, AUVSI, JARUS) and defense and commercial business.  All these organizations need to support investment planning, perform engineering, determine market needs, or establish international standards and agreements based upon the projected use of UAS which goes beyond just having aggregated U.S. totals. The U.S Congress is driving the introduction of UAS through the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2012 and their staffs would be able to benefit from UAS projections by industry and governing domains.  UAxpan will also be the source of analytics and projection data that can be offered to users through the emerging ""big data"" businesses.

API comprises a high accuracy line scanner to measure surface topology of as-made layups driven by a precision articulated arm Robot to perform rapid surface scanning of a Layup after tape placement and layup. Key to API is efficient and robust software to read very large volumes of line scan data and analyze, classify and detect key Layup features very rapidly and reliably. The software retains only key features, filtering the raw data by two orders of magnitude to facilitate real-time data processing at high scan rates. Software also compares the location of as-made features (gaps, overlaps, drops and adds)with the NC program (""virtual layup"") to identify and record only those as-made features that are out of tolerance. API addresses many of NASA's objectives for this topic:   ? Manufacturing for launch vehicles  ? Innovative automated process (AFP)  ? Applies to reliable, large scale PMC structure  ? Applies to Autoclave and OOA AFP methodsAPI provides a powerful capability to enhance reliability of structures manufactured by AFP by automating a tedious and difficult manual task. In fact, the speed of AFP machines today has advanced such that manual inspection now takes as much time, and often more, than automated layup requires. API can significantly increase total AFP productivity (C-rate) and reduce cost by reducing Inspection time.  Flightware has enlisted the participation of two other small businesses in this program to contribute their experience and expertise as subcontractors for specific tasks. Furthermore we have attracted the interest of larger industry leaders who supply AFP equipment and manufacture AFP Aerospace parts in this program, because they recognize its potential value.  This API program is a manufacturing innovation subject to Executive Order 13329 ""Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing.""","Composite cryotanks for propellant storage that save 30% weight and 25% cost are being developed by NASA.  Composites offer similar benefits in other space applications such as the Orion Composite Crew Module (CCM) and 8.4 meter Payload Fairings for the Space Launch System (SLS).  Advanced manufacturing methods like automated fiber placement (AFP) are needed to achieve these benefits because out-time limits of prepreg systems require that layup and cure of very large parts be performed rapidly. AFP can perform layup at rates 10 to 20 times higher than manual layup, which not only makes these applications feasible but also contributes significantly to affordability, always an important program requirement. API can significantly enhance AFP used to build NASA's structures by allowing critical inspection of these parts (performed 100% by hand today) to keep pace. This allows AFP to be more cost effective and widely used. A potential outcome of this program is to install an API capability on NASA's AFP Robot recently purchased by LaRC. This could provide NASA with a remain-in-place advanced manufacturing capability at the conclusion of the Phase II program.","API capability can be provided to industry in two product forms – using either a Robot or AFP Gantry as the scanning platform. When Robotic API is used to inspect AFP layups, it is sometimes possible to perform inspection on the portion of an AFP tool not actively undergoing layup while the other portion of the Tool is being laid up (in other words, in parallel to AFP placement). This can occur, for example, on a back-to-back Spar tool laid up one side at-a-time. Parallel inspection offers the highest productivity (lowest cycle time). In other cases, AFP placement and API inspection must be performed in series due to access limitations and potential collisions. Even so, API is still much faster than current manual inspection. Gantry based API (with the sensor mounted directly on an AFP Gantry) has the advantage that inspection can be performed in real time (i.e. in parallel with fiber placement). In this scenario inspection adds no cycle time and therefore has the greatest potential to improve AFP productivity and reduce cost. Robotic API (as developed in Phase I) can be used not only for automated layup such as AFP but also to inspect manual layups as well. AFP today comprises less than 25% of all aerospace composite layup (measured in pounds produced) and therefore the market where the benefits of API can be realized is expanded fourfold.",3D Imaging; Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Processing Methods; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),Advanced Fabrication and Manufacturing of Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

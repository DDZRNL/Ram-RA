Decreasing the spacing between aircraft on takeoff and landing would increase the throughput of airports.  On-board sensing capability for wake vortices could allow aircraft to operate with reduced spacings. Wake vortices can be detected by a lidar located on the aircraft, but such a system needs to be small, lightweight, rugged, and require minimal maintenance. The Phase I program showed the feasibility of an intrinsically low-cost, coherent lidar that would be suitable for deployment on commercial airliners for axial wake vortex detection. The Low-Cost Lidar Test Bed was used to demonstrate measurement of aerosol returns. The program also assessed the feasibility of using the lidar for remote detection of clear air turbulence and volcanic ash clouds.  The program developed a conceptual design for a prototype system that would be fabricated and ground tested in the Phase II program.  The Phase II program will design and fabricate an engineering prototype compact coherent Doppler lidar and demonstrate it by measuring ambient wind fields at nearby venues.","NASA applications mostly relate to flight safety: wind shear, vortex, and CAT detection.  The low-cost through simplicity design approach may be attractive for high-reliability applications.","Non-NASA applications also relate to flight safety: wind shear, vortex, and CAT detection.  The low-cost through simplicity design approach may be attractive for high-reliability applications.  Other commercial applications include regional air quality monitoring.  This application would combine a coherent wind-sensing lidar with a pollution monitoring DIAL system to measure pollution fluxes rather than just concentrations.  This data could then be used to force compliance with pollution-reduction regulations, or could provide early warning of a hazardous release.  Another application is wind field mapping for wind turbine farm site assessment, as well as forward looking wind monitoring from the turbine nacelle itself for optimization of wind turbine operation.",Air Transportation & Safety; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)

Partnered with NASA and Boeing, Area-I has developed the unmanned Prototype-Technology Evaluator and Research Aircraft or PTERA (""ptera"" being Greek for wing/wing-like). The PTERA, a high-quality flight research testbed, bridges the gap between wind tunnel and manned flight testing with low-cost, low-risk flight-based evaluation of high-risk technologies. In Phase I, the PTERA was enhanced by integrating modularity and design flexibility and culminated in the design of a representative 16%-scale CRJ-700, named the PTERA-RJM for Regional Jet Model.  For Phase II, the team proposes to finalize the design, fabricate, and deliver a 17ft, 278lb PTERA-RJM that is tailored for use within NASA's Aviation Safety Program to enable experiments in vehicle health monitoring, in loss of control prevention, mitigation, and recovery, in atmospheric hazard sensing and mitigation, etc.  The Boeing Company supports the proposed work, as they have great interest in the PTERA platform given its following core capabilities:1) A large, low-cost airframe that minimizes scaling and Reynolds number effects, yet is easily disassembled and transported2) A modular, reconfigurable fuselage design that enables the fabrication and assembly of fuselage configurations that maintain near geometric similitude with a wide array of ""tube-and-wing"" aircraft using existing tooling3) Modular wing design that facilitates the integration of advanced aerodynamic treatments, split control surfaces, and aeroelastic and damage emulation mechanisms4) Integrated ballast system and movable payload/avionics racks to enable the tuning of mass/inertial properties5) Large payload capacity, voluminous payload bays, and large clamshell doors that facilitate the integration of avionics systems and provide access during flight testing","A technology gap exists between well-controlled wind tunnel tests and full scale flight testing where most systems integration issues surface. Allocating these system integration activities to a full scale flight test is replete with safety, schedule and performance risks that dominate flight test costs. The PTERA platform serves as the bridge to integrate and flight test advanced aerodynamic treatments, health management, and control systems, and to perform experiments in structures and aero elasticity for a fraction of the cost of a manned flight test program. The PTERA-RJM flight test facility offers several distinct advantages to NASA and non-NASA customers. The PTERA-RJM configuration, a representative 16%-scale CRJ-700 will provide significantly relevant test data for this, and similar, aircraft and enables flight tests which are typically too costly and risky to perform on full scale, manned aircraft. The PTERA-RJM will be an invaluable resource to the Aviation Safety Program by enabling experiments in vehicle health monitoring, in loss of control prevention, mitigation, and recovery, in atmospheric hazard sensing and mitigation, in crew decision making, among others. This platform will also be of significant value to support NASA's SFW, ERA, UAS in NAS programs.","Area-I has received significant private sector interest in the PTERA platform as a cost reducing research and development tool.  Area-I is currently developing several avenues under which to market the PTERA. Area-I plans to develop PTERA as a production aircraft to sell as a research testbed and to provide flight testing, maintenance, and engineering support to these customers. Area-I will also maintain its own fleet of PTERA aircraft to provide flight testing for a wide range of customers. Several UAV technology developers, including gimbal camera, datalink, image processing, air sensor, IMU, and flight test equipment developers have all expressed interest in flying their products on the PTERA. Additionally, several large aircraft manufactures, in connection with the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA), have discussed having Area-I maintain an exclusive fleet of PTERA configurations for communal testing of NextGen developed systems. Phase II efforts to finalize and fabricate the PTERA-RJM model will highlight the reconfigurability and versatility of the PTERA platform. This, in turn, will allow the private sector to invest funds in PTERA with lower risk to improve the safety and efficiency of aircraft in the national airspace system. The delivery of a custom, dynamically scaled testbed will provide a smooth transition to Phase III commercialization with industry partners as they realize the development time, cost, and risk reductions of testing with the PTERA platform.","Acoustic/Vibration; Active Systems; Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Aerogels; Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Antennas; Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Cables/Fittings; Ceramics; Characterization; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Coatings/Surface Treatments; Coding & Compression; Command & Control; Composites; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Fusion; Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Deployment; Destructive Testing; Detectors (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Fasteners/Decouplers; Fluids; GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Heat Exchange; Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Intelligence; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Knowledge Management; Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Guidance & Tracking); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Lifetime Testing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Man-Machine Interaction; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Mission Training; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Multiplexers/Demultiplexers; Nanomaterials; Navigation & Guidance; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical; Outreach; Passive Systems; Perception/Vision; Polymers; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Process Monitoring & Control; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Ranging/Tracking; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures; Support; Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Teleoperation; Training Concepts & Architectures; Transmitters/Receivers; Transport/Traffic Control; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems); Verification/Validation Tools"

Abstraction is the only way to gain intellectual control over this complex problem; so ATC-NY and Cornell University have developed Event Logic, a high-level model for describing and reasoning about distributed systems, and EventML, a high-level functional language for implementing distributed protocols by ""programming with events.""   Properties of EventML protocols can be formally verified by interactive theorem proving in the Nuprl environment.  To integrate these conceptual tools with standard processes of system development, and to make the labor intensive task of verifying protocol properties more efficient, ATC-NY is developing Emile.  Emile is a software tool that provides: a semantic interface to EventML that translates assertions about properties of EventML programs into logical forms to which powerful fully automated analysis tools can be applied, along with a ""logical manager"" that can direct analyses involving the interaction of these tools.  We will demonstrate Emile by using it to verify the key properties of EventML source code for standard consensus algorithms, such as Paxos.","Emile supports the development of critical protocols that underlie highly reliable distributed systems (whether systems are ""naturally"" distributed, or replicated for fault tolerance)—for example, air traffic control.","Examples of non-NASA Commercial Applications requiring the support Emile provides for highly reliable distributed systems include the New York Stock Exchange, the AEGIS combat system, Google's Chubby service (on which Google File System and Google Analytics rely).",Verification/Validation Tools

Resulting aircraft designs such as blended-wing bodies with distributed propulsion can provide the large reductions in emissions, fuel burn, and noise required to make air transportation growth projections sustainable.  The power density requirements for these electric machines can only be achieved with superconductors, which in turn require lightweight, high-capacity cryocoolers.  We have developed a Cryoflight turbo-Brayton cryocooler concept that exceeds the mass and performance targets identified by NASA for superconducting aircraft.  In Phase I of this project, we extended our initial design study and developed modeling tools to support system-level optimization and individual component designs.  We focused on the critical component for mass reduction – the recuperative heat exchanger – and performed risk reduction activities to demonstrate the feasibility of our concept for this component.  In Phase II, we will design, build, and test two compact lightweight, high-performance recuperators for the Cryoflight cryocooler.  This development effort will provide an enabling technology for the superconducting systems needed for hybrid turboelectric aircraft to be feasible.","The proposed Cryoflight cryocooler development effort will support NASA's long-term goal to increase aircraft efficiency and reduce aircraft emissions and noise.  By providing a cryocooler optimized to meet the aggressive power density target required for aircraft systems, we will remove a key obstacle hindering the development of superconducting aircraft.  While such aircraft are still two or three decades from production, supporting technology development needs to begin now if such aircraft are to become a viable alternative to the aircraft configurations in production today.  The results of this SBIR project will support NASA design trade studies, system demonstrations, and eventual superconducting aircraft demonstrations.   Other NASA applications include space applications such as cryogen liquefaction and storage for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, CEVs, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, in-space propellant depots, and extraterrestrial bases.  Terrestrial NASA applications include cooling for spaceport cryogen storage and transportation systems, and demonstrations of hydrogen production and transportation systems.  The highly reliable and space-proven turbo-Brayton cryocooler is ideal for these applications.","High-temperature superconducting (HTS) materials have the potential to revolutionize the way we generate, transmit, and consume power.  Transformational initiatives that rely on HTS technologies include power conditioning and power transmission systems, large-scale offshore wind turbines, high efficiency data centers, Navy ship systems, and turboelectric aircraft.  While the latter is the target application for the proposed cryocooler, the other applications represent potential near-term markets for the technology.   There is also a large potential market beyond HTS applications, including cooling for laboratory and industrial-scale gas separation, liquefaction, cryogen storage and cryogen transportation systems, liquid hydrogen fuel cell storage for the automotive industry, and commercial orbital transfer vehicles and satellites.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems

Equivalent drag (via thrust reduction) results from the strong radial pressure gradient created by swirl vanes that are aerodynamically ""invisible"" during conventional operation and introduced during a drag management maneuver. Such ""drag on demand"" enables operational benefits such as slower, steeper, and/or aeroacoustically cleaner flight on approach, addressing NASA's need for active and passive control of aeroacoustic noise sources for conventional and advanced aircraft configurations. In Phase I ATA successfully designed an integrated vane-nozzle for a NASA high bypass ratio nozzle. To advance the technology readiness level (TRL) , ATA has formed a partnership with Williams International (WI), a manufacturer of small jet engines and industry leader in the small business jet market. The ATA/WI team will apply the Phase I design approach to the WI FJ44-4 mixed flow turbofan which is selected as a demonstration test article to move the TRL to 5–6 by the end Phase II.","The most immediate opportunity for this system is to assist NASA in the development of next generation quiet aircraft, including tube and wing (current generation +1) and integrated airframe propulsion system configurations (current generation +2). On approach, these aircraft are likely to have airframe noise levels that are comparable to or in excess of the engines. A quiet air brake device will allow noise reduction by creating drag without the associated unsteady flow structures of devices such as flaps, slats, and undercarriage. In addition, these devices will enable steep approaches, thereby locating the noise source further from the affected communities. Further development of the technology could lead to advanced thrust reverser applications whereby the deployable exit guide vanes can actuate to a closed position to function as thrust reverser blocker doors. An additional application for swirling exhaust flows is in the area of wake vortex avoidance and induced drag management. For example, swirling outflow devices placed on wing tips could be used to counter- or co-swirl relative to the bound vortex that is shed by a finite wing, resulting in potential induced drag reduction or increase (possibly of value in a quiet drag sense). This may prove to have applications in designing more fuel efficient and quiet aircraft in the future.","The commercial potential for this system extends beyond NASA's development programs related to next-generation quiet aircraft. Two complementary potential commercial markets exist for the technology: (1) implementation as a complementary technology in retrofit (ejector) hush kits on older aircraft engines in order to meet current and future noise requirements, and (2) implementation in future jet engines as an integral part of the engine design; i.e., modifying traditional engine exit guide vanes or bypass nozzles with a variable mechanism that generates a swirling outflow in drag management mode. The first market has immediate potential (within the next five to seven years), while the second market, although potentially much larger from a quantity standpoint, is a longer-term endeavor (likely seven to ten years before practical implementation in a new engine that would be part of the first N+2 prototypes). The retrofit market provides a simpler and faster implementation and is an opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology to the community before upselling the technology or its derivatives to the engine Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Another  potential application is integration of the technology into tactical UAV and cruise missile platforms that demand high levels of power generation while simultaneously requiring maneuverability and thrust control.",Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Deployment

Starting from a freely supported version of the model, a two-step model reduction process is proposed to create aeroelastic models that include rigid body dynamics. In the first step, proper orthogonal decomposition at a set of flight conditions reduces the model order from millions to hundreds of degrees of freedom. In the second step, a linear matrix inequality further reduces the order and creates a linear parameter varying reduced order model. The model includes a trimmed and parameterized description of aeroelastic forces valid over a region of the flight envelop. The same model can be used for rapid simulation and for linear parameter varying flight control design. Feasibility of this two-step process has been demonstrated in the Phase I work and a plan has been developed for a prototype implementation. Specific improvements to the rigid body model, technical risks in the development effort, and a risk reduction plan have been identified. An X-56A vehicle model will be developed and then used to demonstrate the model reduction process and to demonstrate applications including a linear parameter varying flight control system.","The Reduced Order Aeroservoelastic Models with Rigid Body Modes technology will increase the technical readiness of methods that can be used by NASA to support Aeronautics Research. The proposed work addresses development of efficient methods to generate mathematical models of flight vehicles currently employed in NASA research projects such as the X-53 and X-56A for performing vibration, aeroelastic, and aeroservoelastic studies. This includes design methodologies that encompass CFD steady and unsteady aerodynamics, flexible structures, and active control systems. The work will use existing methods that predict aeroelastic phenomena and complex steady and unsteady aerodynamic flow phenomena, especially in the transonic speed range.

Beyond industry there are potential post applications within the US military. The innovating firm is aware of specific interest within the US Air Force for aeroservoelastic simulation capability in concert with active control. Because of the demands of aeroelastic analysis and testing at the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB and other military facilities such as the Air Armament Center at Eglin AFB and the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division at China Lake, the capabilities can aid in flight test analysis, assessment and safety.","Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

In Phase II of this effort, ZONA aims to improve all the three tiers of NASA's MDAO architecture as follows: (1) The low fidelity capability will be enhanced by incorporating ZONAIR for providing flight loads (for structural design) and pressure differential (for sonic boom mitigation). ZONAIR will also 'flexiblize' rigid CFD loads for aeroelastic analyses, (2) the medium fidelity capability will be further extended by addition of new ModelCenter plug-ins and improvements in the existing plug-ins for ZONA CAE tools, for facilitating ease of design process, and (3) the high fidelity analyses capability will be augmented by the development of supportive software offering beneficial features such as automated surface+flowfield mesh morphing/generation, commonality of input within all branches of fidelity, etc. Rapid shape sensitivity generation capability will be offered with incorporation of ZEUS-DO into the framework. For ease of model-making and input setup process, a pre/post-processor software called ZONA-MV will be further improved with linkage to NASA's VSP tool. A NASTRAN-to-ASTROS finite element model converter will be developed.

The Phase 2 program will make the first large scale hybrid gears that can be run in a rotating gear rig with imposed torque loading. Several full scale gears will be made as well as full scale test elements. Test results from full scale testing will be applied to computer simulation models.

Using a 1:400 scale realistic airport ramp area model the following features were demonstrated: (i) detection of aircraft in the ramp area and (iii) 3D localization of aircraft 3D inertial frame of reference to an accuracy of 40 ft. Phase II research seeks to refine and extend the detection algorithms to include ground vehicles; identify aircraft type; and even determine the orientation of the aircraft. The localization algorithms will be extended to decipher the 3D geometry of the aircraft. Data fusion algorithms will be developed to track aircraft as they move through the ramp area.

The algorithms associated with this technology can also update in real-time the expected time-of-arrival and sequence of arrival at different ramp spots.","The primary commercial application of proposed technology is in low cost surveillance systems for airports. CVAROS is being developed to enable surveillance systems for airports, especially, ramp areas. The FAA has solicited proposals for a low cost ground based surveillance system suitable for smaller airports that cannot afford ASDE-X. The proposed technology is an ideal fit for this category. Ramp areas in US airports are typically controlled by airlines. Industry experts estimate the airlines' cost resulting from ramp area accidents at $4 billion to $5 billion internationally each year. The surveillance technology developed under the current research can be used to enable safety monitoring systems that would mitigate the above costs to the airlines.",Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Image Analysis; Image Processing; Perception/Vision

The experiments tend to require the participation of a large number of subject-matter experts (SMEs) including air traffic controllers (ATC) and (pseudo-)pilots, which makes the experiments costly and the logistics with so many participants make them difficult to plan. These experiments often are designed only to collect data from either ATC or the pilots, but not both; the counterpart is needed only to provide realism in communication between them. The proposed research will develop a Speech-Enabled Simulation Interface Agent (SESIA) to replace the non-essential human subjects in these experiments. SESIA can interact with the SMEs through voice communication, and interface with the simulation platform to perform the intended control. It has the benefit of reduced cost associated with the experiments and increased convenience in their planning, thus allowing the opportunities to schedule additional testing. In cases where a pseudo-pilot would normally represent multiple flights and communicate to the ATC with the same voice for all flights, SESIA will actually increase the realism of the experiments by allow different voices to be synthesized to simulate different pilots.",The Speech-Enabled Simulation Interface Agent (SESIA) is conceived for simulation facilities within NASA for human-in-the-loop (HITL) assessment of airspace system concepts and technologies. A large number of such NASA facilities have been identified in an FAA/NASA NextGen Human Factors Research Coordinate Plan. The software-based system will reduce costs and provide additional flexibility in performing HITL experiments.,"The Speech-Enabled Simulation Interface Agent (SESIA) can be adapted for other simulation facilities within the FAA. In addition, SESIA will also benefit air traffic control training facilities, including the FAA Academy at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, OK, and DoD training facilities such as the Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) in Pensacola, FL.",Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Command & Control; Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Teleoperation

Video is an invaluable tool for flight-testing, allowing the collection of a wealth of information such as craft position, speed, health, as well as tracking different phases of flight, capturing events, extracting performance figures, and documenting historical flights.  For several cases of interest (high-speed/high-altitude aircraft, lakebed remote landings, vehicle re-entry, smoke airflow traces, etc.) it is not feasible or physically possible to install external cameras close to the aircraft whose behavior is being filmed.  Long-range imaging equipment is typically used in these cases, but the captured footage is severely limited in quality by atmospheric effects, which are often the dominating source of image degradation, long before diffraction-related limitations occur.  In consequence, long-range imagery typically suffers from scintillation, blurring, poor spatial resolution, and low contrast.  Since these problems result from atmospheric conditions, they cannot be overcome by simply improving imaging hardware.  What is needed is a solution to combat atmospheric distortion.  In Phase I, EM Photonics demonstrated a signal processing technique based on initial research from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  We modified and implemented this core algorithm and showed its ability to enhance imagery collected from the long-range imaging systems at NASA DFRC.  In Phase II, we will evolve and integrate the prototype components developed in Phase I and deliver an image enhancement device capable of running in real time to mitigate the image distortion present in data collected from NASA DFRC's long-range cameras.","NASA collects massive amounts of long-range imagery, whether for range safety pre-launch, tracking objects after launch, or observing objects in space.  All these applications require imaging through the atmosphere at great distances.  This causes all the imagery collected to be blurred and often detail is lost.Our primary goal will be meeting the needs of the flights test imaging group at NASA DFRC.  The image enhancement tools developed in this project can be integrated directly into their operation center and used for improve the quality of collected both in real time (as the tests are occurring) and as later analysis is performed.In addition, this technology can be used to support any NASA mission that requires imaging over long distances.  One such application is range safety and flight tracking at NASA KSC.  By viewing enhanced imagery, NASA officials will have access to additional information for a variety of key decisions.  During launch, added level of detail provides the ability to make more informed ""go"" or ""no go"" decisions.  When tracking rockets, enhanced imagery allows for more detail on pieces that may fall from the craft during flight.  Accounting for atmospheric effects will also improve the quality of all imagery taken of space-based objects from Earth.","We have identified both government and commercial groups outside of NASA that use long-range imaging and could benefit from image enhancement.  Government groups that could benefit from our technology include the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and local law enforcement.  These applications are primarily in the area of long-range surveillance.  Details on some of the groups we have identified can found in our Phase II proposal.While there are promising government applications, we believe the first commercial applications of the image enhancement tool developed in this project will be in the private-sector.  This is because the solver we develop for NASA will have numerous commercial applications without modification to the underlying platform.  We have identified several broad potential markets and have begun discussions with companies with the intention of demonstrating our second-generation prototype to them upon completion.  During Phase I, we have begun discussions with several commercial manufacturers of imaging systems.  Details on which companies we are currently working with can be found in our proposal.  After NASA, we expect one of these companies to be the first users of our resulting technology.  We will be exploring two primary models for licensing our technology to commercial companies: as an add-on to their current offerings and directly integrated into their imaging system.","Adaptive Optics; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Infrared; Perception/Vision; Ranging/Tracking; Space Transportation & Safety; Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Visible"

The PTERA flew successfully during Phase I of this program, and stands to enhance the already capable NASA Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) by enabling the low-cost, low-risk, flight-based evaluation of everything from advanced aerodynamic treatments to control systems and sensor payloads. The PTERA will bridge the gap between wind tunnel testing and manned flight testing to greatly reduce technology development time, cost, and risk. This work seeks to further mature the PTERA system through rigorous flight testing and will begin the integration of the PTERA into the NASA ATP through the delivery of a new PTERA baseline system to NASA. Several core capabilities that the PTERA would bring to the ATP include:1) A low-cost, low-risk flight test facility that can be used to expand ATP's role in the testing and validation of NASA's physics-based multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) tools2) The ability to flight test advanced aerodynamic treatments, health management and control systems, and to perform experiments in structures and aeroelasticity for a fraction of the cost of a manned flight test program.3) The ability to flight test cutting-edge and complex systems whose cost and risk are too high for manned flights.4) A testbed with modular airframe that enables the evaluation of multiple technologies with the same airframe.5) A testbed with a large payload capacity that facilitates the inexpensive and risk-mitigating flight test evaluation of a wide array of sensors and payloads as well as the evaluation of flight-test measurement systems before they transition to manned programs.6) The ability to perform unmanned, autonomous, flight experiments relating to the burgeoning field of autonomous unmanned aircraft, including experiments supporting UAS integration into the NAS.","A technology gap exists between well-controlled wind tunnel tests and full scale flight testing where most of the systems integration issues surface. Allocating these system integration activities to a full scale flight test is replete with safety, schedule and performance risks that dominate flight test costs. The PTERA platform serves as the bridge to integrate and flight test advanced aerodynamic treatments, health management, and control systems, and to perform experiments in structures and aero elasticity for a fraction of the cost of a manned flight test program. The PTERA flight test facility offers several distinct advantages to NASA and non-NASA customers. The PTERA configuration is representative of most commercial/transport aircraft and will provide relevant test data for these aircraft. PTERA's reconfigurability also allows cost effective testing of more unconventional designs that would otherwise be too dangerous or costly to test. Finally, PTERA's payload capacity and custom avionics allow it to host a multitude of subsystems for flight tests and in-flight tuning. PTERA's capabilities make it a perfect platform to support SFW, ERA, UAS in NAS, and the AvSP programs and has already begun to generate substantial interest from industry partners, who recognize PTERA's significant potential to reduce development time, cost, and risk of new systems including NextGen technologies.","Area-I has already received significant private sector interest in the PTERA as a cost reducing research and development tool. As such, Area-I is currently developing several avenues under which to market the PTERA. Area-I plans to develop PTERA as a production aircraft to sell as a research testbed and to provide flight testing, maintenance, and engineering support to these customers. Area-I will also maintain its own fleet of PTERA aircraft to provide flight testing for a wide range of customers. Several UAV avionics manufacturers and software developers, including gimbal camera, datalink, image processing, air sensor, IMU, and flight test equipment developers have all expressed interest in flying their products on the PTERA. Additionally, several large aircraft manufactures, in connection with the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA), have discussed having Area-I maintain an exclusive fleet of PTERA models for communal testing of NextGen developed systems. Phase II efforts to rigorously test the PTERA testbed as a research aircraft will allow the private sector to invest funds in PTERA with lower risk to improve the safety and efficiency of aircraft in the national airspace system. Data from Phase II flight testing will serve as baseline data for future flight tests and provides a clear transition to Phase III commercialization.","Acoustic/Vibration; Active Systems; Actuators & Motors; Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Antennas; Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Cables/Fittings; Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Coatings/Surface Treatments; Coding & Compression; Command & Control; Composites; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Contact/Mechanical; Conversion; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Fusion; Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Deployment; Destructive Testing; Detectors (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Electromagnetic; Emitters; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Filtering; Fluids; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Heat Exchange; Image Processing; Inertial; Intelligence; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Knowledge Management; Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Guidance & Tracking); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Weapons); Lenses; Lifetime Testing; Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Mission Training; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Multiplexers/Demultiplexers; Nanomaterials; Navigation & Guidance; Network Integration; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Outreach; Passive Systems; Perception/Vision; Polymers; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Process Monitoring & Control; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures; Support; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Teleoperation; Thermal; Training Concepts & Architectures; Transmitters/Receivers; Transport/Traffic Control; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems); Verification/Validation Tools"

In developing these demand sets, we are capitalizing on new technologies prototyped and demonstrated in Phase I of this project, in which our team demonstrated that credible flight demand sets for UAS missions can be developed using a combination of socioeconomic modeling combined with techniques derived from the activity-based modeling community.","NASA is already stood up a UAS Integration project and is committed to helping the FAA determine the issues and resolution of those issues for integrating UAS aircraft in the NAS.  Notably, Congress has directed FAA that it must have a plan in place for civilian use of UAS in the NAS by 2015.  The result of the phase II effort will be accessible by NASA analysts in all NASA laboratories without charge, and can be used in NASA fast-time systems (such as the Airspace Concepts Evaluation System—ACES—or the Multi Aircraft Control System—MACS—or any other fast-time system) to represent UAS vehicles in the virtual world.  Combined with a companion project that is underway at IAI to product machine-readable UAS performance files, a NASA analyst will have all the tools at his/her disposal to properly conduct the required research.  In addition, NASA researchers can use the future data sets produced by this phase II project in combination with the performance files produced by our companion project to represent UAS aircraft in human-in-the-loop (real-time) systems such as the Air Traffic Operations System (ATOS) or even the Future Flight Simulator (virtual tower) at NASA/Ames","The non-NASA commercial applications include analyses by private research organizations along the same lines that that government is conducting.  We would expect that UAS manufacturers will use our projections as a basis of their own business cases for building UAS aircraft, or for the analysis of how their UAS aircraft will mix with other UAS or piloted aircraft.  We would also expect that large airports and airport consultants will use our demand files as ""background traffic"" when they study the future growth at large airports.  While the UAS flights that we project in phase II may not themselves be using large airports, many of them will be flying in the vicinity of large airport such that airport planners cannot ignore their flight paths when planning for future growth at large airport.  In addition, large aircraft manufacturers may be interested in our projections to augment their own internal analyses or provide alternative views of future UAS flights.  Although it is impossible to estimate the size of this market, it is most likely many times larger than the government investment, as tens of thousands of commercial UAS aircraft are expected to enter some use in the civilian airspace within the next twenty to thirty years.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

RAMPS will include an in-flight dynamic contingency management capability that assesses ATC-requested re-routing and threats posed by weather to determine feasibility of modifications to the UAS flight trajectory.  RAMPS can operate as a recommender system, providing operators with a narrow list of best options to help facilitate timely decision-making.  RAMPS capabilities will provide UAS Operators with valuable time saving examination of a proposed route and possible contingency operations along that route – automating what has been an exceptionally tedious and lengthy manual process during mission planning.  The in-flight component of RAMPS will provide the UAS operator with a dynamic mission evaluation tool – exceptionally important when a reconnaissance and surveillance mission is introduced into the routing planning process.","Potential applications for the UAS contingency planning and management system beyond Phase II include use as a mission planning augmentation system to improve safety of NASA UAS flight operations and as a research and development tool supporting in-house simulations of UAS activity in the NAS.

RAMPS will be applicable to ongoing integrated system research projects and will beneficially impact NASA's contributions to standardized safety and certification of UAS in the NAS.","RAMPS will find a significant number of applications within federal and non-federal agencies.  Immediate customers include DoD UAS operators both within and beyond the NAS.

Anytime, anywhere connectivity for Earth, Moon and Mars is a stated goal, with high-bandwidth optical relay crosslinks for Earth, Moon, Mars and planets. Laser based optical communication links for space provides more than an order of magnitude higher data rates than corresponding RF links.. In addition, this is achieved with much smaller size, weight & power (SWaP) burden to spacecraft payloads, making spacecraft resources available to enhance or extend science missions, and the overall mission productivity. Tremendous progress made in 1.5um & 1-um fiber-optic fiber laser/amplifier technologies, their power scaling, and availability of reliable high-power components, makes such transmitters feasible for space mission application. In this SBIR proposal, we propose to develop 1.5mm fiber-amplifier based laser transmitters, with Pavg>4W, and compatible with a variety of M-ary PPM formats, that have a clear path to a space-qualification roadmap. In addition, power-scaling to 10W, athermal operation over a wide temperature range (with passive conductive cooling only), and improved power efficiency, are simultaneously addressed. Limited scope qualification tests relevant for space environment will also be conducted. These activities leverage prior and ongoing related activities at Fibertek, on high-performance, high-reliability fiber laser transmitters.","The primary NASA application for this SBIR is to support  high bandwidth lasercom  spaceflight and aircraft flight terminals for planetary missions, as well as for various lunar & Mars relay links identified in the SCaN roadmap. The core space-qualifiable, robust, compact and efficient lidar component technology developed in this SBIR is also directly applicable to remote sensing for planetary and asteroids missions. The technology can be used for atmospheric sensing of CO2, methane by   frequency converting into the  mid-IR.  A low power version of the laser developed could be used for topological mapping, descent and landing utilizing the high frequency encoding capability of the laser.The proposed laser technology is directly applicable for  coherent lidar applications. NASA is funding coherent lidar technology as an aircraft mounted sensor for aviation-safety to detection of wake vortices, wind shear, turbulence and improved vision. The core laser technology can be used for atmospheric water and ice discrimination.This core technology is directly applicable for NASA JPL's 2.05um CO2 lidar approach for Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS).

To reach these higher speed data rates, increases to the overall system gain of the communication link will be required. A deterministic method to increase system gain of a RF communication link is to provide higher transmitted RF power. However, with this higher RF output power also comes the challenge of maximizing power efficiency and reducing the size weight and power (SWAP) of the power amplifier (PA) for long-range space missions. The innovation will be to develop a Solid-State Power Amplifier (SSPA) that produces 50 W of linear RF (100W max) at X-Band (8.5 GHz) with high DC-to-RF-efficiency (> 50%) and low mass. The significance will be the utilization of wide band-gap RF semiconductors to efficiently create high RF power that is robust to the high radiation environments of space. A wide band-gap compound semiconductor material such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) will provide this required innovation. GaN-based Field Effect Transistors (FETs) have the potential to operate at power densities of up to 10 times that of conventional RF semiconductor technologies, which will enable compact PAs with higher RF output power to be implemented. The proposed GaN PA design is estimated to be >50% smaller in both size and weight compared to existing TWTA solutions and almost 20% lower in power consumption for typical designs used in long-range space RF Telecommunications.

Scintillation-hardening techniques will be applied to an open-source waveform ported to the SCaN platform.  This will result in improved GPS navigation during geomagnetic storms.The ported waveform will be STRS-compliant and open source.  It will provide a validation of the STRS architecture and software defined radio technology for space applications.  While operational, the waveform will autonomously detect scintillation and automatically switch into a data collection mode for relaying the GPS samples to the SCaN avionics subsystem for later transmission to White Sands.The open-source, STRS-compliant waveform software and GB of GPS scintillation data will be enduring products of the flight demonstration.  The STRS infrastructure will be expanded with the STRS tool kit produced during this project.  The STRS tool kit will be similar to the OSSIE tool kit for the SCA, providing automatic code generation of STRS wrappers and interfaces.  An eclipse-based framework will provide drag-and-drop of components for developing STRS-compliant software.","The SBIR is producing product valuable to NASA across a breadth of missions  such as ISS, TIROS, Stardust, Mini-Sat, and CubeSats.  The scintillation-hardening improves the reliability of GPS for lower-orbit missions and the STRS-compliance permits mission redundancy.  A software-defined radio implementation allows a single hardware element to function as either a conventional radio, or GPS, providing backup and redundancy for platforms such as the ISS and high-value remote sensing platforms.  Packages such as the Stardust mission's return capsule can benefit from the flexibility of a software defined radio implementation that can provide GPS and communications from a single hardware system, saving cost, weight, and power.  Scintillation hardening improves mission reliability and flexibility.  Lower cost, low-orbit missions benefit directly from the STRS-compliant software package that enables low-cost, single-radio hardware systems that can function as a communications system or GPS system.  Because scintillation effects increase at the lower altitudes, mission reliability will be improved with the scintillation hardening.","CubeSats have primarily been a university curiosity.  The August 2012 launch of the Atlas V from Vandenberg AFB ferried 11 CubeSats as auxiliary payloads.  Of the eleven, three are government or Department of Defense, and three are commercial satellites.   Although we anticipate university interest to continue, the presence of the Department of Defense and commercial satellites in this launch indicates this market is about to open up with significant funding and resources.  We believe there is great potential for STRS products and our GPS waveform in CubeSats.The most likely commercial product though, is software services.  Similar to the dilemma confronted by Red Hat software in 1993, there is an established tier or monopoly of space product contractors and suppliers.  To penetrate the market, we must provide a disruptive product that will compel system integrators to investigate our product.  'Free' is a powerful economic force, and one that has been successful in switching many markets from traditional suppliers to smaller and more agile software developers.Our business model is to develop the STRS Eclipse-based software tools and distribute them open source.  We will also publish a scintillation-hardened GPS software as open source.  Because schedule is equivalent to cost for many programs, we will provide subscriptions and consulting for those programs desiring direct assistance.","Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Navigation & Guidance; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Transmitters/Receivers; Verification/Validation Tools"

Therefore, there are no igniters currently on the market that are well suited to NOFBX™ engines, which is the motivation for this proposal.  Because this igniter would be manufactured and sold as part of NOFBX™ propulsion systems, the market for this technology is closely tied to adoption and use of NOFBX™ propulsion technology.","NOFBX technology is currently being developed under a NASA BAA for flight on the International Space Station as a commercial flight experiment. The proposed activity would upgrade the ignition element of this flight system reducing mass, volume, and power of the device as well as conductive and radiative emission characteristics. Given the commercial interest in the NOFBX propulsion technology, we anticipate this block upgrade ignition module to be readily integrated into the NOFBX product line being developed by Innovation Space Propulsion Systems, the licensee of NOFBX technology.",Ablative Propulsion; Atmospheric Propulsion; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Spacecraft Main Engine; Surface Propulsion

Two primary challenges must be overcome to enable the use of composite tanks for these new classes of heavy launchers. One is to develop novel, microcrack-resistant, polymer matrix composite materials that will enable the manufacture of 5 to 10 meter diameter composite tanks, and the second is to develop out-of-autoclave manufacturing methods. In response, CTD is developing novel matrix materials based on toughened epoxy and benzoxazines to meet these goals and exceed the performance of current state of the art materials. The end goal of the Phase II program is to advance the material systems suitable for out-of-autoclave fabrication of very large cryotank (10 meter diameter) structures from TRL 3 to TRL 4. The proposed Phase II SBIR program will be a synergistic effort between analytical assessments of material performance requirements, material and process development, testing to assess material performance improvements and the ability to manufacture these novel materials into microcrack resistant composites laminates and cryotanks.","The linerless composite cryogenic tank technology that is proposed herein can provide enabling capabilities for several near-term and longer-term NASA mission goals including those intended for future heavy launch vehicles, planetary and asteroid decent and accent vehicles, in-orbit spacecraft re-fueling as well as for long term storage in deep space on one planetary surfaces such as the moon. Indeed, the development of lightweight, linerless composite tanks for these applications will help to reduce mass, which is a critical need for these systems. Lightweight composite tanks can also be used for storage of hydrogen in fuel cell driven high altitude long duration aircraft as well as other unmanned air vehicles with varying mission objectives. In addition to storage tanks, the manufacturing technology being developed here can be used for composite cryogenic piping and other aircraft parts.","The linerless composite cryogenic tank technology that is proposed herein, can provide enabling capabilities for a variety of other government, industrial, and commercial uses.  For example we have initiated discussions with BMW, who is pursuing the use of pressurized, cryogenically cooled hydrogen gas as their hydrogen storage approach for fuel cell powered vehicles. Liquid hydrogen tanks can store more fuel in a given volume (i.e. higher energy density) when compared to their compressed gas counterparts. Cryogenic gaseous hydrogen has been identified as the fuel of choice for many hydrogen car and vehicle manufacturers, including public transportation vehicles, since they all share a common interest of extended range and greater hours of operation. If the cryotank technology proposed in this effort can result in a viable cryogen storage product any and all applications and uses where cryogens are stored and transported will be potential applications for this SBIR developed technology and the resulting products.",Composites; Fuels/Propellants; Polymers; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Storage

The Light Microscopy Module (LMM), which was developed and is being managed by the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC), is one such facility currently operating and producing fascinating results on ISS. LMM will yield even more astonishing results with the addition of enhancing subsystems. Techshot is currently developing one such subsystem, the LMM-Dynamic Stage (LMM-DS), which will satisfy a host of new experiments proposed for LMM. However, GRC has many more researchers awaiting the ultimate enhancing subsystems for conducting colloid science experiments in the LMM that could lead to new advanced materials with significant commercial potential. Capitalizing on Techshot's rapid progress with the LMM-DS, the company's vast array of mixing and separations technologies, and its extensive experience with microfluidic systems, a series of Colloid SPEcialty Cell Systems (C-SPECS) will be developed by Techshot for use in the LMM-DS. These innovative low-volume mixing devices will enable uniform particle density and remotely controlled repetition of LMM colloids experiments. In addition C-SPECS will minimize crew time, as well as avert the need for multiple, costly colloid samples that are expended after only one examination. C-SPECS are vital analytical microgravity research technologies that will greatly enhance the capability of the LMM, thereby enabling ISS to become even more effective as a national laboratory.","The proposed C-SPECS devices offer important new technologies needed for on-orbit analysis, as well as the chance to leverage existing ISS facilities for new scientific payloads. This is expected to lead to many new potential NASA commercial applications and opportunities. In particular, Techshot expects to commercialize C-SPECS by incorporating them into the company's spaceflight service program that it offers to NASA mission programs, as well as to other government agencies.  By further automating the experiment process, C-SPECS allows more colloid samples to be processed more quickly, while minimizing the need for crew time. This high-throughput capability afforded by C-SPECS can lead to far more efficient and productive use of the LMM, which will help NASA more fully realize its vision for the ISS as a national laboratory.","Techshot serves as an Implementation Partner to NASA and CASIS for enabling space flight experimentation on ISS. Building on its heritage of developing and integrating space flight hardware, as well as conducting scientific research in space, Techshot offers flight experiment services to non-NASA customers, such as researchers from universities and the private sector. Techshot's successful experience with microgravity processing facilities such as the Avian Development Facility and the ADvanced Space Experiment Processor positions the company as a leader in offering these unique services. Soon, the LMM-DS when coupled with the innovative capabilities of C-SPECS is expected to give Techshot an even greater competitive advantage in attracting commercial research customers. Furthermore, with the ability of commercial launch vehicles (e.g. SpaceX, Orbital, Boeing) to get more experiment samples into orbit, once these vehicles begin routine visits to the ISS, the economics of transporting and processing materials in microgravity should become far more compelling. Eventually, given sufficient economical commercial launch vehicle transporting capacity, when coupled with Techshot's cadre of space processing equipment, C-SPECS could become an important element for processing larger quantities of high-value materials for non-NASA commercial customers in the unique environment of space.",Adaptive Optics; Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Biophysical Utilization; Fluids; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Process Monitoring & Control

The corrosion mechanisms of greatest interest are salt and acid attack due to exposure to brackish and untreated waters.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with Ferrum College, proposes the development of a protective barrier conversion coating to prevent corrosion cell formation in steel substrates.","The proposed polyoxometalate conversion coating will find application in reducing life-cycle costs of piping systems subject to microbial-influenced corrosion in the presence of untreated or brackish water.  The environmentally friendly chrome-free conversion coating is expected to perform not only as a corrosion inhibitor to microbially induced corrosion, but also function as a smart coating that will passivate metal exposed in organic-coating topcoats and at defects in the conversion coating.

The ability to provide precise positioning and pointing in real-time is a capability needed for formation flying, rendezvous and proximity operations, and radio and laser altimetry. To address this need, Emergent Space Technologies will develop a low SWaP codeless GPS receiver that will be capable of precise and real-time orbit determination. Currently, precise orbital determination is performed on the ground since real-time GPS differential corrections won't be available on orbit until they are broadcast by the TDRSS Augmentation Satellite System (TASS). The proposed innovation will combine the capability to receive TASS messages with SCP and the Goddard Enhanced Orbital Navigation System (GEONS) to provide precise PNT capabilities. SCP can track the L1 P(Y) chipping code-phase without an encryption module since it is codeless. Combining this capability with the ability to receive TASS messages in GEONS, on a suitable hardware platform will enable kinematic GPS capable of decimeter-level positioning in real-time. This effort determines how to best integrate these technologies, and to find a suitable host.","The proposed system can be utilized for any NASA mission in which GPS tracking is desired, and is especially useful for small satellites where SWaP concerns are critical. Because the system proposed integrates real time correction messages with a highly accurate codeless GPS navigation system which shares a heritage with JPL Blackjack technology, and utilizes GEONS as a Kalman Filter Navigation engine, deci-meter level positioning accuracies are possible. This high accuracy real time positioning enables future missions in which these are desirable goals. Due to the abilities of the unique receiver design proposed, it is possible to extend the sensor for scientific missions such as ionosphere profiling, and to extend navigation ability to degraded GPS or complex orbits such as those higher than GPS.","The proposed receiver system has significant applicability to DOD needs for positioning in orbits where conventional GPS is difficult, and can be extended to operate in cases where GPS is denied. The ability to produce highly accurate positions in a low cost, low swap, form factor, and in a software defined radio implementation has applications for operationally responsive space, in which a satellite must be assembled and launched quickly. Commercial applications include any application in which highly accurate positioning is required, in any orbital regime.

Under this program an all-solid-state parametric-converted laser will be delivered to NASA LaRC which will be suitable for acquiring range-resolved and column CH4 measurements, and compatible with integration into an airborne methane DIAL system under future programs.  Due to its relative insensitivity to aerosol and cloud interferences, a DIAL system based on this pulsed laser source will be ideal for NASA investigating high-latitude CH4 releases over polar ice sheets, permafrost regions, wetlands and over open ocean during night and day. In addition the methane lidar system has commercial applications in detection of fossil fuel leaks.  This development advances the laser system TRL from 3 to 5. The proposed laser is designed to be compatible with manned or UAV platforms and traceable to space=based instruments.","NASA markets include planned airborne metane DIAL systems and eventually space-based sensors. These applications are all for low-volume high value systems, which makes DIAL instruments a viable product for small business.  Methane is cited as an important atmospheric variable by several panel reports in the Decadal Survey for Earth Science Applications from Space. NASA's plan for climate-centric investigations recognizes the importance of CH4 and discusses the potential for capability on the follow-on to OCO-2.  A U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Plan currently under development recognizes the importance of CH4 and emphasizes the importance of an integrated system to collect and maintain the essential data that drive scientific understanding. The laser source proposed under this SBIR directly addresses these needs.","Methane lidar systems are being deployed for commercial gas leak detection, mainly in Europe, and as airborne pollution sensors and for wide area characterization of methane atmospheric content in support of global warming research. The major contributors in this area are in Germany and France.   Currently there is little analogous work in the US.  The sensor developed under this SBIR program is designed primarily for airborne deployment.  WIth increased exploitation of natural gas reserves detection of leaks from wells and pipe lines is becoming increasingly more important.  We anticipate that successful demonstration of airborne methane DAIL by NASA will introduce this technique to the commercial sector.

(www.NxGENelectronics.com), teamed with its subcontractor Linear Signal, LLC (www.linearsignal.com) has successfully completed a Phase I contract for the 2011 NASA SBIR Phase I, Topic S1.02, subtopic, ""Low Cost mm-wave Beamforming MMIC Receiver"". These receivers, operating at 35.6 GHz and 94 GHz, are targeted for the space-borne, polarimetric, Doppler-capable radar for the NASA Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) Mission, the successor to other cloud-study satellite missions such as CloudSat and EarthCare. The radar antenna itself will consist of 3.3 meter wide, 35.6 GHz and 94 GHz co-located linear antenna arrays that scan across the direction of orbit. The size of integrated receiver electronics behind each of these arrays does not extend beyond the antenna outline.  The critical physical specification for phased array antennas is the spacing between antenna elements. At 94 GHz, this implies an element spacing of 1.6 mm, while at 35.6 GHz the spacing is more generous at ~4.2 mm.   Then, for this particular configuration of 3.3 meter wide arrays the total number of receive elements is ~800 for the 35.6 GHz antenna and ~2048 for the 94 GHz antenna.  The  integrated receiver combines multiple array elements and their supporting circuitry into one integrated electronics package which results in an order of magnitude reduction in per channel cost and size.   Moreover, the decrease in package interconnect will also result in marked increase in reliability.The other main goal of this project is to meet the functional requirements for W-band receiver.  The original requirements per the Phase I solicitation is as follows:- Frequencies: 35.6, 94 GHz- Input Channels: 16 - Phase shifter: 360 degrees, 5 bits- Serial phase update rate: > 10 kHz for all channels- Output IF: 1 channel,  < 2 GHz- Bandwidth: >100 MHz","NASA/JPL has ongoing mission plans for numerous critical earth observing and planetary missions. Many of them have in common the need for phased array radars optimized for specific frequencies, small size, low cost, and high functionality.   From JPL, the deliverable packaged Rx beamformer MMIC from this Phase II will be used as the baseline to develop a fully functional MMIC Beamformer Receiver for a Phase IIe 10 cm wide linear demonstrator array.  This would require the design and manufacture of 8 16 input Rx modules which would implement the more functional block diagram. The demonstrator array would in turn be used to win a contract for the 3.3m orbiting radar envisioned for the ACES program. This would require roughly 256 16 input MMIC beamformers.","NASA/JPL has ongoing mission plans for numerous critical earth observing and planetary experiments and data collection.

Each receiver is tuned to the 180GHz frequency, while the intermediate frequency (IF) reaches 500MHz. The IF signal is quantized at 1GHz with 2-bit accuracy. The resulting data rate is 700Gb/s. This data has to be pre-processed aboard the satellite before it can be transmitted to Earth for further processing. One of the steps of such data processing is cross-correlation. For a space borne instrument, power dissipation and radiation hardness are among the most important requirements. Pacific Microchip Corp. is designing an ASIC that includes a cross-correlation unit with interfaces for the GeoSTAR's receivers. The ASIC will have greatly reduced power consumption compared to that of the FPGA-based or classic ASIC-based implementations. This ASIC must be designed and integrated with already existing system components of the GeoSTAR instrument. The ASIC includes cross-correlation cells based on novel architecture. The deep submicron SOI CMOS technology selected for the ASIC's fabrication will increase its tolerance to the total ionizing dose (TID) and reduce the probability of radiation-induced latch-up. The design of the ASIC will follow design for testability (DFT) methods, which will simplify characterization and testing of the fabricated ASIC, reduce risk and lower the cost of the product.","The proposed ASIC is intended for processing the GeoSTAR instrument's microwave sounder signals. The ASIC will cross-correlate the signals of 2X125 receivers located on two arms of the Y shaped antenna. A total of three ASICs will be employed for the complete cross-correlation function required for the instrument. The proposed cross-correlator ASIC can also find application in signal processing required for radio telescopes that employ more than 2,000 receivers, such as the SKA. The cross-correlators installed on such telescopes consume tens of kilowatts of power. The novel ASIC offers a reduction of power consumption by at least an order.

If the wavefront is distorted, the light imaged on the CCD sensor consists of displaced spots and missing spots. This information can be used to calculate the shape of the wavefront that was incident on the microlens array. Another application is in 3D imaging and displays. The use of a GI lens array can define the viewing directions for a pair of interlaced images and hence enable the observer to see a 3D stereoscopic image.

The bulk nature of the material will provide an unprecedented degree of freedom in core geometry design over existing ribbon-form amorphous alloys, allowing for net shape, drop-in fluxgate cores that can compete with, or exceed noise levels observed in the 6-81.3 permalloy family.  The Phase I effort brought the technology from observed trends in materials, a TRL of 1, to a level wherein analytical obersevations and proofs of concept have been carried out, a TRL of 3.  During the Phase II effort, we projection a minimum TRL of 4 at the completion of the effort.","The predominant NASA commercial application lies in a drop-in replacement for current 6-81.3 permalloy fluxgate ring cores.

As such, there are relatively few appropriate materials that are commercially available and viable alternatives to the diminishing supply of permalloy material.  Consultation with NASA customers, particularly those in the GSFC mag group, will place Prime Photonics in a unique position to offer a material that has been designed specifically for use in NASA space-based magnetometer missions.Additional uses of the proposed technology lie in magnetic shielding as replacements for mu-metal materials.  The amorphous nature of our materials have the potential to provided enhanced reduction in eddy current generation, and advanced flux steering around sensitive components.

While there exist alternative magnetic sensing technologies more suitable to terrestrial applications, certain of those technologies can benefit from the advanced material properties of the proposed technology.

As such, we can tailo the material to provide for elevated magnetostriction of increased permeability, both of which can serve as foundations for alternative sensor modalities.

This sensor will provide rapid (10 Hz), real-time, accurate measurements of these important trace gases with minimal calibration.  The SBIR instrument will be capable of both terrestrial and airborne deployment to provide data in the troposphere, tropopause, and stratosphere.  The resulting system will allow NASA researchers to acquire data that complements satellite observations made from missions in the Earth Observing System.  The data will help elucidate stratospheric aerosol loading and terrestrial CO2 fluxes to improve climate models.In Phase I, LGR demonstrated technical feasibility by fabricating an Off-Axis ICOS system for OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O quantification in ambient air.  The prototype was highly precise (OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O to better than �4 ppt, �0.2 ppm, �0.31 ppb, and �3.7 ppm respectively), linear (R2 > 0.9997) over a wide dynamic range, and fast (2-Hz response), with no appreciable cross-interference between the measured species.  Subsequently, LGR deployed the Phase I prototype locally and at a DOE Ameriflux site (Sherman Island, California). In Phase II, LGR will develop and deliver two autonomous OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O analyzers for terrestrial flux and airborne monitoring respectively.  The first analyzer, which will measure these gases at up to 10 Hz in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, will be tested with Professor Chris Still for long-term monitoring and Professor Dennis Baldocci for eddy-flux measurements.  The second instrument will be packaged for deployment aboard a select NASA aircraft, and include provisions for ambient temperature, humidity, and pressure fluctuatons.  The flight sensor will be tested using a modified Mooney TLS with Dr. Stephen Conley and then deployed aboard a NASA aircraft.","The primary objective of the NASA Earth Science Division is to determine how the global environment is changing, what drives these changes, and the potential consequences for human civilization.  In order to better research atmospheric properties, NASA requires instrumentation that is capable of measuring several key gaseous species, including OCS, CO2, CO, and H2O.  OCS plays a critical role stratospheric aerosol formation and may serve a carbon cycle tracer for photosynthesis.  Thus, NASA requires new technologies that make stand-alone, in-situ measurements of OCS with faster time response (e.g. 1 Hz) and comparable accuracy aboard both airborne and terrestrial platforms with no sample preparation or transport.  Additional measurements of CO2, CO, and H2O are also necessary to provide information on carbon dioxide respiration, combustion emissions, and dry-mole fractions.  In addition to NASA's environmental science needs, several other NASA programs can benefit from the technologies developed during this SBIR, including the NASA Astronaut Health Monitoring Program.  The difficulties associated with manned space travel necessitate the development of point-of-care medical instrumentation that can gauge astronaut health.  LGR's proposed mid-infrared Off-Axis ICOS analyzer enables the implementation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) medical breath diagnostic tests aboard space vehicles.  Such tests provide initial indicators of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","Besides its importance to NASA, the development of a highly sensitive, mid-infrared trace gas analyzer has several commercial applications.

This proposal seeks funding to develop an in-water ""Hybridspectral"" capability that combines two differing practices for data collection (multiwaveband and hyperspectral) to satisfy the diversity, accuracy, and precision requirements of future ocean color missions.  Called the Compact Hybridspectral Radiometer (C-HyR), C-HyR places special focus on two important priorities from the call: 1) Instruments making measurements of the apparent optical properties; and 2) Hyperspectral radiometers (340 - 900 nm) for use in near-surface profiling.  The C-HyR system leverages a 2004 NASA SBIR microradiometer development that lead to the Compact-Optical Profiling System (C-OPS), a commercially available multiwaveband radiometer system and adds a spectrograph-based upwelling Radiance Collector Assembly (RCA) for operations very near the surface of the water at the top of a vertical profile.  In Phase II, attention will be paid to spectrograph selection with the goal of making optically valid measurements out to 900 nm, as requested in the call.  For improved deployment security and shadow avoidance, the system uses an innovative buoyancy backplane with twin positioning thrusters to ensure ship avoidance and allow maneuvering the profiler to a desired sampling location.  The result is an innovative expansion of existing state-of-the-art commercial instruments to include a spectral sampling capability that exceeds current and planned satellite requirements, and that can operate in optically complex near-shore regions.  The benefits of this new sampling capability are an improved ability to separate the biotic and abiotic components of seawater, an improved ocean color mission calibration and validation capability into Case 2 waters, reduced deployment effort, and reduced deployment risks.","C-HyR directly supports NASA satellite and aircraft missions and associated cal/val activities (e.g. PACE/ACE, GEO-CAPE, HyspIRI, AVIRIS, MODIS, and VIIRS).  The hybridspectral nature of C-HyR is well suited to support the shallow-water, near-shore, and precision sampling objectives driving the GEO-CAPE mission which include understanding the dynamics of coastal ecosystems, river plumes, and tidal fronts, tracking oil spills and other waterborne hazardous materials, as well as optical monitoring in regions of special biological significance such as bays, marshes, and estuaries.  In addition to wide spectral coverage, the wide dynamic range in responsivity and flexible architecture ensures that C-HyR supports ecosystem-focused ocean ecology missions, such as VIIRS/NPP and PACE/ACE as well as the goals of the Carbon and Ecosystems Roadmap.  This includes quantification of carbon budgets at sub-regional local scales, coastal carbon dynamics, or terrestrial applications, In addition to validating radiometric models, these systems have an immediate application in ground and ocean color validation studies.  This support includes deployments from small near-coastal vessels or even a variant of C-HyR for autonomous drifters.  In addition to reduced uncertainties and increased data product accuracy, the C-HyR passive and dynamic free-fall protocols also control deployment risks associated with operations on large oceanographic vessels, such as entanglement with a ship's screw.","Non-NASA benefits to this technology parallel the direct benefit to NASA, that is, commercial sales of C-HyR outside of NASA.  In addition to satellite Cal/Val programs by other nations, such as Japan (SGLI), India, or Germany, C-HyR directly supports an increased opportunity for multidisciplinary studies in the field, such as near-shore to basin-wide phytoplankton ecological research, UV photodegradation of petroleum events, and fisheries studies such as visual predation or breeding cycles.  International and domestic potential customers for this technology include government, university, and privately funded researchers interested in ocean color, phytoplankton ecology, fisheries, or photodegradation.  Water quality monitoring and municipal drinking water systems are also valued but non-traditional markets for profiling systems such as C-HyR.",Infrared; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Radiometric; Ultraviolet; Visible

We propose to develop new gamma-ray and neutron detectors based on wide-band-gap (WBG) solid-state photomultiplier (SSPM) photodetectors coupled to emerging scintillation materials such as Cs2YLiCl6:Ce (CLYC), and CeBr3 for gamma and neutron spectroscopic studies of planet surfaces and small cosmic bodies. The proposed SSPM photodetector for scintillation readout is based on AlGaAs, a WBG compound semiconductor with aluminum concentration of 60% to 90%. The ~2-eV band-gap energy of this material is engineered to match the emission spectrum of both CLYC and CeBr3. The high band-gap of AlGaAs also provides much lower dark noise and better radiation tolerance than Si-based detectors. Compared to conventional PMTs, the compact size, low voltage operation, and lighter weight of AlGaAs SSPM is ideal for spaced-based instruments. The advantages of AlGaAs SSPMs and the excellent detection properties of CLYC and CeBr3 scintillation materials make them a perfect match in the development of new gamma and neutron spectrometers for planetary science.","The proposed innovative technology is a suitable component for a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer that can be used for Earth science missions, planetary missions, exploration of small cosmic bodies such as asteroids and comets, satellite radio-imaging, and space exploration probes. The nature of the detectors, as having a high signal-to-noise ratio, excellent energy resolution, low power consumption, and resiliency to harsh radiation environments, can open the door for improved gamma and neutron spectroscopy in future NASA planetary missions.","The development of the new gamma-ray and neutron detectors has a myriad of applications in the science, homeland security, and medical fields.  The AlGaAs SSPM, with its low thermal noise and radiation hardness, makes it an excellent photodetector for scintillation detection of high energy x-rays, gammas, neutrons, and protons in nuclear and high energy physics experiments.

OptiPro's UltraForm Finishing (UFF) is a sub-aperture compliant wheel and belt type polishing process for rapid material removal from the ground state to a finished optic. The UFF removes residual grinding sub-surface damage, mid spatial frequency errors, and provides the mechanism required for surface corrections. OptiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities along with a support partnership with the University of Rochester Mechanical Engineering Department and the Penn State EOC, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards solving the difficult problems associated with, grinding, polishing and metrology of large complex optical surfaces. The UFF, with its 5-6 axis of motion provides a platform to polish traditional flats and spheres as well as aspheres and freeform shapes. The UFF was designed for deep concave shapes and it is suitable for finishing conformal optics. The Proposed Phase II will include further development on UFF using a 200 mm x 200 mm fused quartz mandrel to optimize the process to meet NASA's X-ray optical requirements. Grinding development will also be performed on OptiPro's eSX platforms to minimize material removal required during polishing. The part geometry will be measured by a non contact optical probe using OptiPro's UltraSurf free-form measurement system. Once development is complete, OptiPro will work on the mandrels that will be supplied by Goddard Space Flight Center to attempt to correct the form error on those surfaces. OptiPro will also build and install a 6-axis UFF machine to NASA. The UFF platform will be used for development during the Phase II effort, and installed at NASA at the end of the contract.","UltraForm Finishing (UFF) is a CNC controlled process designed to remove grinding sub surface damage as well as mid spatial frequency errors for both relatively ""soft"" glasses as well as ""hard"" metals and ceramics for many applications. These applications may include the fabrication offorming mandrels used to produce multiple segmented shell mirrors for the International X-Ray Observatory (IXO). The aspheric and freeform optical surfaces required by LISA and WFIRST will benefit from the fabrication advances made with this endeavor. By integrating finite elementanalysis (FEA) tools with the UFF computer aided manufacturing (CAM) interface, we will be able to optimize the fabrication process and subsequently reduce and/or completely eliminate mid spatialfrequency errors. The UFF has the capability to work with a wide range of traditional optical mediums (i.e., combination of belt materials and loose abrasives) in addition to wheels that range from approximately 20 mm up to 150 mm. This makes the UFF suitable for polishing a wide variety of materials for other segmented types of telescope systems such as the Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST). The wide variety of loose and bound abrasives allows the UltraForm platform to finish hard ceramics, Silicon and SiC. With these hard to process materials,the UFF has shown promise for grinding as well as polishing optical surfaces, on a small scale.","Since 1989 OptiPro has developed and refined conceptual technologies into robust deterministic machines and processes for the optical fabrication industry. Non-NASA commercial applications include the fabrication of flats, spheres, aspheres, and complex conformal shapes such asaerodynamic ogive domes. Commercialization of these technologies has driven very cost effective solutions. The UFF polishing tools' ability to polish a variety of materials from the ground state, removing grinding marks and subsurface damage, makes it especially attractive for applications where mid-spatial-frequency surface errors are an issue such as EUV lithography. Another application is for laser amplifiers, such as the Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, at the University of Rochester. For these types of applications, laser damage threshold and irradiance distribution are critical and therefore mid-spatial frequency errors need to be minimized after the polishing stage.",Adaptive Optics; Ceramics; Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Lenses; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Metallics; Mirrors; Optical; Processing Methods

Inc. will develop a high throughput Hall effect thruster with a nominal peak power of 1-kW and wide throttling range in terms of both power and Isp. In Phase I the preliminary thruster design was completed.  Project activities focused on achieving a magnetic field that shields the discharge channel from ion induced erosion.  The goal is to achieve a propellant throughput greater than 100 kg/kW.  Numerical modeling is playing a critical role in the thruster design.  In Phase I, we used a fluid based code developed by JPL to model the plasma in an existing thruster that is currently undergoing life testing.  The erosion predictions of the model were found to agree well with actual measurements.  The numerical model was then applied to the magnetically shielded 1-kW thruster and preliminary results were found to be reasonable.  The goal is to demonstrate a thruster design where channel erosion is entirely eliminated as a life limiting mechanism.In Phase II, we will build and test the extended lifetime thruster.  The performance, lifetime, and plume properties of the thruster will then be evaluated, and the design will be optimized.  Numerical modeling will be used throughout the process to ensure that magnetic shielding is achieved.  Code predictions will be grounded in plasma measurements taken with a variety of diagnostics including channel wall probes, high speed intrusive channel probes, and plume probes.  The ability of the thruster to achieve its lifetime goals will be assessed through a 500 hour wear test.  When the design is finalized, an engineering development unit (EDU) thruster will be designed, built, validated, and delivered to NASA.  The EDU thruster design will be modeled thermally and structurally to facilitate the transition to Phase III.  At the end of the Phase II, the TRL will be 5/6.","Implementing magnetic shielding has application across the spectrum of thruster power and sizes and is therefore a cross-cutting technology.The thruster will be well suited for orbit raising and interplanetary transfers, supporting exploration and science missions.  The demonstrated throttling ability is important for a singular thruster that might be called upon to propel a spacecraft from Earth to Mars or Venus.  Mars orbits at 1.52 AU, which reduces the solar constant to 43% of the value at Earth.  As a result the output power of a nominal 600 W array reduces to 260 W at Mars as a spacecraft travels between these planets. For NASA low power, high throughput electric propulsion systems are an enabling technology for radio isotope powered spacecraft for sample and return missions identified in the NASA Decadal Survey.  A study conducted by the SMD ISPT Project in 2004 confirmed the significant potential of REP for space science, especially with recent advancements in enabling, high –specific-power RPS technology (from 3 to over 8 We/kg).  The study also concluded that REP would be ready for near-term NASA science missions if an electric propulsion thruster with the appropriate specific impulse and propellant throughput capability could be developed.  Examples of missions examined by this study include: 1) Trojan Asteroid Orbiters, 2) Jupiter Polar Orbiter with probes and 3)Comet Surface Sample Return (Tempel 1)","Commercial applications for the proposed system include orbit raising, circularization, inclination changes, repositioning, and station-keeping.  For higher power missions, the system would be clustered.  Commercial applications for a clustered system include a small electric upper-stage.  Other applications include a system for de-orbiting spacecraft that have reached their end of life.","Lifetime Testing; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

Such techniques will be critical for deep space missions that face inhospitable environments, unpredictable operating conditions, and communication delays. The distributed nature of agent-based control will also support plug-and-play capabilities for modular power systems. The first main focus of the Phase II effort is to expand and refine the International Space Station (ISS) model library created in the Phase I. This will enable advanced energy management studies by supporting the interconnection of multiple channels. In addition, hardware validation of both component and system models will be pursued. Finally, Distributed Heterogeneous Simulation will be applied to the system models to accelerate simulation speed. The second main focus of the Phase II will be to utilize the simulation environment to investigate agent-based autonomous controls. In particular, the ability of agent-based controls to perform in scenarios that stress conventional controls will be analyzed. This ability will also be examined when communication constraints (such as sample rates and latencies) and packet loss are present. Lastly, the ISS system model will be integrated with hardware agent emulators setting the stage for hardware experimentation in future efforts.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The most obvious and immediate NASA application for this technology is the ISS, which was used as the demonstration system for the Phase I. The ISS has a complex electrical power system that is redundant and segmented in nature. In addition, several factors including humans-in-the-loop and communication latency make the investigation into autonomous control of the ISS attractive. NASA's Advanced Modular Power System (AMPS) program is another potential application. The repeated use of modular components is particularly well-suited to analysis with a model library where parameters are flexible but the underlying mathematical model is the same. Additionally, an agent-based control scheme could provide modularity and plug-and-play capability to the controls as well as the electrical components. The wide applicability of the demonstrated approach enables this technology to also be applied to other robust and autonomous electrical power systems such as satellites, landers, rovers and other isolated or limited contact vehicles used during space missions.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; Other types of power systems can take advantage of the simulation architecture and proposed control approach. For example, terrestrial microgrid based systems that incorporate renewable energy sources are similar in nature to the ISS. These applications could include military operating bases or large office buildings. It should be noted that these systems can be either ac or dc in nature; however, the overall modeling environment and control structure can be largely the same. In the case of terrestrial microgrids, the simulation environment will provide (1) an inexpensive and fast means of simulating a detailed model (three-phase detail) of the dynamic system's electromechanical characteristics during isolated or near-isolated operation with potential new nuclear, solar, or wind power sources; (2) information to electric grid researchers regarding the control and aggregation of renewable energy sources which can lead to better informed decisions of stability and future system planning; and (3) an opportunity to electric grid system operators to evaluate the feasibility and advantages of a real-time or near-real-time simulation in the control of an electric grid for online dynamic security assessment, system control and/or reconfiguring, robustness to loss of system components, and operator training of a larger scale electric grid.; ; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Distribution/Management; Mission Training; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)"

A flight control computer, 2 Star Trackers, 3 reaction wheels and 3 electromagnets are incorporated in a 4"" x 4"" x 3"" (3/4U) CubeSat sized module.   The system is based on the highly successful MAI-400 miniADACS and extends its performance capability to the 0.1deg range by incorporation of 2 star cameras and attitude determination software.  Phase I developed the software algorithms and prototyped the star cameras and electronics.  Phase II consists of a development program culminating with a system at TRL 7.  The technology is significant because it extends the capability of current low cost Nanosats to tactical imaging and other missions requiring fine pointing and dynamic retargeting, missions hitherto restricted to large and expensive spacecraft.  The MAI-400SS will facilitate rapid development of low cost satellites by providing a turnkey system which would be capable of determining and controlling spacecraft attitude automatically; simplifying operations and enabling rapid mission development as envisioned by ORS.","Our firm markets the MAI-400 which is the latest generation of turnkey ADACS specifically targeted at CubeSats. The performance of the MAI-400 is currently limited by the CMOS Earth Sensor attitude determination which gives end-to-end accuracy of 0.2deg, but is limited to periods of Sun illumination. Addition of the star trackers will yield day/night accuracy of 0.05deg which will enable many new nanosatellite applications requiring the next level of precision fine pointing such as tactical Earth imaging and Sun, planetary and deep space science. NASA centers that have active CubeSat development programs include GSFC, WFF, LaRC, ARC and JPL. From what we know of their activities, most are planning high performance missions that could benefit by use of the MAI-400SS. NASA is currently sponsoring the Edison initiative which will demonstrate new CubeSat technologies on orbit.  The offeror is party to two separate Edison proposals  NASA is also sponsoring the ELaNa program which will provide launch opportunities for potentially a dozen or more CubeSats in the near term.

The recent DARPA SeeMe (Space Enabled Effects for Military Engagements) initiative seeks to launch a constellation of 24 Nanosats in only 45 days at a cost of only $450k per satellite.  The Office of Responsive Space at Kirtland AFB seeks to develop technologies that will allow payloads to be integrated and launched with a limited budget in a matter of only days or weeks. This can be facilitated by stockpiling CubeSat busses and delivering them from inventory on demand. The first steps toward this were taken by the National Reconnaissance Office with the procurement of 12 Colony I CubeSat busses. (We are pleased to have provided the MAI-100 ADACS for Colony I.)

Flash LIDAR sensors utilize a 3DFPA and rely on the illumination of a 10nsec pulse from a diode pumped solid state (DPSSL) q-switched Nd:YAG laser.  Improvements in pulse shape and stability are crucial to improve range resolution for higher resolution landing maps.

An innovative approach for an optically triggered ""semi-active"" q-switch will allow for increased power stability in a very compact laser design.  The semi-active fused q-switch will eliminate the need for a mechanical or electro optical q-switch by actively bleaching the passive q-switch with a laser diode.  The advantage of the Cr4:YAG crystal over active q-switches is that it can be fused directly onto the YAG laser rod creating a monolithic laser cavity reducing the number of coated surfaces and the overall size.","This sensor will increase the success of NASA operations such as:?

Currently envisioned ISRU plants include production of oxygen from hydrogen reduction of lunar regolith and extraction of water from Martian regolith or asteroid material.  NASA's Regolith & Environmental Science and Oxygen & Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) mission's objectives are to analyze the distribution of volatile compounds in the lunar surface and to demonstrate ISRU operation on the moon.  To support ISRU activities, NASA requires the development of a compact, lightweight gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) instrument that can quantify volatile gases with masses below atomic number 70 released by sample heating.  The instrument must also be designed to withstand exposure to the release of HF, HCl, or Hg that may result from heating regolith samples to high temperatures.

Our GC/MS design is based on components that can be space qualified using techniques proven on numerous past space hardware development projects.  During the Phase I project, we proved our design with benchtop testing, and in Phase II, we plan to build a brassboard version of our GC/MS that will meet the important performance requirements for the intended application.","The main initial application area for the proposed GC/MS for ISRU plants will be in NASA's RESOLVE mission to the surface of the moon.

An ISRU propellant production plant on Mars may be needed for the sample return mission that NASA is envisioning in the 2020s.","The primary private sector applications for the proposed GC/MS system is for use in performing portable chemical analysis, particularly when looking for harmful gases in harsh environments.  The sensitive and specific sensor that we propose to develop will not only help ensure the timely generation of data for hazardous gas detection, but will also provide this capability to commercial organizations wishing to perform chemical analysis in the field.  For example, the proposed system would be invaluable for supporting first responder personnel who need to determine the safety of areas during cleaning and securing activities for interval testing in different areas.  On the commercial front, inexpensive portable mass spectrometers would revolutionize pollution monitoring, process control, and the response to incidents by emergency personnel.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)"

A novel EM hammer drive technology is proposed for use in cryo-propellant fuel storage and regulation valves/devices.  In addition to high force, the new drive technology offers potential advantages for miniaturization, heat load reduction, and lower cost than traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric actuators.  Dynamic Structures and Materials (DSM) proposes to focus the Phase II innovation on the development of a hammer drive actuation mechanism that will take the EM oscillatory power and produce continuous linear motion for operation at cryogenic and extreme environments.  DSM has demonstrated expertise in the operation of its high force linear motor actuators at temperatures down to 77 K.  The proposed actuator should operate from approximately 4 K to 400 K and should provide very low or no out gassing as well as operational capabilities in hard vacuum. The technology is proposed for applications in the cryo fluid management, pressure and flow control, and driving operational equipment and instruments. This proposal addresses DSM's approach to the development of flight-scalable demonstration components for the EM hammer drive technology.","DSM has received interest from NASA regarding actuators for cryogenic applications and for others that do not require low temperature capability.  Many non-cryogenic uses require a wider temperature range than laboratory environment, so some of the proposed work would be useful for these purposes, as well.  Many inquiries are related to the regulation of fluid flow or pressure.  Thruster valves used in highly miniaturized satellites have received significant attention.  Flow and pressure control of cryogenic propellants such as LOX for propulsion and LH2 is also an area of interest.  As the technology is more fully developed, it will be practical to pursue applications requiring more force.  Interest has been expressed in an actuator for a 1-inch and 2 inch cryo-isolation valve that will require over 150 pounds of output force.  There are many cryo and non-cryo valve applications that can potentially be addressed by this technology.","The oil and gas transportation/handling/processing field is wide open for valve technology that can withstand extreme temperatures, high levels of contaminants, and provides intermittent operation in conditions that cause either temperature induced or contaminant induced binding.  DSM's hammer-drive technology has a number of uses in this industry.  DSM will look to specialists at oil industry research groups that will provide guidance for this market.  Applications outside NASA are other aerospace projects that require actuators to operate valves for cryogenic fluid handling.  ESA and major US defense contractors have previously tested systems that used DSM's piezoelectric actuators.  The US Air Force has expressed interest in very low temperature, high force actuators for use in their low Earth orbit simulation chambers at Arnold Engineering Development Center.  More broadly, some commercial applications related to materials evaluation and inspection need positioning at very low temperature and could benefit from this research.","Actuators & Motors; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Deployment; Fuels/Propellants; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller"

A key challenge is the storability of LH2, LCH4, and LOX propellants for long durations.  The storage tanks must be well insulated to prevent over pressurization and venting, which lead to unacceptable propellant losses for long-duration missions to Mars and beyond. Aspen Aerogels validated the key process step for a next generation aerogel manufacturing technology to enable the fabrication of thin, low density aerogel materials.  Multi-Layer Aerogel Insulation (MLAI) system prototypes were prepared using sheets of these aerogel materials that have superior thermal performance exceeding that of the current state of the art insulation for space application, MLI, across the vacuum range tested (0.01 – 100 millitorr).  The exceptional properties of this system include a new breakthrough in high vacuum cryogenic thermal insulation, providing a durable material with excellent thermal performance at a reduced cost when compared to longstanding state-of-the-art MLI systems.  During the Phase II Program, further refinement and qualification/system-level testing of the MLAI system will be performed for use in cryogenic storage applications.","The material developed in the Phase II effort could have a variety of applications within NASA. Thin low density aerogel material could potentially be used to insulate cryotanks and cryogen transfer pipelines for ground processing, satellite thermal management, and cryogen storage for space applications.  Aspen has been in discussions with United Launch Alliance, NASA Kennedy Space Center and Yetispace to test the MLAI system on real-world tanks such as VATA or the CRYogenics Orbital TEstbed (CRYOTE).  This real-world testing will be used to advance the TRL level of the insulation system from 5 (at the end of Phase II) to 6 - 7.  Development and optimization of Aspen's new process of making thin and low density aerogels will greatly assist NASA to improve its insulation for cryogenic fuel tanks, cryogenic fuel transfer lines, spacesuit and internal insulation on future generations of re-usable launch vehicles.","The new insulation system from this program will also have far reaching benefits for both military and commercial applications.  The potential for the use of this material exists for durable and reliable insulation systems for any cryogenic, high vacuum or thin, flexible applications including appliances, airliner fuselage, LNG fuel storage tanks and transfer lines, and apparel.","Aerogels; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal)"

The radiation components of interest include protons, alpha particles and heavy ions from galactic cosmic rays, protons and other ions from solar particle events, high energy electrons and neutrons, and high-energy electromagnetic radiation.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, proposes to raise the technology readiness level of selected polymeric radiation-shielding materials through participation in the Materials on the International Space Station Experiment program, named MISSE-X.  The Phase I SBIR program demonstrated the feasibility of developing a flight-qualified Technology Demonstration Experiment to be carried on board the ISS as part of a MISSE-X payload to facility Technology Infusion.  Phase II Technical Objectives will include specification and fabrication of polymeric materials to shield astronauts and sensitive electronic equipment, acquisition and test of detectors/dosimeters suitable for measurement of total ionizing dose, design, construction, test and optimization of an experimental package compatible with the guidelines and specifications of the MISSE-X program, and field testing and integration in conjunction with NASA personnel and NASA contractors.  The anticipated result of the Phase II program is the delivery of an experiment package for MISSE-X.","The proposed approach to validation of passive radiation-shielding materials has NASA applications including evaluating the effects of the space environment on multifunctional nanocomposite materials capable of serving both as radiation shields and structural elements.  These materials are being developed by International Scientific Technologies, Inc.  Several NASA programs will be directly affected as a result of the Phase I and Phase II programs. The Human Research Program (HRP) is tasked with ensuring crew safety on long-duration space missions. Validation of radiation shielding on-board the International Space Station will support that task.  HRP will also deliver a design tool to assess advanced radiation shielding on space vehicles. The Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Program will develop and demonstrate prototype systems for life support, habitation, and extravehicular activity (EVA).","Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial sector in reducing collateral damage from heavy charged particles emerging as a therapeutic approach in nuclear medicine.  The shielding will lead to decreased fatigue among medical personnel required to wear heavy protective garments during radiological procedures.  Workers in industrial facilities using radiation for materials processing and in nuclear power facilities will also benefit from more-comfortable garments having reduced weight and thermal stress.  The Departments of Defense and of Homeland Security will find applications that include protection of soldiers, first responders and emergency medical personnel against high energy gamma radiation and neutrons resulting from so-called dirty bombs as well as from hazards brought about through accidental release of radiological materials.  The uses of continuous monitoring of arrays of in-situ radiation sensors include evaluation of degradation of personal protective garments for biomedical, defense and homeland security applications.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Composites; Ionizing Radiation; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Nanomaterials; Polymers; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Smart/Multifunctional Materials"

We use a closed loop control system and a servo motor to smoothly and accurately simulate the gravitational and inertial loads of lifting a weight on earth. However, because the system uses a computer-controlled motor, the load can be varied independently during the concentric and eccentric phase of the exercise. Thus, the system can easily provide an eccentric overload during the return stroke, greatly increasing the physiological benefit of a workout. The NGRED has a user-friendly interface where the exercise is selected from a drop-down menu, along with the desired weight and overload. The NGRED will automatically adjust to the user's stored range of motion (ROM) for the selected exercise and apply the set load only during the ROM. The NGRED automatically applies the eccentric overload at the top of the ROM and advances to the next rep at the bottom. The time required to change between users, exercises, and weights is less than 10 seconds. This makes much better use of the astronaut's time; with current mechanically adjustable exercise machines up to two thirds of the time is spent adjusting the machine. The software includes data logging and communication abilities to meet NASA requirements as well as redundant hardware and software fail-safe mechanisms.The NGRED includes an efficient energy recovery system which stores the energy generated by the user during the concentric phase of the motion (pull stroke) and applies that energy to provide resistance during the eccentric phase (return stroke). The average power consumption of the NGRED will be less than 50 W during an exercise session. The expected weight of the NGRED at the end of Phase II will be 20 kg, and the total volume is expected to be 55 L, including all electronics and controls. A flight-like NGRED will be delivered to NASA at the end of Phase II.","Extended stays in reduced gravity environments lead to a decrease in bone density and muscular deterioration if proper countermeasures are not taken. Studies have shown that crewmembers of the International Space Station can lose up to 2% per month in bone mass and 32% in muscle strength during a 6 month stay. To counteract this phenomenon, several pieces of exercise equipment have been developed. These pieces range from elastic bands to more complex pieces of equipment such as the interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED) and the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). The iRED does not generate sufficient force for effective resistive exercise, whereas the ARED has been proven to be sufficient for maintaining muscle mass and bone density. The ARED, however, is large and heavy, making it unsuitable for incorporation into a small spacecraft for long duration space travel.The NGRED is able to generate sufficient resistive force for effective resistive exercise (up to 600 lbf) and is able to provide eccentric overload to further increase the efficiency of a resistive exercise session. Furthermore, the NGRED is lightweight, low power, compact, and user friendly, making it perfectly suitable for inclusion in a small spacecraft for long-duration missions. Average power consumption of the NGRED will be less than 50 W during operation, the volume will be less than 55 L and the weight will be less than 20 kg.","The NGRED has markets in academic research, physical therapy, athletic departments and fitness industry. The NGRED can be used in home-gyms to replace the heavy weight-stacks and add an electronic interface to monitor progress or to share results with a remote coach or friends online. There is much research being performed to study the physiological benefits of different load profiles during strength training, with the majority of this work being focused on the effects of eccentric overload. The NGRED is perfectly suited for this because the amount of eccentric overload can be precisely controlled and set by entering the desired value on the user-interface. The NGRED also allows the study of custom load profiles throughout an exercise motion. For this application the NGRED has unique capabilities in that can match a user's range of motion (ROM) in seconds and then apply a custom load profile based on the ROM while logging position and force data at 16 kHz. Lastly, the features of the NGRED make it ideal for physical therapy centers. With the NGRED, strength training can be designed to precisely meet the needs of the patient by providing resistive loads only where desired during the range of motion. To market our device, we will use a proven commercialization pathway, building credibility through sports medicine research and incorporation into physical therapy facilities, leading to large sales in athletic departments, fitness centers, and ultimately in home markets.",Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures

Our innovative and extremely cost-effective multi-analyte LFTS approach is eminently suited for space travel. Taking advantage of the built-in flash and high resolution camera, in Phase I we have modified a commercially available cell phone with optical filters, lenses, a UV LED excitation source, and a cassette holder for LFTS image capture. In Phase II, we will expand the capability of cell phone-based LFTS for an antibody-antigen sandwich binding assay to include blood gas measurements by developing sensitive indicator films to be integrated with our cell phone-based detector. Furthermore, we will develop cell phone-based software for on-cell phone detection and data processing with an expanded panel of biomarkers, advancing the TRL from 5 to 7.","Future space missions will require prolonged stays of crew members onboard space stations, and on other spacecraft for journeys to other planets. Increasingly complex space missions will also require monitoring the health status of astronauts, preferably in a point-of-care apparatus that is compact and simple. The IOS system will enable NASA to monitor the health status of crew members by means of simple blood-based biomarker detection. A lateral flow test strip will be integrated with a cell phone into a simple and compact blood biomarker detection platform. This platform will gather diagnostic information in the absence of medically trained personnel, and can also monitor the health of aircraft pilots, cabin crews, passengers, and others in aeronautics-related occupations.","A cell phone-based serum biomarker detection platform will be cost-effective and compact not only for space exploration; it will also benefit the overall healthcare industry. Cell phones are becoming increasingly prevalent all over the world, with approximately five billion subscribers worldwide, and in the U.S. approximately one in three adults owns a smart phone. The ability to integrate a simple LFTS assay with a cell phone will enable healthcare providers to perform blood tests for many diseases on a wide population, including populations in remote areas where healthcare facilities are sparse. Such a platform can have a major impact in developing countries where a simple cell phone can be converted into a blood marker detection platform, avoiding the cost of acquiring dedicated medical equipment; furthermore, this point-of-care device improves the probability of early detection, yielding additional savings in overall healthcare cost.

Unlike many video analytics solutions, AVIMA goes beyond simple blob-based video analysis by tracking the geometric configuration of human body parts like the trunk, head, and limbs. This tracking enables human motion understanding algorithms to model and recognize complex human actions and interactions.The resulting system will represent a substantial breakthrough providing benefits to an array of applications in video surveillance, human-computer interaction, human factors engineering, and robotics.","Vecna expects the full-scope software system to have immediate and tangible benefit for NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD).

A number of programs sponsored by the DoD (FCS, HumanID, CTS, Mind's Eye, Rail Security Pilot) employ video-based monitoring systems and would benefit from the proposed system. Also, Vecna will investigate commercialization opportunities in other sectors, including mobile robotics, interactive displays, and visual surveillance. Initial analysis of these market segments reveal both unaddressed needs as well as vast potential for rapid adoption and growth.As robotic systems become more commonplace in today's society, robust, intelligent interaction between humans and robots is essential.  To interact with humans in a lifelike manner requires the robot to infer physical intentions based on visual cues.  The proposed technology could potentially revolutionize human-robot interaction.

Inc. tested an existing Hall thruster, the BHT-8000, on iodine propellant.  The thruster was fed by a high flow iodine feed system, and supported by an existing Busek hollow cathode flowing xenon gas.  The Phase I propellant feed system was evolved from a previously demonstrated laboratory feed system.  Throttling of the thruster between 2 and 11 kW at 200-600V was demonstrated.  Testing has shown that the efficiency of iodine fueled BHT-8000 is the same as with xenon, with iodine delivering slightly higher thrust to power (T/P).  Plume current was also measured at a variety of operating conditions.  Preliminary design work for a new thruster to be built in Phase II was also completed. In Phase II a complete iodine fueled system will be developed including the thruster, hollow cathode, and iodine propellant feed system.  The nominal power of the Phase II system is 8 kW.  However, it can be deeply throttled as well as clustered to much higher power levels.  The technology can also be scaled to >100 kW per thruster to support MW-class missions.  The target thruster efficiency for the full scale system is 65% at high Isp (~3000 s) and 60% at high thrust (Isp~2000 s).  These projections are based on Phase I testing and prior testing of higher power thrusters. Iodine enables dramatic mass and cost savings for lunar and Mars cargo missions, including Earth escape and near-Earth space maneuvers.  High purity iodine is available commercially in large quantities at much lower cost than xenon.  Iodine stores at 2 to 3 times greater density than xenon and at approximately one thousandth of the pressure and may be stored in low mass, low cost propellant tanks instead.  Passive, long term storage of a fully fueled system is feasible including storage in conformal tanks which may be used to shield internal components against some types of space radiation.","The proposed thruster system has many applications both as a stand-alone system and as part of a much larger (higher power) cluster.  On its own, the thruster will be well suited for orbit raising and interplanetary transfers, supporting exploration and science missions to NEOs, Asteroids, comets, and planets. The demonstrated throttling ability of iodine is important for a singular thruster that might be called upon to propel a spacecraft from Earth to Mars or Venus.  The ability to throttle efficiently is even more important for missions beyond Mars. Another possible NASA application is re-boosting the ISS, a mission which is currently accomplished by inefficient chemical propulsion. For high power exploration missions (hundreds of kW or greater), the system would be increased in size and/or clustered.  Destinations of interest include the Moon, Mars, asteroids, and NEOs.","Integrated with a high power commercial spacecraft, the proposed thruster could accomplish all required propulsion functions including orbit raising, orbit circularization, inclination changes, station-keeping and repositioning.  All aspects of a GTO to GEO transfer are possible. The thruster would be also very well sized for a high power electric upper stage for a commercial launch vehicle.  The high stored density of iodine leads to much lower system volume than with xenon or other conventional alternatives.","Active Systems; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Fluids; Fuels/Propellants; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Lifetime Testing; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Pressure/Vacuum; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Direct Discharge Power Processing Units (DDUs) have been proposed as an alternative due to their simplicity and low mass, but the achievable operating range of thrust and ISP is significantly limited because power regulation for DDUs is only achieved through gas flow control, array offpointing or shunting. This proposal presents a compromise between PPUs and DDUs called a Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Unit (HDDU) that provides a wider operating range than DDUs while reducing the mass and increasing the efficiency compared to conventional PPUs. An HDDU provides filtering like a DDU, but it can additionally raise or lower the discharge voltage over a limited range. An HDDU only processes the power necessary to raise or lower the discharge voltage. We propose using a soft switching non-inverting interleaved buck-boost circuit similar to what was built for Phase I, but with improved control circuitry and a modular chassis. Straight-through direct drive operation is possible by leaving the buck switches on continually while having the boost switches off.  The proposed HDDU would operate from an input voltage of 150 V to 300 V, and would provide 15 kW output power from approximately 200 V to 500 V. The HDDU approach is readily scalable to higher power levels by connecting modules in parallel because the proposed circuit naturally shares output currents. The HDDU will also include a digital control interface unit (DCIU), heater, keeper and magnet supply modules and driving circuits for a VACCO gas flow controller.  The DCIU will be controlled through a Windows GUI and a MIL-STD-1553 communication to USB adapter. The modular approach and enhanced operating range promote design re-use and reduce life-cycle costs.","Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Units are well-suited for both manned and unmanned Electric Path missions, and can be readily scaled to hundreds of kilowatts through parallel-connected modules of approximately 15 kW. The power converters used in the HDDUs could be re-purposed for a variety of power conversion applications such as fuel-cell output converters and solar array simulators. The primary market for this technology is for high-power low-cost electric propulsion systems where Hall thrusters are likely to be used. It is anticipated that the CPE HDDU will have a lower cost than state-of-the-art PPU designs. Additionally, the high specific mass and high efficiency will reduce the overall system cost. The enhanced operating range capabilities compared to a pure direct drive can help enable missions where shifts between high thrust for short-term maneuvers and high ISP for long-term operation are desirable. The wide-range capabilities and a modular design also enable one HDDU design to be used in a variety of different applications.","Hybrid Direct Drive Power Processing Units could be used for commercial and military satellites, both for station keeping and orbit lifting. The advantages outlined for NASA applications also apply here. One specific non-NASA application is for Aerojet thrusters that are being developed for geosynchronous satellite use. Commercial non-flight applications include laboratory bench power supplies. A path to high volume sales may be achieved by using theconverters refined in this SBIR for general purpose scientific equipment. The power converters used in the HDDUs could be re-purposed for a variety of power conversion applications such as fuel-cell output converters, solar array simulators and hybrid vehicles.

Drying will be accomplished utilizing microwave energy addition and ""jet"" air flow to fluff and move clothing in the washing chamber.  Operation in a two phase water / water vapor system precludes the formation of sustainable foam in the wash effluent while allowing adequate volume for agitation of clothing in a weightless environment while using a minimum amount of water.  Drying using air ""jets"" and microwave addition was proven during micro-gravity testing performed in the Single Phase Space Laundry Phase II program (NASA contract No. NAS9-18362, Jan. 1993) The Phase II effort will build upon the successful Phase I feasibility demonstration of the AMCIL concept and result in delivery of a working AMCIL prototype whose performance will be thoroughly characterized and delivered to NASA for independent testing.   The AMCIL promises a reduction in ESM associated with crew clothing on long duration missions through the reduction of expendables.  Clothing can be re-used which minimizes ESM associated with storage of new clothing, and waste storage associated with used clothing.","The NASA application for this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future, long duration exploration objectives beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where efficient, reliable, laundering of clothing will reduce the ESM.  On long duration missions re-supply is impossible.  This technology promises to substantially reduce the ESM penalties associated with disposable clothing, including storage volume of new clothing as well as waste storage of used clothing. It will also increase astronaut comfort, as it will be more practicable to change clothing on a more frequent basis than when finite amounts of disposable clothing must be carried on the mission.","The primary focus of this program is to prevent the formation of sustainable foam and minimize the amount of water usage during the washing / rinsing cycles. The AMCILS relies on a weightless environment to minimize water consumption.  Sustainable foam is only a problem in a weightless environment.  At this time there are few customers that require operation of laundering facilities in a weightless environment.  The drying function, utilizing microwave heat addition, could be easily integrated into Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) front loading wash machines.  This would minimize space requirements in household by eliminating the need for a separate dryer unit.  It may also provide a more energy efficient method of vaporizing liquid water entrained in clothing over simple heating with hot air.  Commercial manufacturers of washing machines will be interested.",Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment

This battery-operated device would be hand-held, use very little electrical power, and have a multi-year lifetime without the need for consumables, re-calibration, or maintenance, in contrast to the currently-used analyzer.The Phase I research focused on what we believe are the most critical risks to using our approach.  All of these objectives were successfully accomplished, laying a strong foundation for continuation of the research in Phase II.  In Phase II, a fully functional prototype analyzer, meeting all of the requirements for operation in the International Space Station, will be built and tested.  Issues relating to space-qualification will be identified so as to ease the transition to Phase III and subsequent development.","Successful development of an integrated, robust fire detection sensor will allow NASA to adopt a high-reliability system for detection of smoldering and/or fires in the International Space Station and other manned spacecraft.  Such systems will become more important as extended-duration flights to the Moon and Mars begin.  The same gas sensing platform also could be used for meeting the needs for a multi-gas sensor for monitoring cabin air, gas regeneration, and life support systems.   This same gas sensor could also be used on a wide variety of platforms (e.g. aircraft, balloons, ground-based network, etc.).  Since it is designed for long-term operation with minimal attention and maintenance, it is expected to find use in validation of remote data sensing obtained from planned NASA atmospheric research missions.  Longer term NASA applications could include adaptation of the instrument for measurements in planetary atmospheres, via use of space-qualified electronics and further ruggedization of the mechanical and thermal design.","Potential non-NASA customers include the U.S. Navy for fire and environmental sensors in submarines, and the Air Force and commercial airline manufacturers for fire and air quality sensors in aircraft.

Regenerative CO2 removal systems are attractive for these missions because they do not use consumable CO2 absorbers.  However, these systems also absorb and vent water to space along with the carbon dioxide.  We propose to develop an innovative water recovery system that minimizes water lost from regenerative CO2 control systems without the need for low-temperature condensing heat exchangers.  This approach addresses the need for water recovery systems in long-duration missions, reduces the need for consumables by enabling use of state-of-the-art regenerative CO2 removal systems, and minimizes demands on the spacecraft thermal control system.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach through proof-of-concept tests that demonstrated efficient water recovery from a compact exchanger with low pressure losses.  Trade-off studies using our mass transfer analysis models have yielded a design for a full-size prototype that meets all the requirements for service on future spacecraft.  In Phase II we will build the prototype and measure its performance in ground tests of a full-scale, regenerative CO2 removal system.","Creare's water recovery system will enable exploration spacecraft to undertake long-duration missions while conserving water.  Our system will not increase the size of the spacecraft thermal management system, and will enable use of state-of-the-art, pressure-swing absorption systems for CO2 removal.  Applications include crewed exploration vehicles and manned surface rovers.  The unit is compact, typically weighs less than one day's worth of water loss, and adds negligible air pressure drop to the cabin ventilation circuit.  Combined with Creare's nonventing lithium chloride absorber/radiator (LCAR) technology, a similar system could be used in future EVA suits to prevent water from being vented along with carbon dioxide.","Creare's water recovery system can be used in terrestrial fuel cell power systems, where water management is a critical balance of plant function.  It will be particularly useful for vehicles powered by PEM fuel cells, where compact size and light weight are critical requirements.","Active Systems; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients)"

No current compact sensors have the tolerance for liquid water that is specifically required for next-generation portable life support systems (PLSS). Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) is developing a luminescence-based optical sensor probe to monitor carbon dioxide, oxygen, and humidity. Our monitor will incorporate robust CO2, O2, and H2O partial pressure sensors interrogated by a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The sensors will not only tolerate liquid water but will actually operate while wet, and can be remotely connected to electronic circuitry by an optical fiber cable immune to electromagnetic interference. For space systems, using these miniature sensor elements with remote optoelectronics provides unmatched design flexibility for measurements in highly constrained volume systems such as PLSS. Our flow-through monitor design includes an optical sensor we have already developed for PLSS humidity monitoring, and an optical oxygen sensor with similar IOS technology. In Phase I of this project IOS demonstrated a CO2 sensor capable of operating while wet, and a miniature prototype PPCO2-H2O-O2 sensor probe was fabricated and tested under relevant environmental conditions. In Phase II, in collaboration with Hamilton Sundstrand (Hamilton), we will design and produce prototypes for space qualification, and will conduct extensive testing under simulated space conditions, culminating in validation in NASA systems, bringing the monitor to TRL 6-7. Engineers from IOS and Hamilton will design the new sensor system to be compatible with electronics developed and fabricated for space operation by Hamilton (in particular, the common modular data bus interface unit). This approach will minimize the power requirements and size of the monitoring device, and will tremendously facilitate the infusion of the technology into the PLSS.","Advanced Extra-Vehicular Activity systems are necessary for the successful support of the International Space Station beyond 2020, for future human space exploration missions, for in-space microgravity EVA, and for planetary surface exploration. In collaboration with NASA personnel, several needs and potential applications of the multiparameter probe sensors have been identified particularly for space suits. These include the International Space Station (ISS) Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), the Orion derived Launch Entry Abort (LEA), and the future EMU Demonstrator development. The ISS EMU requirement is the highest priority, because problems have been reported in the CO2 sensor in use under conditions of liquid water condensation, and because problems reported in the CO2 scrubber system can be solved by a humidity sensor capable of withstanding water condensation. NASA guidance and the participation of Hamilton Sundstrand will ensure that the prototypes resulting from this project are compatible with the ISS EMU PLSS system. The proposed technology will also have application as a monitor for air quality in the pressurized cabins of crewed spacecraft, will significantly improve miniaturization, and has potential for distributed sensing.","Compact high-performance gas sensors have a number of aeronautical applications. IOS has already conducted negotiations with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for the integration of the sensor probe to be developed in Phase II into fight crew air supply systems. Because of its status both as an aircraft system integrator and as a leading supplier of avionic and aeronautic subsystems, Lockheed Martin is in an excellent position to bring IOS sensor technology to the aeronautics market. Biomedical monitoring is an attractive business opportunity; non-invasive or minimally invasive sensors and miniature probes for measuring and monitoring PCO2 and PO2, have many potential applications for monitoring medical airways during surgery, tissue oxygen supply, and blood perfusion. Sensor elements developed in Phase I have already been used for non-invasive PCO2 and PO2 blood monitoring in animal models, demonstrating high correlation with the invasive gold standard blood gas analysis. IOS has already established collaboration with the UCLA-affiliated Los Angeles Biomedical Research Center to explore this market opportunity.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus"

The SIRIUS Phase I prototype system demonstrated excellent potential for 3D localization of defects in various aerospace materials and structures, such as thermal protection system (TPS) ceramic foam tiles, micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shielding, spacecraft pressure walls, inflatable habitat structures, composite overwrapped pressure vehicles (COPV), aluminum-rubber composites, and metal honeycomb materials. In Phase II, POC will develop a compact, standalone version of the SIRIUS system with improved performance (in terms of resolution and data acquisition speed), as well as an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for straightforward data acquisition and visualization. At the end of Phase II, POC will perform a TRL-6 demonstration of SIRIUS at the NASA facilities. SIRIUS will provide NASA with an effective NDE tool for both in-space and on-ground applications.","The primary NASA application of the proposed SIRIUS system is a compact NDE system that can be used for evaluating the structural integrity of spacecraft components during spaceflight, with the capability of providing reliable, high-resolution assessments of the locations and extent of damage within thermal protection, MMOD shields, inflatable habitats, EVA suits and vehicles, electronic systems, conductive structures, pressure vessels, and other lightweight materials, with the capability of functioning in hard-to-access areas within both pressurized habitable compartments and external space environments.

These requirements, in turn, are allocated among critical subsystems, such as engines, propellants, structures, software systems, thermal protection, power, avionics, life support, guidance, communication and navigation. In this vein, novel integrated system health management (ISHM) technologies that evolve with the system life-cycle, viz., concept-> design-> development-> production-> operations and training, are essential for meeting the requirements of safe and ultra-reliable, sustainable and affordable launch vehicles and spacecraft. To improve the ISHM process, QSI proposes to emphasize advancement in the two following areas: 1) generation/selection of an optimal sensor suite for the system based on user selected performance requirements and system level constraints, and 2) enhancement of a drill-down diagnosis/next best test capability in terms of algorithms that can be implemented for low power, low memory CPU/hardware that are available for embedded diagnosis using TEAMS-RT. Outcome technologies of the proposed focus are expected to allow an improved ISHM process to systemically trade-off prevention, detection, diagnosis, decision, and response strategies to mitigate the failure effects, as well as enhance FM development process by improved/new capabilities of TEAMS® tool set.","NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy for vehicle health management and mission planning and recovery makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. Clearly, establishing the technology and the software so that it readily operates as part of NASA's next generation missions especially those that require long-term operability and automation (e.g., missions similar to the Curiosity Rover) allows NASA to utilize the continuous health assessment and mission satisfiability information from QSI's tool for improved mission execution and reconfiguration while improving safety, mission success probability and reducing flight controller and crew workload.","Among the other agencies, DoD and Air-force and Navy are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies.

In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets could also be potential target for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems. Commercial air transport, space-based systems, underwater, and maritime (both civil and military) sectors can be the potential end user of the technologies developed from this effort. All these systems require the presence of mission critical systems whose operations are mostly automated and conducted in demanding circumstances.

The reactors would have an 8 to 15 year design life and should be available for a 2020 launch to support future NASA science missions.  Both 1 kWe thermoelectric and 3 kWe Stirling systems have been examined.  Heat pipes are being examined to transfer the thermal energy from the reactor to the electric conversion systems.  There are three types of wicks that can carry this power over the distance; grooved, sintered arterial and self-venting arterial.  Arterial heat pipes are the default design for spacecraft nuclear reactors; however, de-priming of the artery due to radiation is a serious potential problem.  Grooved and self-venting arterial heat pipes are less susceptible to de-priming since the liquid in the grooves is open to the vapor space and the self-venting arterial heat pipe has venting pores in the evaporator to allow trapped vapor to escape.  ACT's innovation was to examine the tradeoffs between the three heat pipe wicks and determine an optimum wick design that is suitable for fission reactor applications.  The Phase I project was successful in demonstrating that all three types of wicks can transport the necessary power.","The immediate NASA application is for space fission nuclear reactors that utilize Stirling converters or thermoelectric for power conversion.  Specifically, the 1kWe Fission Power System with a 15 year design life.  The alkali metal heat pipes developed in this program would be capable of transporting the reactor heat to the Stirling or thermoelectric convertors for power generation.The Stirling system and other space nuclear reactors also require radiator panels to reject waste heat.  The grooved and self-venting arterial heat pipes developed on this program will also be suitable to the lower temperature radiator heat pipes.","The high temperature heat pipes developed under this program can also be used for waste heat energy recovery and utilization, specifically for automotive engines and military generator sets.  The exhaust heat generated in these applications is considered high-grade heat and would require alkali metal heat pipes for collection and transportation.  The high temperature heat pipes developed under this program could be used to collect the high-grade exhaust heat and transfer it to either a catalyst convertor to reduce the energy needed for vehicle startup or to Stirling engines for electrical energy generation.  A second application is high temperature solar receivers.  These devices are currently being investigated to provide the necessary thermal power to aid in alternate energy generation.  The thermochemical reduction processes used to generate alternate energy must be performed at very high temperatures.  The high temperature heat pipes developed in this program could be used to transfer the thermal energy collected by a solar receiver to a reactor to aid in the thermochemical reduction process.",Conversion; Fluids; Passive Systems; Prototyping; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine

Key Phase II improvements in the ELO process are reduction in cycle time and increase in the yield of large-area devices.  In addition, we will transition all critical device fabrication processes to 6-inch production tool sets that are designed for volume production, with an emphasis on automated cassette-to-cassette and batch processes that will minimize operator dependence and variability.  During the Phase II program we will establish a pilot production line capable of at least 1500 6-inch wafers per month at greater than 80% yield. We will also increase the yield and manufacturability of the 6-inch reclaim process, which is crucial to reducing the cost of the cells.  This will involve a closer collaboration with our substrate reclaim vendor and the establishment of clear metrics to qualify key process variables impacting device yield.  A successful conclusion of this Phase II program will place us in strong position to support potential SEP volume solar cell manufacturing requirements.","The 6-inch ELO manufacturing platform to be developed in this Phase II program is ideally suited for building low-cost, high efficiency and lightweight multijunction solar cells for potential NASA solar electric propulsion programs.","MicroLink Devices' large-area multijunction solar cells have many different potential applications. The light weight and high specific power of the ELO solar cells make them ideal for powering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We are also engaged with several different manufacturers of commercial satellites for whom cost reduction is major motivation. Finally, there are potential military applications for mobile solar electric power to carry out recharging of batteries in the field.","Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Processing Methods; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

Measurements on internal echoes established the feasibility of non-intrusive temperature measurements.  In the Phase II program we will continue to improve, optimize, and extend the technology.  Sensors with better elevated temperature performance will be developed and configured for ablation measurements.  Instrumentation with improved low frequency and more robust time-of flight algorithms will be incorporated into the system.  Configurations with multiple sensors suitable for mapping recession profiles will be evaluated.  The measurement technique will be applied and measurement results verified through a series of ablation tests where the real-time recession data will be quantitatively compared to that obtained from post-ablation analysis.","PICA and materials of its class are currently under development worldwide, including a Carbon-Resin by the European Space Agency (ESA). The largest current scheduled user of PICA-class ablators is SpaceX which utilizes a PICA-X variant in the Dragon spacecraft for earth re-entry. This environment is toward the lower end of heat fluxes and ablation to be encountered during a re-entry procedure. All private and public space endeavors that require re-entry heat shielding can benefit from the technology developed under this program which can augment and improve modeling, test ablators in real-world conditions and perform health monitoring roles in test articles.","Mass and heat dissipation performance are critical to thermal protection systems for many NASA objectives both in spaceflight and hypersonic flight. Low-density carbon phenolics perform well in both of these critical parameters. Phenolic Impregnated Ceramic Ablator (PICA) was developed by NASA/Ames in the mid-nineties and flown successfully in the Stardust mission. This particular material is of active interest to NASA, with its use in the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and the possibility of its selection for multiple future missions. Real-time recession and heat flux measurements will support continued development of this class of ablators as well as mission specific implementation. Ablator performance models can be enhanced with higher fidelity temperature data and used for faster development with decreasing cost. Future programs are also in need of PICA and PICA class ablators. Two of the New Frontiers Program proposals incorporate PICA for sample return missions including MoonRise, a Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return Mission which would place a lander in a broad basin near the moon's south pole and return approximately two pounds of lunar materials for study and Osiris-Rex which would rendezvous and orbit a primitive asteroid, returning more than two ounces of material from the asteroid's surface.","Ablative Propulsion; Acoustic/Vibration; Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Characterization; Composites; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Destructive Testing; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Thermal"

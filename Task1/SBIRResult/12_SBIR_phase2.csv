Ice accretions on the wings affect the smooth flow required for proper lift. A thin layer of coarse ice can reduce the lift by 30 percent and increase drag by up to 40 percent.  In addition, accretions can also reduce the air intake in engines and affect readings from a (heated) Pitot tube. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes to continue the development of an integrated LIDAR instrument capable of identifying icing conditions while also allowing for air data sensing as well as other hazard detection capabilities.  The resulting Raman Icing Detection System (RIDES), when coupled with MAC's optical air data solution, will provide unprecedented situational awareness and aircraft safety. The proposed solution will operate without protrusions into the flow, behind a common flush-mounted window on the skin of the aircraft, mitigating the risk of ice build-up during operation and therefore providing a critical redundancy through dissimilar measurement of air data parameters while greatly enhancing a pilot's awareness of potential icing hazards.  MAC will build on its successful Phase I trade-study and design effort through the fabrication and demonstration of a Phase II prototype in an icing wind tunnel.","An airborne icing condition detection and characterization system, such as RIDES, will have wide applications in the study of the threat icing conditions pose to aircraft. In addition, the system will allow for climate change studies that look at aerosol concentration and distribution, including water vapor/liquid water content, in the atmosphere.  There is potential to combine such a system with MAC's optical air data system and turbulence-detection systems into a unified system that would sense both icing conditions and turbulence hazards ahead and report airspeed along with air, temperature and density routinely.","Outside NASA, military and civil aviation is often affected by icing, sometimes severely (e.g., Comair flight 3272 in 1997, Air France flight 447 in 2009) and the ability to detect these conditions so as to avoid or at least account for them (activating de-icing systems, etc.) would be of tremendous safety value, suggesting a substantial market. Michigan Aerospace Corporation is already working on NASA projects for clear-air turbulence (CAT) detection and volcanic ash detection ahead of an aircraft. Adding SLD to these optical air data system (OADS)-derived capabilities will lead to a powerful suite of optical instruments capable of measuring air data (air speed and direction along with air density and temperature) and warning of icing conditions, volcanic ash and clear-air turbulence, all without protruding into the flow around the aircraft and without ports or probes that can clog with debris or ice up.",Air Transportation & Safety; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ultraviolet; Visible

A sizing supercooled liquid water content (SSLWC) sonde is being developed to meet a directly related need for in-situ measurements of both total supercooled liquid water content and droplet size distribution.  This data will support the development of remote sensing instrumentation to detect icing conditions, support aircraft certification activities for flight into known icing conditions, and support the development of new icing-related operational weather forecast products. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the SSLWC sonde's measurement technique.  The sonde airframe was designed, built, and tested, mathematical models relating the sonde's raw data to the target variables were completed, a data processing algorithm was developed and implemented, and a proof-of-concept sonde was built.   Phase II will involve refining the sonde design, adapting the mathematical algorithms into their final application environments, conducting additional studies of sonde elements in an icing wind tunnel, and undertaking two field missions to obtain intercomparison data between the SSLWC sonde and other accepted approaches to such measurements.  At the end of Phase II, the SSLWC sonde will be proven to the point that it can be marketed with confidence for the application areas outlined above.",NASA will be able to use the SSLWC sonde to support the development of remote sensing methods for cloud properties and for fundamental research into icing.,"Aircraft certification activities, private sector development of remote sensing techniques, and new icing weather forecast products are three areas of application foreseen for the sonde.  Other scientific agencies, particularly NOAA, DOE, and NSF, are likely to have applications for the sonde in the areas of in-situ cloud research and the development of remote sensing techniques for cloud characterization.

The approach is based on a mathematical formalism derived from hybrid systems theory. The correctness of information content in user interfaces is analyzed by a special observability test that takes into account of the limitations in human cognition and psychology. A possible mismatch between an operational mode perceived by the human operator and the one active in the aircraft is detected using an algorithm that compares the inferred intent of the human operator to that of the machine. Metrics-based performance evaluation will be carried out to demonstrate the benefits of the prototype software developed under the Phase II research.

(DTI) proposes to design and build an autostereoscopic (glasses-free 3D) LCD based aircraft cockpit display that features switchable 2D & 3D operation, full LCD resolution in both 2D and 3D modes, a wide viewing area without head position restrictions, and high brightness.  The display will be configured for installation and testing in a Boeing 787 cockpit simulator for evaluation and testing at the end of Phase II. Given positive results this could be followed by modification and installation in a test aircraft in Phase III.  The display will be based on Rockwell's 15"" flight deck displays currently in use and be designed to fit inside the existing display volume envelope.  Code will be written to allow Boeing's existing simulator software to produce 3D images on DTI's displays.  Presentation of images in 3D should increase the pilot's ability to extract information, particularly situational awareness from cluttered displays, as indicated by various studies at NASA and the US Air Force.  Boeing has agreed to partner with DTI in Phase II.","After initial discussions and a meeting with NASA, it was apparent that NASA's interest in this project is primarily for purposes of improving commercial transport aircraft safety, as opposed to any internal NASA project or NASA aircraft or spacecraft. Nevertheless, the technology will potentially be of benefit in NASA aircraft and spacecraft cockpits for purposes of increasing situation awareness,  as well as in NASA telerobotic applications, such as the space station based manipulator arm and Robonaut, where display in stereoscopic 3D is of proved benefit for human controlled robot systems.  During discussions NASA personnel have also expressed interest in glasses free 3D for workstation applications, especially those that require viewing of complex representations of data sets like atmospheric information obtained by satellites.  Scientific workstation applications have long been recognized as a potential market for glasses free 3D displays, and therefore is one of the markets that DTI will seek to license into.  DTI's strategy is to license to major monitor manufacturers who can commercialize and mass produce 3D displays with DTI technology inside, making them available to NASA and others at low cost for a variety of applications.","DTI is partnering with Boeing on the Phase II project for development of a prototype glasses free 2D/3D display for testing in their 787 cockpit simulator during Phase II/Phase III, ideally leading to licensing.  The display developed under Phase II could have wider application in the avionics industry - a successful Phase III program could result in the opening of other avionics markets.  The US Army Tank Command also has an interest in 3D technology for remote controlled vehicle use.An automotive company and a point of sale display company have already expressed interest in DTI's full resolution face tracking display technology. The following long term potential markets have been investigated by DTI:Patient Education - The 150,000 dentists in the U.S. could generate an annual volume of 10,000 3D units.  Student Education - Market Research has determined that 3D content yields a 30% higher retention rate than 2D content in an education environment. This could lead to a annual demand for 250,000 3D monitors for each of the following five years. Medical - 3D visualization systems in the operating rooms are estimated to be a $2 billion market annually, including stereoscopic endoscope systems.   Consumer games and Television - The home television market is expected to have great demand for glasses-free 3D.  Variations on DTI's face tracked display that could providing 3D to more than one person are a potential solution.",Air Transportation & Safety; Display

Most of this code is written in the C programming language. We need a scalable static formal program verification tool that is able to prove the functional correctness of flight-critical software, limiting any failure of flight critical software to hardware faults.This project seeks to leverage the matching logic verification framework. Matching logic is generic in an operational semantic of a given programming language, so we also seek to give a semantics of a subset of C, called CIL, which is guaranteed to be deterministic. While we already have a semantics for the entirety of C, CIL is more representative of flight-critical software, and the simpler, deterministic semantics will result in a more efficient, and thus more scalable, static program verification tool. We are also building a new unification- based rewrite engine that will result in a more powerful version of the Matching Logic Framework.  In order to make the tool more commercially feasible, we will develop new techniques in pattern inference, so that loop invariants and some pre/post conditions can be determined automatically.  We will perform a thorough evaluation of our tool on a large-scale piece of software with similar characteristics to a flight system.","We anticipate that our tool and definition of CIL will beused in verification of all safety and mission critical flight systems.  NASAhas shown themselves to be very amenable to formal methods techniques in thepast.  Our technical contact within NASA expects such a tool to be used on vehiclestargeted at manned space missions as well as mission critical systems such as the rockets, probes, space telescopes, andlanders/rovers.","TAM for our work would be the entire software industry. Realistically, we do not have the manpower to target the entirety of the software industry. A more reasonable SAM would be those companies in the software industry where correctness is key, either because bugs are very expensive to fix (Microsoft) or where bugs are disastrous to life and limb (NASA/Boeing/medical device manufacturers). We feel that our realistic SOM is larger software development corporations that would be willing to pay larger amounts for site licenses as well as be willing to hire on verification engineers from our Runtime Verification, Inc. This will allow us to leverage our smaller number of employees in a way that results in maximal possible profits, versus marketing to smaller software developers, which will be less willing to pay for site licenses. We can move into that segment of the market later, once Runtime Verification is able to grow. Initially, we would like to focus on Aerospace companies (Boeing), Automotive (Toyota-ITC, DENSO), Finance (2Sigma), Microsoft (in particularly Windows and Office), Apple (OS X), the US Military, NSA, the large hadron collider, and Facebook (they have already shown themselves amenable to formal methods tools).","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

Current automated tools require approximate analyses; fully-assured verification with formal methods is expert-intensive. A key to improvement is machine-checkable specifications for software modules. Specifications are also needed to express the intent of software. Further, to scale to wide use, engineers who are not formal methods experts must have usable tools, as automated as possible, integrated into their usual software development environments (IDEs).Our proposal, SPEEDY, is a user experience (UX) design for convenient generation, manipulation, and checking of specifications, directly in a common IDE (Eclipse). The tool's design integrates automated specification suggestion using current tools and published techniques. The tool also enables checking and debugging specifications directly in the IDE, with information presented in the context of the source code. The proposal targets C/C++ programs, particularly for embedded software development.Phase I of SPEEDY assessed current specification languages and prototyped the key UX mechanisms: we are now confident that they can be implemented in the Eclipse IDE. We also integrated several analysis tools, demonstrating that SPEEDY can obtain specification suggestions from external sources. We assessed many specification suggestion algorithms, selecting some to be implemented and evaluated on realistic software in Phase II. Phase I also prototyped the integrating specification checking tools and specification debugging features. We demonstrated SPEEDY on NASA software from the NASA open software site.The Phase II proposal presents a plan for scaling up the successful Phase I prototype in many dimensions: more language features; more sophisticated user guidance in generating and debugging specifications; more specification suggestion algorithms; scaled up to realistic program size.","We envision these use cases for SPEEDY's specification discovery and manipulation features:1) Developers creating implementation and specifications together, with continuous automated checking2) Developers writing code to specifications previously created by experts who have designed and verified core algorithms3) Understanding and reverse engineering existing (legacy) code4) Code Review of code under development5) V&V teams inspecting developed codeNASA has applications across these use cases. There are four particular categories of potential users.1) NASA developers implementing safety-critical avionics or space-flight software can use SPEEDY in use cases 1, 2 and 4 above. SPEEDY helps them introduce formal methods into their work processes without having to swim (and sink) in the details of logics, provers, and verification conditions.2) NASA formal methods teams have the task of verifying core designs and protocols. But once designed, the result must be communicated to developers and implemented correctly. Formal specifications provide a way to enable and check this communication, and SPEEDY provides a tool in which to accomplish it easily. This is use case #2.3) NASA V&V teams can make ready use of use cases #4 and #5.4) NASA developers faced with old code or changing team members will welcome the capabilities of use case #3.","Our target market for the eventual SPEEDY product is safety and security-critical software development engineers and organizations. We are building on the current trend toward more logical formality in software development. The bulk of that market develops embedded software; this is the same market space that is addressed by GrammaTech's existing products. We believe there is an early-adopter segment of that market that is willing to increase the level of model checking/software verification/formal reasoning during software development. But we are sure this need will be satisfied only if there are tools that provide the right capabilities, in the developers' working environment, targeted to non-formal-methods experts. This market growth will be particularly the case for embedded (and robotic) software, as such software will be increasingly important to an ever more technological society.We will initially focus our (non-NASA) marketing efforts on current customers who manufacture avionics systems, medical devices, and other safety-critical embedded systems (e.g. automotive software) – e.g., FDA, Covidien, Lockheed-Martin, and Honeywell.

This sensor will also  provide enhanced vision to overcome reduced visibility in fog, drizzle and light rain and the detection of hazards/obstacles on runways for landing and takeoff applications. Specifically, this effort will build upon a developing synthetic vision system for landing piloted aircraft to: 1) customize the design and feasibility for targeted unpiloted autonomous systems (UAS), and 2) incorporate interferometry for terrain mapping and hazard detection. Dubbed ""PathIn"", the proposed sensor is comprised of a Ka-band digitally beamformed (DBF) radar interferometer that will  provide a real-time data interface for ground-collision avoidance systems. The proposed effort is aligned with the effort to integrate UAS into the National Airspace (NAS). The Phase II will realize a prototype of the PathIn sensor, leveraging our extensive radar, interferometry and DBF experience and key technology capabilities. In particular a FPGA-based digital receiver system will be extended for real-time beamforming and interferometry. At the end of the Phase II, a technology readiness level of 5 will be achieved.","The immediate NASA application of PathIn is for Ka-band interferometry to provide 3D platform-relative mapping over a relevant field of view in support of safe UAS operation in the national airspace and also piloted operation during limited low visibility conditions (i.e. fog, drizzle, etc.). The PathIn Ka-band radar interferometer electronic vision systems would complement existing synthetic vision and automated ground-collision avoidance systems.","In the commercial space, the need for landing systems to assist pilots in low visibility conditions is great. The NEXTGEN project and emphasis on improving airport runway utilization along with the savings in costs from aborted landings or delayed landings have combined to prompt the FAA to seek improvements in aircraft based systems to assist in this manner. A PathIn based 2D and 3D Electronic Flight Vision System (EFVS) would provide the measurements or imagery necessary to validate aircraft and runway location as well as hazard detection. Its integration into a Heads Up Display (HUD), showing anomalies detected with comparisons to the DEMs would provide Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) with the verification and detection needed.

The technical objectives specific to Phase II effort are twofold: (1) Analytically design the four Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) wind-tunnel models that employ Distributed Multiple Control Surfaces (DMCS) and Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF) to achieve the weight and drag benefits, and (2) Fabrication of one of these four designed models to validate the AAW-process experimentally by a future wind tunnel testing. As per the first specific objective, four wind tunnel models will be designed for high speed Transonic Dynamic Tunnel (TDT) testing along with their detailed fabrication and wind tunnel testing plans. These four models are carefully chosen to incrementally demonstrate the benefits of applying AAW technology and aeroelastic tailoring technique by potential future fabrication and wind tunnel tests. As per the second specific objective, the fabricated wind tunnel model will be delivered to NASA along with its target performance improvement predicted by AAW-process for validation with a near-term wind tunnel testing. In order to ensure the safety of the wind tunnel models during the TDT testing, flutter suppression and gust load alleviation controllers will be designed for those models that are not aeroelastically tailored and have analytically displayed potential flutter instability problems.","The proposed Phase II effort is highly relevant to several on-going and future NASA projects in NASA's fixed wing project under Fundamental Aeronautics Program such as the elastic aircraft flight control and Truss-Braced Wing (TBW) development. NASA is currently studying the application of the VCCTEF to a generic transport model (GTM) and plans to perform a wind tunnel test for measuring its drag characteristics in FY2014-2015. The AAW-process can be adopted by NASA to calculate the optimum SMA actuations for minimum drag prediction to provide a guideline for establishing a viable wind tunnel test plan. NASA also plans to extend the VCCTEF concept to the TBW configuration with a planned wind tunnel test in FY2016-2017. Upon completion of the proposed Phase II effort, a wind tunnel model for the baseline DMCS configuration will already be submitted to NASA and can be readily tested in the wind tunnel for validation of load alleviation and drag characteristics. Thus, NASA can perform a wind tunnel test on this baseline DMCS wind tunnel model as an intermediate step prior to the VCCTEF-TBW testing to validate the AAW-process. Once validated, the AAW-process can be used to establish a viable wind tunnel test plan for the VCCTEF-TBW model. It thus can be seen that through the research planned to be conducted during Phase II of this effort, NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program will benefit significantly, thereby largely expanding NASA's technology portfolio.","Since AAW-process developed in this effort can lead to a minimum-weight and minimum-drag design, it will be highly desirable to both military and commercial aircraft companies. ZONA plans to use the results of the wind-tunnel test of DMCS model as a showcase for demonstrating the capabilities of AAW-process. With the experience gained and lessons learned during the Phase II effort, ZONA will have an increased level of confidence to assist the aircraft companies for applying the AAW technology to their designs. Furthermore, since the application of AAW technology requires a set of ZONA commercial software, the ZONA software will be increasingly used by the aircraft design companies, thereby expanding ZONA's software market share. The AAW technology and aeroelastic tailoring technique explored in Phase I + II of this effort can be effectively extended for application towards many categories of flight vehicles including X-56A MUTT, X-48B blended wing-body, joined-wings, sub/supersonic transports, morphing wing aircraft, space planes, reusable launch vehicles, and future military aircraft.",Aerodynamics; Characterization; Composites; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Structures

The plasma fairing will use single dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) plasma actuators to reduce flow- separations and impingement around the landing gear, which are the dominant sources of landing gear noise.  The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the plasma fairing concept on a generalized tandem cylinder configuration that shared important features of key sections of the G550 landing gear, specifically the relationship between the strut and the torque arm.  The Phase II extends the concept to a more complex geometry: G550 landing gear.  We will develop aeroacoustic simulations using University of Notre Dame's state-of-the-art plasma actuator model and Exa Corporation's flow solver PowerFLOW, coupled with experiments in an anechoic wind tunnel with both aerodynamic and acoustic measurements on a scaled G550 nose gear model to design and optimize a Plasma Fairing configuration that provides significant noise reduction on the G550 landing gear.  We anticipate a technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 at the end of the Phase II project.","The plasma fairing technology directly addresses research/technical challenges for two NASA projects under the NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate: (1) Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project (research challenge: reduce aircraft noise by 1/8 compared with current standards); and (2) The Fixed Wing Project - Quieter Low-Speed Performance (research challenge: reduce perceived community noise by 12 dB cum with minimal impact on weight and performance).While the main thrust of this SBIR work is to develop Plasma Fairings for reducing landing gear noise, these fairings can be effectively configured to reduce noise caused by the high-lift devices such as wing flaps and slats.  Other potential NASA applications of the plasma technology include lift enhancement and drag reduction on aircraft wings, high angle-of-attack operation using plasma actuators as lifting devices, enhanced performance and efficiency of propulsion (S-ducts, inlets) and aerodynamic (control surfaces) systems at both on- and off-design conditions, and improved cycle efficiency of NASA's air-breathing propulsion systems.","Potential non-NASA applications for the plasma actuators include design of revolutionary subsonic and hypersonic aerospace vehicles for commercial and military (DoD) purposes, use in turbomachinery systems, noise-control on landing gears of commercial aircraft, design of smart wind turbine rotor blades, drag reduction on ground vehicles, smart helicopter rotor blades, tip-casing clearance flow control for reduced turbine losses, control of flow surge and stall in compressors, and turbulent transition control experiments.",Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics

Turboelectric propulsion for aircraft applications is envisioned, and cryogenic and superconducting components are sought. In particular, low AC loss superconducting wires for the stator windings and superconducting wires with filaments less than 10 micrometers in diameter are of interest. There is an intense push in the aircraft industry to ultimately develop an all-electric aircraft, with liquid hydrogen and fuel cells being considered as the prime generation source for aircraft propulsion. The U.S. is in competition with Europe for the development the next generation all-electric aircraft.  Superconductivity especially magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconductors are considered an enabling technology that is being investigated by NASA, Air Force, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and EADS.  This means the need for a low cost, low AC loss (fine filament superconductor) that can operate in the 10-25K temperature range in 0-2 tesla fields for superconducting stators for motors and generators.  This wire is need by 2016-2017 time frame so all cryogenic motors and generators can fabricated and tested in the NASA test bed.  In the Phase I Hyper Tech has shown that fine filament MgB2 wires can be fabricated and there is potential for low AC losses in the 60-400 Hz range for stators.  In the Phase II Hyper Tech will continue to work on developing, manufacturing, and testing fine filament MgB2 wire.  The wires will also be twisted to reduce coupling losses.  The wires will be tested for their superconductor and engineering current density and AC losses.  The result of this work will be a low AC loss MgB2 superconductor wire for enabling all-electric aircraft development and allow the U.S. industry to lead the world in this needed and rapid developing technology.","Besides stator coils for the all-electric aircraft, magnesium diboride superconductors can benefit NASA for many applications where light weight power components are required such as generators, motors, transformers, inductors, power conditioning equipment and ADR coils. Other magnet applications that magnesium diboride wires can be considered for are magnetic bearings, actuators, MHD magnets, propulsion engines, magnetic shielding in space, and magnetic launch devices.","For Non-NASA commercial applications, MgB2 superconductor wires for DC applications are: rotor coils for motors and generators, background magnets for MRI systems to eliminate liquid helium bath cooling, inductive type superconducting fault current limiters.

Aerodynamic efficiency is the foundation of energy-efficient flight in any regime, and low drag is one of the fundamental characteristics of aerodynamic efficiency. For supersonic aircraft, drag can be broadly decomposed into four components: viscous or skin friction drag, lift-induced drag, wave or compressibility drag, and excrescence drag. The relative impact of these four drag forces depends upon vehicle-specific characteristics and design. However, viscous skin friction drag stands out as particularly significant across most classes of flight vehicles. Therefore, effective techniques to reduce skin friction drag on a vehicle will have a major and far-reaching impact on flight efficiency for low supersonic aircraft. In an effort to address the need for increased aerodynamic efficiency of low supersonic vehicles, PM&AM Research, in collaboration with Texas A&M University, propose to build upon our successful Phase I effort to mature/develop our novel energy deposition technologies, using basic, well-demonstrated energy-deposition techniques along the surface in supersonic flow to control/compress/forcibly-move the boundary layer fluid by creating a low-density ""bubble-like"" region, thereby reducing the viscous skin friction. Once matured, this solution will reduce the drag experienced by a low supersonic platform, allowing vehicles to exhibit increased aerodynamic efficiency.","Our technology can be used to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of a wide range of supersonic NASA programs, including access to space platforms and prototype aircraft.","Our technology can be used to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of a wide range of supersonic Government and industry platforms including supersonic business jets, commercial and military access to space vehicles, supersonic cruise vehicles, and high-speed delivery platforms, among others","Active Systems; Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Conversion; Lasers (Weapons); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Transport/Traffic Control; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

Active Combustion Instability Control (ACIC) controls the combustion process such that the heat release profile is modulated to dampen the naturally occurring thermoacoustic instabilities. A major challenge to effective implementation of active combustion control is the availability of valves and actuators that provide adequate flow modulation control authority. The majority of the published work revolves around valves designed to modulate the main combustor flow. At present these valves are not designed to operate in a harsh environment and as such are required to be located outside the main flow path, reducing their control authority. To effectively meet the challenge, valves and sensors that are smaller, more responsive and robust must be developed. Ultimately the control valves are co-located with the fuel injection manifold. The trade-off for the harsh environment operation is the ability to maximize the flow modulation control authority. The objective of this research is to integrate the required control authority into an operational environment. This research continues the development of a light weight fast-acting fuel control valve for harsh environment operation. In the Phase 1 effort, the valve demonstrated the ability to modulate fluid flow at 1,000 Hz.  This demonstrated the valve will allow the precise time dependent fuel control required for lean-burn combustor operability. In this Phase II research a Prototype valve is designed, fabricated and flow tested using commercially-available driver circuitry to  demonstrate valve operation in harsh thermal environments.","Potential NASA applications include those application where a valve can cycle at high frequencies.  These applications include liquid rocket engine combustion stability control, where the principles being applied to combustion control for gas turbine engines can be applied.  In this application, the ability to modulate the propellant flow at frequencies above 1,000 Hz may be advantageous.  A second potential application is in high frequency valves for pulsing space engines such as the Pulse Inductive Thrusters.  These units require valves that operate a flow rates and pulse frequencies similar to the current ACCV.  In addition they require very long life, as these low force thrusters operate for very long periods of time.  The effort being proposed will provide solutions that are applicable to both of these applications.","The valve has a direct application to active combustion control in gas turbines.  The valve allows precise time dependent fuel control required for lean-burn combustor operability. The small size, internal cooling capability and high frequency modulation capability of 1,000 Hz makes it directly applicable for use in this application. The benefit of harsh environment operation is the ability to maximize the flow modulation control authority due to close proximity to the fuel injector.  The valve also has application to combustion stability control in commercial liquid fueled rocket engines.  Using active combustion control in rocket engines has the potential to save millions of dollars in development costs and reduce development schedules",Active Systems; Actuators & Motors; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Process Monitoring & Control

Significant rotorcraft problems such as dynamic stall, rotor blade loads in forward flight, and blade-vortex interaction all have significant unsteady pressure oscillations that must be resolved in order to understand the underlying physics. Installation of pressure transducers is difficult and expensive on rotorcraft models, and the resulting data has limited spatial resolution. Application of a fast-responding pressure-sensitive paint should provide unsteady surface pressure distributed over the blade surface. Fast PSP measurements have been demonstrated at NASA Langley on a 2-meter rotor model in hover and in forward flight by the ISSI/OSU team using two single camera systems. More recently, measurements were conducted in forward flight using multiple cameras and lasers at two azimuthal positions. We propose expanding this system for production testing. During Phase I, a lens controller + pan/tilt stages with Ethernet control and presets was developed. This device will be used to control the field of view of the system remotely. Mitigation of motion blur at the tip was demonstrated using a galvanic mirror. A temperature measurement capability using TSP was added to the system to allow temperature corrections to be applied to the PSP data. Fast efficient data processing software that included automatic image registration and scripting of repetitive operations was investigated to speed up data processing. These new tools and software will be integrated into the data acquisition package and data processing package to improve accuracy and productivity during testing.","There is considerable interest in measurements of unsteady pressure for evaluation of computational models and study of flow physics on hypersonic inlets, compressors, aeroelasticity, and rotorcraft aerodynamics.

The proposed Phase II SBIR research effort will seek to create wall shear sensors that can be applied to measure signals at temperatures in excess of 1,100","The proposed MEMS sensors can be applied to the measurement of both flow and acceleration in extreme environments and therefore the commercial potential of the technology is broad. Current high temperature flow sensors are limited to optical MEMS and laser-Doppler anemometers.  However these technologies have a large probe volume, have not demonstrated accuracy better than 10% under fluctuating shear conditions and do not offer direct, dynamic, time-resolved skin friction measurements with sufficient frequency response and accuracy to resolve transitional or turbulent flows. The proposed sensors can be designed as a surface mount package and does not function based on optical measurements which require costly signal conditioning electronics, thus creating a significant opportunity for commercialization. Beyond future use in flow sensing, the nanowire arrays offer acceleration sensitivity and thus may find use in a wide range of additional applications in structural dynamics or condition monitoring. Accelerometers have become a ubiquitous technology in modern electronics yet require costly and complex manufacturing processes and are unstable in extreme environments. The proposed sensors were shown to be accurate high bandwidth accelerometers while being processed using simple and low cost methods. With this technology being the only MEMS scale accelerometer compatible with the extreme environments found in turbomachinery, the sensors have excellent commercialization potential.","Beyond the specific applications identified for the extreme environments in NASA applications, the proposed sensors can be applied to the broader commercial accelerometer market.  MEMS accelerometers currently represent a $1.7 billion dollar market and may be the most successful MEMS technology ever commercialized.  While MEMS devices can be produced on a large scale through wafer level manufacturing, they require complex manufacturing processes and costly equipment which has generally been a limiting factor in the production of MEMS devices over the past two decades.  The high operation cost of such equipment has also led to a consolidation of the market for MEMS foundry services removing many small businesses.  The MEMS scale sensors developed are fabricated without the need for complex and expensive lithography, physical deposition and etching tools that are required in traditional MEMS processing.  The proposed nanowire arrays only require a single growth step and can be fabricated onto surfaces or substrates of varying composition.  Furthermore, the process does not require the hazardous and environmentally toxic chemicals widely used in traditional MEMs processing.  This unique approach will allow the rapid and low cost development of the sensors at HARP Engineering and without significant capital required for equipment purchases.  This low cost will provide HARP with a competitive advantage over competing MEMS technologies.",Acoustic/Vibration; Contact/Mechanical; Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Nanomaterials

Lynntech has demonstrated the feasibility of a novel low power, low temperature plasma assisted catalysis process for addressing these limitations with the methanation of CO2 at a scale of 14 g/h methane production rate. In the Phase II project, Lynntech proposes to build and demonstrate a full scale (0.55 kg/h methane production rate) Sabatier reactor for NASA application. The anticipated Technology Readiness Level at the beginning and ending of Phase II will be 3 and 4, respectively.","Lynntech's non thermal plasma assisted Sabatier reactor technology provides an energy efficient, low temperature and durable product for the generation of methane from CO2 for following NASA applications: (1) Propellant production on Mars from the Martian CO2, (2) Atmospheric revitalization of the cabin environment for utilization of CO2 in the cabin.","The Sabatier technology can be used for CO2 sequestration or as an intermediate processing technique for fuel or chemical production in the commercial market.  The primary and sub-markets for Lynntech's Sabatier technology are as follows: (1) CO2 sequestration with SNG formation for a number of areas including power plants and petrochemical industry. (2) CO removal (specific methanation) technology for purification of reformate or hydrogen streams from fuel reformation. (3) Reformation processes such as dry reforming of methane with CO2. The plasma assisted catalytic reactor design has several applications in following areas: (1) Gas purification (such as impurity removal from biogas, natural gas, LPG, etc.), (2) Diesel exhaust gas purification for NOx and SOx abatement, (3)Fuel reformation for hydrogen generation and (4) Sluggish catalytic reactions requiring high activation energies.",Fuels/Propellants; Heat Exchange; In Situ Manufacturing; Resource Extraction

The system is a gravity-independent, compact, leak-tight, Solid Oxide Electrolyzer (SOE) system with embedded Sabatier reactors (ESR). Applying Corning Incorporated (Corning) Intellectual Property (IP), ENrG and Paragon can leverage an all-ceramic, efficient, and low mass solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that remains leak-tight after hundreds of thermal cycles. Paragon proposes that incorporation of the all-ceramic technology into our SOE/ESR system will result in a design that will: 1) be thermally shock tolerant and capable of hundreds of on-off cycles at faster cycles than compared to the metal-to-ceramic SOE designs, 2) be lighter, smaller, and require less power than existing designs, 3) allow for high (>90%) single pass utilization of feedstock, and 4) achieve a thermodynamic efficiency of up to 80%. Our Phase II effort includes laboratory tests to optimize operation of an all-ceramic design for increased single pass utilization of the feed stock and mitigation of carbon deposition. Engineering analyses and component testing will be performed to inform the design of a stack. The stack will be built and tested to verify requirements. Results will be used to size a full system with recommendations for integration.  An engineering development unit will be built and delivered to NASA. Integrating cells that operate as either an electrolyzer or a Sabatier reactor simplifies operations, lowers hardware complexity, and increases reliability. The proposed system can perform multiple functions without modifications, making it a readily deployable technology for various missions from ISRU on the Moon and Mars to regenerating 100% of a crew's oxygen in spacecraft or habitats.","SOE/ESRs can be used to produce oxygen from in situ planetary resources and to regenerate 100% of the oxygen needs of a crew from crew-produced CO2 and H2O vapor. The SOE/ESR can be designed to satisfy various missions, regardless of destination or the technology chosen for using the extraterrestrial resources (e.g., hydrogen vs carbothermal lunar regolith reduction). SOE operated as a regenerative fuel can supply power, for example when solar power is unavailable.","SOE/ESR development could allow less massive oxygen systems in commercial spacecraft vehicles currently under development. A point underscored by Paragon's existing relationships with industry. SOE/ESR oxygen regeneration systems can also be utilized in underwater research facilities, submarines, high altitude aircraft, or emergency bunkers. Hazardous material handlers, rescue personnel, or other professionals performing in extreme environments would benefit greatly from a self-contained oxygen supply system that requires no external supply of consumables. Also, SOE operated as a regenerative fuel can be used in back-up emergency power systems or as relief systems during high energy-use periods of the day.","Ceramics; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Simulation & Modeling; Storage"

Phase II will result in a complete full-scale implementation of a general framework and its application to several problems at KSC to create several operational systems (e.g., for Ground Processing (GP) and the Cryogenic Test Bed (CTB)) and other systems targeting future, advanced applications (e.g., autonomous cryogenic operations).  During Phase II, delivered applications will improve scheduling of SLS Processing and V&V activity, including reduced scheduler manpower, reduced turnaround time in response to changes and what-ifs, and more optimal schedules; improve CTB Planning and Scheduling; and complete the diagnosis, planning, scheduling, and execution closed loop system for more-automatic ground and autonomous space-based cryogenic operations.  The KSC Engineering Development Lab has substantial development and testing efforts ongoing for automatically diagnosing faults in cryogenic operations.  By interfacing our system to these applications, it effectively completes the closed loop system required for completely autonomous operations.  Our Phase II system will participate in a number of demonstrations during Phase II to prove the capabilities for future advanced more-automatic ground and space-based operations.  Letters of support are included in this proposal from the managers of the groups that would use the operational systems in Phase II and the manager of the project demonstrating future, advanced applications.  This Phase II effort will also improve the ability of SMEs to customize intelligent scheduling systems, capture corporate knowledge, and implement the required interfaces to allow operational use and participation in cryogenic operations demonstrations.","The most direct targets for transition of this proposed effort are the large number of various payload and vehicle processing planning, scheduling, and execution applications at KSC, most specifically GP SLS processing and V&V scheduling, CTB Test Planning and Scheduling, and autonomous cryogenic operations.  These customers will begin using delivered applications operationally during the Phase II.  By showing their ability to create high-quality schedules with greatly reduced manpower, they will clearly illustrate the advantages over the status quo.  Because it will be possible for SMEs to customize the applications themselves to their own scheduling problems, a large number of intelligent scheduling applications can be quickly developed.  As more are fielded, additional synergies will be created by the cooperative interactions between the different intelligent scheduling applications.  Capabilities to easily interface and interact cooperatively and in a peer-to-peer manner with legacy scheduling systems will also provide additional cooperative synergies.  This is especially true given that Primavera is the designated schedule rendering and transmission tool for all of KSC and our system will have Primavera import/export capabilities.  There is potential to automate the majority of scheduling decision-making at KSC with a corresponding massive savings in highly skilled manpower.  Beyond KSC, NASA has many difficult scheduling problems the system could be readily adapted to.","Cape Canaveral Air Force Station has nearly identical scheduling problems as do the various commercial space companies (Space X, Blue Origin, Boeing, ULA, etc.).  On the commercial side, Stottler Henke already sells the Aurora intelligent scheduling framework and associated customization services to private companies.  Commercial Aurora sales have already resulted in over $5 million in revenue.  Phase II improvements can be readily incorporated into Aurora and sold through existing channels.  By providing for SME customization, this effort will be removing the most significant current constraint on Aurora sales—the need for Stottler Henke in 90% of the customization projects.  An SME-customizable version of Aurora would be applicable to orders of magnitude more customers.  And by requiring far less of our time, it would allow us to sell the product for far less.  More specifically, the types of 3-D graphical resource and constraint editing and scheduling being added (for hazardous operations and space and weight limited areas) will also make the Phase II system applicable to the Ship Building, Refinery Turnaround, Power Plant Turnaround, Mining, and Commercial Space markets; commercial markets that we have specifically targeted for the new capabilities and have reseller agreements already for.

ANSIBLE (A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement) leverages evidence based strategies to 1) augment asynchronous communications using Virtual Environments (VEs) and facilitate novel interaction methods beyond email, 2) use the inherently immersive and stimuli rich nature of VEs to counteract sensory monotony, and 3) leverages VEs and intelligent Virtual Agents (VAs) as companions and advisors to combat social monotony and detect changes in astronaut psychosocial states can increase astronaut self-awareness, suggest countermeasures, and provide rehearsal scenarios to maintain and enhance interpersonal skills.  Along with Dr. Morie, SIFT will leverage its prior work with human communication models and unobtrusive detection of psychosocial dimensions, to enhance VE and VA technologies.

However, future long duration missions will heavily rely on asynchronous communication due to the expected time delay. ANSIBLE will provide additional methods beyond email to combat social and sensory monotony. While ANSIBLE will have the technologies to accommodate the communication latencies, it can also be used in real time, during pre- and post-flight when crew and families may be geographically separated (e.g. due to training schedules), thus providing a longitudinal continuum for connecting with their social support systems.  Further, VEs are natural environments to provide training, skills maintenance, as well as cooperative experiential learning.  VAs are guides and instructors in  other domains, and they may be of greater importance to serve in those roles in the context of limited real-time communications.","There are many potential ANSIBLE applications.  Military service members can use ANSIBLE to connect with family, friends, and psychological health support before, during, and after deployment.  Virtual avatars can function as therapists and not only reach a larger population, but also allow anonymity which has been shown to be a preferred option for many end users. Outside of telehealth, the global military simulation and virtual training market (estimated $9.03 billion in 2012), and simulation-based learning (revenues estimated at $2.48 billion by 2015) are natural fits to an ANSIBLE like tool.  Further, the growth rate of virtual meetings in companies is estimated to be 80 , with tools like Conversity meetings  bringing together global team members for 'face-to-face' exchanges in Second Life.

This will be accomplished by designing and building a rugged, small, low mass, low power, easy to use analyzer that can identify and quantify API and degradation products with little or no sample handling in 1 minute.

The inlet pressure for these systems is typically on the order of 1.4 psia with a discharge pressure requirement above atmospheric pressure.  In the past this has required multiple stages of compression by machines operating at high speeds on ball bearings.  The bearing life in these machines was at most a few hundred hours.  While this is feasible to use for a proof of concept test system, it is not acceptable for the H2 compressors in application at the launch pad.  It is desired to replace these grease-packed ball bearings with foil bearings to greatly increase compressor life.  Additionally higher speed can eliminate several stages thus reducing complexity and cost of the system.  If this technology proves feasible it could finally make densified LH2 propellant a reality for future launch and space applications.","The potential applications for this technology at NASA are widespread.  In addition to propellant densification for use in liquid rocket engines at launch, there are also applications that involve long term in-space storage of the propellants to be used on vehicles over months or years.  By subcooling the propellant it drastically reduces boil-off of the cryogens over time and thus improves storage life.  The applications include on-vehicle propellant storage for long range mission and propellant depots that are planned for space.  Liquid cryogenic injection at the foil bearing also makes sense for rocket engine turboumps.  This bearing innovation for LOX and LH2 turbopumps could greatly increase life over the ball bearings currently used which will be especially appealing for the long range missions planned for the future.",There are also numerous applications outside of NASA.  Numerous private companies are currently designing and building rockets that use turbopumps.

SLM enables us to ""print"" the spool piece in days, despite the complexity of the regenerative liner's inherent flow passage complexity. This reduction in manufacturing lead time, combined with the fact that SLM manufacturing costs are driven in large part by the amount of raw powder used during fabrication, results in a substantial cost reduction for future regeneratively-cooled rocket engines. Additionally, the proposed advanced regenerative cooling approach features a heat-pickup efficiency that is at least two orders of magnitude higher than traditional milled channel liners and/or brazed tube bundle chambers.As a result of our Phase I activity and confidence in our commercialization path, we will be making a capital investment to stand up an SLM manufacturing capability in house.  We plan to augment that investment with an internally-funded trade study that we will use to derive main combustion chamber performance requirements for a future expander cycle engine.  Those requirements will feed into Phase II design requirements and, ultimately, to supporting our commercialization opportunity presented by the Affordable Upper Stage Engine Program.","The Affordable Upper Stage Enginer (AUSE) is our primary NASA application.  The upper stage engine, which will replace the RL10, will benefit from our SLM-manufactured MCC in three ways.  First, SLM is known to reduce the cost of component manufacture by 50-70%, which will help satisfy affordability requirements.  Second, the pressure drop penalty incurred by using our advanced cooling approach is reduced by about an order of magnitude over current state of the art, which will reduce turbompump requirements, which will also contribute to lower cost.  Third, our approach provides a dramatic increase in heat flux to the regenerative propellant, which will enable an increase in expander cycle engine performance, by increasing its potential for doing work across the turbine.  The Space Launch System (SLS) Program is another opportunity, particularly since the core stage will use the RS-25 engine, a staged combustion cycle that will likewise benefit from reductions in cooling jacket pressure drop. The Altair ascent and descent engines would also both benefit from our technology.","We are already actively pursuing a non-NASA opportunity with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), which is forced to fly very expensive foreign missile systems as targets for interept missions.  Today, these targets cost about $40M per mission.  We have identified a low cost target that we can upgrade with a version of our SLM-manufactured advanced combustion chamber that will improve the range of that target, such that it can be used instead of the expensive foreign systems.

Recently, advanced additive manufacturing techniques (EL-Form and Vacuum Plasma Spray Forming) have been developed that enable the deposition of coatings and near-net-shape refractory metal components with high density and tailored microstructures.  The Phase I investigation produced fine-grained W claddings using EL-Form and VPS processing techniques.  Testing showed the W claddings were well bonded to surrogate nuclear fuel element materials, and the W claddings were vacuum tight.  During Phase II, the techniques developed during Phase I will be optimized, and W claddings on full size cermet fuel elements will be developed and characterized.  Subscale and full-size test articles will be produced and delivered to NASA-MSFC for hot hydrogen testing in the Compact Fuel Element Environment Test (CFEET) facility and the Nuclear Thermal Rocket Element Environment Simulator (NTREES).","NASA applications that would directly benefit from this technology include Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP).  Space nuclear power and propulsion are game changing technologies for space exploration.  Initial NTP systems will have specific impulses roughly twice that of the best chemical systems, i.e., reduced propellant requirements and/or reduced trip time.  Currently, NASA's Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (NCPS) project is working to demonstrate the viability and affordability of NTP.  The proposed Phase II effort would greatly assist NASA with achieving the goals of the NCPS project.  Potential NASA missions include rapid robotic exploration missions throughout the solar system and piloted missions to Mars and other destinations such as near earth asteroids.","Both government and commercial entities in the following sectors use advanced high-temperature materials for the following applications: coatings, defense, material R&D, nuclear power, aerospace, propulsion, automotive, electronics, crystal growth, and medical.  Targeted commercial applications include net-shape fabrication of refractory rocket nozzles, crucibles, heat pipes, fuel rods, and propulsion subcomponents; and advanced coating systems for x-ray targets, sputtering targets, turbines, and rocket engines.","Ceramics; Characterization; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Conversion; Destructive Testing; Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Main Engine"

The most important feature that sets this thruster apart from other similar devices will be the use of an innovative, long-life catalyst. This proprietary catalyst, constructed without any bed plate or ceramic substrate, has the potential to suppress catalyst-related performance degradation problems that often plague monopropellant thrusters. The Phase II thruster in essence will be a matured version of the highly-successful Phase I prototype, with the addition of high-temperature nozzle material.  To further demonstrate the design's scalability, a 100N class thruster will be developed and demonstrated at the end of Phase II.","Potential NASA applications of both the 5N and 100N green monopropellant thrusters include missions to low Earth orbits and beyond.  Near-term examples are the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) at GEO, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) at GEO, the International X-ray Observatory (IXO) at L2, and the next Mars robotics mission scheduled for 2020 launch.  As with state-of-the-art reaction control rockets Busek's green monopropellant thrusters are radiation-cooled and restart-able, making them a simple yet reliable propulsion option.  In addition, the green propellant's storability and low-toxicity will be attractive for NASA's future manned spaceflight.  Without the need for excessive safety measures, overall operational cost for the manned missions will be reduced.","The market size for green monopropellant thrusters is very large.  In addition to NASA, all branches of the military are interested in deploying them for tactical or in-space applications.  The non-toxic storable feature of the propellant enables preloaded propulsion systems that can accommodate rapid launch operations.  Because Busek's thrusters have the potential for extended life without performance degradation, developers of GEO communication satellites will likely consider them for both reaction control and primary propulsion.  This versatility will help broaden market access.  A successful Phase II program will lead to direct sales or licensing of the thrusters and the associated catalyst technology.",Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices

Unlike competing deposition technologies severely limited by substrate size and dimensions, NanoSonic's rare earth silicate coatings may be spray deposited under ambient conditions onto large area complex substrates and converted to mechanically robust, thermally insulative EBCs on a production basis.  In fact, legacy spray equipment employed for hardcoat deposition within the marine, automotive and aerospace industries has been used for successful EBC deposition. Simulated NTP testing completed by the University of Washington on coated Inconel 625 substrates indicate five candidate EBCs have exceptional environmental, dimensional, and adhesive durability within flow conditions representative of NTP rocket engines. In fact, zero spallation, erosion, or any other form of coating degradation was observed at the thermal limit of testing of 1,950 C. All candidate resins may be transitioned to 200-gallon batch production quantities within an established manufacturing infrastructure.","NanoSonic's yttrium silicate coatings will serve as a next-generation alternative to line-of-sight vacuum assisted EB-PVD coatings for lifetime and performance gains  on nozzle, throat and core rocket engine components. Since the technology is spray deposited using legacy HVLP equipment under ambient conditions, literally any rocket propulsion component may be coated during a continuous or semi-continuous process during vehicle construction, as well as retrofitted on existing large area, irregularly shaped structures in need of high temperature thermal, corrosive and erosion protection.","Broad secondary commercial and DoD applications will be continuously sought for NanoSonic's polymer derived rare earth silicate EBCs.  Of particular interest is the foreseen return-on-investment for aerospace, marine and automotive engine components and subcomponents integrating NanoSonic's EBCs for enhanced thermal insulation, corrosion and erosion durability.  Additionally, NanoSonic's polymer derived EBC coating technology may serve as an integral enabling technology for the use of fiber reinforced polymeric composites in closer proximity to engine systems by providing highly efficient, thin (<75 microns) insulative coatings.","Airship/Lighter-than-Air Craft; Atmospheric Propulsion; Characterization; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fire Protection; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Launch Engine/Booster; Nanomaterials; Passive Systems; Polymers; Processing Methods; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Surface Propulsion; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

The sorbent can be integrated as a thin layer into an existing cartridge used in the ISS first response crew mask; the new media will greatly extend the capability to protect against the NH3 and hydrazine for extended duration under high contaminant challenges, without undermining the ability of the cartridge to filter out other combustion by-products.In Phase I, we successfully completed all proof-of-concept demonstrations at the bench-scale elevating the TRL to 3.

Our innovative design for the preconcentrator combines high water sampling flow rates with low dead volume, thus enhancing preconcentration. This is designed to meet monitoring needs for NASA's Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs) and addresses a key technology gap for long-duration human spaceflight, since standard techniques will not function without gravitation to stabilize phase boundaries. Human exploration of the solar system will depend on such technology, since water must be recycled and the option of returning grab samples to Earth for analysis from beyond low-Earth orbits does not exist.  During Phase II, we plan to incorporate this technology into a miniaturized water preconcentrator module. Based on our Phase I results we project that it will be possible to develop this module with a mass of about 0.5 kg and average power consumption of <1 watt.","Thorleaf Research's miniaturized water preconcentration module will be designed to interface with spacecraft instrumentation for air-monitoring, such as the Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM) which has now successfully completed two-years of testing on the International Space Station. It should also be possible to adapt our high flow, low dead volume design to the next generation of miniature air-monitoring instrumentation, such as the micro-Gas Monitor (mGM) currently under development at NASA/JPL, or other instrumentation. This will enable NASA's goal of long-term monitoring of trace contaminants in both air and water using a single instrument.Since we intend to follow a modular design approach in our Phase II development, this core instrumentation can be adapted to other detectors of interest, and for other NASA needs. For example, our preconcentrator technology may be applicable in process monitoring for the extraction of planetary resources such as water from Lunar or Martian soils, especially where this water will be used for human consumption. It may also be possible to adapt our preconcentrator sampling system for use in non-aqueous solvents. For example, an important future NASA planetary mission application might arise for preconcentration of trace organic compounds in the cryogenic methane-ethane lakes on Saturn's moon Titan.","Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%. Our modular design approach for the miniaturized high flow, low dead-volume preconcentrator for trace levels of contaminants in water under microgravity conditions should allow it to be adapted for miniature field portable analytical chemical instrumentation to meet specialized environmental monitoring needs.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support)"

For these long duration missions, NASA is interested in replacing the iodine water treatment system with ionic silver. Although iodine treated water has been used successfully with the International Space Station, its use requires that the iodine be removed before being consumed by astronauts due to its adverse effects on the thyroid. For long duration exploration missions, minimal mass systems are desired that lessen logistical supply requirements for storing and distributing potable water. In particular, it is imperative that an effective biocide is used that prevents microbial growth, biofilm formation, and microbially induced corrosion in the water storage and distribution systems. To address these needs, Reactive Innovations, LLC successfully demonstrated a Phase I program that developed an electrochemical silver ion generator to produce an effective biocide solution for disinfecting water throughout the water storage and distribution system. A follow-on Phase II program will further develop and optimize this cell and control system. This biocide delivery system will be demonstrated in a relevant environment showing its long life performance for preventing biofilm growth.","A potable water treatment process is needed to prevent microbial growth and biofilm formation in the water storage and distribution system for long duration missions. Silver ions have been proven by NASA to be effective for such microbial control, however, there remain significant challenges with the biocide delivery system and materials of construction that are compatible with silver.

Unlike traditional analysis where highly-trained engineers spend days to months developing, running, and evaluating high-resolution models, QuickSTAT provides the similar results in near real-time to a broader range of users. QuickSTAT will enable, on one hand, highly skilled thermal engineers to more effectively explore complex design spaces, while on the other hand give better engineering design access to less skilled engineers and program stakeholders. For thermal analysts involved in multi-dimensional trade studies, QuickSTAT provides the means to rapidly compare hundreds or thousands of discrete design points and identify trends that lead to more optimal design solutions. For designers of low-cost spacecraft, QuickSTAT can enable quick and efficient thermal design trade studies without investing in a high-end thermal analysis tools.","QuickSTAT will enable the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate's (HEOMD) chartered responsibilities of; 1 reduce costs of future human space flight, and 2) providing a tool that will reduce the cost and time required for design and analysis of spacecraft TCS.

However, even in light of advances in electronics efficiency figures, the increased power density operational points result in the generation of excess heat.  In order to maintain efficiency and to product sensitive components from thermally-induced failure, intelligent rejection of thermal energy is often a critically limiting constraint in system development.  Novel concepts for thermal management are particular necessary in applications with finite energy stores, such as long-duration space missions.  The Prime Photonics magnetothermal fluid pump provides for game-changing, autonomous self-powered thermal management systems.Our self-powered pump converts excess thermal energy into point-of-use mechanical energy with a low mass insertion penalty.  The operational frequency of the pump is proportional to the magnitude of the thermal gradient, supplying additional pump capacity in response to increased thermal loads.","Cubesat thermal management:  For smaller craft thermal rejection or management requirements, a self-powered pump would allow for the design and implementation of systems that do not consume limited electrical power resources.Remote sensor thermal management:  The autonomous, self-powered pump scavenges all operational energy requirements from the thermal gradient under management, requiring neither electrical leads for device powering nor for any control signals.Long duration lunar lander projects:  Actively pump thermal management concepts for lunar lander missions have in general not been considered due to parasitic power consumption.  The self-powered, autonomous capability of the magnetothermal fluid pump allows for advance heat spreading and alternative thermal management system design with no additional power consumption.EVA or astronaut thermal control:  Our technology can be tuned to operate with very small thermal gradient excitation with a wide range of absolute temperature ranges.  As such, thermal management, including heat or cooling, could be powered through astronaut body heat, or scavenged thermal energy from avionics.","High-density electronics cooling:  With the exponential growth of cloud computing, social media, and internet commerce, large server farms are necessary to handle the vast data uploads and throughputs necessary maintain high bandwidth quality.  Energy required to power thermal rejection technologies reduces profitability of companies, increases carbon footprints, and results in a reliance on grid power.  The autonomous, self-powered magnetothermal pump proposed here would alleviate much of the costs associated with powering cooling systems, and with associated control systems.Concentrated solar energy generation:  Modern multi-junction silicon photovoltaics demonstrate efficiencies far beyond those available even several years ago.  However, even at 20% efficiency, significant portions of the 1kW/m2 solar irradiation incident on the panels must be converted to heat.  However, in order to operate at mutli-sun concentration, advanced heat rejection systems are required in order to maintain sufficiently low junction temperatures so as not to decrease quantum conversion efficiency with PVs.  Often, the power required for active cooling cannot be offset economically through increases in PV output power.  As such, typical concentrated solar arrays are passively cooled with pronounced fined aluminum heat sinks.  The incorporation of a self-powered fluid pump would shift the optimization of the cooling system, allowing for further solar concentration with no added energy cost.","Active Systems; Actuators & Motors; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Conversion; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Generation; Heat Exchange; Passive Systems; Remediation/Purification; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Thermal"

This can translate into smaller systems, lowering capital costs.  Our system is also expected to provide more efficient regeneration (lower thermal energy requirement), thus reducing operating costs.  The monolithic support also offers pressure-drop advantages for CO2 capture from the flue gas.European and US manufacturers are having more difficulty with single-use CO2 scrubbers due to the increased disposal costs.  Regenerable technologies will provide advantages when the overall life cycle costs are counted (e.g., disposal).

Currently, the maximum power available from conventional solar arrays, for a given spacecraft, is limited by either the weight or stowage volume of the honeycomb panel substrates. Flexible substrate arrays can enable higher power spacecraft by improving specific power (W/kg) and specific volume (kW/m3) as well as improving the deployed natural frequency. Typical designs for flexible substrate array require a stiff boom mechanism to deploy the array and provide the deployed structure. Heritage flexible substrate arrays have used metallic slit-tube or coilable longeron booms. To be feasible, large, next-generation flexible substrate solar arrays require deployable booms that are more thermally stable than metallic slit-tubes (STEMs), and less expensive and lighter than coilable longeron booms (i.e. AstroMast).  To address this need, CTD has developed the Stable Tubular Extendible Lock-Out Composite Boom (STELOC Boom).  The STELOC Boom can provide stiffness equivalent to coilable longeron booms with a significantly reduced volume, mass and cost.  The Phase I program demonstrated feasibility of the STELOC boom as the deployment actuator and primary structural component of a 15 kW solar array wing.  The proposed Phase II program will advance the STELOC Boom to TRL 5 through the design, fabrication and testing of a flight-like Engineering Development Unit.","Advancement of high power and high specific power arrays and large robust arrays are both listed as critical requirements in NASA's technology roadmap. Advanced arrays are required to enable scaling up to 350 kW systems for interplanetary missions using solar electric power (SEP). While increased efficiencies of PV cells and power distribution will contribute to a portion of this power increase, very large arrays with very stiff support structures will be necessary to reach powers in the hundreds of kilowatts. In addition, large arrays which are structurally and dynamically durable under deployed conditions will require stiff, stable deployable structures to carry the deployed load and provide deployment forces. The stiff, lightweight STELOC booms provide the efficient structural performance necessary to achieve both very large arrays and robust deployed arrays. Therefore, successful achievement of the objectives defined for this program can provide a significant capability to NASA and NASA contractors to aid in the development of a SEP spacecraft tug or SEP for deep space missions. And in the near term, the 10cm twin-boom STELOC mast will enable robust 30 kW array systems for an SEP demonstrator or other high power missions.","Power systems compromise nearly 30% of a spacecraft's mass on average, thus improvements in specific power (W/kg) will enable either a reduction in spacecraft mass or an increase in capabilities. Near term Air Force satellite missions require more capable solar arrays with more total power on the same or smaller platforms. This includes enabling the GPS III Dual Launch variant which can leverage significant cost savings, and overcoming power challenges for Advanced EHF and classified missions. More powerful arrays must also have better specific power, decreased stowage volume and increased deployed stiffness in order to maintain other performance parameters of the spacecraft. Flexible blanket solar arrays can provide all these improvements by eliminating the heavy, bulky honeycomb panels used for conventional arrays.The STELOC boom will enable flexible arrays with all these qualities that could save $50 million per satellite and more than $1.5 Billion for a notional 30 satellite constellation of the GPS III Dual Launch Variant.   The next-generation solar arrays being designed by Lockheed Martin are also intended for use on commercial geostationary satellites. Larger arrays will enable more transponders per spacecraft. Solar electric propulsion variants with high power, very stiff arrays can arrive on orbit more quickly and provide longer lifetimes. All these benefits translate to higher total revenues per spacecraft.","Actuators & Motors; Composites; Deployment; Generation; Polymers; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Structures"

The use of analysis to drive design from an early stage is critical to their success, yet conflicting design requirements and demanding space constraints make traditional design/build/test methods challenging and expensive. The proposed SBIR program focuses on overcoming this through the development of a user-friendly multi-disciplinary design and analysis software toolkit that can rapidly perform parametric studies and design optimization of solar array concepts. The software package will provide a graphical user interface and analysis procedures to evaluate critical performance metrics, while eliminating the unnecessary pre-processing and computational overhead associated with current approaches. Analysis capabilities will include flexible multi-body dynamics, array deployment, modal analysis, and response simulation. Model creation will be simplified through the use of an extensible, hierarchical blockset solution and a library of blocks specific to deployable solar array analysis. The Phase II effort will focus on the development of advanced analysis and design capabilities and further validation of the tool through test-correlated modeling of a state-of-the-art solar array system.","The most immediate opportunity for the tools that will be developed under this SBIR is to assist NASA and its contractors in performing design trade studies of large mass-efficient deployable solar array systems. NASA has recently awarded two contractors—ATK and DSS—Phase I contracts to advance their concepts through hardware development and verification testing. One design will move forward to a multiyear Phase II flight demonstration program. The tools that will be developed under this SBIR will allow rapid design trade studies of these systems to be carried out by NASA and the manufacturers so that the designs can be optimized for critical performance requirements such as deployment reliability, stiffness, strength, and control. These studies will allow a more complete exploration of the design space and substantially reduce risk in expensive hardware manufacture and testing on these and future deployable systems.Additional areas of expressed interest for NASA include using the tools for control-structure interaction studies of structures with flexible components as well as simulating thermal-gradient effects on the structure. Control-structure interaction is important for a wide variety of NASA interests, one of which is attitude control. Using a flexible structure in the simulation of the control system dynamics will greatly enhance the accuracy of simulations and provide valuable insight into the actual performance of the control system.","The tools developed in this program will have broader applications than just the design and optimization of solar array structures. Development of the toolset will provide a modular, open-architecture tool that is easily extensible and customizable to integrate with other systems, software tools, and architectures across other industries. The fundamental approach of using Modelica as the core of a lightweight, graphics-based, intuitive, and efficient computational tool for design and analysis can be extended to a wide variety of other structural analysis and design optimization applications including lightweight booms, frames, expandable/inflatable structures, and associated mechanisms. Furthermore, the underlying architecture of the toolset allows it to be easily expanded and/or customized to enable additional analysis solutions, geometry modules, control systems, interactions, and componentry relevant to a vast array of other products. The software will eventually prove to benefit the design and analysis of any product that has several disparate components that must work in an integrated way. Examples include heavy equipment, robotics (terrestrial and space-based), industrial manufacturing, spacecraft, aircraft, automotive, and energy applications.","Actuators & Motors; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Characterization; Deployment; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Photon Sails (Solar; Laser); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

The Phase I Trusselator effort successfully demonstrated fabrication of continuous lengths of high-performance carbon fiber truss using a novel additive manufacturing process, establishing the technology at TRL-4.  The initial truss samples displayed bending stiffness efficiency superior to SOA deployable mast technologies.  The Phase II effort will address the key technical risks and mature the Trusselator technology to TRL-6.  We will do so by first refining the additive manufacturing process elements to improve process reliability and increase structural performance of the truss products.  We will then design and prototype a Trusselator capable of operation in the thermal-vacuum environment of space, incorporating design improvements to reduce weight and stowed volume.  Demonstration of fabrication of multi-meter lengths of truss in a vacuum environment will establish the technology at TRL-6.  We will also develop an automated process for integrating the fabricated truss with thin-film solar cell blankets, and demonstrate this process with a solar cell blanket simulator.  These Phase II efforts will prepare the Trusselator for flight demonstration in Phase III efforts to enable its adoption into the critical path for flight missions requiring high-power solar arrays.","The Trusselator is a key element of the NIAC ""SpiderFab"" architecture for on-orbit fabrication and integration of space systems.

These processing methodologies yield parts with inferior mechanical and physical properties as compared to wrought metal of the same composition.  Additionally, the production rates for even the fastest processes are relatively low, the part envelopes are limited to a few cubic feet, and often the process must be conducted in an atmospherically controlled chamber.  Aeroprobe's additive friction stir (AFS) process is a novel high-speed, large-volume wrought metal additive manufacturing technology that will enable affordable, full-density, near net-shape component manufacturing from a wide range of alloys, including aerospace aluminum alloys, nickel-based super alloys, and metal matrix composites.  The ability to rapidly fabricate large-scale, complex wrought and functionally graded aluminum components from three-dimensional models will be an enabling manufacturing advancement in exploration launch vehicle fabrication, for parts such as those on the Orion Crew Module. A scaled representation of the window frame structure proposed for the Orion Crew Module was fabricated from 6061 Al using Aeroprobe's additive friction stir process during the Phase I program.  To move AFS up the TRL ladder to full-scale demonstration and deployment, two major technical objectives must be met: (1) develop process/structure/property relationships for AFS deposition of aluminum aerospace alloys, such as 2219, which can be used for process control and material property optimization; and (2) demonstrate net-shape, large-scale aluminum launch vehicle and aerospace components (including a functionally graded structure) with mechanical properties comparable to traditional wrought metals.","Additive manufacturing via AFS has the potential to lower the cost and improve the performance of NASA exploration launch vehicles, such as the Orion Crew Module.  Additionally, AFS also offers a means of fabricating advanced aluminum airframe structures such as bulk heads and stiffened panels.  AFS offers the ability to locally control composition, which can be used to impart functional gradients in components, thus improving part performance.  High buy-to-fly ratios are often attributed to subtractive manufacturing of webbed and ribbed components to reduce the structural weight while maintaining required stiffness.  Manufacturing such components using additive manufacturing could drastically reduce the machining operations, material requirement, energy consumption, and part specific tooling. Using AFS to additively manufacture components on NASA exploration launch vehicles and airframes has the potential to reduce total system costs while maintaining wrought metal performance of traditionally fabricated parts and the design flexibility of additive manufacturing.","The primary applications for early adoption of AFS are high-value propositions for which AFS enables some performance that is not achievable by traditional processing methods.  One of the key benefits of AFS is that consolidation and deposition occur in the solid-state, thus highly engineered microstructures can be retained throughout processing.  For, example AFS is being applied to large-plate and component manufacturing using ultra-fine-grained (UFG) Mg.  Fabrication of UFG Mg components at a large-scale is currently not feasible and AFS is proving to make this possible.  Aeroprobe is currently working with commercial defense and aerospace primes on proprietary AFS demonstration projects with commercial applications. Other commercial applications of AFS under development include coating of shaft journals for use in extreme wear and corrosion applications.","Composites; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics; Processing Methods"

For operations on NASA's International Space Station (ISS), these procedural constraints may be of several different types. Notes, Cautions, Warnings, and Inhibits are all relevant types of procedural constraints. Phase I of the Constraint-Checking Editor for Procedure Tracking (ConCEPT) established the feasibility of constructing a constraint-checking system for procedures represented in the Procedure Representation Language (PRL). Using automated translation and Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) generation technologies developed on previous projects, ConCEPT assists users in identifying conflicts and inconsistencies in PRL procedures as they are developed. The user edits a PRL procedure in the Procedure Integrated Development Environment (PrIDE), using procedure steps that have been annotated with procedural constraints. As the procedure is being developed, ConCEPT automatically and continuously gathers appropriate procedural constraints and checks them against the procedure. ConCEPT then alerts the user to any violated constraints. Phase I defined relevant scenarios of use and established feasibility by demonstrating a proof-of-concept system to relevant NASA flight controllers.","This effort will support users of the Procedure Representation Language (PRL) and the PRL authoring tool PrIDE. The mission scenarios eval- uated in Phase I were provided by the Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) at Johnson Space Center (JSC). PRL and PrIDE are being actively used or evaluated for use for a wide variety of mission operations. MOD has used PrIDE to write over 100 International Space Station (ISS) procedures over the past several years and is currently evaluating PrIDE for use to author all procedures, ground and on-board, for Orion and future space vehicles. The JSC Rapid Prototyp- ing Laboratory (RPL) uses PrIDE to author experimental Orion procedures. The JSC Morpheus project currently uses PrIDE, as does the JSC Deep Space Habitat (DSH) project. The addition of ConCEPT to PrIDE will provide automated constraint checking for authoring procedures for a large and increasing range of mission applications.","Other near-term potential applications for ConCEPT include domains where complex, partially-manual operations are implemented in terms of, and decomposed into, simpler, local actions, checks, and sensor readings. Specific examples include industrial process control and operations, unmanned autonomous vehicle operations, and possibly logistics and transportation applications. ConCEPT will allow for the gradual adoption of automated procedures that are integrated with planning systems (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems). Military domains have complex operational constraints derived from both relevant doctrine and operation-specific ""rules of engagement,"" much like NASA's flight rules and procedural constraints. ConCEPT will allow combat commanders from the brigade to the company level to generate efficient plans that integrate human and robotic units.

During operations it is possible for unexpected events and anomalies to disrupt the mission schedule, and in the case of critical faults, even threaten the health and safety of the spacecraft.The planner's relatively slow response time to unexpected events (changes in resource levels, failed activity indications, flight software fault indications) during dynamic and critical operations means that it does not suffice as a sole solution to the vehicle autonomy when the primary purpose is to keep it safe and ensure mission success.  Mission success can also be enhanced through the use of a sequence engine that provides reactive capabilities. Traditional sequence engines execute commands without regard to the overall safety of the vehicle.  Through the use of a reactive sequence engine that utilizes State Machine technology vehicle further enhances safety and the probability of mission success. The Integrated Scheduler-Planner And Reactive Executive (I-SPAREX) architecture utilizes a layered software architecture (an approach proven successful on previously flown autonomous demonstration missions such as EO-1) and incorporates an existing goal-based, planning solution as well as an advanced, real-time, decision-making sequence engine. Specifically, we plan to study and demonstrate the feasibility of integrating NASA JPL's CASPER (Continuous Activity Scheduling Planning Execution and Re-planning) as the Continuous Planning Layer (CPL), and VML 3.0 (Virtual Machine Language) as the Reactive Sequencing Layer (RSL) providing programmable heuristic control.

While the innovations envisioned by this program are broadly applicable, they serve an immediate and urgent need for missions to prospect for volatiles at the lunar poles (i.e., the NASA Lunar Resource Prospector Mission, currently in Phase A). These missions must be rapid and precise, covering multiple kilometers in approximately 10-12 Earth days to complete mission objectives in one lunar light cycle. This calls for the ability to drive intentionally and efficiently to precise drilling destinations. Polar operations encounter low angle lighting; this creates shadows which confront robot operations with challenges in power production, thermal control, and operator situational awareness. This demands robust path planning for efficient mission planning and execution.The proposed work develops a computer-aided mission planning tool that balances the competing demands of efficient routes, scientific information gain, and rover constraints (e.g., kinematics, communication, power, thermal, and terrainability) to generate and analyze optimized routes between sequences of locations. Planner-computed statistics about the set of viable paths enable mission planners, scientists, and operators to efficiently select routes considering a range of priorities including risk, duration, and science return. This planner will serve an invaluable role in preplanning missions and as a tool for rapidly understanding the impact of changes in mission profile during the mission execution.","The proposed innovations in planning can drive dramatic improvements in mission planning and operator awareness efficiency to enable highest-science-value robotic surface missions and enable future human exploration. These technologies open up new opportunities for cost-effective missions to Mars, the Moon, asteroids, and beyond.The immediate markets within NASA are for exploration and science missions to surface destinations on the Moon and Mars. Phase II development is in the context of a mission to the lunar pole (i.e., NASA's Lunar Resource Prospector mission, currently in Phase A).

With additional modifications to the vehicle model, it could be used to plan trajectories for vehicles that explore the surface of Near Earth Asteroids. The technology could also be applied to plan traverse routes for crewed transport vehicles.

Planning technologies could benefit unexploded ordinance survey, Special Operation Forces, mining, transit planning, search and rescue operations, and agriculture.Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) is a quarter of a billion dollar a year industry encompassing surveying and disposal. In the US there are 16,000 UXOs sites with an EPA estimated cost of cleanup at least $14 billion. The worldwide need notably includes UXOs from WWI & WWII in France, Belgium, and Germany; approximately 80 million unexploded ordinances in Laos; and approximately 1 million in Lebanon. While the market is vast, manual techniques are labor intensive and costly. The technology proposed here can readily be integrated into planning for automated UXO survey to dramatically improve efficiency and reduce downtime.Unmanned vehicles play a rapidly expanding role in warfare.

The drill uses a novel method of core or powder acquisition, and is suitable for both use by both robotic platforms and astronauts. The core acquisition bit can be used for either a rock core, icy-soil or loose regolith acquisition. The continued development of robust sample acquisition and handling tools is of critical importance to future robotic and human missions to Mars, the Moon, Asteroids, and other planetary bodies. For these missions, consolidated or unconsolidated core samples (as opposed to, say, scooped regolith or collected drill cuttings) are of particular interest. We will conduct testing in the laboratory and in the field to demonstrate the drill's effectiveness both in relevant environments, in relevant operational scenarios.","Future robotic astrobiology and geology missions such as Mars Sample Return, Venus In Situ Explorer, Comet Sample Return, and South Pole Aitken Basin Sample Return missions will benefit greatly from the ability to produce and capture rock and regolith cores, using a compact, low mass, low power device, and hermetically seal the samples in dedicated containers. A system utilizing a surface drill and a suite of bits for different applications could be deployed during lunar and asteroid sortie missions by astronauts (i.e., hand held coring drill) since it is more manageable to bring small cores back as opposed to large rocks.","Scientists often use small drills to acquire core samples for the study of everything from geological classification to ocean drilling and surveying. Traditionally, petroleum engineers will use large cores to extract information about boundaries between sandstone, limestone, and shale. This process is time consuming so smaller cores are sometimes taken. This method of sampling is called sidewall coring and provides more information to the petroleum engineer than simply logged data. Scientists studying earthquake mechanics could also benefit in a similar fashion. Automation of this process would save time and money; enabling the science goals of the research with reduced schedule and budget risk/impact. The arm-deployed coring tool also has applications in the study of terrestrial biology, such as coring into rocks in the Arctic and Antarctic, among other desirable locations.",Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Man-Machine Interaction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Tools/EVA Tools

Novel linear drive eddy current methods are proposed for NDE of carbon-based TPS materials, such as felts, rigid materials, and three dimensional woven fiber composites. Using a combination of physics-based models of layered media, including an eddy current micromechanical model extension for composites, multivariate inverse methods, high resolution imaging, and innovative sensor array constructs, the developed methods will independently measure the material characteristics of interest.  In Phase I, the focus was on adapting methods developed for carbon-based composite structures and laminates and demonstrating feasibility of these methods for felts, rigid materials, and three-dimensional woven composites.   In Phase II, the focus is on maturing this method, including the instrumentation hardware, models, and sensor designs, to provide scanning assessment and in-situ monitoring capabilities for TPS material condition assessment.  JENTEK's MWM-Arrays have a linear drive that permits both scanned type imaging and permanent installation for monitoring of anisotropic properties, temperature, and stresses at multiple depths.  The projected depth of the magnetic field into the test material can be adjusted through the sensor dimensions and excitation frequencies; this enables inspection of materials more than 1.0-in. thick and supports measuring far-side surface recession in ablator materials.  JENTEK delivered the MWM-Array solution used by NASA KSC on the Space Shuttle Leading Edge to detect damage of the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) thermal protection tiles; thus JENTEK is well-positioned to deliver a practical TPS NDE solution.","If the program is successful, it will demonstrate the capability of the MWM-Array technology to measure relevant material properties and structural damage in the advanced materials in spacecraft thermal protection systems.  This technology will be suitable for flexible and rigid carbon-based materials.  This type of analysis tool for detection of damage may be useful for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV's), exhaust nozzles, and other critical composite structures.  NASA customers that may benefit from these analysis tools include the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) spacecraft manufacturers and other interplanetary programs such as science exploration mission vehicles and human crew vehicles.","There are numerous applications in which NDE measurement and analysis tools are needed to verify design requirements or structural integrity during usage of advanced carbon-based composites, such as three-dimensional woven materials.  These include applications for commercial aircraft, wind turbines, land vehicles and composite repairs for pipelines and structures.

Therefore, there is a need to be able to predict the properties and performance of a woven material.  Validation of predictive modeling tools would allow for the use of these tools to design and optimize the 3D weaves, significantly reducing the cost of fabrication and testing of a variety of configurations.  While there are proven tools for the prediction of laminate composite properties, textile composites are relatively new materials and much less effort has been focused on modeling this class of materials.Therefore, MR&D is proposing to use the lessons learned from the Phase I effort, to improve the strength prediction capabilities, evaluate the effects of porosity and molding of curved panels, and deliver a beta version of a 3D weave design optimization tool. A combined analytical and experimental program has been proposed.  The analytical effort involves modifying the current version of the 3D weave modeling tool, based on the lessons learned in the Phase I program, to include things such as unique bundle strengths for the different yarn types and improved failure criteria to improve the strength prediction capabilities.  It also includes increasing the current capabilities to allow for estimating properties of 3D woven composites with varying levels of porosity or that have been molded into curved panels.  The experimental effort involves fabrication and testing of various 3D woven reinforced composites (flat, curved, partially densified).  The properties obtained from this experimental effort will enable improved calibration of the modeling tools.  Finally, the final portion of the Phase II effort will focus on the preparation of a beta version of the 3D weave design optimization tool for delivery to NASA for use in heat shield design as well as other applications requiring the use of 3D woven preforms.","The successful completion of the Phase II program would directly benefit the Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) project, which is using 3D woven preforms in the current designs.  The ability of a predictive tool to generate material properties and strengths for a variety of 3D weaves would allow for the evaluation of multiple design configurations and fiber types to be evaluated in a much more efficient and cost effective manner than having to fabricate and test panels to generate data to be used for downselection of the best candidate designs.  In addition, a validated design tool of this kind would also be very useful to the mission design community to optimize materials for specific missions.","In addition to the potential NASA applications, there is also potential for applications within the Department of Defense (DoD).  The use of 3D woven preforms in ballistic armor applications creates a need for design and predictive modeling capabilities of these materials as well.Finally, there would also be potential for applications from the weavers themselves.

The intent is to use the sensors for real time temperature/heat flux measurements to validate new materials and systems, as well as for flight structures where space and accessibility are limited.  Methods for incorporating thermocouples, heat flux and recession sensors using Direct Write technology will be developed to provide accurate sensing capabilities.  Notably, recession tolerant heat flux sensors will be designed and fabricated to demonstrate feasibility of this new heat flux sensor technology and subsequent instrumentation capability for TPS.","NASA has communicated a need for advanced TPS sensing to improve laboratory performance evaluation of new TPS materials as well as in-situ monitoring for manned and unmanned missions.  Testing and evaluation of new TPS materials represents a significant activity in the planning of all missions.  Typically, the TPS requirements are fairly well identified with respect to heat flux profile, duration, atmosphere, etc. based upon the specific mission.  However, ruggedized sensors for monitoring heat flux in-situ are not yet available for TPS validation or fielding.  The Orion capsule, being developed by NASA under the MPCV (Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle) program, calls for a number of TPS sensors where real time heat flux data would be invaluable.  Challenging opportunities exist at JPL in developing TPS systems for unmanned sample return missions from both a Near Earth Object (NEO) and Mars.  The competing requirements for low mission weight and increased TPS performance due to increased thermal loads from higher re-entry speeds results in a need for improved sensors for TPS development.","Opportunities for sensor integration onto manned and unmanned vehicles not only exist within NASA, but are becoming more prevalent in the commercial sector including space travel as well as other areas.

The converter will use gas bearings to provide reliable, maintenance-free, long-life operation.  It will also consist of discrete components that can be packaged to fit optimally with other subsystems, and its continuous gas flow can communicate directly with remote heat sources and heat rejection surfaces without ancillary heat transfer components and intermediate flow loops.  Creare is well suited to succeed because we have a long history of developing advanced turbomachines, heat exchangers, and Brayton systems for challenging spaceflight applications.  We completed detailed analyses, trade studies, fabrication trials, and preliminary designs for the components and converter assembly during Phase I, and we now plan to fabricate and test a breadboard converter during Phase II.",There are many potential NASA applications for our converter technology.  The converter can be sized for coupling with radioisotope heat sources to support low-power devices such as space exploration probes and unmanned surface rovers.  Our converter can also be sized for significantly greater power levels and coupled with fission reactors to support larger spacecraft as well as manned exploration of the lunar and Martian surfaces.  Other applications include nuclear electric propulsion and space station power systems.  Alternative heat sources include concentrated solar radiation.,"Terrestrial versions of our converter can be used to produce electric power for military and civilian applications.  These converters would be coupled with non-nuclear heat sources such as fossil fuel combustion, biofuel combustion, refuse burning, and concentrated solar energy.  The resulting systems can be applied wherever electric generators are currently used.  They will be particularly attractive for mobile applications because they have high specific power.  Their hermetic, closed-loop configuration will also make them desirable in environments that have contaminants such as sand, dirt, and dust, and in environments that are exposed to corrosive substances such as sea water.",Conversion

A non-nuclear system ground test in thermal-vacuum is planned by NASA GRC to validate technologies required to transfer reactor heat, convert the heat into electricity, reject waste heat, process the electrical output, and demonstrate overall system performance. This SBIR project by ACT will develop a modular single-facesheet Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP) radiator, operating near 450K, to support the Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) for surface power. Based on the Phase I results and the experience gained during previous NASA SBIR VCHP radiator programs, ACT and VST will develop in Phase II a low cost high specific power modular radiator for the TDU. New features of this radiator include direct bonding to the titanium condenser and the fact that it is modular and therefore, the CTE mismatch on the manifold direction is eliminated. The modular radiator will consist of 12 clusters of 9 modules each. ACT will design the modular radiator, validate the radiator module, fabricate the heat pipes and test the clusters in ambient conditions before sending them to GRC. VST will further develop the GFRC direct bonding and attach the GFRC fins to all the heat pipes.","The low cost VCHP radiator developed under this Phase I and Phase II program would provide the waste heat rejection system necessary for the non-nuclear TDU to be tested at NASA GRC.  Additional, longer term NASA candidate missions that the low cost VCHP radiator would support are initial power sources for human outposts on the Moon or Mars and nuclear electric propulsion systems (NEP) for Mars cargo transport.  A benefit for Lunar and Martian radiators is that the VCHP can passively accommodate the large swings in environmental conditions between lunar (or Martian) day and night, including long periods at very low temperatures.  In addition, the VCHP can passively accommodate large changes in thermal load, and avoid damage during periods of low thermal load.  The non-condensable gas in the VCHP will also help with start-up during sudden increases in thermal load.","There is a commercial application for high temperature VCHP heat exchangers in fuel cell reformers. In a fuel cell reformer, steam, air and diesel fuel react in a High Temperature Shift (HTS) and a Low Temperature Shift (LTS) reactor to produce as much hydrogen as possible. Feed streams to and from the reactors must be maintained under tight temperature control, typically within 30�C despite a turndown ratio of 5:1 in reactant flow rate.  ACT believes that VCHP heat exchangers can replace the current heat exchanger and control system with a passive system.  The VCHP heat pipes passively adjust the heat removed, to maintain the output stream at a constant temperature. The direct bonding of the single facesheet GFRC to the titanium condenser would allow low cost and mass radiators for atmospheric high altitude applications like waste heat rejection from balloon payloads or from UAV electronics.",Active Systems; Generation; Heat Exchange; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Passive Systems; Prototyping

While high efficiency, space-qualified solar cells are in themselves costly, integrating them into a high performance Photovoltaic Assembly (PVA) using conventional glassing, interconnecting, stringing, tiling and laydown techniques can double their cost in $/Watt. The cost of solar power could be significantly reduced if the design of the Photovoltaic Assembly could be modified, modularized and standardized to be compatible with automated electronic assembly and terrestrial solar panel manufacturing methods. Additional benefits of such an approach include higher quality and consistency, improved qualification traceability, and robustness on thin flexible as well as rigid arrays. During the Phase I effort Vanguard successfully demonstrated automated pick-and-place, electrical interconnection, and adhesive dispensing adapted to our lightweight flexible Thin Integrated Solar (THINS) PVA. THINS uses multi-cell covers and advanced interconnection and encapsulation technology, which enables automated integration of traditional and advanced space qualified solar cells. Engineering economic analysis showed the potential for >30% PVA $/Watt cost reduction, while the encapsulation approach associated with THINS showed enhanced durability in space environments, even at high voltages and extreme thermal cycle environments. During the Phase II Program we will further enhance our automated sub-module manufacturing, and scale the approach to the module level. Automated assembly scale up will be performed while integrating into an existing deployable space structure platform, enhancing the TRL of a high performance high power application of automated cell integration scalable from tens to hundreds of kilowatts, and providing a credible commercialization path, all while reducing solar array costs by more than $150/W.","Low cost, lightweight, high power solar arrays with compact packaging and high voltage capability is an enabling technology for meeting the key NASA objective of implementing solar electric propulsion, which enables enhanced planetary, human exploration, and orbit transfer missions.

The approach additionally prepares for the low cost integration of IMM solar cells as they become qualified. These improvements, together with demonstrated high operating voltage capability exceeding 300V, allow an affordable high power system up to hundreds of kW to be packaged into a single launch. The THINS Array also has the advantages of improved high voltage stability and electromagnetic cleanliness because of surface continuity available from encapsulation, with similar technology developed at Vanguard already transitioned through a NASA Phase III SBIR to the Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission.","The trend towards Solar Electric Propulsion to supplant chemical propulsion for orbit-raising and station-keeping, and the advent of ""all-electric"" spacecraft which use SEP for orbital transfer and stationkeeping, have driven the need for both higher power and higher voltage in commercial and DoD spacecraft. Commercial spacecraft have trended toward higher power to also provide more capability (e.g. more bandwidth or coverage) which translates directly to increased revenue for the spacecraft operator. Additional functionality for military spacecraft, including enhanced communication, reconnaissance, and on-orbit computational capabilities, as well as the maneuverability afforded by SEP also drive to higher power requirements.

Component testing of the sensors and actuators further demonstrated that the design will meet the performance requirements. These tests and analyses advanced the technology to TRL-4.Phase II continues the development by ground testing an end-to-end prototype on a soft suspension testbed to demonstrate overall performance in a simulated low-g operational environment. Both acquisition search and beacon track will be demonstrated. Iterations of development and environment testing are performed to produce several space qualified 2-axis strut assemblies for delivery to NASA. Three strut assemblies rigidly mounted to any space terminal will provide 6-DOF isolation and high-bandwidth stabilization.

NASA estimates that the current Mars to Earth transfer rate of 6 Mbps might be increased to 600Mbps using a Laser Communication (LC) system.  Beam jitter caused by spacecraft-based motion must be reduced to sub-microradian levels to enable beaconless optical beam pointing.  ATA will create a Compact, Lightweight Isolation Platform (CLIP) that will host the LC collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the LC terminal.  To enable that stabilization, ATA will develop an ultra-low angular noise Capacitive Angular Position Sensor (CAPS).  The proposed sensor will have low power and high reliability, which ATA will demonstrate by producing TRL 4 prototypes in Phase I and TRL 5 CLIP engineering development unit (EDU) in Phase II.The integrated CLIP overall design is a major innovation.  Most significantly, the platform payload capacity must increase from the typical few hundred grams to as much as 50 kilograms, roughly two orders of magnitude, but without major growth in the mass of the platform itself.  While the payload for most stable platforms is only a small fraction of the platform overall mass, the CLIP payload must be from more than half (3 kg) to as much as 94 percent of the total platform mass (3-50 kg payload + 3 kg platform).  Combined with the large payload range, the needed disturbance rejection from 150-microradian to less than 0.5-microradian across the broad frequency range of 0.1 to 500 Hz requires innovation in the platform suspension, high-performance actuators, servo controls, and structure.  Other programs have demonstrated these requirements individually, but the innovation CLIP provides is to combine structure, suspension, actuators, and sensors to give the required performance within the stringent 3-kg weight and 15-W power constraints.","Beginning with a NASA funded Phase I SBIR, ATA developed the stable platform concept that serves as the basis for the laser communication terminal that NASA will be flying on the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstrator (LLCD).  In September 2013, NASA GSFC awarded a contract to ATA for two (2) innovative inertially stable platforms for the Laser Communications Relay Demonstrator (LCRD) in support of the NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Architecture Roadmap.  Our proposed Compact Lightweight Stable Platform (CLIP) and Capacitive Angular Position Sensor (CAPS) could host the laser collimator for NASA's integrated Radio and Optical Communications (iROC) program, which seeks to implement beaconless laser communication from Mars by 2025.  ATA's inertially stabilized platform technology also has applicability for the NASA Next Generation Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS).","ATA expects laser communications to continue to expand in DoD space programs and we will work directly with government agencies on technology development.  We have established relationships with major aerospace prime contractors including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and will be supplying stabilized platforms and inertial reference units to these customers.  ATA is producing Inertially Stable Platform Assemblies (ISPAs) for a Government organization.  Naval Air Weapons Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) at China Lake, California is procuring a Tactical Inertial Reference Unit (TIRU) for their Helicopter Beam Director (HBD) program and a customer at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has shown interest in procuring a TIRU-like device through a follow-on contract with High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO).  Boeing has partnered with ATA on the Magnetohydrodynamic Inertial Reference Unit (MIRU-D) Phase II SBIR and ATA is working a follow-on effort to develop this device specifically to support the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) experiments being conducted on the Boeing Phantom Eye unmanned aircraft system (UAS).  ATA anticipates selling additional vibration isolation devices for Line-of-Sight Stabilization (LOSS) to the NRO, SMC, and TESAT.","Inertial (see also Sensors); Lasers (Communication); Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Telescope Arrays"

These components are utilized to protect high power amplifiers (HPA) during the transmit cycle from destabilizing, and potentially harmful, power reflections from the antenna element. During receive cycle these components are utilized to direct lower power received signals with minimal attenuation to the low noise amplifiers (LNA). As such, performance specifications of these ferrite control components, such as bandwidth, insertion loss, isolation, power handling, temperature stability, radiation hardness, and linearity impose strict limitations on the overall system performance. Over the course of the proposed Ph1 SBIR program self-biased ferrite control components based on highly textured hexagonal ferrite compacts which have the potential to eliminate biasing magnets and significantly reduce the size, cost, and weight of the TRM while concurrently increasing power handling capability, and improving temperature stability and radiation hardness will be investigated. Specifically, a research and development path to realizing high performance self-biased ferrite materials and device designs for operation in space based environments at Ka-band (>27 GHz, 31.5 - 34 GHz targeted) is outlined.","Metamagnetics anticipates the use of self-biased radiation hardened Ka-band circulators where size, weight, power, and cost of ferrite components are the limiting factors. Metamagnetics components have the capability to influence the total price tag of the long range communication systems, particularly when thousands of T/R modules (TRM) are employed, as is often the case in phased array architectures such as those utilized in next generation observation missions including DESDynI (Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice), SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography), and HyspIRI (Hyperspectral Infrared Imager). Metamagnetics devices are designed to be radiation hardened and temperature stable without costly shielding making them ideal for low earth orbit (LEO) and long range space based communications platforms which require high data rates.","A prominent alternative application of ferrite circulators is in the front end of ground based Transmit/Receive Modules (TRMs) utilized in Active Electronically Steered Arrays (AESAs). Specifically, Metamagnetics circulators have higher power handling thresholds than commercially available semiconductor technologies making them ideal for corporate feed array structures. A single AESA system can utilize anywhere from 300 to over 35,000 TRMs, operating at frequencies from UHF to above Ka-band, each of which is equipped with at least one ferrite circulator. The role of the circulator is to forward the high-powered transmitted signal to the antenna while protecting the amplifier (HPA) from harmful reflections during the transmit cycle and pass the received signals with as little attenuation as possible to the low noise amplifier (LNA) in the receive cycle. Metamagnetics has already identified a series of prime industrial partners who are interested in integrating this technology as the TRL level is increased.","Ceramics; Characterization; Electromagnetic; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Superconductance/Magnetics; Transmitters/Receivers"

This will be achieved by employing two major innovations. Firstly, we are employing state-of-the-art wide bandgap GaN (Gallium Nitride) devices. At millimeter-wave frequencies, these GaN devices have demonstrated power densities of 5 to 8 times higher than GaAs or InP devices. Further, we are proposing to operate these devices in a quasi-switching mode, which has demonstrated, in Phase I simulations, drain efficiencies approaching 70%. The resulting MMIC, operating over the 106 to 114 GHz band, will produce an output power of one watt and an efficiency of greater than 33%. Secondly, we are proposing to utilize a new low loss, H-tee combining approach to combine 4 of these high-efficiency chips to achieve 4 watts. The net result is a unique combination of high performance devices and innovative power combining. We anticipate that this work will result in an order of magnitude increase in the state-of-the-art of SSPA output power and efficiency at F-band. We anticipate that this work will be very important for NASA's Earth Science missions and for DoD W-band radar and communications applications.","Future NASA Earth Science missions require submillimeter-wave remote sensing instruments to monitor air quality, climate variability and change, ozone layer stability, weather, and the global hydrological cycle. A key enabler for this technology is the F-band (106-114 GHz) solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) described in this proposal. This amplifier is need for the LO multiplier chain of the Scanning Microwave Limb Sounder and for the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) airborne observatory. and other NASA missions. Currently available W/F-band SSPAs simply do not have enough power at this frequency, and further, their efficiency is poor. The efficiency SOA for amplifiers in the adjacent W-band is in the range of 15%, and with practical packaged amplifiers including regulators, the efficiency is often in the single digits. Our approach addresses this need by utilizing high-efficiency wide-bandgap (GaN) device technology and new high-efficiency power combining techniques to reach efficiency levels of 30%. Other NASA applications include LO multiplier chains for THz sensors studying star formation and neutral oxygen (ROSES 2013 APRA proposal). Further, W/F-band FMCW sensors are required for planetary exploration missions to assist in planetary landings. NASA applications require output power levels ranging from less than a watt to perhaps tens of watts at these W/F-band frequencies.","Applications for this high-efficiency amplifier technology abound at DoD, but at slightly lower frequencies, primarily the atmospheric window at 94 GHz. These include airborne applications such as helicopter landing and obstacle detection/avoidance radars, very high altitude long duration reconnaissance UAV applications, W-band missile seekers (e.g. AARGM missile) and DoD's W/V-band communications (e.g. Air Forces' WSCE and DARPA's Mobile Hotspots programs). Space-based applications include broadband RF cross-links in satellite constellations, and W-band downlinks for Mobile Hotspots.  Specific examples include the Joint Arial Layered Network (JALN), the ICD effort from STRATCOM and AISR. Further, this GaN MMIC technology can be readily applied to other military missions at adjacent frequencies, E and V band. In all these airborne and satellite applications, efficiency is particularly important due to limited availability of prime power. Further, using power combining techniques, this high-efficiency MMIC technology can be extended to applications requiring higher power levels. With the proposed 1-watt MMIC chip as a building block, we can readily extend this technology to applications requiring tens of watts.",Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Power Combiners/Splitters; Transmitters/Receivers

In order to image from long distance, it is important that imagers have high sensitivity, high resolution, and very low dark currents. This leads to technical goals of having low noise, low dark current in small size pixels in large arrays. While saturated performance levels of traditional systems based on bulk semiconductors have not quite met the requirement of applications, it is expected that novel quantum systems will bring new development stage for infrared imagers. In recent years, Type-II InAs/GaSb superlattice (T2SL) has experienced significant development, from theoretical modeling, material growth to device processing and packaging. Performance of LWIR detector based on T2SL has become comparable, even better than that of HgCdTe. However, LWIR T2SL devices have been shown to be limited by surface leakage, especially at lower operating temperature. This proposed effort will investigate gating of Type-II photodiodes as a means to suppress this bottle neck of T2SL technology. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an effective method to completely suppress the surface leakage current in LWIR type-II superlattice photodiodes that is compatible with the development of high performance gated FPAs in Phase II.",LWIR is also of special interest to NASA for planetary observation missions. The LWIR wavelength region is an ideal wavelength to look back at the earth from space and accurately map minute variations in the surface and/or atmospheric temperatures. It is even possible to use simultaneous measurements from two different LWIR wavelengths (a two-color camera) to help isolate the surface temperature from that of the atmosphere. This same LWIR technology can also be readily applied for observation of other planets.,"IR imaging sensors also find their use in commercial applications such as deep-space astronomy, commercial satellite imaging, geophysics, geology, remote environmental (pollution) IR sensing, law enforcement, search and rescue, firefighting and emergency response. For its part, the Optoelectronics Industry Development Association estimates that the current infrared imaging market for military and law enforcement applications is about US$3 billion. The development of high performance LWIR imagers with higher operating temperature has the potential to significantly reduce the operational cost of these sensors and thus potentially open up new lower cost commercial applications.",Detectors (see also Sensors); Infrared; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Radiometric; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation)

A silicon carbide (SiC) integrated circuit technology that is compatible with production in commercial silicon fabs will be used to fabricate the sensors. SiC is an ideal choice because of 1) its material properties that lead to high UV quantum efficiency while being inherently insensitive to visible and near IR light, negligible dark current up to high temperatures, and excellent radiation tolerance and 2) technological maturity demonstrated by commercially available 4-inch wafers and previous demonstrations of SiC integrated circuits by NASA, United Silicon Carbide Inc. and others. Monolithic integration improves sensor reliability and performance over hybrid approaches and the manufacturability of the n-channel JFET fabrication process provides a clear path to commercializing the technology.In addition to producing monolithic solar-blind UV sensors, the underlying SiC integrated circuit technology being developed has numerous harsh environment analog sensing and electronics applications.","UV solar-blind imaging is required for scientific study of the sun and its influence on the earth. In this application, the high performance of existing silicon CMOS and CCD sensors in the visible and near infrared is a detriment as it forces the use of long wavelength blocking filters that also attenuate in the UV. The wide bandgap of SiC sensors make them inherently insensitive to wavelengths longer than the UV.UV imaging and spectroscopy is also useful for in-situ detection of trace amounts of organic and other materials on planetary missions. (R. Bharita et al, Deep UV Native Fluorescene and Resonance Raman Imaging Spectroscopy for In-situ Organic Detection.)NASA related applications for the SiC IC technology include high temperature electronics for aircraft engine control and electronics for the exploration of Venus.","The UV solar-blind sensors developed in this program would be directly applicable to important defense applications such as missile warning systems. Electromagnetic storm prediction using solar-blind UV sensors has considerable commercial value due to the modern reliance on electrical distribution.

The latter will provide the ability to safely operate the cryocooler system off of virtually any spacecraft power bus from all perspectives, meaning that the cryocooler system will be protected from transient effects from a ""dirty bus,"" and the cryocooler will not impart back onto the power bus large amplitude current ripple that would otherwise affect the performance of other devices on the bus.","Iris anticipates LCCE-2 will supplant the electronics presently used by the prime contractors for their ""core"" cryocoolers, such as the NGAS HEC, the Ball SB-235, and the Raytheon RS1 and RSP2.

Such missions will require cryocoolers providing cooling capacities in excess of 0.3 W at 35 K with heat rejection capability to temperature sinks as low as 150 K at input powers up to 20 W. Presently there are no cooling systems operating at this heat rejection temperature.","NASA applications include missions to remote locations and orbits where there is a low level of solar input.

Only a third the power draw is predicted for the 35-K cold end case. Serendipitously, this agrees well with the drop in power generation due to dim solar light on remote missions.

We propose to develop a highly efficient, lightweight Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigeration (AMRR) system that can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at temperatures of about 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K.  The AMRR system uses three novel design features to achieve a large cooling capacity and very high thermal efficiency: a vibration-free, reversible cryogenic circulator; innovative micromachined regenerators; and lightweight superconducting magnets.  The superconducting magnet uses low-current superconducting wires and a unique winding arrangement to enable an AMRR system to achieve high thermal efficiency. In Phase I, we selected an optimum superconducting material for the magnet and developed its electrical and structural support subsystems.  Based on the performance characteristics of the magnet, we optimized the magnetic field and showed by analysis that the AMRR system driven by such a magnetic field will be able to achieve high efficiency.  In Phase II, we will build and characterize a superconducting magnet, assemble a brassboard AMRR system with a circulator and an active magnetic regenerator, and demonstrate the system performance under prototypical conditions.  In Phase III, we will assemble a fully integrated Engineering Model AMRR system and demonstrate its performance.","The proposed AMRR system will enable NASA to carry out future space astronomy missions that use cryogenic infrared, gamma ray, and X ray detectors.  These detectors need to operate at temperatures in the range of 4 K to below 1 K to reduce the thermal emission of the detectors themselves and to achieve high sensitivity and resolution.  The vibration-free, lightweight AMRR can provide efficient cooling for these missions at the required temperature ranges.  The fabrication technologies developed for the lightweight superconducting magnets can also be applied to the fabrication of advanced magnets for multistage active demagnetization refrigerators (ADRs), particle accelerators, and portable MRIs.","Military applications for the proposed magnetic cooler include cooling systems on space-based surveillance, missile detection, and missile tracking systems.

Frozen H2O is the dominant ice in the outer solar system, recently found on the Moon. Extensive deposits of near-surface ice discovered on Mars. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic records preserve history of water/rock interactions depending on chemistry and ambient conditions. Ratios of these isotopes are the main tool in paleoclimatology studies on Earth. A proposed non-contact optical instrument similar to ChemCam will be capable of measuring not only complete elemental compositions but also the key isotopic abundances in surface materials. We demonstrated the resolution and sensitivity required to determine these isotopes in synthetic samples and natural minerals relevant to Mars. We are utilizing and developing our recently published technology: Laser Ablation Molecular Isotopic Spectrometry (LAMIS). Our concept is simple and scientifically proven. We will advance to TRL4 with the further aim of integrating our LAMIS detector with a ChemCam-like instrument. The proposed effort leverages and advances the technology developed for ChemCam. The added strength of measuring isotopes will greatly expand the capabilities of the ChemCam, which is already a highly successful instrument onboard ""Curiosity"". We will develop a breadboard prototype of the instrument that can be later amended to measure other key isotopes (C, N, B, Cl, Mg, Ca, Sr). We plan further infusion in NASA missions and commercialization. The immediate focus is on Mars but our concept is also highly germane to future landing missions to the Moon, other planets and their moons, asteroids, and to a broad range of applications in ecology, agronomy, nuclear industry, radio-chemotherapy, forensics, security and other fields. Our instrument can be used for stand-alone landing missions or for in situ sample characterization prior to sample return.","Our non-contact optical instrument will rapidly measure elemental compositions (~30 elements simultaneously) and key isotopic abundances in planetary surface materials. The isotope ratios of D/H and O-18/O-16 will provide important constraints on the history of processes on Mars, particularly related to past water activities. We first aim at oxygen and hydrogen in this proposal but we have also shown that our technology can be extended to many other chemical elements. This technology is directly relevant to several NASA objectives for Mars: (i) characterization of geological features contributing to deciphering geological history; (ii) determination of surface chemical composition including elements known to be building blocks for life; (iii) characterization of organic compounds and potential biomarkers in representative bedrock and regolith; (iv) identification of potential chemical and isotopic biosignatures in rocks and regolith; (v) characterization of the local environment, the state and cycling of water and CO2, and the near-surface distribution of hydrogen. NRC's decadal survey recommended a plan leading to Mars Sample Return. As part of this program, there is a need to conduct in situ analysis to select the best and most varied set of samples to return to Earth. Our proposal is particularly focused on Mars but highly relevant to applications on the Moon, other planets, their moons and asteroids. Similar studies are very important to NASA's Earth Science missions.","Our concept of an integrated instrument capable of both elemental and isotopic measurements has significant commercial applications. LAMIS is poised to speed up, to simplify and to make isotopic analysis more affordable than at present. Multiple applications are anticipated in the nuclear power industry, medical diagnostics and therapies, forensics, homeland security, carbon sequestration, natural gas and oil exploration, ecological and agronomical studies. Heavy water nuclear reactors require deuterium enrichment 99.85%. Water-18O is used as a precursor in the radiopharmaceutical industry. Deuterated drugs and stable isotopic markers are increasingly used in the fields of medicine, pharmacology, nutrition and physiology. Studies of vegetation and different ecosystems include isotopic measurements of soils, flora, fauna, air, groundwater and the results of human activities. Medical multinuclear MRI scanners require compounds enriched in NMR-active isotopes. To assess quality, specifications or aging of these materials, their isotopic homogeneity or distribution, and a degree of isotopic enrichment can be rapidly tested by LAMIS in open air. In animals and humans, stable isotopes are used to study host-parasite relationship. Measurement of the D/H and oxygen isotopic ratios is essential in paleoclimatology, material sciences, biological and medical research.

Key subsystems such as the sampling probe, flipper mechanism and hermetic sealing canister could be re-purposed for sampling terrestrial sites. These systems could potentially be deployed from a helicopter with a tether, acquire a sample, hermetically seal it on the ground, and be reeled in with the sample inside the sealed canister. This would reduce the risk of sending personnel into contaminated environments.In addition, commercial companies such as Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries, who are interested in asteroid mining for economic gains, would use this technology. It would be extremely useful to conduct reconnaissance of target bodies in order to determine their composition (e.g. fraction of water-ice, Platinum Group Metals, Rare Earth Elements etc) and in turn evaluate economic potential for mining the bodies.",Deployment; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)

The Phase II work plan will implement the following hardware improvements:� Mount the light collection optics on a commercial solar tracker that has a built-in GPS to simplify setup at different locations.� Replace the current external cavity laser used for the oxygen spectral range with a laser having two orders of magnitude better wavelength repeatability and an order of magnitude faster wavelength switching speed.� Eliminate the electronic noise canceller. Phase I results showed that fluctuations in collected sunlight intensity is the dominant PHOCS noise source. Laser excess noise is small in comparison. The Phase I invention does a much better job of improving sensitivity than does the noise canceller.� Switch from a narrowly tunable laser to a widely tunable one for carbon dioxide measurements. As with oxygen, the improved laser will allow fast measurements of selected absorption lines.� Consolidate the signal processing electronics onto a custom-built, compact, low-power circuit board and replace the commercial lock-in amplifier with new dual, single-board lock-in amplifier that Mesa Photonics has developed.","High-resolution, ground-based atmospheric column measurements are now made using solar occultation with high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometers. Called ""transportable,"" rather than portable, these spectrometers are used worldwide by the NASA-funded Total Carbon Column Observation Network (TCCON). These ground-based instruments also have an important role in aiding analysis of satellite remote sensing data. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) team expects to use TCCON atmospheric profiling results to aid analysis of the space-based carbon dioxide and methane remote sensing data. The OCO-2 satellite is scheduled for launch in 2014.PHOCS instruments will provide atmospheric column information to NASA from locations that are inaccessible to TCCON instruments. By narrowing our measurements to just one species, oxygen, we will be able to determine precise distributions of temperature and pressure fluctuations from the ground to the top of the atmosphere. These distributions are critical information needed for interpreting satellite data.",A secondary market for the proposed technology is for unobtrusive remote sensors that can detect hydrogen fluoride (HF) emissions from clandestine nuclear fuel processing.,"Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Detectors (see also Sensors); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

The heart of this spectrometer will be an RMSF core, which can be paired with different fore-optics or detector modules to achieve active point or passive standoff detection of the chemicals of interest.  The RMSF core is comprised of a dispersive spectrometer that images the sample spectrum from 3 – 5.5 micron onto a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) such that different columns correspond to different wavebands.  By applying masks to this DMD, a matched spectral filter can be applied in hardware.  This results in a highly flexible system that can address a wide variety of chemicals by simply updating the DMD masks applied and a wide variety of applications through modular hardware design.  Use of the DMD and a single element detector in place of a conventional FPA results in significantly reduced cost and improved performance in terms of image uniformity, pixel operability, and dynamic range.  The proposed Phase II effort will produce a prototype RMSF core with one set of fore-optic and detector modules for each of the two detection modalities.","The primary NASA application is ground, mobile and/or air-based missions which are tasked with greenhouse gas, volcanic gas, and other air pollutant measurements.","Non-NASA applications include fugitive emission monitoring, flare analysis, stack emission monitoring, general environmental and process monitoring, vehicle emissions diagnostics and greenhouse gas monitoring.",Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support)

This Phase II SBIR proposal addresses two critical areas in MEMS DM development towards the goal of developing flight-like hardware. Namely, Phase II research will further develop Iris AO's proven hybrid MEMS DM technology to: 1) develop and demonstrate wafer-scale assembly of deformable mirror arrays and 2) increase drive electronics resolution to >=18 bits using hardware-controlled super-resolution oversampling techniques. The increased spatial and actuator resolution afforded by the development here will enable picometer resolution DMs required to reach 10^10 contrast levels necessary for direct detection of Earth-sized terrestrial planets.","Iris AO technology can be a key enabling component in a host of future NASA missions, including the space telescopes of the 'Origins' program including Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), Space Astronomy Far Infrared Telescope (SAFIR), Life Finder, and Planet Imager. Four recent ASMCS concepts require multiple DMs to implement coronagraphs. Two of these, DAViNCI and EPIC, specifically require segmented MEMS DMs. Other potential programs such as Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) and ultraviolet telescopes will also require adaptive optics.

Systems used in military surveillance such as in the Predator drone and Global Hawk would benefit from the high-resolution, light weight, and low power consumption afforded by Iris AO's MEMS. Atmospheric correction enabled by these low-cost but highly capable devices would benefit space situational awareness surveillance applications as well. In the commercial sector, adaptive optics has been employed in research systems in biological imaging, most notably in vision science and microscopy. Several research universities are reporting results using AO-equipped systems. The high segment-count devices enabled by this proposal would lead to unprecedented levels of spatial fidelity for biological imaging applications. Other commercial applications include metrology, laser processing, coherent combination of multiple fiber lasers, and laser beam quality improvement and drift compensation. Iris AO segmented mirrors are uniquely well-suited to higher power applications such as laser processing, combining fiber lasers, and laser beam quality improvement. This advantage lies in the relatively thick segments that enable the use of dielectric coatings which tend to warp conventional surface micromachined MEMS DMs. The precision open-loop operation of Iris AO DMs greatly simplifies the use of DMs in these applications.","Adaptive Optics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Mirrors"

A unique capability is being enabled through this SBIR program that allows selection from various DM vendors a best DM to be integrated with the driver ASIC in order to build an extremely high contrast, compact, and low-mass coronagraphs and nulling interferometer system onto a space-based telescope. Given its superior performances namely (1) low power dissipation, (2) high control preciseness, (3) tiny chip estate and low mass, (4) minimal number of needed cables, and (5) universal capability in driving various piezoelectric actuator loads, the proposed ASIC driver technology holds the promise of enabling ultimate deployment of low power, low payload, low cost, and high-performance adaptive optics (AO) systems into NASA's space-based platforms. The feasibility of the proposed Phase II approach is demonstrated through eight major technical objectives: (1)packaging and characterizations of the Phase I 8x8 driver ASIC, and based on the test results, (2) design optimization and simulation of the Phase II 32x32 switch array driver ASIC, (3) layout, simulation verification, and tape out for ASIC manufacturing, (4) packaging and basic characterizations of the driver ASIC, (5) ASIC UBM (Under Ball Metallurgy) fabrication, (6) building ASIC PC communication interface and PC software development, (7) fabrication of capacitive load arrays made of different piezoelectric materials, and (8) characterizations of the final Phase II 32x32 switch array driver ASIC in integration with load/actuator arrays.","The driver ASIC and a DM will work together to enable NASA's applications including adaptive optics systems for correction of aberrations in large-aperture, space-deployed optical interferometers and telescopes (e.g. for nulling coronagraph), and for high-resolution imaging and communication through atmospheric turbulence. Differentiating itself from traditional driver solutions is its ultralow power dissipation, control preciseness, compactness, lightweight, and low cost. Should these features be demanded by a specific AO system to serve NASA's wavefront correction needs, the proposed ASIC will be worthy of considerations by working on four implementation levels: ASIC dies, standalone ASIC, programmable driver board, and programmable DMs.","Future non-NASA applications for ASIC-DM integrated deformable mirrors include laser beam shaping, ophthalmology and other microscope applications.

An occulter, which is a satellite flying far from a telescope and employing a large screen or, starshade, to suppress the incoming starlight, is used for detecting and characterizing exoplanets.  Detecting Earthlike planets existing within the habitable zones of nearby stars is a key element of NASA's space exploration mission.  The NASA JPL starshade incorporates a deployable center ring-truss as a hub and flower-like petals that wrap around the hub for packaging.  As a result, it exhibits exceptionally challenging deployment kinematics.  Roccor's Phase II will contribute to maturing the design of the NASA JPL deployable starshade through system and component design and analysis and supporting ground-demo hardware thereby helping to position it for spaceflight should it be transitioned to a NASA flight mission.Roccor's broad Phase II focus is on maturing each of the deployable starshade system elements that support the petals including the unfurling control system, the launch control system, and the deployed strut system.  Innovative solutions have been conceptualized for each of these petal support functions as part the Phase I program.  In Phase II, Roccor will emphasize developing and demonstrating the proposed petal unfurling technology culminating in a 1/3 scale fully functional and motorized hardware demonstration with 30 petal simulators, 3 of them being instrumented and strength-representative (e.g. fragile and narrow petal tips).

A polishable cladding is desired for SiC optics so they may be figured in less time, and so they may be polished to levels suitable for UVOIR astronomy.  ZeCoat has filed a provisional US patent application for the technology.  The proposed process is directly scalable to SiC mirrors several meters in diameter. The process is based on a novel, low temperature, ion-assisted, evaporation technique (IAD), whereby the coating stress of a silicon film may be manipulated from compressive to tensile, in order to produce a near-zero net stress for the complete layer. A Si cladding with little intrinsic stress is essential to allow thick coatings to be manufactured without cracking.  A low stress coating also minimizes substrate bending that would otherwise distort the figure of very lightweight mirrors.","Normal incidence 4-meter class UVOIR telescopes have been cited as a high priority by multiple government review panels including; the National Research Council's (NRC) study of NASA's Space Technology Roadmap and Priorities, The Office of the Chief Technologist, The Cosmic Origins Program and NWNH Decadal.","The ability to apply silicon cladding over a very large area offers the possibility of coating hundreds of smaller SiC optics at a time, thereby driving the cost down.

Recent X-ray telescopes, such as the Chandra Observatory, utilized reflectors made from zerodur which were up to 20mm thick.  The thickness of these reflectors, as well as the mass, limited the number of nested optics that could be implemented.  Current state of the art telescopes, such as those found on XMM-Newton, utilize reflectors made from an electroforming process with shell thicknesses on the order of 1mm.  This reduction in thickness has enabled a larger number of reflectors to be implemented, 58 nested reflectors in the case of XMM-Newton, but the weight still needs to be significantly reduced for future missions.  The proposed innovation seeks to improve upon the current state of the art by replacing much of the NiCo with a stiff, lightweight, ceramic material.  A thermal spray process, which was tested for feasibility in Phase I, will be enhanced to allow for the deposition of porosity graded alumina onto the rear surface of the NiCo reflector. Several diagnostic techniques will be employed to adjust the in-flight particle state as well as the residual stress of the coating as to not adversely affect the micro roughness of the optical surface as well as the figure accuracy of the optic. The gradation of the alumina layer will allow for CTE matching with the electroformed shell as well as optimization of the ceramic stiffness.  By reducing the NiCo layer from 1mm to less than 100um with a 200um alumina layer as the support structure the overall mass of the telescope can be greatly reduced allowing for a greater number of reflectors to be nested.","X-ray astronomy is highly dependent upon focusing optics as illustrated by the profound influence that results from the Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku observatories are having upon astrophysics. The next generation of NASA Physics-of-the-Cosmos missions will build on the discoveries of current missions and will take us to new stages of discovery. X-ray measurements address many of the major scientific objectives of NASA. They involve the entire range of X-ray emitting objects from the most distant supermassive black holes to planets and comets in our own solar system. Thus, X-ray astronomy will continue to be an important activity of NASA. Future X-ray explorer missions, such as a successor to Nu-STAR, would benefit greatly from the improved resolution of the optics discussed above. Future X-ray astronomy missions such as Smart-X will require large effective area and will utilize a segmented optics approach. Our technology studies to fabricate lighter weight substrates may be useful not only for the full-shell optics but also for substrates which can be used in the segmented optics of such future missions.","While the development focuses on X-ray optics, significant possibilities exist for multi-spectral systems (i.e. UV, visible, infrared).  These applications can be applied to the area of defense telescopes, commercial space exploration and medical imaging.  The proposed innovation of layered material assembly  for supporting the precise X-ray optical surface can be applied to other applications which require surface conforming ability, large area deposition, material versatility, and cost effective, non-vacuum manufacturing.  The hybrid manufacturing technology being investigated in this program combining metal alloy plating with ceramic or composite backing technology can be contemplated for expanded applications in DoD and commercial sectors.  This methodology can also be used to fabricate novel projectile systems such as graded liners for gun-barrels with smooth internal surface with light weight backing.  It can enable 3D forming of complex hydraulic cylinders, cavities, in general aviation systems.  Thermal spray can also be used to augment general plating technologies by adding material a much higher rate and speed so as to minimize the amount of plating time required. Additionally, the advances made through this program have the potential to influence a broad sector of current thermal spray related applications including manufacturing of tubular solid oxide fuel cells, large gas separation membranes, thermal barrier coatings, chromium-plate replacement coatings etc.","Actuators & Motors; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Ceramics; Characterization; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Destructive Testing; Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; In Situ Manufacturing; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Manufacturing Methods; Material Handing & Packaging; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Metallics; Passive Systems; Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods; Project Management; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation); X-rays/Gamma Rays"

This device is well sized for spacecraft ranging in size from several tens of kilograms to several hundred kilograms.  It could be fueled by either xenon or iodine.  The latter yields performance like xenon, but stores at low pressure and high density, make it especially attractive for volume limited spacecraft.  The available specific impulse will be 1400-1600-s. The target thruster efficiency is 45%.  At 100-W and 1500-s, the thrust will be 6.1 mN.  The lifetime of the thruster may exceed 10,000 hours, yielding a throughput of greater than 14.9 kg. In Phase I, the thruster was designed. Design considerations included efficiency, specific impulse, temperature, lifetime, mass, volume, and cost.  Careful attention to the magnetic field resulted in a ""magnetically shielded"" shape, which should minimize or entirely eliminate ion wall losses.  Testing with a nominal 200-W thruster showed the feasibility and desirability of both permanent magnets and a diamond discharge channel.  Permanent magnets save mass, volume, and power.  Diamond reduces ion sputtering by 50% with respect to conventional materials.In Phase II, the 100-W thruster and a compact cathode to accompany it will be manufactured, tested, and improved.  Performance, lifetime, and plume properties will be evaluated.  Testing will include both xenon and iodine.  Year 2 development will focus on maximizing throughput.  Integrated testing will include a compact, low cost, power processing unit. The technology will reach TRL 5.The program is responsive to NASA topic S3.03, Propulsion Systems. Both the ""Electric Propulsion"" and ""Micro-Propulsion"" sub-topics are relevant.  The proposal also addresses several of NASA's Grand Challenges, including Efficient In-Space Transportation, Space Debris Hazard Mitigation, and Economical Space Access.","The proposed 100-W thruster fills a void between existing micro-propulsion options and existing low power Hall thruster systems. The system provides the benefits of electric propulsion (specific impulse, delta-V) to small, low cost spacecraft, a market which is presently underserved. The proposed 100-W thruster is especially well sized for spacecraft weighing 20 to 200-kg.  Integration with nano-spacecraft (<20 kg) is also feasible.  The first NASA application could be a small technology satellite demonstration satellite fueled by xenon or iodine propellant.  Other near term applications could include drag-makeup and formation flying.The size, low alpha (kg/kW), and simplicity of Hall thrusters make them ideal for many other applications.  These include orbit raising and lowering, de-orbiting, station-keeping, inclination changes, and interplanetary transfers.  Destinations could include asteroids, comets, dwarf planets, outer planets, etc.  In such missions, the thruster could function either by itself or in conjunction with a larger Hall thruster.   Still other applications could include a cargo delivery vehicle originating in LEO or at the ISS, or a small electric upper stage.","Hall thrusters are attractive for commercial and military spacecraft due to their high performance, relatively small size, low mass, and relatively low cost.  Continuous thrust functions for small, power-limited spacecraft in LEO would include orbit insertion and maintenance, in-space maneuvering, orbit-raising, and de-orbiting.  The thruster is appropriate for spacecraft as small as 6 - 12 U in size.  Applications for geosynchronous spacecraft would include station-keeping and repositioning.  In pulsed mode, the thruster could provide high precision impulse bits for station-keeping, attitude control, precision positioning, and constellation maintenance.  An iodine fueled system could provide an ""off the shelf"" option for operationally responsive spacecraft.  The military has a need for satellites that are both operationally responsive to launch command and operationally responsive to the war fighter on-orbit.  The ORS office is proposing a paradigm shift from the traditional architecture to a more flexible ""plug and play"" architecture.  For this class of spacecraft, a low power Hall thruster fueled by iodine is very attractive because it can be stored as a solid at low temperature and sub-atmospheric pressure, allowing pre-fueled long term storage of the propulsion system until a responsive space need arises.",Ceramics; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Passive Systems; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Main Engine

AlN has exceptionally high plasma erosion resistance but suffers from high SEE yield. AlN can be a ""revolutionary"" replacement for BN channel insulator since it provides high plasma erosion resistance with structural robustness and high thermal conductivity if it's SEE yield can be reduced.

The MiPS system has been tested to 200,000 cycles without any technical issues, demonstrating excellent reliability. A 1.5U CHIPS subsystem, using non-toxic R134a propellant, is a compact thruster system having a total impulse of 680 N-s and a fully throttleable continuous thrust of 30 mN. The subsystem also includes an R134a 3-axis cold-gas attitude control system to replace reaction wheels.  Approximately 25 W of primary power is required from a lithium-ion battery included in the 1.5U package. This low-cost subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of nanosat propulsion systems, which will become available to the CubeSat and nanosatellite communities for orbit change, de-orbit, precision maneuvering, and drag makeup missions.","CHIPS technology supports the NASA Roadmap for In-Space Propulsion Systems, nonchemical propulsion. CubeSats and nanosatellites with CHIPS would enable a number of different significant missions for low Earth orbits including orbit raising, orbit phasing, and deorbiting.  The drag makeup capability of CHIPS would allow low altitude endo-atmospheric orbits, permitting onboard sensors to operate at lower altitude.  Using a cold-gas mode, CHIPS also has the capability for precision position adjustments, enabling missions requiring station keeping, formation flying, and docking. CHIPS would improve mission affordability for multiple CubeSats, since several CubeSats with CHIPS could be launched from a single low-cost booster and maneuvered to other orbits, then later deorbited.  Note that CHIPS is easily scalable to smaller or larger sizes (total impulses), depending on mission and payload requirements, by changing the tank volume.  Battery size can either be scaled, or kept the same size if recharging between thrust events is practical for the mission.","The CHIPS thruster family provides a compact, non-hazardous, dual-use propulsion technology solution with projected low cost, that will be made available in sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in NASA, DOD, industry, and academia for CubeSat and nanosatellite missions.",Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Spacecraft Main Engine

The overall objective of this program (Phase II) is to adapt CarbAlTM-based advanced thermal management substrates from terrestrial to space applications.  ANI will target improved CarbAl™-based heatsinks and thermally conductive circuit boards for power electronic applications.  CarbAl™ is a carbon-based thermal composite with a thermal performance exceeding that of many metals.  The low CTE provides excellent matching to state-of-the-art power transistor dies and the low density and robustness make it suitable for space vehicle applications.   The proposed Phase I program is a continuation of the materials development completed internally at ANI.

Tight integration of the sensor with the sUAS avionics and airframe will enable precise flight control for low altitude missions in the range of 15m-30m above ground level (AGL) required for the sensor to accurately map soil moisture down to ~5cm in depth at up to a 15m resolution.  The teams strong working knowledge of the regulatory environment surrounding sUAS will be used to inform the development of the system and associated concept of operations. This will facilitate safe and legal operation in the national airspace following FAA approval. The continued SuperSwift system development will address the design issues identified in Phase I.  The stock airframe utilized in the Phase I study, the Tempest, while well qualified for use in preliminary flight testing, created additional challenges for integration of the soil moisture measurement payload.  Due to the requirements of the radiometer antenna the Tempest was modified during Phase I to accomplish initial flight testing, but had several challenges including external placement of the antenna, more complex manufacturing of the control linkages for the rudder and elevator, and a soil moisture electronics payload that is deeply integrated into the airframe and difficult to remove for testing and replacement. These requirements drove the team to design a modified fuselage to be built in Phase II that involves a modified removable nose cone to house the entire sensor payload and converts the propulsion to a twin engine design on the wings.","In terms of addressable NASA markets, the SuperSwift sUAS has several unique benefits and fulfils multiple needs of the agency.  The Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) Mission is in development by NASA for an October 2014 launch based on the recommendation of the National Research Council's Committee on Earth Science and Applications from Space.  The benefits of measuring the global hydrosphere are extensive and well documented by NASA.  For SMAP specifically, the expected resolution of measurements from the passive radiometer is approximately 40 km.  The SuperSwift sUAS in development is able to obtain comparable measurements to a resolution of 15 meters.  This refined resolution enables two important uses of the data in support of the broader SMAP mission: validation, and resolution.  In support of the prime science objectives of SMAP an extensive calibration and validation plan has been developed  which articulates the need for many different data sources both before and after the spacecraft is launched.  In addition to assisting with this extensive validation process, the SuperSwift sUAS will be able to augment SMAP science data products with finer resolution data near watersheds and in drought areas where local soil moisture data can provide unique information.  The SuperSwift sUAS will also provide data products for regions where enhanced measurement frequency or resolution would advance research utilizing radiometer data.","The proposed system will have the ability to support FEMA in better understanding flash flood vulnerability.   This utility was demonstrated in 2007 when Prof. Gasiewski led a NASA funded research effort to map soil moisture in a region of North Texas and Oklahoma that suffered from severe flooding. This data was used to provide alerts and warnings to areas susceptible to flash flooding.  A SuperSwift sUAS could provide this data at a fraction of the cost and thus improve predictions for flooding events in vulnerable watersheds around the country. Providing information on vegetation density and soil moisture has a potentially powerful application in support of state and federal agencies seeking to understand, monitor, and fight wildland fires in certain circumstances.  This work has been evaluated broadly by Black Swift Technologies and a proprietary white paper has been submitted to several state organizations using other sensor and system configurations.  The progress made to date on developing the SuperSwift sUAS in Phase I of this project has already elicited specific interest from researchers looking at transitioning technologies to support precision agriculture applications.

Market opportunities for tethered rovers within NASA often coincide with Mars exploration missions that are launched every 26 months. Prime contractors supporting NASA's rover missions include Lockheed Martin Astronautics.[3] While Luna's technical development of self-sensing tethers is focused to meet the specific needs of NASA as an early adopter, there is a wide and diverse market for self-sensing tethers to support robotic inspection in challenging Earth environments.","Luna is already actively engaged the market for short-range distributed fiber optic shape and position sensing though minimally invasive surgery (MIS) development efforts with Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Philips Medical.  Luna's preliminary long-range sensing capabilities has also generated interest among makers and end-users of robotic exploration tools, UUVs, pipe crawlers, and articulated borescopes. These potential customers, including industry leaders in aerospace, NDT inspection, and ship building,  have all expressed the need for 3D shape and position sensing in a lighter, more flexible, durable, and most importantly, longer form. Phase I efforts have proved the feasibility of making continuous shape measurements out to lengths up to 100m. The upgraded acquisition system and software, integration into a rugged cable, in-the-field testing gained through the Phase II effort will move this technology closer to industry adoption.","Diagnostics/Prognostics; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)"

As performance of new processors increases, we are moving into a new reality in which data movement is expensive and operations are becoming nearly free. In Phase I we discovered a new theory of data compression with unprecedented capability to reduce data movement in distributed HPC applications. Phase I results include: 1) the demonstration via proof-of-concept prototypes of lossless compressive gains of 4x-20x for NAS Parallel Benchmarks, and 2) the formulation of COPA, a Compression OPportunities Auditing & discovery process that facilitates the analysis of any given large-scale code with the purpose of optimizing it for performance via data movement reduction.Phase II targets the consolidation of the new theory through two major thrusts: 1) the development of software that facilitates integrating high-yield compression into HPC codes, and 2) the further infusion of the technology into NASA applications. Thrust 1 will produce a fully functional prototype of a software suite for the automatic/semi-automatic acceleration of HPC codes via compression. The prototype will incorporate ease-of-infusion features (e.g., MPI-enabled compression and decompression routines), as well as ergonomic features that allow the seamless integration of new compression modules into the suite. Thrust 2 will begin with the application of the Chapter 1 of COPA to five HPC codes of utmost importance to NASA, namely Cart3D, FUN3D, USM3D, Enzo, and WRF. Accelogic will collaborate with the developers of these codes to integrate the compression technology under three different levels of ""integrability,"" namely automatic, semi-automatic, and manual. By the end of Phase II, at least one of these applications will undergo the complete COPA optimization process. Complementary Phase II/III funds for $1+ million have been secured to ensure successful commercialization.","The impact of this technology on NASA is high and very broad.  The fact that, in the short time span of the Phase I project, five of the Top NASA HPC applications have submitted letters of intent to Accelogic to become Phase II participants, speaks vastly about the significance of this technology for NASA. One of these participants mentions in his letter of intent that this technology ""can be considered critical in achieving the next generation of so-called exascale software applications."" Another participant mentions that a rough audit of their codes in production runs suggests that speedup factors on the order of 2-4 would be reasonable to expect across the spectrum of their user's cases. Such speedups would represent new opportunities for the code users to explore new larger science problems, faster and at a lower cost. The impact of this compression technology spans most areas of importance to NASA's scientific mission, including aerospace, weather forecasting, combustion, climate research, and chemistry, among many others.","The landscape for non-NASA government and commercial applications is similar, with this compression technology having a potential strong impact on most fields for which HPC is crucial. This includes a vast array of Government and commercial fields such as: climate research, molecular dynamics, chemistry, defense, weather forecasting, energy, finance, economic forecasting, civil and environmental engineering, geophysics, life sciences, and semiconductors.","Computer System Architectures; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Rice is one of the most important crops globally considering its role in the Earth system, food security, and providing livelihoods with more than 1 billion people depending on rice. Tools and systems that can help monitor production and support risk management are needed for decision making by many end users and governments. Futures are a tool used to manage or hedge risk, reduce volatility, improve food security, and maximize efficiency and profit on the open market. Currently, the rice futures market has little high quality and timely information available to make strategic or application specific decisions to reduce risk and maximize profit. The global rice futures market is thinly traded causing extreme price fluctuation orders of magnitude. The innovation of Rice Decision Support System (RiceDSS) is the seamless fusion of operational satellite remote sensing monitoring metrics of rice agriculture, rice yield modeling, and weather forecasts to generate near real time information on rice extent, growth stages, production forecasts and statistical uncertainty. RiceDSS uses a state-of-the-art open source framework with advanced automation routines, web-GIS, and mobile technologies to support visualization and delivery of information to support global food security programs and commodity markets.","This effort will support futures market and NASA contribution to GEO-GLAM program, NASA Applied Sciences Program index insurance programs, and climate change science. RiceDSS will also support USDA NASS and RMA efforts providing area statistics, production estimates, and insurance for rice. Anticipated Direct Results: * Platform for supporting rice futures markets * Operational, near real-time rice mapping products * Operational, near real-time rice yield forecasts with quantified uncertainties * Platform for supporting rice index insurance markets * Agricultural monitoring to support food security and risk management * Platform for Rice GHG MRV support.","Better forecasts, more accurate and timely acreage information, planting progress, more accurate quality data prior to harvest, more accurate harvest date predictions, are a few key information needs of rice industry, including rice elevators and mills, rice breeders and overall supply chain.Environmental markets (e.g. California Rice Offset Protocol) needs access to spatially explicit, timely and accurate maps of rice production and management practices for efficient, cost effective and transparent offset markets. RiceDSS system, including the remote sensing linked with mobile apps and webGIS tools, can support environmental markets.  This effort will support voluntary and compliance GHG offset markets using the existing and in development rice protocols for ACR, CAR and California ARB.",Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Image Processing

These tools place a corresponding stress on legacy engineering visualization systems which now are required to handle larger data sets, provide more intuition to the user, integrate well with many other tools, and help the user with his/her ultimate goal: improving the design of complex systems.Phoenix Integration proposes to complete the prototype visualization environment created during Phase I to the point where it is a commercially viable product. New features, refinements, and integration with other tools will be accomplished in Phase II. In particular, the work will involve major improvements to whitespace exploration algorithms, techniques that enable users to unconstrain or modify the underlying engineering model in an effort to obtain results in previously unattainable areas. Work will also include more data mining algorithms (e.g. Principal Component Analysis), new graph types (e.g. spider plots), export formats to 3-D tools (e.g. Tecplot), integration with MBSE/SysML tools, integration with web-based decision support environments, and incorporation of probabilistic analysis. A rich integration with ModelCenter, the company's engineering integration and trade study environment, is planned, although a standalone capability will also be offered. The visualizer's architecture will be based on OpenGL and will use the GPU to parallelize rendering computations. Design will focus on usability and responsiveness, with the goal of providing quick insight into complex data. The tool will be user-tested through early adopters to ensure relevance and to guide development.","The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) performs research in the areas of Earth Science, Planetary Science, Heliophysics, and Astrophysics. All of these areas involve the common need for conceptual and preliminary design of complex system models and the attendant engineering visualization this implies. The same need to more readily build and execute more sophisticated engineering models exists within other NASA directorates as well: Aeronautics Research, Human Exploration and Operations, and Space Technology. As NASA develops the next generation of scientific and space exploration missions there is a growing need for an integrated and collaborative visualization environment that can be used to rapidly evaluate competing vehicle and mission concepts. Current NASA projects that exemplify this need include the James Webb Telescope, robotic space probe missions, future manned space exploration capsules, potential heavy launch propulsion systems, new low noise, low emission, and fuel efficient airliner designs, and future air traffic control concepts. JPL's System F6 effort (for DARPA) and their TeamX environment are possible specific beneficiaries of this system. The F6 program already uses Phoenix Integration's current visualization system. Aeronautics programs at Langley have also used this system and would benefit from the proposed new visualizer.","Due to its generic nature, there are numerous non-NASA applications that will benefit from improved design-space visualization technology. These include a wide range of military and civilian design programs in domains such as aircraft, automotive, electronics, heavy machinery, shipbuilding, and alternative energy design projects. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are all current Phoenix customers and could make good use of better visualization technology. The company is well positioned to introduce this technology to organizations in various sectors such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, Raytheon, Dresser-Rand, GE, etc. since they already utilize the company's current products. Many, indeed, already use the legacy visualization system this SBIR will replace. Many are also adopting more integrated approaches to engineering and system modeling, for which the new visualization system will be designed. A common driver for all customers is the economic need to improve the design process for ever more complex systems. A major goal, therefore, is enabling greater intuition and exploration of complex trade spaces early in the design process.","Analytical Methods; Data Processing; Display; Knowledge Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

FM software and methodologies, however, too often have nagging limitations that restrict utility, and research and development continues to grapple relative to advancements in the complex systems they monitor. Modern spacecraft, for example, may have thousands of sensors and hundreds of systems/subsystems (and extensive cabling) but relatively few FM co-solutions. Theoretically, the overall FM challenge is in monitoring, modeling, and managing the huge numbers of signals and then determining how to detect them and set appropriate handling actions.For complex systems FM is not trivial, and automated FM is tasked with catching potential failure conditions within interconnected networks before consequences elevate. Ensuring fault coverage while maintaining system reliability under these circumstances is a daunting challenge for even the most capable team, and from anecdotal evidence, it is apparent that FM remains partly elusive.Our SBIR project herein involves the research and development of an innovative FM software solution called ""DyMA-FM"" (Dynamic Multivariate Assessment for Fault Management). As software, it uses model-based reasoning in a distributed processing environment for real-time detection and response to fault conditions.Building on the Phase I successes, in the course of this Phase II we will further develop the DyMA-FM concept as an innovative full prototype FM software application, having a tiered hierarchical architecture design leveraging advances in mathematical modeling. Thus, as per the intent of the Phase II, we believe we have a well-defined and innovative FM system capable of meeting the NASA requirements and representative thematic goals of: (1) verifiability, (2) transparency, and (3) fault coverage. Phase II, then, will allow us to advance the development further and fully.","During Phase I we demonstrated the DyMA-FM analytical foundation using BCDU data from the ISS. Our Phase I conclusions, and the basis for our Phase II argument, are as follows: DyMA-FM is easily scalable and configurable and can adapt to widely variant NASA FM needs. Notably, this is one of the main advantages of having a software solution serve as the initial SBIR-derived product. We envision the following NASA options for DyMA-FM transition:- Create a standalone passive software FM monitoring system, usable on a laptop, and suitable for NASA laboratory testing/design support. - Migrate the software to an integrated, yet still passive, ground-based mission control role.- Integrate the software for in-flight support, helping to monitor and diagnose FM in situ (i.e., aboard the ISS) or other larger program missions.- Under separate funding, build hardware modules of the solution for full integration with system hardware. (We should note that while our partner, Boeing, desires this option fully.)Thus, we believe the DyMA-FM software solution has directly relevant roles for both: (1) NASA development engineering and design in the laboratory as well as (2) continuous, real-time (passive) support for missions and mission control. Additionally, the output for DyMA-FM could migrate from being a passive system to an active one. Success in this regard would conform fully to the theme and scope of an SBIR.","DyMA-FM is a software solution fully capable of running on multiple hardware/operating system configurations. The target market is the electrical industry, particularly those focused on closed grids (i.e., micro-grids, automobiles, aircraft, subsystems, etc.). Since the system performs modeling as per signal inputs, nearly any network capable of digital monitoring could make a suitable target for the solution. Thus, we see commercial opportunities in the following product formats:- Software – We plan to offer commercial versions of DyMA-FM as a standalone software application. This will entail an ""exclusive"" reseller agreement with IAVO being paid a licensing fee for each copy sold. We also envision multiple versions of the software to emerge once we develop initial revenues.- Embedded software – We expect DyMA-FM software to work as a component within larger offerings. This would be built under an original equipment manufacturer agreement whereby DyMA-FM would become embedded/integrated with another vendor's system. This would require a formal end-user license agreement.  - Hardware – Our SBIR partner (e.g., the Boeing Corporation) finds great appeal in a hardware version. The logic being that this would allow them to configure devices as per needs – and install the integrated module as an FM plug-in on existing and future aircraft. Boeing holds that this resulting device would have great utility for their aircraft design, test, and operations.","Analytical Methods; Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Command & Control; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Heat Exchange; Lifetime Testing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Quality/Reliability; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Verification/Validation Tools"

Fault management (FM) is a critical challenge that must be addressed, especially when multiple spacecraft are working in proximity.  Automatic fault management reduces the effort required by the ground crew when faults occur, and it reduces the chance of collision by quickly recovering from faults. We are developing a Flexible Fault Manager for Distributed Systems (FFMDS) for these missions. FFMDS is a FM architecture that will include algorithms to be run on each cluster module for fault detection, isolation, and recovery; software to be used at a ground station to direct recovery actions; and protocols for communication of fault information between cluster modules and between modules and the ground station. The architecture is service-oriented, so that algorithms for fault detection, isolation, and recovery can be added to or subtracted from the system as appropriate.","The proposed fault management (FM) architecture will improve the robustness and survivability of multi-spacecraft missions. The numerous nano-satellite demonstrations within NASA are potential targets for this technology. Although the launch dates of funded demonstrations are too early for our timeline, there will be further interest in nano-satellites. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is a cooperative spacecraft mission that launches after Phase II. Other applications include spacecraft that assemble large space structures, such as a manned mission where an Orion MPCV docks with another Orion MPCV. These low Earth orbit demonstrations are critical to expanding human space flight.","The fault management (FM) architecture development augments the Cluster Flight Application (CFA) that Emergent is developing under DARPA's System F6 project. The CFA is focused on guidance, navigation and control software to support cluster flight. The CFA and this fault management architecture have significant potential for reuse on clustered spacecraft missions in the future.  DARPA is currently looking for options to demonstrate technologies developed under the System F6 program. Any such demonstration of CFA could also host FFMACF.In a few years commercial manned spacecraft will dock with the ISS or other commercial space stations. Commercial systems are sensitive to size, weight, power, and cost.  Rendezvous-capable vehicles at any scale will benefit from FM enhancements.  The applications for our FFMDS are not limited to space. Non-space applications include groups of UAVs, groups of marine vessels, and autonomous transportation vehicles. All missions involving automation of multiple vehicles are potential commercialization targets.","Diagnostics/Prognostics; Navigation & Guidance; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

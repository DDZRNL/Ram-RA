Many NASA trajectory design packages (OTIS, EMTG, MALTO) have already had their own code streamlined, and it is now the serial execution of existing NLP solvers that represents the largest bottleneck. CU Aerospace has an existing prototype of this kind of solver, the Nonlinear Parallel Optimization Tool (NLPAROPT), which has already demonstrated speed superiority over comparable serial algorithms and shown that there remains significant potential for improvements. Currently, NLPAROPT is restricted to run on distributed memory systems. It is the goal of this Phase I effort to create a sister program to NLPAROPT, the CUA OpenMP Nonlinear Optimization Tool (COMPNOT), which will be compatible with shared memory systems. As large-scale shared memory parallel systems, such as Intel's Xeon Phi family, become more commercially available, COMPNOT will greatly expand the market for this NLP solver, even enabling most modern desktop computers to effectively run it. Additionally, Phase I will entail developing hardware-specific optimization, focusing on the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), but other platforms will be explored as well. At the end of Phase I, can begin integration into NASA trajectory design packages, significantly reducing the time-to-solution.","NASA currently utilizes SNOPT, IPOPT, and WORHP software packages for astrodynamics applications such as the design of complex spacecraft trajectories and other optimal control problems, but could greatly benefit from the introduction of a parallel large-scale, nonlinear, sparse optimization solution - one which does not have its speed bottlenecked by a single processor. The core NLP algorithm proposed to be used in COMPNOT has already been shown to result in a reduction in execution time, thereby reducing the optimization's turn-around time and improve communications between both designers and scientists. COMPNOT would take this effort, and refocus it to multi-core machines so that individual NASA scientists could perform advanced optimizations on a desktop. Our solver would act as a significant force multiplier for existing NASA tools such as GMAT's collocation-based low-thrust transcription and EMTG's inner loop solver. Additionally, COMPNOT could improve run-times across all forms of problem optimizations, including trajectory design, resource management, attitude determination and control, and vehicle design.","Government agencies other than NASA, as well as commercial markets, would benefit from the improvements inherent in COMPNOT, especially given the widespread use of nonlinear programming techniques as a primary method for solving some of the most difficult technical computing problems. For example, in economics the product-mix with price elasticity problem can be formulated as a nonlinear program and solved with a tool like COMPNOT. Another field that depends heavily on efficient and robust NLP solvers is operations research, with the facility location problem and network optimization problems being archetypal examples of operation research challenges that may be cast as nonlinear programs. Furthermore, industries dealing with problems such as power grid design, weather prediction, and crop planting optimization could benefit from COMPNOT's speed enhancements.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This design will enable a compact, safe, robust, NTR to be designed that emits clean exhaust, high specific impulse, high thrust to weight, intrinsic subcriticality in accident scenarios, and affordability.The SPRINTR design uses a stack of thin plates of fuel which have radial grooves etched into the top surface. The size of the grooves, number of grooves, and thickness of the plate can be varied to match power density. The coolant flow is a folded flow path identical to the particle bed reactor but the solid fuel form solves the problems of matching the power density. The flat plate fuel element allows extreme ease of manufacture and allows coatings to be easily applied if needed.The basis of the concept will utilize LEU loaded tungsten fuel. This will allow retention of all radioactivity and clean exhaust. Clean exhaust will enable much more affordable ground based testing facilities to be considered. Separating each fuel plate will be graphite composite plates. These will be unloaded graphite which will moderate neutrons and provide a more thermal neutron spectrum. By providing a more moderated neutron spectrum, much less LEU will be required in the tungsten fuel. In the event the graphite elements crack or erode, no radioactivity or fuel is lost to the flow stream.Due to advancements in cermet fuels, the SPRINTR can succeed where previous flat plate designs struggled.  The proposed design allows for simple manufacturing, effective heat transfer, high thrust, and low mass.","A human mission to Mars will drive technology and focus public attention. Leading the human exploration of space demonstrates the superiority of the US technology and industrial base to the world.Robotic missions to the outer planets benefit from shorter mission flight times and higher payload masses-thus, greater scientific return. Similarly, human missions benefit from shorter exposure to galactic cosmic radiation and higher payloads for life support. Recent studies made at the CSNR have also identified the benefits of using an NTR to support a Lunar Outpost and to intercept an inbound ""planet-killing"" comet.  The concept of using a NTR as a ""space tug"" to launch robotic probes to the outer planets is also possible.  Previous studies have shown that the expense of developing the NTR could be recovered in 7 years even without the human mission to Mars and would see significant profits to private industry with the inclusion of a human mission.","Development of the fuel element for a compact, robust, safe, reactor with high power density could enable a number of systems with ground based applications. This project could lead to the development of a small, mobile power reactor for use at remote locations such as mines and research stations in Alaska or the Arctic. Such as application was pursued at the CSNR with support from the Alaskan governor's office.The NTR is basically a heat exchanger. Heat exchangers are used throughout the commercial power industry.

The unique advantages of the proposed system include:(1) a wide input voltage range (28V to 100V) with a wide output voltage (150V to 400V) while maintaining high efficiency operation. Therefore, it provides a universal solution for aerospace systems with different bus voltages. (2) this modular converter will be capable of input-parallel output-series (IPOS) operation to support higher output voltage (800V-1200V or higher) and input-parallel output-parallel (IPOP) operation to support higher output power (20kW or higher). An intelligent ""plug-n-play"" power sharing and voltage balancing control is proposed to support the IPOS and IPOP operations. (3) the proposed converter adopts a soft-switching DC/DC topology using the advanced GaN power MOSFETs to enable high efficiency with high switching frequency operation, which leads to significant size reduction of magnetics and other passive components to push for high power density design. The targeting power density for single module is more than 1kW/kg.The Phase I effort includes design and analysis of modular discharge converter with the GaN power MOSFETs and the ""plug-n-play"" power sharing and voltage balancing control system to support IPOS and IPOP operation. The bread board will use COTS EEE parts.  Its testing will validate the performance over the wide input/output voltage range. Two modules will verify IPOS and IPOP operation. The initial system integration test with Busek HET will also be conducted.In Phase II we will fully characterize the breadboard discharge converter with a thruster and develop a proto-flight brass-board level unit with multiple discharger modules using GaN devices. At the conclusion of Phase II we will build and deliver several discharger modules to NASA for additional characterization testing.","HET systems are well suited for interplanetary transfers, supporting exploration and science missions.  Throttling ability is important for a thruster that might be called upon to propel a spacecraft from Earth to Mars, which orbits at 1.52 AU and reduces the solar constant to 43% of the value at Earth. The Outer Planet Assessment Group has called out high power density/high efficiency power electronics as needs for the Titan/Enceladus Flagship and planetary exploration missions. These types of missions, including Mars Sample Return using Hall thrusters and PPUs, require advancements in power electronics to improve efficiency, reduce mass and volume, and to develop systems beyond the state-of-the-art.A HET system that provides efficient and affordable transportation to, from and around space destinations is one of NASA Grand Challenges.  NASA has identified 30kW-class SEP systems as a high-value intermediate step toward higher power systems due to broad cross-cutting capability. The proposed modular discharger is easily scalable, providing NASA with greater mission flexibility over any target SEP power level.","Electric propulsion systems have been identified as a key technology for transportation of DoD space assets.  The AFRL IHPRPT Program continues to invest in the development of HET systems.  Hall Effect thruster propulsion systems can serve DoD space needs by the in-space transportation of DoD space assets and commercial communication satellites for both orbit transfer and station keeping. The PPU for such a thruster system could enhance many missions for satellite orbit maintenance, orbit changes, and repositioning.  The PPU is also compatible with Hall thruster operating on alternate propellants such as krypton and/or iodine.  High power density EP systems are also identified in the IHPRPT RP21 goals for spacecraft propulsion.For commercial applications dominated by communications GEOsats, the proposed universal, rugged converter could significantly reduce the cost of current PPU.  Because of its wide input voltage range and IPOS and IPOP operation such converter could capture significant fraction of the commercial market further reducing cost and delivery time.  A high power density modular PPU could also find near term application on an all-electric upper stage derived from Busek/ULA ESPA orbit maneuvering system (OMS), a free flying S/C based on the ESPA ring.  The low power ESPA system presently utilizes four BHT-1500 Xe Hall effect thrusters and is capable of delivering up to five secondary payloads to diverse earth orbits.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Command & Control; Conversion; Distribution/Management; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Superconductance/Magnetics","Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storageis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The human-centered control methodology utilizes 3d sensor fusion for workspace visualization, machine learning with on-the-fly training, and pilot assist features to garner operator trust, improve safety, mitigate training latency, and support rapid task switching. The integrated algorithms identify and track underlying structure to enable pilot assistance and other safety features such as collision avoidance. DCS utilizes a common interface across robotic platforms and supports variable levels of autonomy specific to each task and/or operator. DCS permits robotic execution of exceedingly complex tasks that require high-levels of cognition and precise motor control which, to date, have been intractable for purely manual or automated control schemes to accomplish.The overall Phase I and II objectives are to: (1) demonstrate the value of a DCS interface to support intuitive manual control for remote operations, (2) demonstrate 3d visual-feedback and  operator assistance supported by machine learning for tasks with underlying structure and varying levels of complexity, and (3) demonstrate the DCS platform can be extended to support different classes of robots with varying levels of autonomy. The objectives specific to Phase I are to: (1) Demonstrate intuitive manual control of a simulated NASA robot,  (2) mitigate program risk by demonstrating basic assistive features, and (3) refine Phase II technical objectives based on collected user feedback and specific scenario requirements.","DCS algorithms developed as part of this programs can serve as a foundation with the potential to increases the range of beneficial tasks robots can perform and allows for improved safety and efficiency of operations across NASA mission scenarios. Future DCS algorithms could enable advanced capabilities for grappling of large payloads in space (Canadarm2 scope), for establishing and caretaking precursor structures and equipment on extraterrestrial surfaces (Valkyrie scope), and for supporting both robotic (rover scope) and astronaut-based (Robonaut 2 and MANTIS) exploration and science. Indeed, DCS could impact operational scenarios for many NASA funded projects, especially those relating to in-space manufacturing.","DCS algorithms developed for NASA have numerous applications for other U.S. Government organizations. The algorithms can be used by the Combatting Terrorism Technical Support Office (CTTSO) to safely disarm Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and support the Navy with its mandate from the EPA to safely mitigate subsea unexploded ordinances (UXOs). The algorithms could also enable the Navy Research Laboratory to repair, reposition and update space satellites. The largest single commercial market for DCS algorithms developed for NASA is arguably with subsea oil and gas field service companies who routinely utilize ROVs from OEMs such as Oceaneering and Saab to solve complex intervention challenges relating to the maintenance of subsea assets. Additionally, prospective commercial opportunities may be present in nuclear decommissioning or catastrophe response applications on demolition equipment like that offered by Brokk Robotics (Sweden). It should also be noted that DCS is expected to enable increased utility for a range of robotic systems and therefore has implications for the commercial viability of other hardware products (both sensor systems and robots) which would encourage further development and commercialization in the sector.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Image Processing; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Operating Systems; Perception/Vision; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Teleoperation,Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Some forward modeling tools exist commercially, but inverse modeling remains a topic mostly in low TRL research. The ill-posed nature of the problem in general requires data-driven methods that are computationally intensive and highly problem specific. We propose two innovations to provide significant improvement to inversion: First, modern classifier-based data reduction, to prepare data for the second innovation, Kriging methods for a generalized NDE inversion approach. Experimental data and/or modeled data can be used to define known points in a multi-dimensional solution space, and Kriging methods can provide efficient interpolation in this space to invert new NDE data. TRI/Austin, AeroMatter, and Computational Tools are teaming to develop and demonstrate inversion of ultrasonic NDE on composite structures for quantitative damage assessment. The proposed innovations to be provided are:1. Combined use of experiment and model data for developing the known solution points.2. Dimensional reduction of the data for efficient inversion using state of the art classifier techniques.3. Kriging methods for interpolation of new NDE data in the solution space.4. High performance computing (HPC) technologies to speed data reduction and Kriging results.The significance of the innovations are that this approach offers an ability to invert NDE data using known or truth data from experiment and/or models, and is readily adapted to high performance computing technologies for practical use.The NDEInverter will work with the rest of the tools in TRI/Austin's NDEToolbox. NDEToolbox serves as a foundational, evolving platform for the management and analysis of NDE data, interaction with NDE models, and risk / reliability prediction.","The two main categories of NASA applications are in support of in house R&D, and in the inspection of structures for NASA applications by NASA or its suppliers. The NDEInverter software will provide a set of tools or workbox enabling the power user to setup an inversion solver for a problem of interest. One can envision using development specimens, calibration specimens, and forward models to populate a ""truth"" table for the specific problem of interest. This would be followed by a defined process for data reduction using classifier and GLM techniques contained in the NDEInverter software using the available open source libraries. Finally, new data would be input to the software, and the Kriging algorithm from AeroMatter would be executed seamlessly.  For low rate or one-off production, or R&D applications typical of NASA use this will be a less formal process, and many options or even source code in Python may be exposed. In a higher rate production environment this may be sold as a software as a service model, with an initial investment in the setup of the specifics for the problem, followed by a license or even a pay as you go model using cloud services to take full advantage of HPC. We do anticipate the NDEInverter would be one of the family of tools in the TRI/Austin NDEToolbox software.","The inversion software has direct applicability to commercial and military aerospace manufacturers who build and inspect large composite structures with stringent defect requirements. Even sub-rejectable defects are of interest in production as they are often indicative of a process variation issue, and better characterization of defects allows better response by the production team.  After parts are manufactured, defective parts that are expensive are referred to a materials or manufacturing review board (MRB) for disposition. These decisions could be made better with improved understanding of the characteristics of a defect.Finally, components are inspected inservice. Similar to the MRB problem, better inspection and repair/or replacement decisions can be made by improved characterization of defects.TRI/Austin has an excellent record of SBIR transition success and works to begin the transition to market early on in the SBIR effort. Recently, TRI/Austin was awarded a Tibbetts award, which honors a small number of SBIR/STTR program participants and supports that have created a significant economic or social impact through the use of SBIR/STTR funding.",Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Simulation & Modeling,NDE Simulation and Analysis   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

A variety of research studies funded by NASA, DOE and NOAA to measure the fluxes of CO2 from average conditions have been performed. In particular, flux measurements of CO2 in the boundary layer are critical toward understanding the carbon budget for this important greenhouse gas. The World Meteorological Organization has met its goal of 0.1 ppm CO2 accuracy for land based field sensors with gas chromatography and non-dispersive infrared instruments. However, these instruments are poorly suited for small aerial platforms because of their high power requirements, large size and/or weight specifications. This proposal directly addresses NASA's need for high accuracy, small aerial platform, CO2 instrumentation for their Sierra and Dragon Eye UAVs, other unmanned aircraft such as launched and tethered balloons, and  remote, unattended ground platforms where low power, compactness and self calibration are important. This instruments fits in with NASA's Technology Roadmap for satellite validation under the ASCENDS program and the OCO-2 mission, as well as independent high resolution, non-integrated CO2 profiles. To address this instrumentation need, Southwest Sciences proposes to develop a compact (< 1 L), low power (< 2 watts), light weight (~1kg) diode laser based instrument designed to achieve dry-air corrected, high accuracy measurements of CO2.  We will target NASA's desired accuracy of 1 ppm CO2 (~1 part in 400) or better in 1 second or less using wavelength modulation spectroscopy in the 2.7 micron CO2 absorption band.",High accuracy CO2 instruments for small aerial platform use would bridge the gap between current land based and satellite platforms.  NASA would have a new tool to make high accuracy mixing ratio measurements in challenging environments where manned airborne observations are risky (i.e. North Slope of Alaska).,"A direct commercial application of this project is the sale of research and environmental monitoring instrumentation to academic researchers, government agencies for large research and monitoring programs, and commercial entities for regulatory monitoring applications. Although this proposal specifically targets small aerial platforms, the final product will be appropriate after minor adaptation, as a rack mount and even as a hand held ultra portable instrument.

The primary objectives are:1.Determination of a set of subsystems commonly employed by UAS whose failure would cause a system critical issue. 2.The identification of a set of sensors and machine learning algorithms capable of providing the necessary inputs to detect the health and status of its associated subsystem, and determining the probability of a fault occurring in the near future.3.The design of a monitoring node capable of interfacing to the required set of sensors and implementing the machine learning algorithms.  The nodes will also be limited to a size and weight that will allow for them to be installed on most UAS without impacting the vehicle's performance.4.The design of an onboard network capable of supporting communications between all smart monitoring nodes on the aircraft.  Each node can then communicate any potential failures to the autopilot and/or operator as well as share information that will allow for the implementation of distributed machine learning algorithms between the nodes and recognition of cross-correlation between systems.","The small size and modularity of the proposed system allows for integration into many UAS missions flown or funded by NASA. Automated warnings and actions during flight will reduce the need for expert operators to be able to deal with these contingencies. Over the past several years BST has operated UAS for scientists (both at NASA and NOAA) for scientific field campaigns including severe storm measurements and satellite calibration missions with various sensors. It is the goal of this technology to remove the need for expert UAS operators, and allow scientists to directly conduct these field campaigns without sacrificing safety. Achieving this will allow wider adoption by NASA personnel since this will reduce the reduce costs and stress on scheduling flight crews.NASA has a history of conducting new and difficult missions with UAS in challenging environments such as the Arctic The proposed system will be designed in such a way to extend the monitoring capabilities to new types of missions and reduce flight risks. One example of this sort of new capability is the plan to extend the technology in Phase II and beyond for the detection of aircraft icing using machine learning approaches that try and predict icing by looking at environmental conditions combined with reductions in aircraft performance. This type of capability can then be employed in even smaller UAS than usual allowing more flight campaigns that will help increase the market for NASA Earth Science missions.","BST is excited about the potential of this technology for the commercial side of our UAS business. BST's commercial UAS are primarily used to generate 3D point clouds and orthomosaic imagery. Up until now BST has focused on ease of use and intuitive control from an Android tablet to lower the barrier of entry for operators. This is important especially for small businesses that do not have the resources to hire full time UAS pilots, but can greatly benefit from this technology in their day to day business. BST aims to utilize the proposed technology to further lower the barrier of entry and reduce the risk of mission failure.By making the UAS more reliable by both reducing the chances of failure from inconsistent maintenance and better dealing with in flight anomalies, new types of missions and sensing packages will become possible. Commercial customers will be able to begin using more expensive sensors with less fear of crashing. This capability will also be one important aspect in allowing beyond visual line of sight operations. Certain markets will eventually need this capability to grow to their potential; specifically pipeline monitoring and higher altitude missions for atmospheric science. BST has operated demo missions for NOAA that really will only have long term value if allowed to operate much beyond the current limitations of 400 ft AGL. Pipeline inspection with UAS is much more valuable with beyond line of sight operations.",Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Characterization; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Lifetime Testing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling,Vehicle Safety- Internal Situational Awareness and Response   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This shielding typically comprises over 35% of the power system mass.  We propose to develop ultra-radiation-hardened power conversion technology to reduce shielding requirements for the converter and electronics so the large central shadow shield can be reduced or eliminated, in favor of smaller localized shields positioned to protect specific items that are sensitive.  This work has great potential to reduce overall system mass significantly for Kilopower, Nuclear Electric Power (NEP), and Surface Power missions being considered by NASA.  Consequently, these missions will become more practical and affordable to execute.  Although we plan to focus on Brayton converters and electronics, the results will also apply to Stirling converters and their electronics.  Creare is well-suited to succeed because we have a long history developing turbo-Brayton systems and radiation-hardened electronics for spaceflight applications.  During the Phase I project, we will develop converter and electronics designs with radiation-hardened features, we will specify conceptual mission details, and we will optimize shielding mass.  We will then fabricate and test prototype hardware during the Phase II project.","There are many NASA uses for the proposed technology.  It can be applied to emerging Kilopower, Nuclear Electric Power, Surface Power, and Radioisotope Power missions.  Although we will focus on Brayton systems, our results will be broadly applicable to Stirling systems as well.  Additionally, there is an ever present need for radiation hardened electronics to support all space missions and payloads.  In particular, extreme radiation tolerance is important for environments with high background radiation, such as those found in the Jovian orbital system.","Our radiation hardened technology is also ideal for many non NASA applications.  For example, military and commercial satellites for surveillance and communication all require radiation hardened electronics.  Power systems for nuclear submarines and surface vessels could also benefit from our work.  Creare would also like to strengthen its presence providing equipment for particle accelerators that support high energy physics experiments, which also require radiation hardened features.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Conversion",Surface Power Generation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This work is aimed at meeting the aerospace industrys need for economically viable array technology that meets required metrics.","The proposed instrumentation technology has the potential to be transportable across multiple NASA facility classes as well as implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities.  The target application for entry into NASA ATP is as wind tunnel instrumentation for phased-array beamforming to enable noise source localization.

NES has demonstrated and is building a 1 kW TAPS for use in remote power applications where reliability for 15+ years is of paramount importance.  Moreover, NES is developing the Thermoacoustic Radioisotope Generator (TRG), a 300 W Radioisotope Power System (RPS), under the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program for NASA based on TAPS technology. The novel TAPS technology has no hot moving parts and incorporates well proven, reliable linear motors and alternators in an engine based on the Stirling cycle.  NES has designed, optimized, built and tested all sub-systems for reliability, ease of manufacturing and cost reduction over currently available Stirling engines.  The TRG is a 300 W tunable power thermoacoustic device which is insensitive to radioisotope heat degradation, capable of 20+ years continuous operation, is inexpensive to manufacture using well established methods, and yields greater than 25% thermal to electrical efficiency all while being designed for a convertor specific power greater than 30 W/kg and anticipated system specific power near 10 W/kg. The TRG will serve as the foundation for the Linear Acoustic Nuclear Conversion Engine (LANCE), which will satisfy all of the Z1.03 solicitation requirements, as a robust and redundant 10 kW tunable power supply, representing the ultimate in remote power devices and the next step in reliable dynamic power conversion for space.","The primary goal of LANCE is to develop a thermal-to-electrical power conversion system that produces 10 kW of net electrical output, has >25% efficiency, and durability for a lifetime of greater than 10 years.  Due to the significant manufacturing and assemble cost reductions afforded by the TAPS architecture over traditional free piston Stirling systems the TAPS solution could be used as a direct replacement over traditional thermoelectric or other Stirling based systems in future space missions. Future NASA missions would benefit greatly from the cost-reductions afforded by the TAPS system as well as its modularity and relative ease of assembly.Furthermore, the TAPS technology enables architectures that are difficult, or impossible with other systems. Specifically, TAPS can easily be utilized for a combined power and cooling duplex, and some preliminary designs have been created. Such systems would enable a sustained presence in extreme planetary environments such as the surface of Venus.","Nirvana Energy Systems is currently working to commercialize the NASA technology through an exclusive patent license granted for the Alpha-STREAM technology that the TAPS technology is partially based on. The NES TAPS technology could be easily adapted to home use where high efficiencies are possible and the unit would function as a micro-Combined Heating and Power system.  In an installation such as this the TAPS unit could be natural gas fed, where to achieve overall high system efficiencies the unit would utilize excess heat to provide heated water for potable needs or for hydroponic heating. Excess electrical energy production would be sent to the grid.Similar to applications for home power generation, other applications include commercial businesses, military uses (vehicles and domesticated areas), and the transportation industry. In particular, these industries desire higher electrical outputs and efficiencies but with long-term reliability and cost of ownership being of critical importance as well. The TAPS architecture would be able to provide all of these as it is a ""set and forget"" power generation system capable of tunable output powers at high efficiencies. Moreover, the reverse cycle of the TAPS system could be used for cooling in many cases, including as a refrigerant free domestic cooling system.",Conversion; Generation,Surface Power Generation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Humanetics Corporation (Humanetics) is developing a novel radioprotectant, BIO 300, for use in both clinical radiotherapy and as a radiation countermeasure. BIO 300 is a safe, shelf-stable pharmaceutical which has been shown to mitigate both the acute and delayed effects of radiation exposure. BIO 300 is in advanced stages of clinical development, and is currently being evaluated as a radioprotectant of healthy lung tissue during radiotherapy treatment for non-small cell lung cancer in a Phase I/II trial.  One component of developing radioprotectants for space is understanding if the therapy can protect against broad-spectrums of ionizing radiation, rather than just man-made X-Rays.  Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine BIO 300's radioprotective capabilities against mission-relevant doses of neutron/gamma mixed-fields of radiation.  Another component of the work proposed here, is to utilize a novel cellular platform of terminally differentiated human cardiomyocytes to investigate degenerative consequences of radiation exposure in a functional human tissue model. Together, these studies will validate the utility of BIO 300 as a countermeasure for extraterrestrial radiation exposures.","BIO 300 is intended as a broadly utilized radioprotectant therapy to mitigate the cellular and biological consequences of radiation exposure. In our Phase I/II clinical trial, 7 patients have taken BIO 300 daily for 8 weeks, while undergoing daily fractionated radiation doses of 2Gy, for a total cumulative dose of 60 Gy.  Thus, we suggest that BIO 300 could be taken daily for the entire duration of a mission.  Yet as chronic dosing for multiple astronauts may become weight limiting (with respect to amount of drug required to be put on a rocket) we also have data suggesting that BIO 300 can be taken acutely (in 1-3 doses) to mitigate larger radiation events, such as Solar Particle Events.  As these events can constitute a large percentage of the total radiation dose over the mission, BIO 300 could be administered intermittently to mitigate these larger exposure radiological events.","Humanetics is aggressively pursuing multiple modes of radioprotection interests for Earth applications. Our interest in the protection of normal tissue during clinical radiotherapy has manifested itself into a clinical trial in lung cancer patients receiving fractionated radiotherapy.  Secondly, in preclinical studies, BIO 300 has been shown to mitigate radiation-induced erectile dysfunction following prostate radiation. Hence, a clinical trial in prostate cancer patients is planned to evaluate BIO 300?s ability to prevent radiation-induced erectile dysfunction. Finally, BIO 300 is being developed as a low-dose radioprotectant.  For example, there is significant evidence that medical imaging techniques (e.g. CT Scans) which rely on ionizing radiation can pose significant risks, especially in younger patients and those subjected to multiple scans.  For example, some traumatic brain injury patients will receive 20 to 50 brain CTs in a single year.

Current solutions do not meet NASAs goals for sensitivity, timing resolution, and data rate.  Furthermore, many of the current solutions require cryocooling, which significantly impacts size, weight, and power, as well as reliability.  LightSpin Technologies proposes the development of a new generation of single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array devices to fulfill NASA requirements.  The innovation includes a new planar processing technology, enabling tight pitch SPAD arrays to be built, mitigating after pulsing and dead time limitations.  Furthermore, we propose to use InAlAs gain regions, which have significant advantages due to its avalanche breakdown characteristics and wider band gap compared to InP.  The net result at the end of Phase II will be a Photomultiplier Chip SPAD array device incorporating thousands of small area SPAD devices in parallel, enabling precision detection of single photons with sub 100 picosecond timing resolution and maximum count rates in excess of 10 Gcps.","Successful completion of this SBIR project will result in the development of a InAlAs-InGaAs Photomultiplier Chip with performance that far exceeds the state-of-the-art, particularly with respect to single photon sensitivity, dark count rate, timing resolution, and dynamic range.  Furthermore, this will be achievable using only modest cooling (200 K operation anticipated), greatly reducing size, weight, and power.  We envision a quadrant detector module suitable for both tracking and long range optical communications at 1550 nm.  This receiver can be used for both ground based and space based platforms, enabling a broad network of optical communications links to be developed.  In addition to deep space optical communications, the technology has immediate application to a range of NASA applications, including laser ranging (ladar, altimetry, mapping) and remote sensing (lidar).]Beyond the immediate scope of the proposed Phase I-Phase II project include imaging applications using either a single SPAD element per imaging pixel as well as a small SPAD array (array-of-arrays) per imaging pixel.  Imaging arrays can greatly enhance remote sensing applications, including flash ladar for hazard warning, navigation, and docking.","Beyond NASA specific commercial applications, a wide range of commercial applications are directly enabled.  These include free space optical communications, including satellite data links and military communications applications, as well as quantum secure communications and quantum computing.Remote sensing is a particularly attractive commercial application, given the compatibility with eye-safe lasers.  Autonomous vehicles are expected to rapidly gain market share, due in large part to the availability of sensors such as lidar.  Currently, many of these lidar systems operate at wavelengths of 800 -- 1100 nm, which are not considered eye-safe.  This means that these systems must use attenuated laser beams to prevent eye damage, and therefore have range, spatial resolution, and frame rate limitations.  Extending these systems to eyes-safe wavelengths has the potential to greatly improve range, spatial resolution and frame rate.

Box 1092, Barnstable, MA 02630 - 1105",(508) 362-9400,1,3,"Remote Sensing Solutions (RSS) proposes to fill a critical niche in Entry, Descent, and Landing with the design and subsequent development of a terrain relative radar altimeter/velocimeter in support of missions to planetary bodies.  This sensor, similar to that of the successful Mars Science Laboratory's  Terminal Descent Sensor  (MSL-TDS) will 1) expand the  range of operation over that of the MSL-TDS and 2) mitigate  identified risks due to dust and anomalously low backscatter areas.  We will achieve this in part by establishing a Ku-band TDS design.  In Phase 1 we will explore compact multi-beam shared aperture antenna designs and system trades to minimize antenna aperture size.  In addition, the design approach for the system back-end electronics will be modular, compact, reproducible, and highly versatile.  Utilizing RSS' novel, modular reconfigurable digital subsystem will enable us to produce reconfigurable architectures and pulse-timing/geometry.  Such a solution is independent of the eventual transmit frequency of operation.  As such, Ka-band or even W-band sensors could be produced based on this design for landing scenarios where velocity accuracy or size is a premium, and dust or airborne particulates are not a concern.The Phase 1 will establish a design that not only meets the stated MSL-TDS requirements but exceeds them in terms of sensitivity and range of altitudes of operation.  We will simulate the sensor capability over the full range of altitude, velocity, and backscatter ranges. A path for demonstration and space-qualification of critical subsystems and components will be evaluated.  At the termination of the Phase 1 we will have a design with of the Ku-band TDS, recommendations for a prototype in the Phase 2, a system weight and power estimate and a path-to-space.","Every major landing mission since Surveyor has used radar as the key component for delivering range and velocity information. The JPL TDS proved highly successful but was not designed to be reproducible. It may be possible to reconstruct the TDS out of spare parts from the original mission for the 2020 mission to MARS, but this approach will be expensive and for further missions is likely cost prohibitive, as well as size prohibitive for smaller class missions.  A reproducible, low-cost landing radar system would fill an immediate need for upcoming landing missions, including Discovery class through flagship concepts like a Europa lander, and Ku-band would be appropriate for all solar-system bodies, including lunar landing, due to its ability to operate independent of sun illumination, lack of need for coherent surface features (required for an incoherent imaging system to measure horizontal velocity), and far superior performance compared to lidar in the presence of dust and other particulates.  Such a sensor thus solves a key, critical long term NASA need post-Mars2020, enabling numerous classes of planned and future robotic and crewed missions.","The Federal Aviation Administration released its 2016 report on commercial space transportation. They reported the global space industry in 2015 was approximately $324B. Countries, like China, are expanding their programs and the industry is expected to grow. Within this industry, the sector related to launch services was approximately $6B. In this decade, what had been primarily an activity limited to a small sector, mainly governments, has seen the growth of private industry. New companies, such as Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy platforms, are offering competitive capabilities at lower costs. Other companies, like   Arianespace, have offered launch services for decades. Still other companies, such Rocket Lab and Virgin Galactic are expected to offer new platforms. As cost to space becomes lower and more companies enter, there are several efforts to develop reusable launch vehicles. One example is Blue Origins' new Shepard vehicle that demonstrated successful vertical landing capabilities after ascending 100.5 km.  A key technology will be a cost effective, reconfigurable landing system for these platforms. In addition to Earth returning launches, the United States, European, China and other governments are planning missions to the Moon, Mars and other planets and bodies. A space qualified Ku-band landing system would have immediate applicability to these efforts.","Air Transportation & Safety; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Command & Control; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Navigation & Guidance; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Radiometric; Ranging/Tracking","Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing and Small Body Proximity Operation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The radiometer instrumentation installed on CubeSats and SmallSats is required to have small volume, low weight and consume low power. Currently used correlating radiometers rely on analog signal processing, thus are bulky, power hungry and cannot be reprogrammed. Analog filter parameters tend to be unstable over temperature, power supply voltage, may degrade over time and need tuning.The proposed low-power, rad-hard ASIC will operate with microwave correlation radiometer front ends down-converting the RF to up to 10GHz IF quadrature signals. The ASIC will include digitizers, bandpass filters, cross-correlators, totalizers, serializers, an output data interface and an I2C interface for the ASIC's programming. Bandpass filters will split up the digitized quadrature IF input signals into bands (up to 16), will cross-correlate the signals within each band and will ship out the resultant data in a convenient format. Instead of analog signal processing performing a strictly defined function, the ASIC will employ a digital signal processing which can be reprogrammed to adopt specific parameters of the filter block such as the number of bands, each filter's corner frequency, bandwidth and filter's order. A number of innovations will be introduced to the ASIC in order to combine programmability, low power consumption and radiation tolerance. The project's Phase I will provide the proof of feasibility of implementing the proposed ASIC. Phase II will include finishing the design, chip fabrication, testing and delivering the ADC prototypes which will be ready for commercialization in Phase III.","The proposed correlation radiometer back end ASIC combining signal normalization, digitizing, programmable digital band-pass filtering and cross-correlation functions will greatly reduce the size, complexity, power consumption and reliability of radiometer instruments. These radiometers are required for current and future NASA's passive remote sensing instruments within Earth, planet and sun exploration missions. In addition, the proposed ASIC can find application in radiometers required for radio astronomy for measurements of the properties of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSM) including Constellations, Formation Flying missions, or Fractionated missions using CubeSats or SmallSats require precise position synchronization between satellites which can be implemented by using correlation radiometers tracking a common radiation source.","In addition to its primary application in the NASA's correlation radiometry systems, the proposed ASIC will be targeting other commercial and military related systems which require small size, low power,radiation hardened radiometers. Commercial applications include radiometers employed on communication, remote sensing and navigation satellites. With the deployment of small size satellites compact radiometer based positioning is essential as well as it is crucial for swarms of satellites that have to maintain certain formation. Possible military applications include satellites used for communication and surveillance. Another area of application includes synthetic aperture radar receiver modules. In case of Environmental protection agency (EPA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), both space and ground based remote sensing instruments require high precision radiometers for temperature, water vapor, pollutant, ozone and other exploration. Radiometers used for thermal imaging in security systems is yet another area for application of the proposed ASIC.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Infrared; Microwave; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Radio; Radiometric; Terahertz (Sub-millimeter)",Technologies for Passive Microwave Remote Sensing   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The system will be based on a semiconductor laser locked to a monolithic microcavity using self injection locking technique. This technique results in a complete suppression of mode hops in the laser during its operational lifetime. The microcavity will not only stabilize the frequency of the laser, but will also be used to measure and stabilize the power of the laser. Furthermore, the microcavity provides a modulatable laser that features exceptionally low residual amplitude modulation, allowing a robust lock to the clock transition of interest.   The laser is intended as an optical local oscillator (LO) suitable for Yb+ ion clock. The LO will include a semiconductor diode laser stabilized to a millimeter scale monolithic reference resonator. The reference resonator is a high quality factor (Q) and narrow-linewidth dielectric whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator that is thermally compensated to produce a vanishingly small temperature coefficient. The LO will deliver the same performance as the best existing high-end laboratory Fabry-Perot resonator-based LOs--which are large, expensive, and fragile table-mounted instruments--but in a robust, 100 cc volume module that is inexpensive and consumes small power.","The laser has commercial value as a part of optical Yb+ clock system. Timekeeping in commercial GPS satellites, national time references, and national power grids may benefit significantly from the clocks created using the laser.  In addition, critical enhancements for advanced synchronous wireline and wireless communication smart networks from the core to the edges may be realized.  Among others are academic research, test and measurement, and metrology applications. For example, high performance atomic frequency standards and clocks have been always an integral part of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN), responsible for communication, navigation, tracking, as well as related sciences. The performance attributes of atomic frequency references and clocks are stability and accuracy. For most applications, particularly in a two-way link architecture, only stability is required. For greater autonomy and strict one-way navigation system, an accurate clock (i.e. one with a precisely known rate) will be beneficial, as it does not need calibration. Aside from DSN applications, precision frequency standards are used for a wide spectrum of NASA space-based science experiments in astrophysics, planetary physics, space science, Earth science, and tests of fundamental physics.","The laser source will be the best product available for applications requiring tunable ultra-high spectral purity in the C- and L-band ranges and beyond.  The laser source's combination of high agility, small size, robust packaging, superior spectral noise characteristics, and lower cost of production will beat the foreseeable competition across all performance specifications.

Ongoing NASA (and other space agencies e.g. ESA, ISA, JAXA) missions provide an enormous volume of free data that can deliver information at the appropriate temporal and spatial resolution for flood disaster management and emergency response spanning the natural process of a flood event from ""clouds to inundation"" or ""mitigation to response"". However, information is under-utilized by response teams, mostly because of its relative novelty and unintuitive access: (1)difficulties in obtaining information within the timeframe for mitigation, preparedness, response/recovery, (2)confusion as to the most appropriate data assets for a flood situation, (3)limited time and personnel capacity to process and handle new types of datasets; (4)limited bandwidth for large file sharing capacity in deep-field environments (5)incompatibility between user mapping platforms and geospatial data formats; (6)data availability may be simply unknown and/or data latency may be inadequate; and (5) limited understanding by scientists and engineers about end user operational requirements. This problem was discussed by emergency, science academic, and private sector experts during a workshop on ""Flood Response"" in June 2016. The top priority action item agreed upon was the need to build a ""one-stop-shop"" online GUI that was built on OGC standards and had a number of end-user guided ""wish items"", such as depicting and predicting extent and location of impact area for data acquisition tasking.In order to address these needs, we propose to deliver flood-related NASA and other geospatial data layers to flood emergency managers and responders in an easily accessible format using an online Decision Support System that will integrate with end-user operation systems and provide relevant, timely information.","NASA's Earth Science infrastructure exists in a landscape of data systems that contain valuable remotely sensed analysis and modeled information.

This is in accordance with NASA's Applied Science Program to support its contributions to Action 2 of the National Plan for Civil Earth Observations to ""Improve Data Access, Management, and Interoperability"". In this proposal, RSS would augment current efforts by including the newly launched GPM and SMAP data layers from NASA data centers into the proposed decision support system, thereby enhancing ongoing NASA ROSES project deliverables that plan to make NASA MODIS and Landsat flood maps and global flood model simulations easily accessible through data distribution platforms, such as the Dartmouth Flood Observatory and Google's Earth Engine. Such data layers will provide a seamless overlay and create a multi-layer flood event hazard chain ranging from a flood driver layer (GPM) through flood onset layers (SMAP) to flood event hazard layers (from NRT MODIS combined with flood model maps) and flood predictions (UMD's Global Flood Monitoring System). This SBIR DSS project would also use mature technologies that leverage current NASA data system capabilities thereby increasing the efficiency for decision-makers and enabling new users to benefit from EO data.","Non-NASA applications are numerous. It is anticipated that the proposed DSS for flood disasters will be used by national and international agencies, development aid organizations, local and regional authorities as well as scientists and academics. To this end, we will work with a number of different decision-makers from the onset of Phase I. Most of the selected end-users (FEMA, USGS, NGA, DFO, UMD, StormCenter Communications Inc., CSR, JPL, World Bank, UN WFP, CEOS, LIST, LA DOT) were participants of the June Flood Response workshop (organized by PI Dr. Schumann). At the workshop, this new Community of Practice agreed to collaborate and support ongoing as well as newly proposed flood response activities and efforts such as the DSS proposed here. This ""collective awareness"" of needs, challenges and requirements will form the basis of the design, development and implementation of the proposed DSS.The team also expects this system to be used by scientists and academics active in flood science and hydrology in general. The proposed ""one-stop-shop"" for flood disaster response will ingest data from many non-NASA operational and research organizations such as USGS, NOAA, ECMWF, JRC and other space agencies, that are active in flood mapping, modeling and forecasting.",Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Display; Image Processing; Knowledge Management,Earth Science Applied Research and Decision Support   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The modem will be suitable for use in both space-to-ground and inter-satellite links. Unlike fiber-optic telecommunication modems, this modem is specifically adapted to the highly dynamic nature of space optical links. Moreover, a software-defined approach leads to an adaptive and cognitive optical modem, that optimizes link BER (bit-error-rate) performance, compared to a fixed-point design  of large-SWaP space optical modems used in recent and planned space optical communication demonstrator missions. Protocols originally developed for RF/wireless fading channels have been be optimized and extended to  terrestrial free-space-optical (FSO) modems, that have high scintillation and fading. The objective of this program is to further optimize and validate such algorithms and protocols for space optical links. Fibertek's focus will be on small-form-factor hardware implementation of such adaptive and cognitive FSO modem, compatible with a space-qualified roadmap, which can be integrated with ongoing CubeSat and SmallSat optical communication payload for demonstrator missions with Fibertek's end customers.","Potential NASA missions include the NASA ILLUMA program, NASA Earth-imaging Hyper-spectral missions needing high-data-rate download, NASA technology demonstrator programs for LEO constellations, and an independent optical data link for ISS.","Fibertek is currently engaged in building and delivering optical terminals for a commercial customer.

Simple, passive thermal control in which excess heat is radiated to space via blackbody radiators used to be adequate, however, as spacecraft power levels increase and mission environments become more complex, more flexible and capable thermal control systems and mechanisms are needed. Variable heat rejection is an enabling technology to reliably vary heat rejection during human and robotic spaceflight missions with wide variation in thermal environments & vehicle heat loads. Quest Thermal Group is proposing a novel Variable Gas-Conductor Radiator (VGCR) that uses variable gas conduction within an IMLI structure to control heat conduction.   A VGCR could provide both high and very low heat rejection, operating as both effective radiators and high performance insulation, and capable of turndown ratios of 76:1.  The NASA 2012 TA14 Thermal Management Roadmap stated radiator advancement is perhaps the most critical thermal technology development for future spacecraft and space-based systems. NASA is seeking unique solutions for thermal control technology providing low mass highly reliable thermal control systems.  As NASA moves beyond LEO, spacecraft must accommodate various mission scenarios and need variable heat rejection. Current state of the art variable radiators offer heat rejection turn-down ratios up to about 4:1.  Phase I goals are to develop a new variable spacecraft radiator that can simply and efficiently provide a highly variable heat rejection using variable gas conduction within IMLI insulation, and prove feasibility of the VGCR concept to help improve radiator capabilities for future NASA and commercial spacecraft. A VGCR prototype will be modeled, designed, built and tested for thermal performance and variable heat rejection.","NASA's Thermal Management Roadmap emphasizes the need for variable heat rejection. As NASA moves beyond LEO, exploration vehicles and space instruments must accommodate various mission scenarios, operating in environments from full sun to deep space, managing a wide range of heat rejection. Variable radiators are needed that can be turned down to low heat flux in cold environments. Current state of the art turndown ratios are 4:1, NASA's goal is 6:1, and Quest's Variable Gas-Conductance Radiator (VGCR) is modeled to have a turndown ratio of 76:1.Advances in heat rejection technologies could provide more capable thermal control across a wider range of thermal environments and heat loads. Variable radiators offer substantial system-wide benefits, including lower power requirements to maintain spacecraft temperatures in cold environments. Variable radiators are an important enabling technology needed for NASA's future exploration and science missions. It is needed for NASA Design Reference Missions 8 & 9, which are crewed missions to Mars. Both NASA Science and Space Technology Mission Directorates are seeking new technology.  VGCR technology, if proven successful, could be infused into future NASA spacecraft, including manned spacecraft, robotic exploration vehicles, Earth observing satellites, science and interplanetary spacecraft. VGSR could help NASA meet needs for improved spacecraft thermal control for various spacecraft and mission environments.","All commercial satellites require thermal control systems.  The purpose of the thermal control system is to maintain the spacecraft or satellite within allowable temperature limits for all thermal environments it operates in. Spacecraft and related equipment (such as electronics or optics/sensors) require some level of thermal control, and the design approach and technologies employed vary widely depending on application.  As spacecraft power levels increase and mission environments become more complex, more flexible and capable thermal control systems and mechanisms are needed.A new, advanced, low mass, highly variable radiator would be of interest to satellite manufacturers, and once proven out and tested, could be fairly rapidly adopted and incorporated into new satellite thermal control systems.New satellites are being built and launched at an increasing rate, there were 285 large satellites launched in 2014. Many of these new spacecraft are high power requiring good thermal control and heat rejection capability.The target markets for VGCR technology are satellites and spacecraft.  This includes future NASA spacecraft and commercial satellites, including those for communications, Earth observing and remote sensing, Defense, science, navigation, Earth imaging and meteorology.

This represents a novel approach to rapid, high sensitivity sensors and is based upon noncovalent derivatization (NCD). The sensor will consist of a two-dimensional cocrystal film of a hydrazine-interacting molecule and a color-forming molecule. When bound within the crystal, the color-former is not colored, but when the crystal liquefies, the color-former takes on color. The uncolored crystal is maintained just below its phase transition temperature. When hydrazine interacts with one of the hydrazine-interacting molecules, it causes a defect in the two-dimensional lattice. Because the composition is chosen near the crystal melting temperature, the crystal is entropically poised to melt. A local liquefication occurs, which spreads rapidly along crystal dislocations.The specific objectives are:1. To synthesize and prepare a set of bis-phthalimide derivatives for testing as hydrazine-interactive substrates.2. To test the set of bis-phthalimide derivatives as hydrazine-interactive substrates for hydrazine induced melting.a. To determine the best substrate.b. To determine the ideal operating temperature.c.

To design Phase II configuration.","WBI's hydrazine monitoring system is designed to meet NASA's mission goal for Environmental Monitoring, particularly for occupants of the ISS and subsequent extended space missions as well as  during fueling. Our system is designed to meet the requirements of: requiring no ground analysis, limited crew time, miniaturization, low power consumption, no need for calibration. Because of the nature of the sensing element, replacement is only necessary when an adverse hydrazine event occurs. The proposed device will provide a significantly more rapid warning of potential hydrazine danger than existing systems.","Hydrazine monitoring is a very significant problem faced by US industries.

This revolutionary process dramatically extends the economic and design advantages of additive manufacturing into areas where either tolerances or available homogeneous materials would otherwise be insufficient.The use of additive manufacturing has the ability to both reduce part count by enabling innovative designs and reduce design cycle time because of the direct connection between the computer generated geometry and the final part. In addition to expanding the range of possibility for part geometries, additive manufacturing is also unique in the property that the cost of manufacturing increases with the addition, not the removal, of material. Conventional machining is driven by the cost of the time required to remove material. This discrepancy often makes lightweight, minimalistic additive manufacturing designs cheaper than traditionally machined parts.  This conveys a significant advantage for aerospace parts where mass is at a premium.Unfortunately, these revolutionary manufacturing processes are still limited to homogenous powders. This limits their application to parts made from single materials, which, in turn, limits the components on which they can be used or else requires multi-piece assemblies.  Aerospace components often have very different temperature, stress, or material compatibility constraints on different regions of the same part or assembly.The proposed innovation offers a solution to these problems through an innovated method for joining parts into an additively manufactured parent part, creating a functional seal between the materials. This innovation will significantly advance the state of the art of additive manufacturing technology, not only for thrusters and in-space components, but for aerospace and general mechanical parts as well.","The proposed additive manufacturing technology provides significant benefit to a wide range of NASA programs including propulsion, satellite structures, and fluid systems. The proposed technology promises to benefit a number of NASA missions that require high performance, low cost, innovative propulsion systems. This includes Mars sample return missions, asteroid redirect, and propulsion for any of a number of earth science mission satellites. The ability to include a conventionally machined part in additively manufactured products, include high temperature nozzle inserts, or include insulation into thruster walls, can both increase capabilities and lower cost for all of these programs.  Any NASA satellite program is a strong market for the proposed technology. The proposed innovation allows the use of low weight materials, such as aluminum, for an additively manufactured bulk part with high strength materials included into the printed structure at the sites of applied loads. The high strength material then distributes the load into the low weight part. This technology, when incorporated into satellite bus structures can lower weight, reduce cost, and enhance capability.  Satellite buses for deep space missions where propulsion requirements mean that mass and efficiency is highly important can especially benefit. Fluid components, such as valves and cavitating flow elements which are widely used across NASA programs can also leverage this promising technology.","Commercial satellite propulsion and and launch vehicles can benefit directly from the proposed innovation in much the same way as NASA programs. Innovative nozzle, injector, and thrust chamber designs can lower the cost of launch vehicles, decreasing the cost of access to space.

Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors have the potential to yield much more efficient power electronics than silicon, because their larger bandgaps allow them to withstand higher electric fields with less material, which also leads to lower system size and weight. While SiC and GaN are the two most technologically advanced WBG semiconductors, Ga2O3 is very promising and a new alternative. It has a larger bandgap (~4.8 eV) than either SiC (3.3 eV) and GaN (3.4 eV). Its large bandgap allows it to handle large electric fields, which in turn gives it a 4-10 times larger figure-of-merit than SiC and GaN for power devices. Ga2O3 has already been demonstrated in a variety of discrete electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as metal-semiconductor and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, and UV sensors. Despite its potential, few companies have explored the Ga2O3 for power electronics in the US. The Schottky diode proposed will be used as a rectifier in the power applications because of its low forward voltage drop leading to lower levels of power loss compared to ordinary PN junction diodes. The Schottky diode performance can far exceed that of other diodes in many areas due to its low turn on voltage, low junction capacitance and fast recovery time. The Phase I project will also include modeling of material and device design, and production costs to NASA for commercial implementation. During Phase II, we will build complete high power Ga2O3-based Schottky diode prototypes and test them under heavy ion and total dose radiation. We will demonstrate scale-up of the processing technology to the high power Ga2O3-based Schottky diode. We will also define the pathway to Phase III high volume production.","The high power Schottky diode developed in this SBIR Phase I/Phase II program program will support many future electronics that will be used in NASA missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond. The Schottky diodes are one of the key elements of NASA's Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) systems. Operating at higher voltages than the conventional Schottky diodes, the Ga2O3-based Schottky diode will improve the performance of the PMADs. The proposed Schottky diode will operate at high-power and high-voltage, which will also be tolerant to heavy ion radiation to be suitable for variety of NASA applications.","In addition to NASA mission needs, the SBIR team anticipates a variety of commercial applications for the high-power high-voltage Ga2O3-based Schottky diode. The unique properties of the Schottky diodes enable them to be used in many different types of circuit making applications where other diodes would not be able to provide the same level of performance.

ASTS will also demonstrate feasibility that we can customize the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the substrate material based upon increasing the percent SiC by weight in the AlSi10Mg base substrate. As we are able to select a specific SiC-to-AlSi10Mg ratio that has a CTE closest to an electrolytic nickel-plating CTE, we can reduce the risk of mirror degradation over time due to CTE mismatch-based stresses. For both beryllium and pure silicon carbide as a mirror substrate, the cost factor and risk is quite high from a schedule perspective due to both these materials being very hard and brittle. Therefore, machining anomalies is a much higher risk than other metal mirror substrate materials.  Our additive manufacturing development of SiC-AMC could be a game changer in reducing the fabrication cost and schedule risk for a mirror substrate.   Another key technical risk to address is the problem of smoothly and consistently applying the metal powderbed over the SLM build plate. We will demonstrate that we can eliminate practically all voids and porosity in the SiC-AMC by teaming with Plasma Processes, Inc. to create a spheroid SiC powder.  By this company developing the technique to produce a SiC-AMC powder product, which will allow ASTS to manage the SiC-to-AlSi10Mg ratio, we can assure a uniform SiC distribution within the aluminum base. Through this demonstration, great confidence can be obtained to continue material development in Phase II, establish additional SiC-AMC material properties at higher ratios of SiC, and develop weight efficient mirror substrate designs that meet NASA?s mission requirements.","We recognize that NASA, even as leaders in the application of AM across the aerospace industry, is likely to take a conservative approach to adopting flight-rated SLM components.  However, we do believe there are several near-term applications.  For example, additive manufactured mirrors using the techniques we will develop in Phase 1, can be directly applied to relatively small aperture mirrors that are launched on sounding rockets or on balloon missions.  Our current capabilities using the Concept Laser M2 are a direct fit for further development of mirror substrates to be used in infrared, ultraviolet, or optical applications. A good example is the optical lens associated with missions in NASA?s Medium Class Explorers (MIDEX) TESS mission or the Gondola for High Altitude Planetary Science (GHAPS).  In addition, continued mirror development and mounting schemes, we can see the development of larger segmented mirror development for launch on the future Space Launch System.","ASTS plans to develop processes and techniques using SLM on materials such as SS316L, Inconel 718, Ti6Al4V, and copper-based materials such as GrCop84 for use in rocket combustion devices.  In addition, we see the potential in the use of aluminum silicon based alloys, to be used as a structural casing/jacket over a combustion device.  By developing this material to have a near zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) or target a CTE to further augment the structural bond with a copper based combustion chamber operating at very high temperatures, we will also revolutionize the development of rocket engine technology to reduce cost for not only NASA, but also the DOD.  Not only that, but applications for optical in infrared mirrors could be developed as a low cost solution for utilization in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for a variety of functions such as in the agriculture industry for climate and soil moisture monitoring, and in the transportation industry for delivery products or packages to residential addresses.  Technological advances in mirror integration have developed in performance over traditional optical camera lenses.  Our development in SLM for mirror substrate fabrication should reduce the cost in mirror fabrication for such applications.","Ablative Propulsion; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Mirrors",Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

WOLFEChip uses cutting-edge laser micromachining to fabricate fully-three-dimensional optical elements that focus excitation laser light into a MCE microchannel to excite fluorescence. The fluorescence emission is collected using a heat-bonded lens on the backing layer. This improves on current and past implementations of MCE-LIF by (1) greatly miniaturizing the optical elements which comprise a significant amount of space in MCE-LIF systems; (2) making the entire LIF optical system monolithic and immune to misalignment which greatly enhances the vibration-resistance of the entire system; (3) making the system immune to operator-to-operator variations caused by the periodic need to carefully  align traditional MCE-LIF systems; and (4) greatly reducing measured stray light and thereby potentially increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MCE-LIF system by employing right-angle excitation/emission optical geometries and through the use of high-quality fluorescence-free fused silica.","As NASA looks forward to the coming decades, the Ocean Worlds of the outer solar system (e.g., Europa, Titan, Enceladus) as well as other smaller bodies (e.g., asteroids, comets) and rocky planets (e.g., Mars) will be primary targets for NASA exploration. For the detection of life, an unambiguous, highly-sensitive, definitive approach is required. MCE-LIF is an ideal technique for detecting life through by measuring the relative abundance and chirality of amino acids and other important biomarkers. Key benefits of MCE-LIF for space exploration include: (1) its levels of detection are orders-of-magnitude lower than more traditional high-TRL gas chromatography approaches; (2) the technique uses minute volumes of reagents; (3) the instrumentation inherently requires very little power and mass; and (4) MCE-LIF is highly-suitable for dealing with liquid samples. WOLFEChip will be a great stride towards further miniaturizing and ruggedizing MCE-LIF hardware for upcoming mission opportunities by fully integrating the LIF optics on-chip thereby reducing mass, size, and the need for mechanical stability/alignment of external optical systems to micro-scale features.","WOFLEChip has many uses outside of NASA. Due to its sensitivity, specificity, portability (both in terms of mass and ruggedness), and flexibility it can be used in many different situations including (1) environmental research of terrestrial and marine waters (e.g., detecting important biomarkers or nutrient sources); (2) process control and monitoring of closed water systems (e.g., Naval shipboard water monitoring, water treatment centers); (3) pharmaceutical research; (4) monitoring and identification of organic pollution in water, soils, and sediments (e.g., pesticides, fuels, drugs); (5) the detection of biological and chemical weapons.Advantages of WOLFEChip over existing electrophoresis technologies are its portability (enabled by its size and its rugged optofluidic implementation of LIF), resolution (MCE-LIF is inherently higher-resolution than CE due to the injected plug size), and operator-to-operator invariance (other MCE-LIF systems require an operator to manually align optics into a MCE chip, leading to LIF efficiencies varying based on the skill of the operator; WOLFEChip uses integrated optics to avoid this). In Phase III, LMT will seek to establish commercial relationships with vendors of MCE-LIF systems for marketing commercial-implementations of WOLFEChip to environmental scientists, water-quality monitoring authorities, and the United States Navy.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lenses; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Ocean Worlds Life Detection   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Arques Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 - 4521",(408) 636-2643,3,5,"Precision Navigation and Timing (PNT) is a critical resource for government and commercial aerospace. Given the high launch cost and shift toward smaller payloads, reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of space-based navigation systems is a critical need. Atom-interferometric inertial sensors have demonstrated superior performance over conventional inertial devices owing to the intrinsic stability of atomic systems.  Central to making cold atom sensors practical is their ability to reliably operate for extended periods without user intervention.Current laser diodes, which are at the heart of atomic sensors, suffer from power degradation and mode hops on timescales incompatible with long term deployment. Because these properties are inherent to the diodes, it is prudent to circumvent these problems with diagnostic protocols aimed at early detection and action. Diodes close to mode hopping can be temporarily taken offline to tune away the mode hop via current and temperature. Diodes with degraded power can be taken offline entirely in favor of a healthy diode. This approach will provide a robust, wavelength-agnostic technique to deliver reliable, long-lived laser sources at atom sensor-relevant wavelengths.  AOSense proposes to develop a cold atom laser module (CALM) capable of supporting a broad range of atomic sensors. Phase I will focus on addressing laser source reliability. We will identify and test and candidate laser diodes to identify optimal sources. In parallel, AOSense will develop protocols to identify potential diode failure and seamlessly switch to a healthy diode.  Development of the CALM laser module will result in a ruggedized and reliable laser source capable of autonomously driving an atom-based sensor within the space environment. Such an effort would enable space-based applications for atomic sensors such as IMUs, clocks, and magnetometers, opening up significant market opportunities in the defense and commercial sectors.","Frequency stabilized lasers are at the heart of atomic sensors and their robust operation will be required for any future NASA mission that relies upon an atomic sensor.  Atom interferometric sensors can be configured as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity sensors, magnetometers or precision time keeping devices.  In each case they are best-in-class sensors and have the potential to enable new missions and applications of interest to NASA.  Atom interferometers configured for gravity sensing can be used to map the earth's gravity gradient from orbit or to characterize the mass distribution of an asteroid for redirect missions.  Atomic magnetometers offer the potential for improved remote sensing of magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients and could be used for precise characterization and monitoring of magnetic fields from orbit.  Gyroscopes and accelerometers based on atom interferometry can provide orders of magnitude increases in inertial sensitivity which could lead to dramatic improvements in navigation and guidance systems.  Ultra-precise atomic based gravity sensors and optical clocks could provide new methods for detection of gravity waves and tests of general relativity.  Finally, robust frequency stabilized lasers are useful for non-atomic applications such as LiDAR and coherent laser communications.","Robust frequency stabilized lasers will also benefit the development of atomic sensors for non-NASA applications.  Atom interferometric sensors can be configured as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity sensors, magnetometers or precision time keeping devices and therefore can be applied to a wide range of military platforms in addition to commercial applications.  Precision navigation systems based on atom interferometric inertial sensors have the potential to provide precision positioning in environments where GPS signals are not available.  Atomic gravimeters and gravity gradient sensors can be used for geophysical exploration and homeland security applications.   Cold atom based frequency standards will ultimately replace the current generation of commercial cesium beam clocks that are widely used for timekeeping in a variety of systems.","Attitude Determination & Control; Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Navigation & Guidance; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Atomic Interferometry   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Furthermore, the panel stated, ??research on animal models will be constrained without the ability to manipulate the gravity variable as a factor modulating the fundamental processes underlying organ system homeostasis.? In response, Techshot has proposed to develop a Rodent Centrifuge Facility (RCF-QL) that utilizes four locker locations (Quad Locker) in the EXPRESS Rack for life science research. The counter-balanced centrifuge is designed to provide a facility to allow rats and mice to live and be observed in simulated gravity between 0-1 g for up to 90 days. The RCF-QL provides up to five cages. Each cage can accommodate at least six 30 gram mice, three 200 gram rats, or two 400 gram rats per cage. Each individual cage has ablib food and water, controllable lighting, and video monitoring. The habitat is temperature controlled with constant airflow throughout the cages. Air flow entraps waste in a filter that also treats the waste for bacteria and odor. Additional air filters will remove odors and ammonium from the animal enclosure. The subsystems design will minimize crew time. Each subsystem requiring change-out during the 90 day experiment will be designed to be simple and intuitive in operations. The RCF-QL will be the only facility capable of providing group housing for rats and mice, with a medium diameter centrifuge (20 in., 0.508 m) and a large rotating cage volume (1000 in3, 16,400 cm3 for the cage). All hardware cage features are designed to meet NIH animal care and use standards.","The Rodent Centrifuge Facility ? Quad Locker (RCF-QL) offers the largest diameter centrifuge research tool flown on ISS. The RCF-QL is a unique and powerful instrument for novel life and microgravity science research. Techshot?s initial targeted application of the proposed innovation is an offering of both the equipment and services associated with flight hardware and integration activities, which are highly desired by NASA-funded scientists as well as other governmental agencies. The RCF-QL will enhance NASA?s position in exploration research by allowing rodent experiments at, for example, Mars gravity ? a long-standing interest of NASA?s intramural and extramural gravitational physiology users. Its large cage geometry will allow the investigation of a variety of systems, biological and physical, with larger allowed volume than any other ISS centrifugal research device. Obviously the RCF-QL can provide 1-g control conditions for experiments in stationary hardware such as animal and plant habitats. The RCF-QL will have the additional advantage that Techshot is uniquely qualified to provide these space flight services, just as the company has done for PI?s on a variety of flight experiments for the past 27 years, including, for example, our Avian Development Facility (ADF). Techshot is also supporting future ISS experiments for NASA PI?s utilizing the Bone Densitometer flight hardware that Techshot developed and integrated in 2013-14.","Techshot sees tremendous potential commercial applications for the Rodent Centrifuge Facility ? Quad Locker (RCF-QL) in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies where life science research holds promise for cell replacement therapies for bioregenerative diseases. Techshot already has been in talks with U.S. biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies regarding long-term rodent research aboard the ISS. Furthermore, the company has begun to establish international connections with commercial entities in Canada, and most recently Brazil, where strong interest has been expressed in buying microgravity research tools and opportunities. Just as exciting, Techshot expects to commercialize the RCF-QL by incorporating it into the company's spaceflight service program it offers to other Government agencies like NIH, NSF, and DoD. In combination with the long list of other proven flight hardware developed by Techshot, the facility is expected to greatly expand the company's range of services.

Thus, the thruster is not significantly more massive than a standalone state-of-the-art chemical or electric thruster, but capable of either thrust mode and selectable as mission needs arise. This has several benefits, including the optimization of trajectories using both chemical and electric thrust manuevers as well as a significantly increased mission design space for a single propulsion unit. The propulsion system is capable of both high impulse per unit volume and high thrust per unit volume as the total impulse per unit volume is 1500 N-s/U in the chemical thrust mode and 2750 N-s/U in the electric thrust mode, where either type of manuever could be selected on-the-fly.The specific objectives for this study are to build a single microtube setup and feed system and test both the chemical monopropellant mode and electrospray mode with the same setup. This setup will allow verification of thruster models stemming from previous chemical mode tests, verify electrospray operation at lower flow rates than we have previously tested, and study the interactions in switching from the chemical mode to the electric mode and vice-versa with specific attention paid to potential life limiting mechanisms. As an additional part of this contract, we will work in parallel to investigate techniques required to manufacture multi-emitter arrays and conduct fluid flow and electrostatic simulations to further develop the preliminary thruster design.","Multi-mode propulsion fulfills NASA technology needs as outlined in the In-Space Propulsion Technology Roadmap, monopropellant microthrusters and electrospray thrusters, as well as fulfilling needs highlighted by the National Research Council, specifically the need for both chemical and non-chemical propulsion that fulfills the needs for high mobility micro-satellites and extremely fine pointing and positioning for certain astrophysics missions. Research has shown the benefits of multi-mode micropropulsion for NASA missions, including, more efficient small satellite formation flight, optimized attitude control, enhanced transfer rate and useful mass for Jovian missions, more favorable conditions for lunar impact, launch mass savings, and payload mass advantage to GEO.","Multi-mode micropropulsion has potential to meet Air Force needs for fractionated, composable, survivable, autonomous systems, i.e., satellites that can be assembled, tested, and launched within days of operational requirement.

These reusable technologies, already developed under a NASA contract, are also applicable to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and will provide a portable, faster-than-real-time test bed capable of dynamic analysis, fault injection, and automated testing, including Monte Carlo analysis.  This test bed, named Portable Virtual Aircraft Test System (PVATS), leverages TMC's existing virtualization and modeling technologies to create a virtual environment that includes a CPU instruction set emulator and modeled UAS components such as sensors and actuators, and which executes in an automated virtual machine.  The PVATS goals are to directly improve the timeliness and thoroughness of test and evaluation outcomes while reducing costs and increasing UAS flight software assurance.  The three targeted goals are 1) V&V of UAS flight software, 2) Assist UAS software development and early testing by providing many portable virtual test environments to developers, and 3) Training of UAS operators using a virtual environment.","The technologies described in this SBIR Phase I proposal are currently being applied to various NASA applications including dynamic testing, V&V, and mission training.

The core modeling and simulation technologies which are leveraged in these examples are available for use on this SBIR and are also applicable to unmanned (aircraft) system test beds. PVATS is directly applicable to complex unmanned systems requiring rigid software testing requirements, providing a portable environment for testing avionics and payload software early in the life-cycle.TMC's experience has shown that NASA hardware test beds, which usually incorporate extremely specialized hardware, are overscheduled and prone to downtime due to integration and hardware failures.

Furthermore, we propose to exploit an emerging highly efficient modulator technology which is well suited to photonic integration. The expected net result is a high performance measurement of microwave signals over large frequency ranges (e.g. 10 - 100+ GHz) with low size, weight, and power. The systems will be well suited for integration into spacecraft as only a simple phase modulator is required at the antenna since almost all of the measurement apparatus can be connected to the modulator via low loss, low weight, and electro-magnetic interference free optical fiber.","The proposed technology can be applied to microwave measurements in a wide variety of contexts including space vehicles. Common uses would be in radar, communications, and passive and active electromagnetic sensors. Such applications are commonly found in satellites and are used extensively by NASA for navigation, data transfer, remote sensing and atmospheric/climate science. The simplicity and low part count of the designs are useful for reducing the expense of part sparing and system repair. The low SWAP and highly flexible measurement system is also well suited for portable microwave instrumentation, such as for wideband RF network analyzers, and for incorporating into built-in-self-test systems.","The proposed technology is applicable to both civilian and military aviation needs. As is the case for NASA applications, a plethora of microwave systems are onboard such aircraft and these applications also benefit from low SWAP, low part count, reconfigurable measurement bands, and flexible component locations. Electronic countermeasures are also widely deployed in military aircraft and represent an additional application. The growth of unmanned aerial vehicles and their use in surveillance and remote sensing represents another attractive market. Additional applications include microwave signal remoting from cellular towers (back-haul), radar-based process monitoring in industrial tanks, and portable RF instrumentation. In terms of communication systems an optical front end offers the ultimate in re-programmability as could be used in a universal software defined radio or for specialty applications like secure communication via frequency hop spread spectrum techniques.",Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Microwave; Transmitters/Receivers,Technologies for Active Microwave Remote Sensing   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

While the antenna architecture proposed by AOE can be targeted for frequencies from below L-band to Ka-band and higher, AOE has selected X-band for a demonstration array for this proposed effort. Under the Phase I effort, AOE and LoadPath will focus on achieving an efficient deployable reflect array configuration and, within the trade space of reflect array architectures, will explore several approaches and perform the trade analyses in terms of performance, cost, size, weight and power.  The results of this investigation will yield a high gain antenna architecture that will support future NASA and commercial small satellite communication operations.  During the Phase I effort, the array deployment mechanism will be demonstrated with hardware while a complete beam-scanning reflect array antenna will be demonstrated with hardware during the Phase II effort.","Small spacecraft communication systems must be increasingly robust, flexible and diverse to support a wide variety of stand-alone and interconnected missions used by NASA to conduct space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe.  All NASA missions require communications ability and the technology proposed here will be a low-cost enabler to support higher data rate communications for small satellites by reducing the mass, stowed volume and achievable bandwidth and scan volume for a high gain antenna.","AOE?s commercialization strategy will focus on CubeSats and SmallSats and their use in the communication systems market.  CubeSats, NanoSats and SmallSats are gaining increasing popularity as they allow a more practical and cost-effective way of getting into space as compared to conventional satellite payloads.  One of the primary uses of satellite systems is for communication applications.  As with military and government systems, commercial satellite communication systems are evolving toward the need for improved coverage, increased bandwidth, higher data throughput, and improved connectivity and will also need wide-band, multi-beam antennas.

Beside radiation shielding capabilities, such materials would also have desirable thermal and mechanical properties suitable for forming protective structures that are strong, durable, thermally manageable, and hermetic.","Lightweight innovative radiation shielding materials are needed to safeguard humans in next generation exploration.

The micro-channels are produced in a size range of 100-200 microns such that the boundary layer thickness inside is drastically reduced when mixtures of helium and hydrogen gas flow through the channels. This thin boundary layer enhances the thermal and mass transport fluxes to the channel walls increasing the separation rate.  With this micro-channel approach, the membrane surface area to volume ratio is maximized reducing the operating costs and capital costs for the unit.","NASA uses a large amount of helium gas to purge hydrogen from fuel lines during launches. A typical shuttle launch used about a million cubic feet of helium where six times this amount is expected for the space launch system and multipurpose crew vehicle launches. This helium gas contaminated with hydrogen is expensive and energy intensive to purify and recover. Because of helium shortages and rising prices, cost effective recovery and reclamation of helium from hydrogen-helium gas mixture is of great economic significance to NASA and to the nation. The present cryogenic separation process for this gas mixture is energy intensive, and newer demonstrations using proton-exchange membrane based separation processes are difficult and costly to scale to the size needed to process this large quantity of gas. Accordingly, Reactive Innovations is developing a metal membrane based micro-channel separation unit that is readily scalable and inexpensive to produce and operate. The micro-channel separation technology maximizes the separation area per unit volume giving enhanced thermal and mass fluxes to separate hydrogen from the helium mixture.","Beyond NASA's use, helium is an important irreplaceable inert gas used in a variety of scientific and industrial fields such as oil and gas detectors, the nuclear industry, medical applications, cryogenics, and welding. However, due to the growing demand for He, the market supply is becoming tighter and costs are increasing.  Currently, cryogenic distillation and pressure-swing adsorption are the prevalent methods widely used for He separation, especially in natural gas feedstocks. The cryogenic distillation and pressure-swing separation methods involve complicated operations and require considerable energy consumption. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop simple, low-energy, and low-cost methods for separating He from other gases. Other potential uses for this separator unit include removing hydrogen from natural gas processing plants, and separating helium-hydrogen mixtures used in medical MRI imaging, semiconductor processing, welding, and nuclear processes.",Airship/Lighter-than-Air Craft; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Fuels/Propellants; Inventory Management/Warehousing; Material Handing & Packaging; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction,Cryogenic Purge Gas Recovery and Reclamation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The goal of this research is to develop a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based, optical probe capable of significantly improved performance compared to existing available sensors, by enabling faster response time, higher bandwidth transduction and increased angular measurement range while reducing sensor power requirements.  The proposed technology offers these benefits in a compact, high-temperature capable package, extending past successes in fiber-optic, micromachined pressure sensing technology.   Specifically, this sensor technology will be developed to address NASAs objective to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA?s ground-based test facilities to revolutionize wind tunnel testing and measurement capabilities and improve utilization and efficiency as per subtopic A1.08 Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies of the NASA FY 2017 SBIR/STTR Solicitation.","The proposed instrumentation technology has the potential to be transportable across multiple NASA facility classes as well as implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities.  The target market is the wind tunnel test and instrumentation market, beginning with low-speed wind-tunnels but also expanding into higher-speed, high temperature tunnels.In addition to wind-tunnel testing, the proposed sensor technology is also applicable to the types of technological solutions sought for flight-test measurements, as the sensing head is already compact and solutions exist for miniaturizing the optical sensor control unit.Given the capability of the proposed transducers ability to withstand harsh environments, the technology is applicable to multiple ground and flight test facilities.  The target application for entry into the NASA Aeronautics Test Program is as instrumentation for 3D flow measurements within ground test facilities such as those at NASA Langley, Glenn, and Ames Research Centers.  In addition, the instrumentation can be further miniaturized to enable entry into flight test facilities, such as those at Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center.","The target markets can be broken down into immediate and potential long-term markets.  The primary immediate market is the scientific test, measurement and instrumentation market.  These applications constitute a low volume/high average selling price (ASP) market entry, which allows for slightly higher margins to garner resources for market-centric innovation.  The inherently expensive nature of conducting these measurements represents a very niche market with highly specific needs coupled with stringent transducer performance specifications.  The high performance and relatively low volume enables establishment of a value based on per-unit cost while addressing long term customer needs. This approach also allows for room to resolve product issues related to process variations and yield.  It also helps make improvements by incorporating customer feedback on product performance while generating revenue.

Materials in current state-of-the-art electron emitters, and many of the materials used in mounting hardware, are not compatible in a high-temperature iodine environment. This includes cathodes that use inserts made from porous tungsten impregnated with ceramics containing barium oxide, which can be susceptible to rapid decomposition of the ceramic by iodine, and lanthanum hexaboride-based inserts, which are subject to rapid surface decomposition by iodine. The work function of both types of inserts increases in the presence of iodine, and the temperature of the cathode increases, which further exacerbates the decomposition processes. We will use a materials science based approach to evaluate the chemical interactions between iodine and a range of potential materials at elevated temperature. We will construct and experimentally test candidate cathodes in relevant iodine environments to identify robust, safe-to-handle, chemically-stable material systems. In follow-on work, we will (1) perform long duration wear tests to demonstrate adequately long lifetime capability and (2) integrate the cathodes into iodine storage, feed, and thruster systems through industry and government partnerships.","NASA aims to mature and demonstrate iodine electric propulsion technologies. Of particular interest are hollow cathodes with lifetimes greater than 10,000 hours. Hollow cathodes are used in electric propulsion devices, including Hall effect and ion thrusters, to sustain discharge plasmas and neutralize ion beams, and in plasma contacting devices to neutralize spacecraft charge.

This includes ion etching of surfaces, ion-assisted film deposition, ion implantation, and chemical vapor deposition; processes which can present similarly challenging chemical environments to that of iodine. Robust and long life hollow cathodes developed through this work are anticipated to be highly commercially attractive as they would reduce maintenance expenses and process downtime. However, their attractiveness grows exponentially if they could be used in applications that were previously off limits due to the presence of highly reactive gases and plasmas.

Reservoir cathodes have several unique features which will allow them to resist the corrosive effects of iodine. Chief amongst these is that the barium-emission-material-containing reservoir is isolated from the iodine flow. This allows free barium to be produced in an environment free of iodine. Furthermore, barium production rates in reservoir cathodes can be adjusted to very high levels -- high enough to overcome the deleterious effects of iodine at the cathode's emitting surface. Reservoir cathodes carry a barium supply that is 100 times that of conventional cathodes. Furthermore, the reservoir cathode inserts can be made of materials other than tungsten. This is not possible with impregnated cathodes. These materials can be selected for their resistance to iodine attack. They include osmium, rhodium, and iridium.NASA is pursuing iodine EP because of iodine's advantages over xenon, especially for small satellite propulsion. Most important are its low cost and its high storage density. Also, it requires no high-pressure, large and heavy pressure vessels.","NASA's primary interest is for iodine thrusters of less than 1 KW.  It is also interested in powers over 10 KW.

Autonomous GNC allows a spacecraft to perform most of its own navigation activities without the need for ground-based personnel and DSN time, reducing cost and required DSN contact time, saving money, and allowing specialized navigation personnel from different NASA centers to be easily shared among missions.Autonomous GNC activities include:  -spacecraft positioningabsolute and relative (helio, planet, small-body)relative to small bodies, other spacecraft for rendezvous  -orbit determination  -target tracking of bodies, apertures, spacecraft, ground-based assets  -trajectory derivation  -low-thrust maneuvering for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)  -ephemeris calculationsAutoNav from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory implements these functions, and components have flown on Deep Space 1 and Deep Impact. With an appropriate application of software development process to reengineer the code, a new AutoNav Mark 4 could be made available as a commercialized product meeting NASA Class B software standards, thereby enabling its easy inclusion on a wide variety of NASA and non-NASA missions.AutoNav Mark 4 source code is designed and tested to be compatible with a variety of different CPUs (e.g. SPARC, PPC, Intel), real-time operating systems (VxWorks, RTEMS), and flight software cores like NASA Core Flight System. This approach allows AN4 to be deployed in the widest-possible set of environments:  -within STRS-compatible space radios (e.g. Iris)  -in the flight software load of the spacecraft C&DH  -in a dedicated stand-alone instrument like the Deep Space Positioning SystemAutoNav Mark 4 provides highly capable autonomous GNC while saving missions money.","AutoNav Mark 4 is applicable to any space mission requiring any of the following:  -spacecraft positioningabsolute and relative (helio, planet, small-body)relative to small bodies and other spacecraft for rendezvous  -orbit determination  -target tracking of bodies, apertures, spacecraft, ground-based assets  -trajectory derivation  -low-thrust maneuvering for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)  -ephemeris calculationsAll mission perform some or all of the prior activities, frequently using ground-based personnel and processes that are slow and expensive. Commercialized on-board autonomous navigation as provided by AutoNav Mark 4 can be targeted at the whole range of LEO, GEO, and interplanetary missions, large and small.AutoNav Mark 4 for low-thrust missions (including Psyche and Next Mars Orbiter) would allow a dramatic reduction in navigation and trajectory calculation costs by moving the bulk of these activities onboard. Long missions like these would incur even more savings using AN4 than more modest missions.AutoNav Mark 4 is directly applicable to JPL's Deep Space Positioning System. By using a commercialized AutoNav, JPL would avoid most development costs, providing only new algorithms from its Navigation Section to plug into the AutoNav Mark 4 architecture.Human spaceflight could use AutoNav Mark 4 for navigation and trajectory calculation in the event of communications failure, allowing the astronauts to safely reenter and land.","Since AutoNav Mark 4 works with any flight software core, it could be applied to non-NASA spacecraft: DoD, NOAA, and ESA missions are prime candidates. International release of software should be possible under ITAR controls. AutoNav Mark 4 could be directly applied to commercial launch vehicles in order to calculate ascent maneuvers, including for human access to space.Installing AutoNav Mark 4 just on small commercial missions having a CubeSat form factor would allow these missions to proceed at reduced cost, removing much of the need for expensive navigator personnel time. This would free missions from having to implement these capabilities, leading to better reliability of navigation, simpler mission conops, more cross-mission synergy, and lower barriers of entry for less experience providers like universities.Future commercial human spaceflight could utilize AutoNav Mark 4 for on-board spacecraft navigation and trajectory calculation. This would be most useful in the event of a communications failure, allowing the astronauts to autonomously calculate a return trajectory for re-entry and landing without any interactions with ground-based expertise. It would also allow a low earth orbiting mission to track down and rendezvous with other spacecraft or the International Space Station for servicing, cargo transfer, personnel transfer, and the like, without requiring contact with the ground.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)","Guidance, Navigation and Control   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The Vector-R is a 2-stage pressure-fed, LOX/subcooled propylene commercial small launch vehicle, designed to place up to 60 kg in low earth orbit. In the proposed concept, electrically-driven micropumps drive a small portion of each propellant over a heat exchanger at the engine to pressurize the tanks. Excess flow can be diverted to the engine as needed.This approach reduces system mass, complexity and acquisition cost as well as operational costs. It eliminates the need for all high-pressure tanks and associated components. It can be used on any pressure-fed stage, for launch vehicle and in-space application when using high vapor pressure propellants such as LOX/methane or LOX/propane. As such, it is an enabler for missions targeted to use in-situ propellants since the need for a separate pressurant like helium is either greatly reduced or eliminated. By leveraging Vector's ongoing Vector-R micro-launcher development, it is possible to reach TRL 6 with demonstration flight testing during Phase II.","The technology offers the means of drastically reducing the mass, complexity and cost of pressure-fed propulsion stages employing high vapor pressure propellants like LOX, methane, propylene and propane. The reductions in costs apply to both acquisition and operational costs of propulsive stages since the proposed system is simpler and lighter. Applications include small launch vehicle stages where turbo-pumps are inefficient and cost-prohibitive. For Vector, the immediate application of the technology which could benefit NASA is the Vector-R launch vehicle. This vehicle is designed to provide dedicated launch services to nanosats up to 60 kg, with planned operations starting in 2018. Candidate small spacecraft which could benefit from dedicated launch services or reduced launch costs provided by the technology include numerous CubeSats and nanosats in development at NASA or funded by NASA, such as NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative and Educational Launch of Nanosatellites. Other longer term potential applications include future missions to Mars and other bodies which use pressure-fed systems, whether directly or in conjunction with pump-fed engines. For Mars ascent, this technology is particularly attractive when using in-situ propellants since it eliminates the need for a pressurant like helium. The application of this technology for Mars missions is likely to be years away.","With the Vector-R micro-launcher, Vector is positioning itself to provide responsive, dedicated launch to the micro- and nanosat market expected to burgeon in the next few years.

However, the cost to develop and procure this type of antenna prohibits this technology from widespread use. The proposed innovation substantially reduces the control complexity of phased arrays by reducing the control set from MxN phase controls to M+N phase controls where M and N represent the number of rows and columns in the phased array. By reducing the control complexity, not only are the phased array devices simplified, but the control distribution network is substantially reduced. This simplification ripples across the entire phased array to improve physical integration and thermal management which often cost as much as the phased array components. This is particularly important for high frequency antennas where unit cell sizes become a significant impediment to system implementation. Another limitation in state of the art phased arrays are the conventional planar radiators that are easily integrated. A three-dimensional radiator and manufacturing technology is baselined to enhance the bandwidth and performance of millimeter wave phased array antennas. This combination enables significant opportunities to support multifunction operation.","There is a growing list of small satellite and cube satellite missions enabled by industry advances in very capable, low power and miniature digital signal processing hardware. Because the proposed phased array development is expected to result in significantly lower system costs, this phased array technology should be considered for small satellite payload and data transfer subsystems. By providing a communication solution that can be electronically steered, spacecraft attitude management is simplified allowing the payload to point at the primary target longer without interruption for data off-loading. Furthermore, by lowering antenna system costs, larger apertures can be deployed to significantly improve EIRP and G/T metrics essential for long range, high throughput capacity links. A high gain, electronically steered antenna at millimeter waves in Low Earth Orbit can reduce ground station antenna sizes enabling the deployment of small ground stations to avoid scarce resource conflicts. There is also the possibility of making the Ka band antenna compatible with K/Ka band SATCOM links to provide an additional means of transporting data or command and control messaging. The proposed phased array technology not only reduces the cost of millimeter wave phased arrays but enables significant bandwidths (20% or greater) to support commercial, military and NASA spectrum.","The proposed beamforming architecture can enable phased array application to mobile communication markets where spatial diversification is required for high capacity and frequency re-use. The innovation proposed substantially reduces control and physical complexity which will result in widespread use of phased arrays. For example, the Satellite Communications (SATCOM) market continues to grow in users as low cost, low drag antenna terminal products are realized.

The goal is to provide a much faster way to begin working with vehicle simulations, to make collaboration and integration with modern software development tools easier, to reduce cost and complexity with growing projects, to make ""swapping"" subsystems a trivial task (e.g., for trade studies), and to provide flexibility for integrating with C code (e.g., flight software), parallel computing (e.g., Monte-Carlo runs), and communication protocols (e.g., processor-in-the-loop testing). The work rests on the high-level Julia language, as it is both fast and excellent for algorithm design. The environment will be open-source in order to drive adoption and to enable it to become a common platform for providers of models, consulting services, and education.","NASA is expected to benefit in variety of ways. First, the simulation environment is intended to help directly with the creation of new spacecraft programs and other integrated system development by providing an elegant simulator and model-based engineering (MBE) framework. Relative to state-of-the-art MBE, the framework is expected to have lower overhead (both costs and time), to have less built-in complexity, to foster collaboration, to facilitate trade studies, and to enable low fidelity and high fidelity runs, according to needs. This is expected to allow model development and meaningful analyses to occur earlier in the program lifecycle.Second, by creating an accessible platform, in terms of both cost and ease-of-use, a large number of users can adopt the platform. Among other benefits, this will drive heavier use and scrutiny of various models in the simulation (whether provided with the simulation environment itself or provided by third parties), and this will drive forward the maturity of components as well as increase the variety available, much like NASA can reap the benefits of commercial-off-the-shelf components.Third, the simulation itself may be useful outside of a development environment altogether, such as for analyses, for calibration/tuning, or as part of a system to exercise a particular component via its hardware-in-the-loop/communication capability.","Any spacecraft developer would be able to benefit from the simulation environment, and these organizations would stand to gain the same benefits as NASA would. Further, spacecraft have much in common with other vehicles, and the proposed environment is expected to work well for aircraft, cars, and sea-going vessels.Many companies would be able to provide commercial consulting services based around the environment, such as setting up model-based engineering workflows, developing custom components, and designing flight algorithms in the MBE context.With its commercial-friendly license, the simulation environment could be incorporated directly into third-party products, and commercial products could be developed for it.Finally, as a community grows around the project, the software will be directly useful for education. For instance, an undergraduate class may be able to set a moment of inertia and select ideal environment models in order to investigate Explorer 1's spin about an unintended axis. Or a sixth grade class may show satellites in various types of orbits to explain why some look fast and others stay overhead, all with a simple change in the initial orbital elements.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Development Environments; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",Integrated Science Mission Modeling   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Multiple launch and payload providers have expressed interest in repurposing pressure vessels as on-orbit habitats and require outfitting for secondary structure, floors and dividers, ECLS ducting, thermal control accommodation, radiation shielding, wiring, lighting etc. to make the volume functional. The proposed innovation uses multi-functional, intelligent fabrics in a tensioned membrane architecture that can be deployed by means of (a) pressurized annulus envelope that when inflated, expands against the habitat hull to anchor the structure while (b) multipurpose telescoping tubes at the core of the habitat expand in the axial direction across the opposing bulkheads to index the annulus pressure vessels. Tensioned membrane structures exhibit the highest specific stiffness of any known structure and can produce significant weight savings over hybrid structural designs. Inflatable structures package well and can significantly reduce stowed volume requirements and dampen launch vibro-acoustics. An inflatable habitat structure can most effectively address packaging, deployment, damage tolerance, ease of repair and in-flight maintenance. With lightweight rigging, these secondary structures will be designed to be fully repositionable, creating a modular approach to habitat outfitting. The Paragon/TRLA team will develop a design that packages efficiently, deploys repeatability, and provides valuable capabilities including a.) minimum mass, design simplicity, minimal parts count, b.) a structure which folds efficiently deployment repeatability c.)  secondary soft goods fabricated which are integrated during build-up yielding minimal ground handling loads, and d.) flooring, walls, ECLS air flow ducts, TCS fluid loops, lighting, electrical/data lines, and radiation protection structures all integrated in unison during buildup.","The demand for space related habitats is starting to emerge. For example, the Inspiration Mars (IM) Foundation proposed a mission to Mars that included an inflatable habitat. Additionally, test flights to ISS have been proposed that deliver inflatable habitats for increased research space as well as for housing precursor tests for long-duration missions such as IM. The IM architecture study proposed a pre-flight experiment to the ISS that could use the proposed HOUSE solution for the pressure structure. Bigelow Aerospace, for which TRLA built the now-flying units in orbit, has staked the company?s future on the use of inflatable structures. The potential post applications of the proposed are targeted for manned habitats including lunar surface system habitats, airlocks and other crewed vessels. The NextSTEP program, which seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities, will support more extensive human spaceflight. Under the NextSTEP program, NASA seeks to support human spaceflight missions to beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO).  Other potential post applications can range from NASA commercial applications including deployable antenna reflectors, solar collectors, solar sails, payload fairings, water storage tanks, cryogenic propellant tanks, greenhouse enclosures, debris shields, radiation shields, re-entry vehicles, large telescopes, propellant depots, rover vehicles, orbital debris removal systems, emergency escape vehicle (ISS), and Martian air ships.","Non-NASA application customers can include the Army and other DoD agencies in need of shelters.

The algorithm will be combined with cost-effective haptic feedback and a head-mounted display. The result provides a substantial improvement in alerting pilots that they are nearing stall conditions, addressing Loss of Control, which is recognized by the FAA and NTSB as the leading cause of fatal GA accidents. Current GA AoA systems are limited due to lack of flap position information, and their displays are not likely to capture a pilot's attention while maneuvering. Our cost-effective haptic feedback (similar to a 'stick shaker' which is known to be the most effective interface but not compatible with GA aircraft), and our head-mounted display are expected to capture the pilot's attention. AAG's experience in developing and flight testing AoA systems and our history of partnering with avionics manufacturers to develop and flight test commercial avionics systems, uniquely position us to successfully develop and commercialize this innovative AoA system. Our novel derived AoA algorithm has been tested in flight against other AoA systems under FAA and internal funding and shown to have good performance to near-stall conditions. Technical objectives for Phase I are to demonstrate technical feasibility of flap deflection estimation, cost effective haptic alerting in a typical GA cockpit, and cost-effective head-mounted display, and to create a prototype implementation of the integrated AoA system ready to flight test in Phase II. The Work Plan includes: development and evaluation of flap position estimation algorithm in simulation and flight; design, prototype development and inflight evaluation of haptic interface; simulation evaluation of AoA alerting on head-mounted display; and integration of components.","The proposed integrated AoA system addresses a key area within NASA's safety research, specifically ""develop and demonstrate products to address technologies, simulation capabilities and procedures for reducing flight risk in areas of attitude and energy aircraft state awareness."" Our proposed system advances the state of the art in detecting, predicting and preventing a major GA safety problem in real-time, loss of control due to aerodynamic stall. AAG's derived AoA algorithm, coupled with our proposed in-situ flap position estimation algorithm, can be used in concert with a sensed AoA system to provide redundant sources of AoA that are not dependent on the same set of sensors. Highly accurate and redundant AoA information is a key input for NASA's research in detecting and recovering from off-nominal states, including control upset prevention, resilient controls, envelope protection systems, and detecting and recovering from control surface position errors in future aircraft, whether the control surface failed or the sensor feeding back its position failed. Highly accurate AoA information as well as the haptic feedback and the head-mounted display can both be applied to enabling NASA's On-Demand Mobility research to move towards manned vehicles that may be operated by passengers who are not experienced pilots, significantly reducing accidents due to loss of control, loss of attitude awareness, and controlled flight into terrain.","AAG and our industry avionics contacts believe that there is tremendous commercial potential for our integrated AoA system for GA, which addresses the leading cause of fatal GA accidents, Loss of Control, and is a substantial improvement over the commercial systems that are now being developed. Our haptic feedback system could also be used to prevent Controlled Flight into Terrain. The development of a cost-effective head-mounted display suitable for GA opens the door to displaying PFD, navigation, hazard (traffic, terrain, etc.), and other information, including a simple attitude display to prevent a non-instrument pilot losing attitude awareness upon blundering into IMC.","3D Imaging; Acoustic/Vibration; Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Attitude Determination & Control; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Display; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z)",Future Aviation Systems Safety   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The Optomec-Harding team seeks to reduce the localized laser sintering concept to practice by developing ALSS with in-situ automated adjustment of laser power and processing time.  ALSS will include a laser for sintering with sensors to monitor the process so that any flaws in the printed electronics circuitry can be repaired with minimal human intervention.  The benefit will be two-fold: it will enable Optomec, Inc. to expand its commercial applications of the Aerosol Jet technology in printed electronics industry, and to pave the way for the use of this advanced technology in the next generation of human space exploration.  The success of this endeavor will be of vital importance to the NASA's in-space, on-demand manufacturing capabilities to support the unique challenges of long-duration human spaceflight.  The developed automated adaptive in-line quality control system with ALSS is also applicable to that required for long-duration human space missions with minimal need for astronaut intervention, when printing conformal electronics and sensors onto flexible substrates of various geometrical complexities using the Aerosol Jet technology.  The liquid metal nanoparticle (NP) inks as printed are not conductive enough for required circuit functionality; they must be transformed to solid metal path by a sintering at an elevated temperature.  To reduce sintering time and exposure of the substrate to damaging temperatures, localized laser sintering has been shown to be promising.  The challenge to commercialization of laser sintering is controlling the laser power and processing time required for effective sintering of metal NP inks while avoiding thermal damage to substrate, which will be addressed by the ALSS.","After the successful design, test and implementation of ALSS, the science and technology of laser sintering will be better understood for controllable adaptive operations.  It provides a key solution to NASA's challenge of in-space, on-demand manufacturing capabilities to support the unique challenges of long-duration human spaceflight, which requires an automated adaptive in-line quality control system along with the manufacturing process.  The reduction in both time and manpower with modularization of the process will allow better integration of a prototype instrument to be installed for demonstration on ISS. NASA can use this ALSS module at NASA research centers to compare and evaluate the advantages of printing electronics using different direct-write technologies, whether it is the Aerosol Jet or inkjet or other metal NP ink dispensing methods or plasma jet printing technology.","While the Aerosol Jet(R) technology is changing the way engineers and scientists design and develop electronic, biomedical, and mechanical systems, its applicability in printed electronics is mainly limited by the sintering process when the substrate materials must not be damaged by the elevated temperature, especially when the conventional thermal oven is used. The success of ALSS development will enable sintering printed metal NP inks on many low-temperature substrates that have been impossible with oven sintering, because the transient laser power is applied to a very small spot with a very short duration which minimizes the heat-affected zone.  Thus, the Aerosol Jet system with the ALSS enhancement will tremendously increase its production capability and market share in printed electronics industry.  On the other hand, the knowledge gained via ALSS development can be utilized in other in-line monitoring and control subsystem development for future system enhancement, which is also aimed at increasing the scopes of Aerosol Jet(R) potential commercial applications.","Analytical Methods; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); In Situ Manufacturing; Manufacturing Methods; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods",In-Space Manufacturing of Electronics and Avionics   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The GaN LLC Converter will operate at 1 MHz with an input voltage of 80V - 300V and output of 300V - 2kV, capable of handling up to 1 kW. The GaN LLC Converter will have an approximate size of 4in x 2in x 0.5in. Current technology utilizes silicon-based solutions for power conversion and distribution. GaN can fundamentally perform well beyond current silicon based hardware. GaN has direct benefits such as higher power density, reduced footprint, increased power capacity, and improved power efficiency. Increasing frequency of operation results in smaller components but it also creates a challenge for thermal management and magnetic component design. The proposed work will include a matrix transformer which offers: low profile, high power density, robust and flexible for shock and vibration handling, and superior electrical characteristics. In addition, the wide range capability will be handled thanks to the LLC topology which offers: wide input range, ZVS operation, low turn-off current. Finally, the GaN-LLC Converter will make use of additive manufacturing for its thermal management. The marriage of GaN, LLC, matrix transformer design, and additive manufacturing results in a design that is smaller, more efficient and more cost-effective than Si-based products. SET Group will design the GaN-LLC Converter to be used in PPUs, but the outcome of this work will help as a platform for other power conversion products utilizing GaN technology to be developed.","The greatest advantage of the technology proposed by SET Group is its ability to be used across a wide range of applications. An immediate application of our technology is for NASA's Solar Electric Propulsion systems. The PPUs in their system convert the 300V solar array output to the 700V - 2000V input level of an electric thruster. The proposed Wide Range GaN LLC Power Converter is a great candidate for that mission.In addition, the proposed work will serve as a platform to demonstrate GaN-based power conversion technology as a viable and better alternative than the current Si-based power conversion products. SET Group's goal is to develop other units using the same technology, and thanks to its wide voltage capability, it can be retrofitted for various applications with different voltage and power requirements without major redesign efforts.","Demand for broadband internet access in remote areas, airplanes and higher data capability (i.e. 4K TV, 360o video, etc), have pushed satellite manufacturers to provide more powerful RF transponders. These transponders require higher power, increasing satellite size and launching costs, which results in more expensive satellite services for end consumers.  SET Group's proposed GaN-LLC can provide satellite manufacturers a competitive edge by increasing power capabilities while reducing size, weight, and cost. In recent years, GEO satellite service providers, such as DirecTV, have been requesting more powerful satellites to handle the wider bandwidth needed to keep up with the data demand (DirecTV now offers 4K video). To meet broadband internet demand, companies have turned to LEO satellites, which due to their closer proximity to Earth, have a lower delay of signal (latency) over a GEO satellite. This is important for broadband internet given it is a two-way communication. Oneweb, a satellite manufacturer startup, will provide developing countries affordable access to internet by deploying a large constellation of LEO satellites (750 satellites) by 2020. SpaceX has also announced their own 4000 LEO satellite constellation. These satellites are small, thus reducing launching costs. A GaN-based EPS and PPU fits the equivalent capabilities of a much larger satellite into a much smaller and cost-effective one.","Characterization; Conversion; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling","Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storageis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The innovations involve overcoming hardware and software limitations that currently make 3D imaging at millimeter wave frequencies slow, cumbersome and impractical for widespread use.Our goal is to design a system with:  center frequency in the millimeter wave range; significant bandwidth; high-spatial and range resolutions; rapid image data collection; real-time image rendering; ability to image multi-layer structures made of different materials; high system dynamic range (high detection sensitivity); electrical and mechanical  design allowing adaptation to use in-space; modular and frequency-scalablity to accommodate large structures; user friendly design to allow operation by people of various skill sets.  The Phase I effort will include simulations and small-scale testing.","We have used similar systems to inspect:  Thermal Protection Systems; High Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation; and Advanced Flexible Reusable Insulation.  The proposed system would images these materials better and faster.Human Exploration Operations programs, e.g. crew transportation systems; ISS; Orion; deep space habitation; and Advanced Exploration Systems.The NASA/MSFC Meteoroid Environment Office (MEO) could use the system to determine location and depth of simulated micrometeoroids and orbital debris post impact testing.  In-service, this capability could be used by people in space to determine the size and depth of debris and impact damage, allowing appropriate repairs.The camera could also be used to inspect multi-layer polymers, Nextel, ceramic fabrics etc such as those used in Whipple bumpers.  While the camera cannot image through metal layers, such layers can act as reflectors and enhance imaging in materials above a metal layer.It could also be used to assess damage to the composite overwrap on pressure vessels.The system should be capable of imaging inside any dielectric material, including Kevlar fabrics, Kevlar/epoxy, fiberglass, and foams.The system could also be applied to inspection of more Earthbound applications within the Safety, Security and Mission Services/Construction & Environmental Compliance and Restoration programs.  It could image composite, elastomer, polymeric, ceramic and civil materials for degradation.","The proposed systems non-ionizing energy can rapidly image hidden weapons.It can image, in 3D, features hidden inside walls.  This includes substructure, pipes, wiring, joists, fasteners, etc through drywall, paneling, siding, plywood and other common materials.It could also be used to detect and determine the extent of damage such as mold, water ingress, termites/carpenter ant nests, etc.A related application would be civil engineering such as inspecting FRP repairs to bridge decks and FRP wraps around concrete columns.In the petrochemical industry, the system could be used to image blockages, build-ups, and damage in fiberglass pipes, tanks and pressure vessels.  Microwave testing is being commercialized in the petrochemical industry for inspecting fiberglass vessels.  The proposed imaging innovation would greatly expand these capabilities.When a material being tested for radar performance fails radar testing, it is currently difficult to discern the location in the structure that caused failure.  We are developing a tool to localize anomalies that caused far field range test failures in radomes.  While effective, the tool is raster scanned over the radome.  The imaging system proposed here would be a much faster way to localize regions for repair.  The same tool could be used to determine if radar absorbers around antennas are functioning properly and to locate anomalies.  It could also be used for radar absorbing/low observable coatings for the same purposes.",3D Imaging; Air Transportation & Safety; Characterization; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Image Processing; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Quality/Reliability; Space Transportation & Safety,NDE Sensors   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

With built in signal processing, the receiver will provide high resolution spectral estimates for Doppler frequency extraction of weak signals in noise. If successful, the innovation will increase lidar system efficiency, reduce cost, size, weight and power.","The Phase I effort paves the way for a very important component that is key to most coherent lidar system. Of immediate interest, the proposed advanced coherent lidar receiver (CLR) performs real-time signal processing that is common to any Doppler frequency measurement instrument. The proposed advanced CLR has the potential to enhance the sensitivity of an aircraft wind velocity measurement lidar by two orders of magnitude. Other NASA instrument that will immediately benefit from the proposed advanced CLR is the Navigation Doppler Lidar which uses a powerful data acquisition and processing system custom built at NASA Langley Research Center.  The CLR can potentially provide the same capability at a fraction of the cost, with less power consumption, and enhanced signal acquisition sensitivity.","An advanced CLR applications are not limited to NASA missions. Coherent lidar is used by many government organizations such as NOAA, DoD, DoE to name just a few. Simplifying coherent Lidar at the receiver will reduce cost and support hardware needed for typical coherent lidar applications. Such a device can be integrated into the growing number of self-driving cars, by providing inexpensive solution to situational awareness. The increased sensitivity from this receiver coupled with the short operational distances needed for these vehicles would make it possible to develop low power, high accuracy velocity mapping of the vehicles surroundings.  This is a significant improvement over time-of-flight situational awareness laser sensors currently employed in driverless cars. In addition, the cost of the sensor becomes significantly more affordable, which is one of the hurdles facing driverless car manufacturers.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Data Processing; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Guidance & Tracking); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)",Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The success of this Phase I will totally open new avenues in the area of high temperature materials. That, in turn, will enable NASA designers to implement hot structure solution in lieu of parasitic passive insulation system, resulting in significant weight reduction in future NASA Space Exploration vehicles, as well as a plethora of other applications.","The primary focus is initially on new TPS solutions like hot structures for NASA Space Exploration vehicles.

These impact and compaction results, in this SBIR will be analyzed using the meash0based Serpent 2 nuclear code to demonstrate that the reactor will not become critical during compaction events, or will demonstrate what design changes must be incorporated in order to ensure this end.If the NTP system can document an unambiguous safety case prior to major program decisions, it will dramatically reduce programmatic uncertainty, and provide decision-makers with a far less costly approach to NTP development.Because the entire reactor must be designed, modeled and subject to impact scenarios, it is not possible to obtain meaningful results at the component level.  Small-scale analyses have sown the viability of this approach and the LPS team is ready to proceed to a full-scale NTP engine.","Because of the pioneering work performed by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, we now know some NTR configurations are feasible with Low Enriched Uranium (LEU).  This will dramatically reduce security and development costs, and result in a more affordable system.  Because of the LEU approach, commercial companies may be enticed to become involved, because the costs can be more well defined.  The PI and other are looking to engage certain commercial space entities about becoming involved.",This propulsion system appears to have great promise for certain DOD Missile DEfense Agency Missions.  The PI and program advisor will be visitng the MDA during 2017 to discuss a potential collaborative project.,"Display; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Main Engine; Verification/Validation Tools",Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

LoadPath's approach adapts a demonstrated, high packaging-efficiency array folding architecture for a Martian surface application delivering robust autonomous deployments over uneven terrain, retractability, modularity, portability, minimal CONOPS, and integrated dust mitigation.  LoadPath recently invented and demonstrated the feasibility of an advanced, lightweight solar array system to deliver high power generation capability for small satellite systems with extreme stowed volume constraints.  Establishing a functional solar array farm on the Martian surface to support manned missions shares many of the technical challenges and requirements of the small spacecraft, large deployable array problem.  LoadPath leveraged the findings of this previous effort with its extensive experience in devising and delivering numerous innovative deployable structural systems in the development of the leading concept for an META autonomous deploying terrestrial array.  In this Phase I effort, the conceptual design will be developed through a thorough engineering trade study of the required support components, culminating with a functional deployment demonstration with a fabricated prototype structure.","In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act and the U.S. National Space Policy drafted goals to send humans to Mars in the 2030s.  This direction resulted in renewed studies, specifically by the multidisciplinary Collaborative Modeling for Parametric Assessment of Space Systems (COMPASS) at NASA Glenn Research Center, to determine the required systems to support various potential manned mission scenarios.  To support manned operations, a large power generation capability, on the order of 40kW, is required with the ability to be modular, autonomous, and reconfigurable to respond to any mission design. The design trade study between solar versus fission power generation technology showed that, depending on the mission, the solar array option could be the more cost effective and mass efficient solution. The proposed META is an innovative deployable solar array technology that clearly responds to the subtopic, NASA missions, and NASA programmatic needs. As concluded in the numerous Mars mission design studies, there is a need to mature the notional concepts to determine if the requirements can be satisfied. Preliminary design efforts indicate that the META approach addresses all stated requirements with a feasible path towards meeting those goals.","In addition to Mars terrestrial solar arrays, META has Earth terrestrial applications including austere military operations, remote industrial operations such as mining, disaster relief, and temporary or seasonal dwellings such as yurts.  During this SBIR effort we will focus on aerospace and military applications by engaging with Lockheed Martin. LoadPath has an existing working relationship with Lockheed Martin and will continually interact with them during the Phase I and Phase II efforts to assure a clear technology transition path. A Mars surface solar array alone is not a significant market; however, META's extended Earth terrestrial applications including military operations, mining, disaster relief, and portable consumer power products create a sufficient market to warrant the development investment.","Composites; Deployment; Generation; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Mars Surface Solar Array Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This facility will include a test section into which third party experimenters can place their apparatus and will be suitable for studying steady or variable gas-solid flows over a 2-orders of magnitude range in particle size and 4-orders of magnitude in solids-fraction at gas pressures ranging from atmospheric to vacuum and flow velocities from a 10s of m/s per second down to stationary conditions. This facility will provide a unique opportunity to gain understanding of the fundamental physical behavior of granular solids in microgravity over a range of solids fractions that are unobtainable terrestrially due to gravitationally induced settling. It will also support study of phenomena occurring in static assemblies of solid particulates and in pneumatic transport. MGMR will support exploration of static, transient, and steady-state flow conditions. In micro-gravity, low speed pneumatic transport can cause aggregation of particles resulting in the formation of gel-like structures which grow to fill available volumes. Such fractal-lattice particulate-gels are a potential blocking mechanism that could affect low-velocity pneumatic transport in human habitation systems and/or ISRU operations on asteroids or other small bodies such as the moons of Mars. Understanding what contributes to the strength of such gels and developing the means to avoid or disrupt them will be crucial for the design of solids transport systems in future ISRU facilities. The MGMR will provide a unique environment for advancement of both fundamental science and of technologies important for the advancement of solar system exploration. The MGMR will also serve as a subscale testbed for the fabrication of radiation shields made from asteroid regolith for human deep space habitats.","The MGMR facility developed under this effort will address both fundamental science and technology development need of NASA and its commercial partners. There is no terrestrial research facility that can study aggregation of millimeter-scale agglomerates or particles,  a fundamental process in the formation of planetesimals and a process that must be understood for future NASA and commercial applications such as asteroid ISRU and air circulation and filtering in long life deep space environmental control systems. Also, no terrestrial test facility exists that can test low-velocity, low-density-gas pneumatic transport concepts suitable for movement of regolith and other granular solids on asteroids or in processing facilities on the moons of Mars.  Such equipment might be very beneficial for ISRU applications; however, such equipment will not be considered for deep space missions if we do not know enough about potential failure mechanisms, or about design parameter space to design and construct robust micro-g pneumatic transport systems. The proposed facility will allow appropriate science and engineering tests to be conducted in a readily accessible location and in an appropriate environment. In addition this facility will be well suited as a test environment for third party commercial use on ISS supporting NASA contracts.","Commercial space mining is a rapidly ascending industry. Large companies such as Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance are investing in this area and a $200M commercial venture fund has been established for this industry simulating the creation of several rapidly growing small companies. TransAstra Corporation is part of this new resource-recovery industry, which also includes companies such as Deep Space Industries, Planetary Resources, Moon Express, and Shakleton Energy. These companies anticipate excavating, transporting and processing large quantities of regolith to recover water and other volatiles and to process the minerals for fabrication of radiation shielding or structures.  Such operations will involve transporting, storing and handling large quantities of granular solids under reduced or micro-gravity.  Advancement of the understanding of the fundamental behavior of granular materials under reduced gravity conditions and under reduced gas pressures or vacuum conditions will be critical for them in designing their equipment and processes. The industry will have a strong interest in the science and technological developments that can come from a micro-g granular materials research facility. We are confident that our company, and others will want to sponsor purely commercial directed studies using the facility once it is available on the ISS.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Fluids; In Situ Manufacturing; Nonspecified; Outreach; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Tools/EVA Tools",ISS Utilization and Microgravity Research   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Silicon carbide (SiC) switches provide fast, low loss switching, low on-resistance and high breakdown voltage to potentially meet this need. Gate drivers are a key component to fully realize the system level advantages that SiC power switches can provide. By implementing gate drivers in SiC, they can tolerate extreme temperatures (500 deg. C) allowing them to be collocated with the power switches they control. This reduces parasitic inductance and circuit area improving the performance of the power switch and converter. The SiC gate driver will have direct near term application in power processing units and other NASA power conversion systems and also be suitable for future exploration missions in extreme environments.In Phase I, we will design and simulate the gate driver to show its feasibility. In Phase II, we will fabricate the gate drivers and demonstrate them operating at high temperature in a practical circuit such as a high voltage boost converter. We will also perform radiation testing on the gate driver to evaluate its radiation hardness as need for extended space operation. Following Phase II, we will integrate the gate driver with co-packaged SiC switches for NASA and commercial applications. Additionally, the advancement in TRL demonstrated by Phase II testing will help accelerate commercial availability of USCi's SiC integrated circuit fabrication service.","SiC gate drivers can be used with existing discrete SiC power devices to implement scalable, high operating temperature, radiation hard power management and distribution systems and power processing units for satellites and other spacecraft. In these applications, the gate drivers will enable low mass power electronics for space by fully enabling the performance advantages of SiC switches.   The extreme temperature capability and radiation tolerance will make them useful for even the most demanding space applications such as the exploration of Venus and long duration Jupiter/Europa missions. Earth based applications for SiC gate drivers include electrically driven actuators on more electric aircraft and gate drivers for switches in aircraft circuit protection applications. In these applications the gate drivers are co-located with power switches which see high temperatures due to close location with the power switches and due to heating during electrical overstress events.","The SiC gate driver and SiC integrated circuits in general will also have applications in the areas of defense, aerospace, scientific research, energy exploration, and industrial controls. DoD needs high temperature and radiation tolerant power electronics for space and missile defense applications. The automotive industry could utilize SiC gate drivers in their efforts to operate SiC switches at temperatures higher than 175 deg. C. Scientific applications include instrumentation and power devices for physics research facilities which place extreme demands on power electronics technology. High temperature electronics, including power electronics, are needed for improved downhole tools for geothermal energy exploration, development, and production as future super critical wells will require electronics operating at junction temperatures over 400 deg.

This technology can support both symmetric primary mirrors and off-axis segments for segmented telescopes. The recurring fabrication cost and cycle time for these mirrors is quite low, once nonrecurring equipment (e.g. the optical test set) has been completed. For example, a 0.25 m diameter mirror with >2 KHz first mode and 19.5 kg/m2 would be fabricated in < 30 days. A 0.75 m diameter mirror with >350 Hz first mode at 21 kg/m2 would be completed in <60 days. The cost of these mirrors (especially at sizes > 1 m) depends strongly on the stiffness requirements, because stiffness drives overall mirror volume. Fabrication costs for the blank and polishing are expected to be between $0.3M/m2 and $0.4 M/m2 for sizes up to 1 m, and <$0.6 M/m2 for sizes up to 2 m. Initial FEA indicates that these mirror blanks will be more thermally stable than ULE mirrors. The goal of these technology is to produce aspheric mirror blanks which can support: - 10 nm RMS global surface figure - 5 nm RMS mid-spatial frequency errors - 1 nm RMS surface roughness This Phase I SBIR will produce and thermo optically test a 100 mm mirror, while applying heat loads representative of those seen by a mirror in a reasonable telescope shroud. In Phase II, this technology will be demonstrated by making a 0.2 m diameter diffraction limited telescope flat field telescope with a 0.2 m diameter primary mirror that is ~20 kg/m2, >400 Hz first mode, 10 nm RMS surface, and has <5 nm RMS midspatial frequency errors.","In the 2010 Decadal Survey, NASA identified several needs for next generation space telescopes under TA08. Of the top technical challenges, rapid time scale development was identified as the first need, both in order to explore innovative ideas and to fit the exploration within an Explorer or a Discovery class mission. The number two need was high performance, stable, low areal density optics normal incidence optics that could be manufactured at lower cost. These three technologies allow diffraction limited visible wavelength telescope mirrors at a cost and schedule that is an order of magnitude lower than current technologies. The lower cost makes large segmented telescopes affordable. The lower cost and schedule allow a significant expansion of what can be addressed within the cost caps for Explorer and Discovery class missions. The ability to rapidly fabricate these mirrors takes a fragile, expensive, and long lead item off of the critical path and allows a significant reduction in the quality oversight associated with protecting items that have a multi-year lead time. NASA clearly needs a better solution. The goal of this program is to reduce both cost and schedule by an order of magnitude by changing the technologies used to build lightweight mirrors.","Mirrors for commercial remote sensing satellites have requirements that are very similar to NASA UVO telescope mirrors. This applies to larger systems, such as those flown by DigitalGlobe, as well as to smaller systems, such as those flown by SkyBox. For systems like these, current technology imposes costs beyond just the telescope costs. The long lead time of mirrors for telescopes leads to spiraling costs. To protect a long lead, critical path item programs add quality oversight, which can add 60% to the cost. This makes the telescope even more expensive and demands additional reliability and quality oversight. The telescope costs are particularly painful for commercial ventures that must turn a profit in order to attract investment. For example, Planetary Labs requires lightweight telescopes for asteroid surveys. These systems need to be diffraction limited and they are both cost and launch mass sensitive, since they are trying to do surveys at a significant standoff and on a limited budget.",Mirrors; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Telescope Arrays; Ultraviolet; Visible,Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Ideally, the shielding material would be of dual use, i.e., shielding and structural.  Recently, a tailorable multifunctional composite with increased structural strength combined with efficient shielding against GCR and secondary neutrons was developed by this team.  For these multifunctional composites to be seriously considered for such applications as crew vehicles and habitats, their durability against the overall space environment such as atomic oxygen, UV radiation, and temperature extremes have to be evaluated. During this effort, we aim to further improve the multifunctional radiation shielding material and use the MISSE-FF facility to test our composite against the combined space environment.  To further improve the shielding and structural properties of the composite,  incorporation of boron nitride as nanophase particles or tubes (BNNT) and enriched boron carbide will be evaluated.  Aside from having large cross-section for neutron attenuation, significant enhancements in strength and stiffness can be expected from incorporating these phases in the composite architecture. In addition to radiation and mechanical testing, these advanced composites will ultimately have to be tested against the combined space environment, which will be conducted during Phase 2 and 3 efforts.","Potential NASA applications for this technology include structural radiation shielding for the protection of humans and electronics in aerospace transportation vehicles, space transportation vehicles, large space structures, such as space stations, orbiters, landing vehicles, rovers, habitats, and nuclear propulsion.  Potential customers include Boeing, Orbital-ATK, Lockheed, and other NASA contractors.","In addition to NASA markets, this technology can be leveraged across the broader nuclear market.

Propulsion systems offer some of the harshest possible design conditions from a materials perspective and the demands placed on engineering materials will become more rigorous in future systems. The combination of structural and environmental constraints often dictate that ceramics and metals be used synergistically. Unfortunately, the limitations of ceramic-metal joining are exacerbated in these same environments where simultaneous use of ceramics and metals would be most useful. Large discrepancies in thermal expansion coefficients and near-planar interfaces lead to delamination and spallation even in the best engineered bonds. As a novel approach to this problem, Glacigen will create robust C-M interfaces by grading from one material phase to the other through a tailorable thickness. The technique is materials flexible, enjoys exceptional damage tolerance, and can accept significant mismatches in thermal expansion coefficients. The method for producing FGM sheets presented in this proposal will have the added advantage of controlled anisotropic properties within the sheets. In particular, it is anticipated that this new material system will be particularly valued for its damage tolerance at the interface where up to 96% of the interface can be destroyed before contact area is reduced to that of a planar joint with the same footprint. A second point of unique value will lie in the utility of engineered anisotropy where through thickness thermal conductivity is expected to be dramatically higher than in-plane thermal conductivity. Phase I efforts will demonstrate fabrication of these sheets and will include the characterization of mechanical, thermal, and functional properties.","Specific applications which are foreseen at this time include hybrid electric propulsion systems, damage-tolerant radiators, and gas turbine components. The fundamental technology also has the potential to extend into high-temperature aerostructures. As efforts continue in the development of hypersonic vehicles, extreme environmental conditions dictate the need for better ceramic-metal interfaces along the leading edges of these structures.","NASA applications in hybrid electric propulsion systems, gas turbine components, and thermal management systems can be directly applied similar or identical problems of commercial interest.","Atmospheric Propulsion; Ceramics; Composites; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Launch Engine/Booster; Passive Systems; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)",Propulsion Efficiency-Propulsion Materials and Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

SiC is a visible-blind material with very low intrinsic dark current, able to operate at >350C.  Expanding from our past successful demonstration of UV sensors and MOSFET circuits on the same substrate, we will develop fabrication processes and capabilities to design and integrate SiC pn-junction photodiodes and low-voltage MOSFET devices with the required small dimensions.  To our knowledge, this represents the first program to scale SiC optoelectronic circuits to such feature size restrictions; particularly, a 1μm MOSFET gate length and submicron margins for layer overlaps. Scaling monolithically-integrated sensors and transistors to submicron feature sizes advances the SiC technology state-of-the-art.  We plan to extend our process flow and device designs to use a semiconductor reduction stepper during fabrication to enable submicron features.  We will demonstrate single pn-junction photodiodes, photodiodes with MOSFETs in the 3-transistor pixel architecture, and arrays of both these structures.  We will deliver a 32 x 32 passive array and a 4 x 4 active array that contains SiC MOSFETs as well as photodiodes. This effort lays the groundwork for developing a megapixel array in a future Phase II or related program. We will further design planar SiC avalanche photodiodes and planar APD arrays, as the initial step to monolithically integrating APDs with their readout electronics and therefore obtain a high-temperature-operation-capable detector, sensitive to extremely low illumination levels. The entire design and fabrication will be performed in the United States, and using CoolCAD's patent pending fabrication processes.","We propose to design and fabricate, SiC intrinsically visible-blind, 10μm pitch, small-pixel-size UV and EUV detectors and active pixels. We also plan to design monolithic Geiger mode avalanche photodetectors, which can replace large and expensive multiplier tubes. These devices and optoelectronic integrated circuits have immediate applications in high-resolution imagers, and sensor and spectroscopy instrument components.  Such components are usable for missions such as the successors to the Solar Orbiter, missions of the Living with a Star program, and other solar and terrestrial probes such as DYNAMIC and MEDICI, as well as in future instruments such as JEM-EUSO and OWL ultra-high energy cosmic ray instruments. The work described here also represents significant steps forward in SiC technology in general, and in monolithic integration of SiC sensors with their readout circuitry in particular.  Low-power, high-sensitivity, extreme-environment-capable sensor technology is facilitated as SiC technology matures, with significant implications for the fabrication of low-weight, robust, efficient payloads, meeting the needs of future programs such as GEO-CAPE, the next-generation GOES and SOHO, and planetary science missions.  The design and fabrication performed totally in the United States, and in close proximity to the NASA GSFC, which will be able to take advantage of CoolCAD's capability to fabricate application specific optoelectronic integrated circuits.","One of the largest extant markets for UV detection is sanitation and water filtration.  UV water purification systems are in increasingly wide use. The target wavelength is 260nm, which denatures bacteria proteins. Such systems, which currently have a market size of $750 million, require sensors to monitor the efficacy of the system over time.  CoolCAD Electronics is currently collaborating with several UV filtration companies to test SiC photodetector parts fabricated in-house. The shorter UV wavelength allows for higher imaging resolution, leading to commercial applications in manufacturing and quality control, for defect monitoring and material fatigue inspection, and in monitoring weld quality in industrial welding applications.  In addition, SiC UV detectors have application for oil and gas exploration where they can replace expensive photomultiplier tubes. A military and government application area of UV sensors with high sensitivity in the EUV, VUV and Deep UV regions is early warning systems, since rocket and jet engine plumes emit UV radiation. There are also emergent non-line-of-sight communication systems using UV signals, which will significantly benefit from monolithic integration of UV photodetectors and communication electronics.","Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Prototyping; Ultraviolet; X-rays/Gamma Rays","Detector Technologies for UV, X-Ray, Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Instruments   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

As stated in the call, the Technologies for Detection of Extant Life subtopic seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. Because there is no single measurable signature of life, this will require advances in a variety of areas, from those involving sample processing to the detailed components of chemical and optical instruments. Searches for extant life can take place in a variety of environments, including ocean depths, ice sheets, dry deserts, seasonal flows, or even dense atmospheres; technologies are required for handling samples obtained from any or all of these environments. Preprocessing technologies required for those samples may include separation, concentration, dilution, drying, staining, mixing, and many other common processes for laboratory analysis, but which must be done in a remote, autonomous environment. Tests of whether a given sample contains or indicates the presence of extant life include the full range of microbiological and chemical techniques, but those that do not require the addition of potential biomarkers (e.g., complex organics) as part of the test are preferred. We have spent he past 5 years developing a novel means of capturing and concentrating organic molecules onto specialized graphene surfaces, available for later detailed analysis. The adaptation of this technology could offer a new avenue for the detection of key organic elements in ocean environments that contain many background elemental noise sources.","Soon after our work began with graphene sheets and the ability to adsorb biomolecules, we began to wonder whether there would be a means of no just adsorbing the species, but identifying key factors about target analytes of interest without have to resort to complicated platforms such as mass spectrometry. While immunoassays provide high sensitivity to many target species, they must be constructed with some prior knowledge of the target. Such is likely not to be the case for alien organic molecules, although some basic assumptions can be made. As indicated by Dr. Willis at JPL, amino acids are a good start for the search for life. Consequently we wanted to find additional ways in which graphene could assist the search for life in alien oceans. One possibility may be using graphene nanopores to attract, sequence, and retain organic molecules of interest. Nanopore based analysis is currently an area of great interest in many disciplines with the potential for incredibly versatile applications. These include sensing small molecules such as ions, nucleotides, enantiomers, and drugs, as well as larger polymers such as PEG, RNA, DNA, amino acids, and polypeptides. Single pore sensing is a label-free single molecule recognition approach requiring very low sample volumes without sample preparations or amplifications. The detection of organic molecules using graphene in several ways is therefore a versatile method for a number of NASA life detection missions.","Our work over the past 5 years developing a novel means of capturing and concentrating organic molecules onto specialized graphene surfaces, under DARPA support for medical diagnostics.

In cases where classical schemes are not considered trustworthy, key distribution by courier is typically used.  Unlike human courier networks, quantum cryptography has the ability to detect interception of the key, has greater reliability and operating costs, and is automatic and instantaneous.  For long distance quantum communication to be practical, ground-to-space links are a necessity due to the current limitations of optical fiber and photon detectors in ground-to-ground links.

The proposed innovation is the first attempt to use advanced surface nano-engineering technologies to control the formation, propagation and annihilation mechanism of extended defects including dislocations in multijunction solar cells.  There is significant gap between the theoretically calculated efficiency of multijunction solar cells and the experimental results. That efficiency gap increases with the increase of number of junctions/subcells. Misfit dislocations created due to high lattice mismatch between subcells play a major role in hampering the efficiency and reliability of such devices. A successful implementation of nano-ELOG in solar cells will results in 3J solar cells with significantly reduced dislocation density, resulting in an improved Voc and Isc and conversation efficiencies of the cells. Therefore, MLD can utilize this method to grow devices with increased number of junctions to reach practical efficiencies close to 40% (6J) from the current 30% (in commercially available 3J cells) in AM0 and 1sun conditions. It is important to explore, and consequently, take advantage of the latest nano-patterning developments for NASA's photovoltaic devices.","An application for this technology is in building low-cost, high-efficiency, highly reliable and lightweight solar cell arrays for use in solar-powered spacecraft.  The resulting lightweight flexible solar cell arrays with improved record-efficiencies will be an attractive replacement for the existing stiff, heavy carbon fiber panel-based arrays.  For NASA, this will be an enabling technology for solar electric propulsion or any mission that requires electrical power.

Specifically, the innovation in the propellant accelerator and a design with no charge neutralization will enable the device to fully use the potential of any ionic liquid monopropellant, including the advanced energetic monopropellant AF-M315E, the ""green propellant."" As a result, this technology offers balanced and throttled high thrust and variable impulse per unit of volume, which allows for the control of attitude and high efficiency, which directly address NASA's Small Spacecraft Technology Program. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the BEST approach by the combination of proof-of-concept analysis and experiments with the BEST conceptual prototype to reach TRL-3. In Phase II, POC will design and build a BEST prototype, measure its performance and plume characteristics, demonstrate and deliver it to NASA to achieve TRL-6 at the end of Phase II activities.","The proposed concept is further improvement of a colloidal thruster by a novel approach to particle acceleration. As a result, high exit velocity of charged particles and wide range throttling are achievable at a reduced magnitude of applied voltage and full use of the mass of propellant. As an example of electrical propulsion, the proposed thruster utilizes renewable solar energy, thus significantly reducing the launch mass of a spacecraft or satellite. Thus, NASA's related applications include all missions requiring high thrust per unit of consumed power, especially ones where power is limited, and missions requiring attitude control, provided here by the ability to vary specific impulse and thrust. Examples of related NASA missions include the Nodes technology demonstration mission, the CubeSat Proximity Operations Demonstration mission, the Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator mission, and other NASA's missions in science, exploration, space operations, and aeronautics, including those with crosscutting applications for NASA and other users. The proposed thruster concept is directly related to the Small Spacecraft Technology Program's current focus areas such as a propulsion, pointing, and autonomous operations.","While small spacecraft, including military surveillance and GPS satellites, are currently delivered to space by traditional, chemical propulsion thrusters, electrical propulsion is the growing trend in orbit correction and maneuver. It enables dedicated ride-sharing, where an integrator books a complete launch mission and sells the available capacity to multiple spacecraft operators without the need for a primary customer. Solar electrical propulsion resolved the issue with electric power, but the use of separate propellant (from chemical thrusters) limits the lifetime of electrical thrusters. The implementation of multimode propulsion, i.e., sharing propellant with chemical propulsion drives, significantly extends the lifetime of electrical thrusters. Another attractive field for low-thrust electrical propulsion is the market in nanosatellites and microsatellites. These miniaturized, low-cost satellites are designed for commercial, communication, and space research purposes. Continual reduction in the cost of nanosatellites and microsatellites, increasing demand across verticals, and increases in the number of application areas, are expected to remain the major drivers behind increased traction in the nanosatellite and microsatellite market. Therefore, the compact, high thrust, impulse density thruster will benefit NASA's Small Spacecraft Technology Program as well the military space programs.",Attitude Determination & Control; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices,Small Spacecraft Propulsion Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In many cases these heat exchangers and condensers are fabricated using passivated stainless steel to retard corrosion and fouling processes, representing a significant weight penalty even for heat exchangers with minimal solid material. Leveraging extensive experience in the design and fabrication of ultra-compact heat exchangers, evaporators, and condensers using photochemically etched thin metal laminates, microVection has developed a concept for fabricating ultra-lightweight compact microfinned heat exchangers using 3-D printing technology. The concept involves 3-D printing a frame using relatively low-cost resins, followed by fully-dense plating of the frame to produce the desired heat exchanger feature dimensions. Heat exchanger fabrication is completed through heating in a furnace to remove the frame. The result is a heat exchanger that possesses all of the benefits of a laminated microfinned heat exchanger without the design constraints of continuous load paths through the structure. The proposed effort supports the NASA goal of reducing the mass and increasing the efficiency of heat acquisition components (per the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap, TA 14.2.1 Heat Acquisition). Specific goals of the program are to design a heat exchanger with a performance metric below 0.4 kg/kW-K, eliminate the need for bonded/brazed joints, and demonstrate the ability to fabricate the concept.","The reduction in weight and volume, coupled with increased thermal performance, provides significant improvement to the effectiveness of heat exchangers, while reducing the heat exchanger's impact in terms of system integration. Potential benefits include reduced fuel burn and improved system performance, in alignment with NASA's goals. This technology would be applicable to any NASA application where heat exchangers are required and where weight has a significant impact on system performance. NASA programs the concept could impact include ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons), DRM 5 (Asteroid Redirect), DRM 6 (Crewed to Near Earth Asteroid), DRM 7 (Crewed to Lunar Surface), and DRM 8 & 9 (Crewed to Mars).","Lightweight and compact heat exchanger units have uses across a wide range of applications. The impact of such an advancement in heat exchanger technology cannot be overstated, as the applicability to the military and commercial sectors is vast. Improving the thermal performance of the heat exchangers enables process and performance improvements throughout the potential usage scenarios, reduction in weight has cascading impacts on such things as fuel consumption and system performance, while reduction in volume improves system integration and packaging considerations. It is not difficult to envision the multitude of positive impacts such technology could have across a wide array of industries, and these attractive features offer a compelling value proposition to companies.",Analytical Methods; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Distribution/Management; Heat Exchange; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling,Thermal Management   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The effects of this environment has been a topic of research for many years.  Issues include the exposure for humans under acute and continuous exposures and the radiogenic cancer risk that rises with total dose and is a limiting constraint on long-duration missions. The proposed metal alloy development produces a material that is multi-functional and light-weight for deep space missions.  The target material has a significant reduction in mass and potentially volume for protective performance such as radiation and debris shielding applications as well as potential performance thermally and acoustically. Development of these new Mg alloys will improve the margin and overall risk associated with each of these scenarios by improving the shielding performance and provides a reduction in the likelihood of electronic component failure occurrence as well as a reduction in consequence. Equally important, this will reduce the risk of cancer to personnel from radiation exposure.  With respect to electronic systems, the systems that provide life support and are considered critical systems are vulnerable to the ionizing radiation effects as well.  Once the ""heavy"" particles penetrate the electronic components, shorts are created in worst case conditions and provide temporary upsets in the best conditions.  Similarly, those electronic systems that are considered non-critical, similar effects are seen but have consequences that effect the mission assurance aspects.  By replacing existing metallic components with appropriate Mg alloys, such as the ones from this project, both vehicle weight and crew dose rate can be reduced. The operational benefits of such a change are manifold. For example, weight can be replaced with fuel to achieve greater vehicle velocity.  Alternatively, mission duration could be extended while operating within equivalent dose limits.","This project provides a better alternative to continue along the path for improved multi-functional light-weight Mg alloys.  The new metal alloy will improve both NASA Safety and Mission Assurance by offering better protection for the astronauts as well as improving shielding effectiveness of both critical and non-critical electronic systems.  For both human and electronic scenarios, the new Mg alloy will improve the margin and overall risk associated with each of these scenarios by improving the shielding performance and provides a reduction in the likelihood of occurrence as well as respective consequence.  Specific NASA deployment includes deep space mobile (as well as ISS) habitats, crew spacecraft (Organically and Commercial Crew developed), Mars/Moon fixed habitats, unmanned spacecraft, and launch vehicle/propulsion systems.  Such changes may make a manned mission to Mars more feasible.  The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) study showed that in interplanetary space the time to a 3% risk of exposure-induced death (REID), the NASA career cancer risk limit would be reached in under 400 days for a 30-year old male and under 300 days for a 30-year old female.  The LRO study assumed a thin aluminum alloy layer under the shielding that was tested.  If the aluminum were changed to Mg alloys used in this project, it is possible that those calculations could be extended.","This project models and developed multi-functional lightweight Mg alloys, with optimal thickness and chemistry for increasing strength and absorbing neutrons. With the recent approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for Mg use in commercial airliner seats (i.e., nonstructural applications), widespread adoption of Mg would allow for high-efficiency aircraft, which could be transformational for the transportation sector. The doped Mg materials that were investigated in this project could be used for reducing the atmospheric radiation exposure of commercial flight crews and passengers on terrestrial polar flights where exposure to radiation has been shown to be significantly higher than on other routes.","Air Transportation & Safety; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",Radiation Shielding Technologies for Human Protection   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The tensegrital wheel emulates the behavior of a variable pressure tire without the need for an inflation system. The construction of the tensegrital wheel is such that it absorbs and diffuses ground forces fairly evenly. The stiffness of the tensegrital wheel can be tuned to match the demands of a given environment that the wheel is to operate in or can be adjusted on-the-fly. These attributes allow for better adaptation to the terrain thus increasing the amount of thrust that can be generated at the wheel/ground interface, and improving a vehicle's dynamic response and obstacle negotiation abilities. We assert that the tensegrital wheel can be designed to achieve a very high strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional capacity for long-life specifically in the context of planetary exploration. For the Phase I of this SBIR project we aim to prove the feasibility of the tensegrital wheel and quantify its capabilities and limitations through analysis, prototyping, and testing.  The technology proposed here is of particular value to planetary missions involving mobility over various terrain geometries and ground compositions.","The tensegrital wheel would benefit future NASA planetary exploration missions by enhancing the mobility and controllability of surface exploration rovers. The ability of the tensegrital wheel to better conform to the terrain and its inherent capacity to evenly distribute reaction loads through its structure would result in measurable improvements in in-soil traversability, obstacle climbing, stability, and response to dynamic events.The proposed wheel system affords significant advantages over existing wheel systems for planetary rovers. While the structural design of existing wheel systems provides compliance approximating that of a pneumatic tire, such compliance is fixed by the design. Pneumatics, while providing adjustability of compliance by varying tire pressure, are impractical in application to a planetary rover due to requirements for gas supply, pumps, valves, etc. and are furthermore subject to leakage at the tire, piping and pneumatic swivels which are requires to make such a system work.","The utility of the tensegrital wheel goes beyond planetary rover missions. Terrestrial systems may take advantage of the unique performance characteristics of this wheel design. Many military vehicles currently use active control of tire air pressure to adjust compliance of the tires and deal with deflation due to punctures. As with planetary rover systems, using the tensegrital wheel for this application negates the need for pumps, pneumatic lines and pneumatic rotary joints. No pneumatic tire means no risk of puncture. In addition, the tensegrital wheel offers a lightweight alternative to unconventional wheel designs.Farm and industrial vehicles can find application for the tensegrital wheel as well. A tractor, for instance, might negotiate cross slopes more safely and effectively by selectively adjusting the compliance of the wheels so that the uphill wheels are more compliant than the downhill wheels providing a measure of center-of-gravity control. Likewise the pose of industrial vehicles such as manlifts can be provided with additional control through the use of the tensegrital wheel technology.",Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Structures; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems),Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Existing robot systems have largely relied on a combination of highly-controlled, known environments and slow, carefully preplanned motions that require intensive human preparation and oversight. This strategy leaves little room for variation or adaptability in the face of unforeseen errors and limits the amount of direct interaction the robot can have with its environment.Consider the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) arm. This system is used to grapple payloads docking with the ISS and to transport astronauts for EVA operations. In the first case, the payloads remain essentially stationary relative to the ISS, while in the second, the manipulator remains stationary during the actual EVA activity. The current SSRMS software simply does not support dynamic activities such as acquiring a moving object, nor does it allow the astronauts to use its capabilities to assist them during the EVA task. Similarly, consider the tasks performed by the R5 humanoid robot during both the DARPA Robotics Challenge and for the ongoing NASA Space Robotics Challenge. These tasks include manipulating objects such as communication dishes, valves and buttons that are placed in fixed locations. In each case, the robot is commanded to perform a series of carefully constructed actions, typically relying on a remote human operator to react at rates slower than necessary for many crucial tasks. Handling non-rigid soft goods, grabbing a tool from a human co-worker, or using a wrench to tighten a bolt with a specific torque are well beyond the current mission capabilities.To address these challenges, we propose an application development framework in which both experts and non-experts can draw upon a set of reactive control actions to quickly program complex robots to perform complex tasks, expanding their capabilities and advancing the state of the art.","NASA manipulators deployed in space, such as SSRMS and Dextre, as well as research platforms, such as Centaur and R5, are all currently limited by the lack of a framework for commanding and monitoring actions that incorporate reactivity and dynamics. Missions involving these and other NASA robots will benefit immediately from the delivered results of this project, enabling them to accomplish tasks that are currently infeasible. The existing CRAFTSMAN tool-suite was developed in collaboration with NASA, and is currently in use in research labs at NASA. Specifically, the proposed work will have initial applications to visiting vehicle and robotic operations on ISS. We have close relationships with Dr. Kim Hambuchen, Mr. Kris Verdeyen, Dr. Bill Bluethmann, and Dr. Ron Diftler at NASA JSC and have discussed with some of them potential applications of the current and proposed CRAFTSMAN tool-suite on R5. Other TRACLabs software, compatible with CRAFTSMAN, is being evaluated for use in ground control operations for the Resource Prospector (RP) robot being developed by NASA JSC and ARC for lunar surface operations. We have also worked with Dr. Jeremy Frank (NASA ARC) to look how the CRAFTSMAN software may integrate with his on-board ISS automated procedure project. Additionally, TRACLabs has contacts with MOD ROBO flight controllers, including Quinn Carelock (NASA FOD) and Scott Wenger (robotics team lead) where the capabilities of this work could be applied.","TRACLabs is already working with a large automotive supplier to integrate CRAFTSMAN into a production cell in a factory by mid-July 2017. This ""flexible workcell"" will be the first of its kind for this industry leader. TRACLabs is also working with Dr. Chris Thayer and Mr. Chris McQuin at Motiv Space Systems (MSS) to port the CRAFTSMAN software to their Robosimian quadruped robot sold to universities. Motiv has expressed real interest in the reactive control extensions discussed in this proposal. In both cases, discussions on how to license the CRAFTSMAN software for use in these customers' applications are currently underway.These customers have chosen CRAFTSMAN to be the software to integrate into their systems because the need for easy-to-use but capable software for industrial applications is becoming increasingly needed. As such, we expect substantial interest from other commercial customers in the automotive, energy, construction, and service sectors, and will investigate potential opportunities aggressively. For example, TRACLabs also has close contacts with General Electric (GE) including Dr. Roland Menassa, Mr. John Lizzi, and Dr. Shiraj Sen where CRAFTSMAN could be applied to numerous systems in multiple domains, such as nuclear waste disposal.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Perception/Vision; Process Monitoring & Control; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Teleoperation",Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These reliability standards are typically met via hardware redundancy. Multiple, dissimilar components of hardware designated for a single purpose increases the physical redundancy and offers a viable way to detect and correct for hardware malfunctions. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are often subject to weight/power constraints and therefore unable to accommodate similar redundancies. A common approach to solving this problem has been to employ analytical redundancy in the form of fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithms. Although significant breakthroughs have been achieved in increasing UAS redundancies analytically, certification has been challenging. The primary objective of the proposed work is to develop a software architecture for UAS that provides certifiable analytical redundancy. The proposed approach is called algorithmic redundancy, owing to its underlying philosophy of increasing UAS reliability via multiple, dissimilar FDI algorithms. Certification of an algorithmically redundant system relies on well-established methods similar to those for hardware redundant systems. We propose to develop a framework for evaluating and selecting FDI algorithms, combining them to build algorithmically redundant software and finally, assess the overall reliability for certification","The proposed algorithmic redundancy framework for UAS directly addresses three of the six strategic thrusts in the current NASA ARMD Strategic Implementation Plan. Thrust 1: ?Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations? will be addressed by a sustained focus on reducing risks in UAS to maintain acceptable levels of safety for all air traffic. Thrust 5: ?Real-time, System-Wide Safety Assurance? will be addressed by the development of an analytic technique that directly addresses and mitigates UAS risks toward integrated, system-wide safety assurance. Thrust 6: ?Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation? is addressed by the development of an innovative redundant FDI framework that will better enable safe integration of UAS into the NAS. NASA is also addressing air traffic management for low-altitude drones with the goal of developing a system to ensure safe entry of new UAS. The proposed algorithmic redundancy framework will benefit this system by providing safety assurance.","The low-altitude (<500 ft.) drone industry is growing rapidly in the commercial sector with the emergence of new autonomous UAS applications including package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and environmental and agricultural monitoring. At higher altitudes, emerging commercial UAS technologies include high-altitude communications relay systems for expanding internet access to remote areas. The proposed algorithmic redundancy framework will be beneficial for ensuring that new commercial UAS in these applications will be safely integrated with less hardware redundancy, reducing weight and increasing achievable performance bounds. UAS are prolific in the DoD with many currently operational UAS and others that are nearing operational status. There are several other DoD programs where smaller UAS are at lower but increasing TRLs. The proposed algorithmic redundancy framework has direct application to these DoD UAS by providing detailed risk assessment and mitigation for safety assurance using less hardware redundancy, resulting in lower weight and increased performance.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Process Monitoring & Control; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

We will rearchitect FUN3D to take advantage of HPC tools we are currently building for NASA Goddard, using a dynamically-scheduled, task-based approach, with the goals of improving scalability, performance on the CPU, and the amenability to accelerators current and future. In Phase I, the focus will be on proving the validity and applicability of our approach for a given subset of FUN3D code. To meet this goal, we have identified two primary objectives for Phase I: rearchitect FUN3D and develop a prototype demonstrating feasibility. This will decouple the science being performed from the intricacies of implementations on a variety of platforms. In Phase II, we will build off this work to create a full accelerated solver for ongoing use. Once complete, the full solver will be efficient on today's hardware and easily adaptable to future systems.","FUN3D is mission-critical software, and is used to analyze many types of air vehicles.

This technology allows for the manufacture of a single aperture that can be tuned to operate on two separate frequencies, allowing for simultaneous transmit and receive. The transmit and receive beams can be controlled individually, allowing each to have its own frequency, pointing angle, and polarization. This technology allows the use of one antenna where two are typically required, resulting in dramatic size, weight, power, and cost benefits to the platform.Kymeta has built dual frequency antennas using this technology ranging in frequency from Ku-band (11 GHz) to Ka-band (30 GHz) and in aperture diameters ranging from 20 cm to 70 cm.This antenna is well suited for 12U or larger platforms which benefit from simultaneous transmit and receive, wide scan range, fast scanning rates, and the ability to dynamically update the polarization of the antenna.KGS objectives for the Phase I effort are: (1) Identify requirements for a low-SWAP Ka-band ISL antenna for small spacecraft, and (2) perform modeling, analysis, and conceptual design for a dual frequency antenna that operates in both the TDRSS forward and return link bands.This analysis will result in performance predictions for the dual frequency antenna which will be used to determine whether a dual frequency aperture or two single frequency apertures are the best solution to meet mission requirements. If this project is selected for a Phase II award, Phase II will complete design and fabrication of the selected antenna solution.","This low-SWAP Ka-band ISL antenna is a small, lightweight antenna which provides high gain without the use of mechanical steering or phase shifters. This technology enables a high data rate communications solution for small satellites which, when paired with sensors, would provide NASA with the ability to receive high volumes of sensor data from geographically distributed satellites. This has potential applications to a variety of NASA interests, including communications and Earth observation activities.","The Northern Sky Research (NSR) Small Satellite Markets report released in October 2016 describes a market of nearly 300 launches of small satellites between 1 and 100 kg every year between 2018 and 2024. Potential commercial customers in this market are those who would benefit from the high data rate communications that results from a Ka-band connection, as well as those companies for whom the reduction in latency of communication would prove a benefit. KGS expect significant growth in this area resulting from the growth of small satellite constellations both in commercial and government markets. The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) has publically announced plans to perform a demonstration using Ka-band communications within a constellation of 16 small satellites.

The new Dynamically Reconfigurable Electrical Power System (DREPS) fully featured small-satellite power system modular architecture incorporates a number of new technologies enabling a solution that is capable of input and output power levels up to 100W in a 0.5U CubeSat form factor.  Integration of state-of-the-art technologies such as Wide Bandgap MOSFETs, heat pipes, printed circuit board (PCB) integrated planar magnetics, digital system control and three-dimensional circuit layout techniques will aid in the ability to deliver an unparalleled level of system control while providing a solution focused on extreme environmental conditions needed for long duration space missions.  The new approach also provides solution for proposed new electric propulsion technologies via recent advances in high voltage ceramic-based power converter technology. Integration of cutting edge thermal management technology will enable adaptive retention or rejection of heat as a fully integral portion of the system packaging.  Additionally, an array of configurable Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Battery Control Regulators (BCR) will allow compatibility with all available industry standard solar cells and energy storage technologies.","NASA has planned, or is planning, a wide range of high orbit and deep space related missions in support of Earth sciences, planetary sciences, and Heliosphere studies. Science missions such as Astrobiology (e.g microorganisms), radiometrics, environmental monitoring (e.g. weather), relay communications, lunar resources, planetary magnetometry, etc. are increasingly under consideration by NASA to be implemented by SmallSats. As technology advances, these smaller spacecraft will become ever more viable to undertake these, and a wide range of other NASA missions, along with technology qualification missions.  The significant attention to enabling rad hard versions of the modular architecture in the proposed program will allow the same technology to be used for SmallSat and CubeSat missions aimed at operations in and beyond LEO orbits including MEO (Van Allan belt) as to address the needs of high value science missions. The same technology/products that can make have an impact on planned NASA science missions can make transformational impacts to such extended SmallSat missions that aim to deploy in MEO/GEO orbit (gamma ray and proton detectors, solar observation) and beyond (solar particle/space particle environment assessments) as to support NASA mission probe programs.","Several DoD agencies can immediately benefit and are obvious customers for the new modular reconfigurable EPS solution that offers SWaP advantages and significantly higher radiation tolerance.

As such, there is a movement away from traditional spherical optics to nonspherical optical lenses or mirror surfaces. Freeform optics are anticipated to enable benefits like fast wide-field and distortion-free cameras. Although various techniques to create complex optical surfaces are under investigation, the design and use of conformal and freeform shapes are currently costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. To address the need for lower-cost smaller-sized lighter-weight optics, freeform-surfaced 3D gradient-index optics will be developed that allow complex gradient-index profiles to be fabricated directly into the optical materials, allowing for optical power to be realized and for geometric and chromatic aberrations to be corrected, while reducing the tolerance requirements of freeform-surface machining. In Phase I, the 3D freeform optical-index materials will be demonstrated in planar, spherically figured, and 3D-freeform surface implementations. The 3D freeform GRIN materials will be shown to relax the requirements and lower the cost of optical design and manufacturing, while offering superior performance.","As size, weight, power, and cost specifications are vital to NASA missions, a wide variety of optical systems would benefit from the innovation.

AM is especially appealing for complex parts that would be costly or impossible to fabricate by machining or casting. It is also attractive for fabrication of prototype parts.At present there are no reliable, cost-effective process control techniques to minimize defect production and for qualification of finished parts. Studies at NASA, NIST, and other agencies have noted this gap and urged increased efforts to develop techniques for part qualification. In this project we will demonstrate the feasibility of applying laser ultrasonic testing to inspect each deposited layer in real time as it is formed. This in-line inspection qualifies the part layer-by-layer, ensuring finished parts that require no further testing. In Phase I we will first develop a database of the types and sizes of important defects in NASA-specific components. We will then optimize the beam configuration for sensitivity to these defects, and also develop signal processing algorithms to enhance defect detection and collect size information. In Phase II a prototype in-line inspection system will be developed and tested.","Additive manufacturing is finding broad applications by NASA and its contractors for the fabrication of high-value, safety-critical components. AM of components for rocket engines and spacecraft thrusters is particularly advanced. Within NASA, technology development and demonstration efforts for AM of metals are being conducted primarily at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Langley Research Center (LaRC), and Glenn Research Center (GRC). As an example, MSFC is pursuing AM of critical engine components for future heavy-lift space launch systems. GRC is collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne to develop a liquid-oxygen/gaseous hydrogen rocket injector assembly built by additive manufacturing.The inspection technology described in this proposal is aligned with the NASA Space Technology Roadmaps, and addresses needs described in the recent NASA memorandum ""Nondestructive Evaluation of Additive Manufacturing.""NASA's commercial space partners are actively involved in projects to incorporate AM components into their launch and spacecraft systems. For example, the SuperDraco engines for the SpaceX Dragon V2 manned spacecraft have 3D-printed combustion chambers that enable the engines to produce 100 times the thrust than the Draco engines in current unmanned versions of the Dragon.Eventual applications of AM will extend to production of replacement or repaired components in space.","Additive manufacturing is valuable for producing parts that are difficult or expensive to produce by machining or forging. Aside from space, industries that are adopting additive manufacturing include military and commercial aviation, automotive, medical/dental, and consumer products. Aircraft engine suppliers have been investing heavily in capacity for AM parts manufacturing. Key high-value components such as injection nozzles are found multiple times in a turbine engine. The use of AM will reduce engine weight and cost. Components designed with complex cooling channels that were expensive or even impossible to make can now be produced by AM.

This manufacturing process provides an alternative to 3D printing metals in space, which is difficult due to space environment or print quality issues.  Instead, the MAMBA-Process relies on an ingot forming technology to create a metal ingot.  This ingot can then be milled and machined to form a precision part using a standard CNC milling technique.  In order to minimize astronaut time and exposure to the process, the MAMBA-Process will be outfitted with a robotic assistant, using robotic assistance to remove the ingot from the press, to place the ingot in the mill, and to perform tool changes on the mill.  The MAMBA effort will also develop a novel process for management and recycling of metal chips in a microgravity environment. Testing of the process technologies will lead to a lab demonstration of ingot formation and milling in the Phase I effort, maturing the MAMBA Process to TRL-3.  In the Phase II effort, a full scale engineering unit will be built and tested to begin validating this technology for flight.","The MAMBA-Process will support long-duration manned missions such as Manned Mars Missions and the ISS by enabling manufacture of precision metal parts on-orbit as needed.

Throughout this program we will develop the direct write tools, software and platform to test various combinations of conductive and nonconductive materials for antennas, circuit masks and circuit layouts to prepare to move forward to add pick and place capability and substrate printing to build complete circuit boards and eventually complete 3D circuit structures.Although many of the necessary technologies exist, a key feature in out platform will be a unifying open-source software package.  We believe that moving to open-source will broaden the potential user base but will also provide the control, training, security and stability that can only occur when the user community is allowed access to the source code.  This is a paradigm shift in the commercial controls world but is readily embraced in the 3D printing world.Now as a dual use system, the BioFabrication Facility plus STEPS will not be limited to crew demands or vehicle availability which may limit biological systems.  It will be able to print replacement or upgraded electronics or avionics when it?s not printing tissues.  Our end goal is to have enough added capability that the facility will never need to sit idle, space on an exploration vehicle is too valuable.","The space services segment is the core of Techshot?s business plan.

Through its Space Act Agreement and its IDIQ contract, Techshot will offer both the STEPS equipment and the services associated with flight hardware, which are expected to be highly desired by NASA-funded researchers and personnel within NASA?s Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) division. AES pioneers new approaches for rapidly developing prototype systems ? demonstrating key capabilities, and validating operational concepts for future human missions beyond low-Earth orbit.

The proposed Portable Atmospheric Scanning LIDAR (PASL) system will include POC's recent developments in coherent LIDAR for wind sensing, Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) for measurements of water vapor content distribution, and Rotational Raman LIDAR for temperature measurements. POC's existing and proposed innovations in the integrated LIDAR designs will provide NASA with a system with very low size, weight, and power consumption, which will make the PASL easily deployable to any place on the globe and capable of long-term autonomous operation in support of NASA's research missions. In Phase I, POC will refine its existing non-scanning system and modify its design to facilitate 3D scanning, extend its functional range of operation to 10 km, further develop software for fast data processing, and fabricate a prototype of the wind LIDAR (TRL-4). In Phase II, the operational prototype of the entire scanning PASL system will be fabricated and tested (TRL-6).","The availability of a compact, easily-deployable PASL system will facilitate validation of results of measurements of atmospheric parameters with new satellite devices that NASA is developing for its current and future missions, such as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE), Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI), and Aerosol, Cloud, and Ecosystems (ACE, including Pre-ACE/PACE). The PASL may be delivered to any place on Earth and used almost autonomously for long periods of time to collect data about the atmospheric parameters at a range over 10 km over prescribed directions in the entire hemisphere, including both vertical and horizontal paths. During the course of the project, POC will work together with NASA personnel at the Ames Research Center, Langley Research Center, and other centers to identify the immediate and follow-on applications for PASL, and identify any auxiliary sensors and equipment needed to operate in conjunction with the PASL system.","The PASL will be used by government weather forecasting agencies (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)) and weather services at all military branches for improving weather forecasts by collecting atmospheric data more frequently than with currently used weather balloons that are typically launched twice a day. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) can use this relatively inexpensive and compact device for weather monitoring around airports and for detection of air vortices created by large aircraft to avoid dangerous conditions on runways.Universities and non-government research institutions will use the PASL for environmental research, including investigations of atmospheric processes and their influence on climate change.

The significance of the innovation is to enable a highly integrated SIP assembly that integrates multiple die from different processes and foundries, enabling a miniaturized, highly-reliable embedded processing / sensor interface module. The SIP will be optimized for size, weight, power consumption and radiation hardness. Based upon preliminary calculations, we expect that the SIP will be a minimum of 5X the area of implementing discrete chips. Combining multiple functions together will significantly reduce the mass and volume compared to existing solutions that would require at least three separate ICs to provide the same level of functionality. Designers will be able to reduce their PCB size and the amount of effort that it takes to layout and route a board. Fewer PCB connections and solder joints will improve the reliability of a design. A single SIP can also be tested and qualified more expediently than three individual devices. The technical objectives for the SIP are to select best-in-class radiation hardened semiconductor devices that offer a high level of performance, interoperability, very low power consumption and produce a design to integrate them into a single package. The resulting package footprint will be the smallest possible but will be designed so that it can be tested and qualified to MIL-PRF-38534. There are two package configurations that are possible to implement. One option does not involve die stacking and will reduce the area (versus using three standalone chips) of 5.03X. Another option uses a stacked die configuration and will result in an area reduction of 7.37X. After analyzing out both options in more detail, we will decide which option to pursue. A test and qualification plan will be provided.","This board will be a suitable platform solution for many NASA space-based observatories, fly-by spacecraft, orbiters, landers and robotic / sample return missions that require robust command and control capabilities. This miniaturized SIP will be an ideal companion chip to locate with sensors (either analog or digital output types) to perform signal conditioning close to the sensing element. This is advantageous as signals are cleaner at the source without the electrical noise pollution that long signal paths introduce. The device is based upon a programmable microcontroller that is therefore flexible for many highly reliable embedded processing or sensor readout application. When software is programmed into the device, it becomes a custom solution. Programming the device and supporting software will be straightforward as it based on an existing ARM Cortex architecture.","There is a demand for a highly integrated SIP like this in commercial space applications, particularly satellites. The benefit of this part over closest fit existing solutions is that there are no state-of-the-art (based on ARM Cortex) ""mid-range"" embedded processors that are available in a small footprint with NVM and a precision analog-to-digital convertor.

In addition to superior mechanical properties associated with enhanced reliability, BMG technology can offer new manufacturing processes that result in components with higher precision and complexity, eliminating machining and minimizing final assembly. In this project, we propose to utilize the unique thermoplastic forming (TPF) ability of bulk metallic glasses to net shape high precision robotic gears. The fabrication method that we propose to develop for NASA applications will yield shapes and dimensional accuracies that can't be achieved with any other metal fabrication method and produce thin walled geometries beyond what is possible with machining and casting processes. BMGs have demonstrated superior mechanical properties in extremely low temperature environments and ability to operate without lubricants in gear mechanisms. To take this further, we will explore improvement of friction and wear properties important for gears by fabricating composite surfaces through TPF method using molybdenum disulfide particles. The outcome of the project will be a demonstration of capabilities to manufacture precise robotic components with complex thin walled geometries and improved properties. Beyond space applications, the use of versatile thermoplastic forming processes for precision gears has a strong potential to bring cost savings for a wide range of industries that use robotic mechanisms.","Development of novel manufacturing processes for structures with superior mechanical properties has long been identified as one of the critical needs for NASA. The focus of the current solicitation in the area of specialty materials is specifically on bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) and processes that allow fabrication of components with thin walls and high precision. Our proposed project focuses on these technologies. Thermoplastically net shaped BMG components can bring significant benefits, including increased reliability, high level of functional integration, drastic reduction in required machining, lower cost and faster lead times. This is achieved due to exceptional strength and elasticity of BMGs, as well as novel processing methods, developed and patented by Prof. Schroers at Yale and Supercool Metals. In this project, we focus on net shaping of precise robotic components for space applications using BMGs. BMG robotic components are highly attractive for use at low temperature and harsh environments (such as Europa mission) due to improved mechanical properties and ability to operate unlubricated. Beyond this, thermoplastic forming technology of BMGs has broader implications in areas of small satellites, pressure vessels and structural space applications in general.","Combining the properties of best structural metals with the processability of thermoplastics brings unique opportunities that will have a vast impact on a broad range of industries. BMG technology enables to significantly improve properties, develop new architectures and add functionalities to a variety of industrial and commercial products. Specifically, net shaping of BMGs is highly attractive for commercial and industrial robotics applications, electronics, defense, aerospace, automotive and biomedical industries. Currently, Supercool Metals has several contracts with large commercial companies in the watch industry for production of prototype watch movement components based on our TPF net shaping and molding processes.

Energy efficient carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and reduction systems are critical to reducing the power consumption of the spacecraft atmosphere revitalization systems.  TDA proposes to develop a rapidly cycling vacuum-assisted thermal swing adsorption (VTSA) system to remove CO2 from cabin air and concentrate it for subsequent reduction and pressurization.  Our unique sorbent exhibits one of the highest capacities reported for CO2 adsorption at very low CO2 partial pressures (1-3 torr CO2 partial pressure range).  The low heat of adsorption of CO2 on the sorbent and the relatively low heat input needed to desorb the CO2 across a small temperature differential during regeneration will reduce the power requirement for the process.  The new material is also highly tolerant to moisture.  In Phase I, we will prepare the sorbent and demonstrate its ability in selectively removing CO2 from air under representative conditions.  The technology readiness level (TRL) will be elevated to 3 at the end of Phase I.  We will also complete the detailed design of the VTSA reactor.  In Phase II, we will build a high fidelity prototype assembly and demonstrate the concept at full-scale, elevating the TRL to 5.","If successful, the sorbents developed in this project will find immediate use in NASA life support applications.  Reducing the weight and volume of the sub-components of the spacecraft atmosphere restoration system is of critical importance to NASA particularly for next generation planetary exploration missions.","In addition to NASA and military (i.e., the submarines), we believe the new CO2 control system can find applications in commercial aerospace applications (a vacuum swing sorbent will eliminate the engine air intake to control the CO2 levels in commercial airliners) and shelters (e.g., mine rescue shelters).  There is also potentially a very large market exist for CO2 capture if regulations put in place to capture carbon emissions from power plant and industrial sources.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Prototyping; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)",Environmental Control and Life Support   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed drum sampling system is based on a terrestrial roadheader design and includes a Thwacker that generates percussive vibrations during rotary excavation.  All components will be designed to withstand Dry Heat Microbial Reduction as well as Planetary Protection requirements.  The EDuS' structural components include a support boom, a buffer plate, and a cutter head.  The support boom is hollow and its position and length can be adjusted depending on the required excavation depth and volume on the lander.  For launch, the boom will be compressed and then spring-extended upon landing.  A spring loaded boom has an added advantage of mitigating Thwacker vibrations to the Robotic Arm.  The buffer plate is also a structural member whose main purpose is to prevent chips from falling out.  The cuter head is the central part of the system.  The cutter head has been designed in the shape of a typical cylindrical pressure vessel.  The teeth are placed on all rotating surfaces, including the convex sides. This shape can deal with a range of surface topographies from flat to very jagged.  The teeth are very sharp to reduce cutting forces and are made of carbide to increase longevity.  The cutter head also includes a ring of teeth which make up the Thwacker Ratchet.  Thwacking will reduce cutting forces and aid in sample delivery.","The near term application includes NASA's Flagship-class Europa Clipper mission and in particular its lander that requires a sampling system. This SBIR funded technology would transition very well into the actual mission. Europa lander will launch in approximately 2024. This Phase 1 work would end in December of 2017, while the Phase 2 work (TRL6) would end in Dec of 2019. Thus, at the end of 2019 with at least 5 years before the actual launch, the TRL6 sampling system or critical subsystems of the sampling system deemed important by the Europa team could be infused into the actual mission.Other NASA missions that could include this sampling system (or certain subsystems of this sampling system) include: 1. Discovery-class missions to icy-bodies, including Mars; 2. New Frontiers class missions such as Comet Nucleus Surface Sample Return, Lunar South Pole Aitken Basin Sample Return, Venus In Situ Explorer; 3. In the Flagship class category, in addition to the Clipper mission, another mission that could use the sampling system includes the second mission in the Mars Sample Return Program - Mars Ascent Vehicle. It is prudent to have a backup sampling system adjacent to the MAV.In the HEOMD directorate, In Situ Resource Utilization missions to Mars, asteroids, or the Moon, such as Asteroid Redirect Robotic or Crew Mission (ARRM, ARCM) or Resource Prospector Mission could use this technology.","The sampling technology system could be used by several commercial companies that are interested in mining and in-situ resource utilization for financial gain. These include Planetary Resources, Inc. and Deep Space Industries, Inc., targeting asteroids and Shackleton Energy Corp, targeting the Moon. The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to establish human presence on Mars.

Whether or not thermal barrier coating are applied to the engine components, the resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion relies on metallic coatings protecting the superalloy substrate. These metallic coatings are commonly either diffusion aluminides or MCrAlY overlays (where M=Ni, Co, Fe, Ni+Co, etc). Compared with diffusion coatings, MCrAlY coatings are more flexible in terms of composition selection for achieving a more balanced combination of coating properties and having a lower ductile to brittle transition temperature, which makes them more resistant to cracking upon thermal cycling. Several techniques have been developed to deposit MCrAlY coatings including physical vapor deposition, electrolytic codeposition, electrophoresis, and autocatalytic electroless deposition, of which electrolytic codeposition appears to be a promising, low cost, non-line of sight approach. Therefore, the overall objective of the Phase I and II programs is to create a scalable cost effective process to produce coatings that can enhance high temperature reliability and corrosion/oxidation and erosion resistance. This program will build off of Dr. Ying Zhang (Tennessee Technological University) electrolytic codeposition work and Faraday Technology's alloy coating development efforts to create a scalable process to electrolytic codeposit MCrAlY onto engine shaped components and to investigate other potential MCrAlX alloy elements that could further increase the coatings temperature resistance. If successful this program has the potential to greatly improve the oxidation and corrosion resistance of metallic coatings while also improving their reliability at higher operating temperatures and reducing their manufacturing costs.","Turbine engines serve as the primary and/or auxiliary power source for numerous NASA, DoD, and commercial enterprises. It is a desired cost-driven goal that gas turbine engines have a long lifecycle, with ability to refurbish deteriorated hardware for additional service life without replacement. While some engines have approached this goal, others have fallen significantly short. For example, time between overhauls (TBO) for 501K-34 gas turbine engine has been falling significantly short (<10,000 h) of the 25,000 h goal primarily because of hot corrosion damage noted on high pressure turbine hardware. Operational changes and future needs will require increased turbine operating temperatures and change the associated operating environment to one where Type I and Type II hot corrosion and oxidation will be prevalent in newly anticipated operational profiles.","The market consist of all potential energy consumers, the need for next generation high temperature corrosion resistant materials is critical to improving generation efficiencies and reducing production costs. However, it is believe that once optimized this process could improve energy efficiency up to 20% in steam turbine plants alone. This would be accomplished by reducing the amount of waste heat discharged from steam power systems, which is estimated at 280,000 MW.

For optical instruments that are required to view objects with brightness dynamic ranges on the order of 1010, precise control of diffraction and scattering from occulting apertures, Lyot stops, shields, and baffles is critical. Super-black broadband absorbers can help control stray light, and work by absorbing light across the ultra-violet, visible, and infrared spectral regions. No stray-light control application is more stressing than space-based astronomical telescopes because the stray light characteristics of the instrument itself typically limits the ultimate contrast of the imagery. Ultimately, the reflection or scattering of light from an absorber will be limited by the effective ""impedance mismatch"" of the electromagnetic wave as it transits the interface from the incident medium (i.e. vacuum) to the absorber medium.  Recent developments in the patterning of nanostructures have opened great opportunities for the fabrication of nanostructured films which exhibit gradual transitions in refractive index, leading to high performance broadband antireflection coatings and enhancement of black-body absorption. Surface nanostructures that have sub-wavelength dimensions can greatly reduce light reflection, and are biomimetic to moth's eyes, which are designed to minimize reflection in the VIS and NIR spectral bands. Nanohmics proposes to use its ""Thermodot"" technology to produce a sub-wavelength structured surface that effectively couples incoming electromagnetic waves into a material with vanishingly small reflectance. Nanohmics proposes to extend the Thermodot technology to absorbing substrates to produce non-reflecting super-black absorbing materials with performance characteristics compatible with space-based telescopes.","Immediate NASA applications include space and terrestrial telescopes where precision control of stray light and maximum suppression of bright-object glare is required.  The ultimate image contrast achieved by space-based telescopes is limited by stray light, and precise mitigation of diffracted, scattered, and reflected light is paramount.","Industrial applications of the super-black absorber technology include remote sensing in arc furnaces and plasma jets, and other applications where imagery or optical measurements are required in the proximity of very bright sources of light.

In Phase I WCS will develop and mature the concept design of a Stirling cryocooler and control electronics, with extreme miniaturization enabled through very high frequency (nominally 300 Hz) operation. Building off previous research conducted by the principles, leveraging recent advances in manufacturing and digital technologies, and supported by analyses and proof of concept experiments, WCS will develop a complete cryocooler system design encompassing both the thermomechanical unit (TMU) and the cryocooler control electronics (CCE). In Phase II the detailed design for a SSC System will be completed and a high fidelitybrassboard system will be built, tested to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5, and delivered to NASA. Immediate commercialization in support of NASA, Department of Defense, and commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) missions will follow.","The proposed SSC has direct applicability to the cooling of small, infrared sensors requiring a focal plane operating temperature between 70K and 180K. This encompasses a wide range of low earth orbit (LEO) imaging sensors, interplanetary orbiters, and on surface interplanetary explorers. Extended applicability to lower temperatures, say to 30K, is enabled with the addition of a second cooling stage. More broadly, the advanced electronics technology being developed is readily scaled up, extending the applicability to the electronics to encompass virtually any linear (Stirling or pulse tube) type cryocooler.","West Coast Solutions envisions tremendous commercial potential for the SmallSat Cryocooler as it will be the first such device of its kind.Competing designs fail to take into account the inherent deleterious vibration and power bus impacts, making the SSC a far more attractive,more easily integrated option. Based on the deployment of traditional macro scale space cryocoolers, the expected production opportunitiesfor the SSC on non-NASA USG and foreign government orbital missions is limited to just a few a year, but we do not believe this is theright perspective. The interest in this cryocooler is based upon the emergence of a new class of substantially lower cost low earth orbitsatellites, such as CubeSats of various sizes from 1U up to 6U (20 cm x 30 cm x 10 cm), which can be affordably deployed in large numbers,and indeed for which the mission is only satisfied by such a constellation. For example, in February 2014 Planet Labs deployed 28 CubeSats comprising Flock 1 to image the Earth in the visible band. For a comparable infrared constellation, each satellite would require a SSC. Envisioning three such missions per year by 2019, the production opportunity for the cryocooler subsystem is on the order of 28 x 3 x $20,000 = $1.68M in government sales alone.","Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Infrared; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Long; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Multispectral/Hyperspectral",Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

However, TECs are inefficient devices requiring large electrical currents to provide a refrigerant effect. Even modest improvements in TEC performance would vastly increase the market potential of thermoelectric cooling, expanding its role into maintaining space science instrument components at cryogenic temperatures (<90K), as well as increasing adoption in consumer appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners. microVection has identified a means of improving the efficiencies of TECs with minor design and fabrication changes. This involves shifting the peak temperature location through modification of the conductance in a simple and controlled manner. This was demonstrated first analytically and then by using a small cell of 3 couples (6 legs), and the results showed a significant (~30%) increase in the temperature differential of the cell at no heat load. The simplicity of the concept suggests that it offers a near-term, affordable cooling solution that can take advantage of both advanced materials and reductions in scale to improve temperature differentials by as much as 30%. Conversely, the same temperature differential can be achieved at lower input power levels, or at higher cold-side heat fluxes, with input power being reduced by as much as 60%. The overarching goal of the proposed effort is to bring high-performance thermoelectric cooling technology to a maturity suitable for the space science and commercial marketplaces, and to demonstrate analytically and experimentally that asymmetric conductance TEC designs offer significant advantages over conventional thermoelectric devices. The specific objective of the Phase I is to show that asymmetric conductance thermoelectric devices offer near-term improvements to thermoelectric coolers in high current design scenarios.","Space science instruments require dedicated/localized cooling to meet their stringent requirements. TECs have the advantage of small size, long life, solid state design, and no moving parts or fluid operation. Improving the efficiency of TECs and enabling them to provide the cold temperatures needed by certain types of space science instruments would be an enhancing, or possibly an enabling, technology. Based on the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap, programs the concept could impact include Explorer, Earth Venture Suborbital, DRM 6 (Crewed to Near Earth Asteroid), DRM 7 (Crewed to Lunar Surface), and DRM 8 & 9 (Crewed to Mars Moons and Mars Surface).","Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) are used throughout the military, aerospace, electronics, and consumer products industries.  Their compact construction, quiet operation, long lifetimes, and lack of moving parts makes them the preferred choice for refrigeration applications. The commercial potential of the laminate TEC device is extremely large, with residential refrigeration alone being a large untapped market. These market segments are dependent on traditional vapor compression technology, which has the disadvantages of weight, noise, moderate reliability, and the use of environmentally-unfriendly refrigerants. Thermoelectric coolers could provide localized cooling (and heating) capability in a lightweight, compact, convenient form factor, characterized by low noise, essentially no maintenance, ease of installation, and no use of environmentally harmful working fluids. In summary, the market potential of the laminate TEC approach is enormous, while offering a significant civic and environmental benefit, as well.",Active Systems; Analytical Methods; Conversion; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nonspecified; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling,Thermal Control Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Kppa will generate code that is more computationally efficient than existing models and improve the performance of models executing on traditional architectures, an immediate benefit to existing programs and infrastructure.  Kppa will also improve user productivity and lower barriers to entry by providing a domain specific language for computational chemical kinetics that is easily understood by domain experts (chemists, etc.) and facilitate the rapid development of new chemical operators for use in whole-systems models. Additionally, NASA's High-End Computing (HEC) center and supercomputing centers like it require enormous amounts of energy and man-hours to operate and maintain. Kppa will improve HPC return-on-investment by significantly reducing time-to-solution on supercomputing resources, enabling supercomputer-level performance on smaller computers with lower costs, lowering barriers to entry for domain experts seeking to benefit from accelerator architectures, and enabling prospective supercomputer users to rapidly create high-performance numerical simulations.  The competitive advantages of Kppa include exceptional performance, usability, and commercial support.","Non-NASA customers include members of the global energy market, i.e. Shell Oil and ExxonMobil. Researchers from these organizations have expressed interest in using Kppa to study compounds like pentane, but Kppa's support for large mechanisms must be improved before it can be used in these studies.  NREL, ORNL, NOAA, NCAR, and KAUST are also potential customers. The core of ParaTools' business is services and HPC consulting, and our business model targets opportunities to apply our HPC expertise in close interaction with customers who have a strong interest in deploying HPC solutions.

Simple, passive thermal control in which excess heat is radiated to space via blackbody radiators used to be adequate, however, as spacecraft power levels increase and mission environments become more complex, more flexible and capable thermal control systems and mechanisms are needed. Variable heat rejection is an enabling technology to reliably vary heat rejection during human and robotic spaceflight missions with wide variation in thermal environments & vehicle heat loads. Quest Thermal Group is proposing a novel Variable Conductor Radiator (VCR) that uses actuated heat conductors within an IMLI structure to control heat conduction.   A VCR could provide both high and very low heat rejection, operating as both effective radiators and high performance insulation, and capable of turndown ratios of 80:1.   The NASA 2012 TA14 Thermal Management Roadmap stated radiator advancement is perhaps the most critical thermal technology development for future spacecraft and space-based systems. NASA is seeking unique solutions for thermal control technology providing low mass highly reliable thermal control systems.  As NASA moves beyond LEO, spacecraft must accommodate various mission scenarios and need variable heat rejection. Current state of the art variable radiators offer heat rejection turn-down ratios up to about 4:1.  Phase I goals are to develop a new variable spacecraft radiator that can simply and efficiently provide a highly variable heat rejection using variable solid conduction within IMLI insulation, and prove feasibility of the VCR concept to help improve radiator capabilities for future NASA and commercial spacecraft. A VCR prototype will be modeled, designed, built and tested for thermal performance and variable heat rejection.","NASA's Thermal Management Roadmap emphasizes the need for variable heat rejection. As NASA moves beyond LEO, exploration vehicles and space instruments must accommodate various mission scenarios, operating in environments from full sun to deep space, managing a wide range of heat rejection. Variable radiators are needed that can be turned down to low heat flux in cold environments. Current state of the art turndown ratios are 4:1, NASA's goal is 6:1, and Quest's Variable Conductance Radiator (VCR) is modeled to have a turndown ratio of ~80:1.Advances in heat rejection technologies could provide more capable thermal control across a wider range of thermal environments and heat loads. Variable radiators offer substantial system-wide benefits, including lower power requirements to maintain spacecraft temperatures in cold environments. Variable radiators are an important enabling technology needed for NASA's future exploration and science missions. It is needed for NASA Design Reference Missions 8 & 9, which are crewed missions to Mars. Both NASA Science and Space Technology Mission Directorates are seeking new technology.  VCR technology, if proven successful, could be infused into future NASA spacecraft, including manned spacecraft, robotic exploration vehicles, Earth observing satellites, science and interplanetary spacecraft. VSR could help NASA meet needs for improved spacecraft thermal control for various spacecraft and mission environments.","All commercial satellites require thermal control systems.  The purpose of the thermal control system is to maintain the spacecraft or satellite within allowable temperature limits for all thermal environments it operates in. Spacecraft and related equipment (such as electronics or optics/sensors) require some level of thermal control, and the design approach and technologies employed vary widely depending on application.  As spacecraft power levels increase and mission environments become more complex, more flexible and capable thermal control systems and mechanisms are needed.A new, advanced, low mass, highly variable radiator would be of interest to satellite manufacturers, and once proven out and tested, could be fairly rapidly adopted and incorporated into new satellite thermal control systems.New satellites are being built and launched at an increasing rate, there were 285 large satellites launched in 2014. Many of these new spacecraft are high power requiring good thermal control and heat rejection capability.The target markets for VCR technology are satellites and spacecraft.  This includes future NASA spacecraft and commercial satellites, including those for communications, Earth observing and remote sensing, Defense, science, navigation, Earth imaging and meteorology.

Such capability enables the in-situ manufacturing of critical parts for human spaceflight and without dependence on terrestrial resupply. Made In Space integrates flight-proven microgravity process controls and payload support systems, such as environmental and master controls, with a modular manufacturing & tool system that generates a near net shape for surface finishing or other industrial processing into the final product. One of the key innovations of Made In Space?s VULCAN is the ability to produce finished metal parts with one device, eliminating the need for separate additive manufacturing and subtractive machining facilities. The wire feed architecture of both the thermoplastic extruder and metal manufacturing head allows the hardware to be interchangeable and supported on the same gantry without requiring modification of any of the components. The two manufacturing heads follow the SBM-Spec interface standards for ?plug-and-play? operation. Thus, the manufacturing heads can be exchanged easily by crewmembers with no formal manufacturing training. Using this capability, the VULCAN device produces both non-metallic and metallic replacement parts with a minimum of crew interaction. VULCAN is scalable and supports the open SBM-Spec architecture for the thermoplastic and metal manufacturing heads, resulting in a manufacturing methodology that uses multiple materials and can be upgraded over time.","The VULCAN technology is primarily intended for sustaining human spaceflight operations, first on the ISS and, later, on long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, or other destinations in the Solar System. Made In Space has built industry alliances with such companies as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Bigelow Aerospace to evaluate the optimal concept of operations for in-space manufacturing as an enabling technology for the NextSTEP Cislunar Habitat. Made In Space is also working with UTC Aerospace Systems and Paragon to develop ECLSS design principles for repair and replenishment by in-space manufacturing. Robotic expeditionary missions can also employ the VULCAN technology for autonomous repairs while building the infrastructure preceding human habitation. Local robots may retrieve and install VULCAN-generated parts automatically or via teleoperation. Such capability may be necessary to ensure continuity of operations without direct human intervention and enable human crews to focus on mission objectives.","The Department of Defense has a demonstrated need for advanced manufacturing capabilities in locations and on forward-deployed platforms without regular logistical support or available resources for traditional fabrication and finishing technologies. Perhaps the foremost example is the US Navy submarine fleet. While aircraft carriers are commonly referred to as ?cities at sea? because of their size and on-board industrial capacity, the nation?s attack and ballistic missile submarines deploy for months at a time and must function as entirely self-contained units with no physical connection to the outside world. Submarines on patrol duty may only surface during departure from base and upon return. A tactical version of the VULCAN device gives the DoD a modular, common manufacturing system deployable on mobile platforms, such as submarines, destroyers, transport aircraft, and trucks, and in fixed locations with limited external support, such as Forward Operating Bases and advance airfields.Incumbent 3D printing companies generate revenue from four primary sources: new device sales; feedstock sales; on demand printing; and maintenance services. Made In Space plans to adopt a similar revenue model when developing VULCAN units for commercial use. VULCAN units will be developed and sold to the merchant vessel market. Due to its size and importance, Made In Space will initially target the oil tanker vertical.","Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Nonspecified; Polymers; Processing Methods",In-Space Manufacturing of Precision Parts   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

First, it is well understood that for complicated components like a modern combustion chamber, an AM manufacturing approach can drastically reduce cost (by 50% or more) and lead time (weeks instead of months).  Second, our particular design overcomes weaknesses of other additive designs by enabling easy inspection of the printed parts that otherwise would have to undergo CT scanning or X-ray inspection, which has proven to be exceptionally difficult for complex internal geometries like regenerative cooling channels and propellant manifolds.  Third, our basic material and manufacturing approach is scalable to booster class combustion chambers at a rate controlled solely by scaling of the build volumes available in commercial SLM machines (which is occurring rapidly).  In fact, commercial MPW systems are already being used in the automotive industry that can instantaneously weld parts of several meters in length.","Main combustion chambers for large and small primary propulsion systems for future launch vehicles.

These thermal control systems must be designed to perform this turn-down and turn-up within a required time frame reliably and predictably.  Paragon?s innovation will achieve this with lower weight, less complexity, and reduced costs, all while maintaining a highly flexible design. The Controlled Stagnation Radiator offers the ideal combination of maximized radiator performance at high heat loads and a high turndown ratio via controlled, determinate stagnation at low heat loads.  By placing one or more passive pressure equalization devices on some of the radiator fluid tubes, that portion of the radiator becomes more resistant to stall, and those tubes without the innovation will be the first to stagnate. In effect, this system provides controlled stagnation by adding local stagnation resistance, rather than by adding mechanical systems which increase complexity and mass, or flow imbalance which impact design load performance.  Since the implementation of the innovation has no impact to the flow distribution in the design load case the radiator can both be optimized for full flow performance and be designed to exhibit determinate performance in deep stagnation for high turndown and intermediate loads, as is required of modern spacecraft thermal control system design.This improvement upon the state of the art is expected to mature stagnation technology by giving the system greatly improved performance determinance which will allow the solution to be baselined for use in next generation spacecraft and optimized for any application with minimized design cycle, testing, cost and schedule impact.  The innovation concept is also highly compatible with Paragon?s xRad radiator manufacturing technique, meaning that any size and aspect ratio of radiator panel can be easily manufactured without the need for complex tooling.","The Controlled Stagnation Radiator is primarily intended for human-rated single loop ATCS applications as most suitable non-toxic fluids are highly viscous and prone to stall under low heat loads in cold environments.  As NASA develops deep space mission capabilities there will be a need for new habitat modules that would benefit from the incorporation of this technology.  In addition, the developed technology could be incorporated into block upgrades of multiple commercial and NASA spacecraft to save weight and decrease complexity and costs.Additionally, surface habitat modules for the Moon and/or Mars could also benefit from the use of the Controlled Stagnation Radiator, especially as these colonies grow and require more radiator area to support higher maximum heat loads while still being functional at lower loads.","Companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK and Bigelow are known to be proposing development of habitat or EAM modules for the anticipated NASA missions to deep space.

This includes directed energy, high-powered communication systems and Operationally Responsive spacecraft.Also, Mars One is still pursuing the colonization of Mars and continues development of surface modules.

Bulk silicon electronics mostly cease to operate properly at temperatures above the 150C to 200C range due to high off-state leakage. The Silicon-On-Insulator version pushes this limit further to 300C; however, the Venus surface exploration systems and gas giant probes require electronics that can operate above this temperature. A solution for high temperature electronics is the use of devices fabricated using wide bandgap semiconductors. Silicon carbide as being the most mature wide bandgap technology and shown to operate at temperature as high as 500-600C offers alternative device and circuit solutions for high temperature electronics. To this end, CoolCAD has the expertise to design, layout and fabricate silicon carbide integrated circuits to address this need, and extend the useful lifetime of vessels and probes in extreme environments.","Of particular importance is to meet the capability performance goals in the NASA technology roadmaps. The proposed technology helps with achieving these goals in radiation-rich as well as high temperature harsh conditions. Specifically, the proposed technology would help the development of technologies for the robotic exploration of high-temperature environments, such as the Venus surface, Mercury, or the deep atmosphere of Gas Giants. For example the planned Venus lander mission might greatly benefit from the proposed technology. The proposed silicon carbide integrated circuit technologies have the potential to significantly enhance, or reduce technical risk for in situ missions to high-temperature environments with temperatures approaching 500C or higher. In addition to helping missions to high temperature harsh environments, the proposed high temperature electronics would play a significant role in improving the state of intelligent propulsion systems as well as more electric and distributed aircraft and shuttle control electronics.","The benefits of the availability of high temperature silicon carbide electronics go beyond the use of these electronics in Venus, Mercury and Gas Giant probes and vessels.

Our proposed design aims to ensure high yield while maintaining a superb optical quality and retain the proven aspects of BMC?s commercial MEMS DM design and core manufacturing processes. Our objective in the Phase I project is to complete a design study for an innovative approach to scaling up our MEMS DM technology. We will develop new approaches to design and fabrication of routing lines by replacing the single wiring layer by interconnected, stacked wiring layers, and replacing wirebond technology with a flip-chip architecture for the device-to-package integration to overcome two key challenges that currently limit MEMS DM scalability to higher actuator counts. The outcome of the Phase I work will be the design and mask layout of the 10,000 actuator DM, the design and layout of the 10,000 channel PCB subassembly, and the development of a flip-chip bonding process that will enable the fabrication of this DM in a Phase II effort.","Small-stroke, high precision deformable mirrors and associated driving electronics scalable to 10,000 or more actuators have a few astronomical NASA commercial applications. The following applications apply to all Boston Micromachines mirrors that benefit from new manufacturing processes developed which increase yield and reliability.Astronomy:   Post applications in this sub-category can be broken into two categories: space telescopes and ground-based telescopes.  In the case of space telescopes, there are a number of mission/mission concepts that require the wavefront control provided by the proposed high actuator count deformable mirrors.  These include the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVIOR), Alpha Centauri Exoplanet Satellite (ACESat), Exoplanetary Circumstellar Environments and Disk Explorer (EXCEDE) and the Centaur pathfinder mission. For ground-based telescopes, BMC has already had success developing arrays up to 4096 elements for the Gemini Planet Imager and multiple high-yield smaller devices to high contrast imaging testbeds at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the University of Nice. BMC can achieve similar results for larger arrays requiring high-density electronic equipment for other new and existing installations such as the planned Extremely Large Telescopes (Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT)).","Small-stroke, high precision deformable mirrors (DMs) and associated driving electronics scalable to 10,000 or more actuators have a few commercial applications.

While solar arrays and instrument capabilities in CubeSat applications keep growing, the limited radiator surface results in a thermal bottleneck that limits the actual use of science or communication instruments. State-of-the-art deployable radiators use multiple rigid panels connected by a flexible hinge, replicating designs used in large space structures.

To address this challenge, SSCI proposes to develop, implement and test an innovative ON-DEMAND (Operations in Dynamic Environments with Manned And Unmanned Aircraft Deconfliction) system, a portable ATC center, whose role will be to monitor the environment, predict the environmental changes, and approve new geofencing boundaries, new manned-unmanned vehicle separation boundaries, and new flight plans in real-time while avoiding conflicts and assuring overall system safety.

In this SBIR we will close that technology gap by developing a miniature Stirling cooler, suitable for integration with a sensor package at the end of an effector or robot arm, which is capable of keeping conventional electronics cool outside of the spacecraft body in the high temperature Venus environment.  This advance would vastly expand the list of technologies which can be deployed on the surface of Venus, and correspondingly advance the types of science that can be performed.

Although technology development efforts are underway that will provide improvements to spacecraft central processing units (CPUs) they do not address the limitations of current onboard memory systems. In addition to CPU upgrades, effective execution of data-intensive operations such as terrain relative navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning and scheduling, and onboard science data processing and analysis require high-bandwidth, low-latency memory systems to maximize processor usage (i.e. to overcome the ""memory wall"").

NASA is interested in improving thermal insulation for future Mars missions, including Evolvable Mars Campaign, Mars Landers and Mars ISRU cryogenic fuel storage on Mars surface. Cryogenic propellants have the highest energy density of any chemical rocket fuel, propel most NASA and commercial launch vehicles, and would be used for Mars Lander EDL/ascent.  Cryogenic propellants require good thermal insulation.  Improvements in propellant storage and transfer are a critical need for future NASA missions, with zero boil off of cryogenic propellant an important goal. High performance insulation is needed for future Mars missions to store liquid methane obtained from the Mars regolith and stored on Mars surface.  Quest Thermal Group proposes to design and develop an innovative, lightweight thermal insulation system, designed to perform and insulate cryogenic propellants in multiple environments, such as in-air on Earth prelaunch and launch ascent, in-space cruise phase, on-Mars surface and during Mars Lander ascent. Multi-Environment MLI (MEMLI) is a novel multi-functional thermal insulation system that uses a ventable/sealable, lightweight supported vacuum shell, integrated and supported by Load Bearing MLI layers specifically tuned for Mars atmosphere.  MEMLI will be engineered to provide high performance in-air, in-space and on-Mars, could provide <130 W/m2 in-air, <0.25 W/m2 in-space, <0.75 W/m2 on Mars surface with a robust, lightweight system with a mass about 1 kg/m2.Phase I goals are to develop a new high performing insulation structure capable of supporting Mars missions and prove feasibility of the MEMLI concept for future NASA programs. A MEMLI prototype will be modeled, designed, built and tested for thermal performance in multiple environments.","Multi-Environment MLI (MEMLI) might be the best thermal control system for Mars missions, capable of providing high thermal performance for all Mars mission phases, including in-air, in-space and on-Mars operation.  Successful testing of MEMLI might lead to a commercially ready product from Quest Thermal and Ball Aerospace for future infusion into new NASA missions or vehicles, such as Evolvable Mars Campaign, Mars Lander or for Mars ISRU cryogen storage and preservation.The NASA In-Space Propulsion Systems Roadmap, April 2012, calls ""Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions"" the #2 ranked technical challenge for future NASA missions.  The NASA Thermal Management Systems Roadmap (April 2012) states ""performance and efficiency of cryogenic systems will have to significantly increase in order to enable the missions being considered over the next 20 years"" [Ref 2]. It also states ""New materials capable of ascent venting without performance loss or physical damage must be developed and demonstrated"".  The Roadmap further indicates ""insulation schemes effective during ground and ascent phases while still offering optimal performance for long duration on orbit storage are needed"". MEMLI may have numerous advantages for future NASA missions and needs.  The multi-functionality and high performance in various environments could be applicable to various missions.","Quest Thermal Group, and our partner in the aerospace market Ball Aerospace, continue to work diligently to promote and get infused our new technologies.  IMLI will fly on the Ball Aerospace/NASA Green Propellant Infusion Mission, IMLI will fly on a Remote Refueling Mission 3 experiment on the Station, we continue to work with ULA on getting several new technologies on on-ramps to new launch vehicles, and the same effort to interest Boeing with our launch vehicle systems for SLS.  Clearly, an insulation system designed for outstanding performance on Mars will have limited non-NASA use, although, perhaps one day commercial launch providers such as SpaceX might also benefit from this technology.Several aerospace prime contractors are now following with interest Quest and Ball Aerospace development of IMLI and related insulation systems.  Use of a high performance VCMLI system to replace SOFI would be of interest enabling improved payload capacity in cryogenic upper stages, such as Vulcan ACES and SLS cryogenic upper stage development. LRMLI has strong application for insulating LH2 tanks for High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, with discussions with Boeing regarding use on Phantom Eye.IMLI and derivatives might be able to provide improved thermal insulation for storage and preservation of cryogens for a wide variety of industrial uses, such as insulation for dewars for LHe, LH2, LN2 and LOX, for commercial, medical, industrial and research uses.","Active Systems; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fuels/Propellants; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Passive Systems; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Storage",Cryogenic Fluid Management   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

(PSI) proposes to develop new solar cells based on a ferroelectric semiconductor absorber material that can yield a 30% increase in efficiency and a 20% increase in specific power compared with current triple-junction III-V cells. These gains will be realized by exploiting a unique charge separation mechanism in ferroelectrics that enables open-circuit voltages many times the band gap, leading to maximum power conversion efficiencies exceeding the conventional Shockley-Queisser limit (33%). PSI and team members will create photovoltaic cells based on Earth-abundant SnS stabilized in a ferroelectric state by epitaxial strain engineering. By combining above-gap cell voltages with the high absorption coefficient (<1 x 105 cm-1 at 500 nm), low density (5.22 g/cm3), and ideal band gap (1.1 eV) of SnS, a mass-specific power density of 120 kW/kg (mass of absorber material, 1 um absorber thickness) is projected. In addition, a maximum cell efficiency of >45% is anticipated to be achievable. Importantly, these cells will also offer improved radiation resistance due to the reduced carrier diffusion lengths required by the unique ferroelectric charge separation mechanism. During Phase I, PSI, guided by first-principles calculations conducted by the PARADIM Center at Cornell University, will demonstrate room-temperature ferroelectric ordering in SnS through epitaxial strain engineering. During Phase II, PSI and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will demonstrate the potential of the proposed absorber by achieving above-band gap open-circuit voltages in prototype cells. During a Phase III effort, the efficiency of these cells will be increased to a target value of 45% through reduction of intrinsic defects, leading to substantial improvements in cell size, weight, and power output.","The proposed device will fulfill NASA's need for photovoltaic cells with a high specific power output with respect to both area and mass. These cells can be installed on NASA spacecraft, satellites, and other space vehicles for which size and weight are paramount concerns. These devices may also have applications in lightweight, compact cells for small portable electronic devices to be used by NASA astronauts.","The proposed photovoltaic cells will have commercial applications in small-scale power generation. This technology could provide high-efficiency modules for rooftop power generation, where the available surface area for cell installation is very limited. Compelling applications also exist in the commercial aerospace market, particularly for power generation on commercial satellites.

Box 595, Pismo Beach, CA 93448 - 9665",(805) 275-1053,3,6,"In the proposed SBIR study, Empirical Systems Aerospace, Inc. (ESAero) will develop a fault detection and identification avionics system implementing a generic statistical fault detection algorithm and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through flight testing on board a VTOL UAV testbed. The algorithm is aimed to be generic in the sense that it is agnostic to the specific platform or avionics suite on which it is implemented, making the developed technology broadly applicable to VTOL aircraft configurations, other aircraft types, and beyond. Using a statistics-based method, the system will not need to have direct knowledge of the sensors, the system, or the vehicle configuration. By simply monitoring the available sensors and comparing their signals to a trained nominal statistical data model, abnormalities in systems, sub-systems and individual components can be detected before a major failure occurs, greatly improving system operational safety and potentially significantly reducing maintenance costs. To develop the fault detection system, the team will leverage previous ePHM (Prognostic and Health Management) investment and configure a COTS VTOL UAV with a sensor suite and onboard data acquisition and processing system. The team will operate this VTOL UAV testbed to acquire data for nominal operation and then intentionally inject failures into the system to gather data for various faulty operations. The algorithm will be adapted to this dataset and loaded onto the testbed. Finally, in Phase I, ESAero will demonstrate the fault detection algorithm in flight verifying that the algorithm is capable of both detecting and identifying faults during actual operation. In Phase II, ESAero envisions further productionizing the technology by working with commercial motor and speed control vendors to broaden the statistical dataset and miniaturize the sensor and processing modules with the goal to integrate into existing hardware offerings.","A generic fault detection algorithm for VTOL UAVs would be directly applicable to many NASA applications. With successful Phase I and envisioned Phase II efforts, this system will truly be generic in the sense that it can be installed on nearly any aircraft, manned or unmanned, vertical lift or conventional. Furthermore, the generality of the system does not require a precise installation or a tedious training process. NASA would have the ability to integrate the system into existing and future flight test programs and install it on nearly any test article including the ESAero-primed X-57 ""Maxwell"". Such a system would provide an additional layer of safety to the program. Such technology will be vital as NASA begins testing electric and hybrid-electric aircraft where electric motor, generator, and battery performance is being pushed into unknown territory. The system could also be installed onto ground test articles or within wind tunnels.","With millions of VTOL UAV aircraft sold every year for both commercial and personal use, the number of accidents due to system or component failure will inevitably increase hampering their safe integration into the NAS. In addition, VTOL UAVs are gaining traction in the commercial sector as businesses invent new and innovative use cases such as package delivery, farming, photography, land surveying, disaster relief, gas/oil pipeline inspection, and much more. As these commercial UAV fleets grow larger, fleet operators will need new ways to efficiently manage and streamline vehicle maintenance. A generic fault detection system would allow the operators to detect abnormalities and then preemptively repair or replace faulty components before the vehicle becomes a safety hazard and/or causes a disruption in operations. The generic plug-and-play capability of the proposed system is critical to commercialization. By creating a common solution and integration approach that minimizes the complexity, installation, and setup time this technology can bring enhanced safety to the consumer UAV market  and ease the integration of these aircraft into the NAS.",Air Transportation & Safety; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Distribution/Management; Electromagnetic; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Simulation & Modeling,Vertical Lift Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The Movement Area Closure Planner (MACP) provides airport stakeholder capability to improve decision processes and decision outcomes during surface closure events by developing a what-if simulation functionality to explore multiple operational decision choices during surface closure events. MACP ensures realistic simulation of airport traffic operations by relying on a high-fidelity airport simulator which has been used in multiple high-fidelity airport operations analyses for FAA and airport operational improvement evaluation projects. The key innovation added to a high-fidelity simulator is a machine learning based predictive engine which realistically projects multiple probable future evolution trajectories for key factors influencing the airport operations under surface closure events (e.g., predicted gate pushback rates, predicted runway arrival and departure demands, predicted departure queue lengths, predicted de-ice pad queue lengths). Reliable what-if analysis is enabled by taking each of these probable evolution trajectories of key variables and kicking off multiple airport traffic simulations, each simulating airport traffic under one of these probable scenarios. Another variable input for the simulations is surface closure operational decision parameters, e.g., start and end times for runway closure. Multiple probable futures are simulated for each choice of surface closure operational decision parameter, thereby enabling us to predict not just one value for key airport performance metrics, but multiple probable values each associated with its probability of occurrence.","MACP is relevant to NASA's AORG that supports R&D airline focused work, including the airline operations center (AOC) & flight deck. AORG seeks to integrate industry ideas with NASA solutions to develop innovative and automated solutions for increasing airline operations efficiency and safety. The AORG is gaining a better understanding of the effects of winter storms on NAS operations (especially airports) and developing knowledge and tools needed to improve efficiency (reduce cancelations and delays). AORG developed a tool called FACT. FACT is a web-based application that would improve winter weather operations within the AOC and at airports.Accessing the MACP would represent a significant shift in airport runway closure decision making processes. The ability to create a reliable data driven CDM process automates the decision process during irregular (non-emergency) operational situations, namely prediction. By having predictive data at hand when multiple decision making processes are active, airport staff have a greater flexibility to focus on safety related aspects - thereby enhancing safety. A quick and easy tool that can provide efficiency and safety benefits, reduce staff workload, and drive data into the multiple management decision making layers would be highly desirable for commercial application. Deploying this tool across a wide variety of airport sizes and types could have a significant positive efficiency impact on the NAS.","What-if scenario analysis decision support tool supports runway closure decision making at the FAA ATCSCC, FAA ARTCCs and AOCs supporting NAS-wide what-if analyses while planning and negotiating potential TMI actions under a CDM operational paradigm. MACP input portals can also be installed at busy TRACONs and Towers so controllers or Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) at those facilities can provide real-time inputs on current or forecast local conditions. Airport operations staff is the most reliable local runway closure forecast source and MACP portals provide an expedient approach for generating the most reliable forecasts. Deploying MACP as a web based tool enables airlines and ATCT to share data with central airport tools to improve CDM. Airlines providing expected gate pushback times, high-value flight preferences, ATCT can share data on the expected arrival landing rates, airspace configuration (e.g., what departure-fixes are open for use), expected runway configuration changes, etc. Enhanced non-NASA application includes predicting and managing the closure of any movement area during any selected airfield irregular operational condition. Movement areas may include any surface between the gate and the departure runway surface or may be limited to portions between those points. Movement area closures can be more disruptive to airlines than a runway closure due to extended taxi times, fuel burn, and overall delay.",Air Transportation & Safety; Simulation & Modeling,Autonomy of the National Airspace Systems (NAS)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In process inspection (IPI) can detect inconsistencies and potential defects on a layer-by-layer basis, offering  lower rejections, higher yield, closed loop process control and in process repair. We will develop a novel IPI method called Layer Topographic Mapping (LTM). Surface morphology of every layer is measured after melting to very fine detail at high speed using a COTS laser profilometer (LP) sensor. Dense 3D point clouds (LTMs) of the top layer of the surface are created with high accuracy and spatial resolution.  The LTM map describes detailed surface morphology of the layer and also is used to calculate the incremental thickness distribution of the formed layer. The data is analyzed in several ways to detect, classify and locate layer defects such as pores, balling and unfused powder. Both 1D and 2D frequency analysis of the surface profile has been shown effective detecting atypical or aberrant layer topography features that may correspond with flaws. Computer vision tools developed to reliably detect subtle defects in textured surfaces will also be employed, analyzing statistical variation of regions of the image from the overall image. These methods are effective detecting texture abnormalities without any a priori knowledge of the texture itself and are successfully used in high speed industrial inspection applications such as textile production. Flightware has teamed with Edison Welding Institute (EWI) who built and operate a dedicated L-PBF Test Bed to develop effective IPI methods and closed loop process control. This includes several local and area sensors, including a Laser Profilometer mounted on the powder Recoater. EWI's Test Bed is operational today; no SBIR investment is required. In Phase I we will acquire extensive LTM data with the LP sensor and analyze it to detect, classify and locate specific defect conditions in in L-PBF process.","Space applications such as the 3D Printer operating on the International Space Station are especially appealing opportunities for AM processes to provide functional replacements part in space, where spare parts logistics are very challenging. Unlike the ISS proof-of-concept device, mission critical AM parts require a high level of QA to assure functionality, where in process inspection can be extremely beneficial. For terrestrial applications laser powder bed forming (L-PBF) offers compelling advantages such as parts integration, facilitating design complexity and drastically shortening supply chains and lead times. For example, an Inconel 635 LH2 Injector made for NASA was produced in two pieces, replacing more than 150 separate parts that were previously assembled, and was fabricated in 10 days compared with months for the conventional injector.   NASA parts often are made in low volume, are very complex and made from high temperature alloys metals. L-PBF fits these needs very well, enabling parts that otherwise could not be made, at lower cost and much faster delivery.","The market for Aerospace Metal AM including Equipment and associated software, services and materials is forecast at $805 million in 2019 growing to $1.2 billion by 2023.

We address Focus Area 9, Sub Topic S1.08 Value Proposition: There is a need to measure the total atmospheric NHX load (NH3+NH4+), with significant ecosystem implications including eutrophication, air quality, and indirectly on atmospheric radiative balance. Current NH3 analyzers miss most of the atmospheric NH3 load, present as fine aerosols.The Innovation: The front-end NH4+ reactor cycles between a line that passes gas phase NH3 to the CEAS analyzer, and then a line where NH4+ aerosols are converted to NH3. A key innovation is flow path material, for which the literature is confused, with significant differences between Teflon formulations (factor of 10 difference in adsorption for PFA versus PTFE by one study).This fast, in situ, analyzers, will enable measurements at dramatically lower per sample cost and far greater data density than aerosol samplers. The ability to measure both NH3 and NH4+ sufficiently rapidly will allow characterization of the strong heterogeneity exhibited by these short-lived species with localized emissions.The NHxR is developed in collaboration with Los Gatos Research, a major manufacturer of state-of-the-art trace gas analyzers with extensive market awareness and well-established clients. BRI retains intellectual property to the NHxR and will license the NHxR for manufacture, potentially by LGR. LGR partnership provides significant commercialization advantages. Dr. Leifer (BRI - Team leader), has led multi-institution, multiple-aircraft NASA campaigns. BRI conducts numerous field studies to solve real-world problems, field expertise that aids in solution-development to meet NASA and market needs.","The NHxR will interest research labs (academic, industry, agency labs), regulatory agencies (local, state, national agencies), and agriculture, specifically intensive husbandry and poultry operations. The NHxR will be commercially accessible (pricing comparable to typical air quality analyzers) requiring low technical expertise and minimal maintenance and calibration time. The envisioned applications are stationary air monitoring and mobile monitoring on automobiles and/or small airplanes.Commercial agricultural interests include stationary applications in enclosed cow and poultry sheds where concentrations can be far higher than outside ambient - with just the NH3 load (neglecting NH4+) reaching 8 ppm in cattle houses, to 18 ppm in pig houses and to 30 ppm in poultry houses in Northern Europe. Human exposure limits are 25 ppm. Industry trends are for greater agricultural animal density, intensifying these problems. Although workers can wear masks, animals inhale the full atmospheric NHX load. Current analyzers are negatively biased, missing the NH4+ load. An NHxR-CEAS could actively modulate exhaust fans, thus improving worker conditions and livestock health and productivity.Other NHxR opportunities include industrial stack emission monitoring (power plants, refineries) where ammonia is a waste product, but are not a first focus. Other opportunities exist by extension to other sticky gases, such as nitrogen dioxide / nitric acid and sulfur dioxide / sulfuric acid.","A number of NASA satellite platforms are focused on aerosols for which the NHxR can help understand formation mechanisms as well as improving our understanding of the relationship between space-based NH3 retrievals from satellites like AIRS and IASI to total atmospheric ammonia (NHx) load, which is the parameter that impacts ecosystems. Current NASA orbital instruments measuring aerosol products include MODIS, VIIRS, CALIPSO, etc., which will be added to by future missions such as PACE and candidate missions like HySpIRI. In all cases, better understanding of aerosol formation mechanisms and size distributions will improve interpretation of satellite-derived aerosol optical depth, the relationship between environmental controls and aerosol formation (which impacts all other satellite products via atmospheric radiative transfer corrections) and ecosystem impacts. Additionally, there could be future planetary applications. For example, future Titan atmospheric explorer missions where NH3 plays an important role in aerosol formation or even Jupiter's Great Red Spot where NH3 also is proposed to form aerosols. After miniaturization of the NHxR design, it could play a role in future space missions as a front end to a CEAS or other planetary science analyzer.",Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support),Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These include increased efficiency, reduced vibration and reductions in overall system mass and power consumption.  For the coolers required, Stirling and pulse tube coolers offer the best opportunities.  At present, the efficiency of these coolers is limited by the effectiveness of low-temperature-stage regenerators.  Below about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators.  The heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thus, reducing the efficiency.  Also, materials commonly used are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues.  In the proposed effort, we will address both the aspect of high-efficiency and regenerator durability.  First, a Rare Earth alloy, that below 60 K has a heat capacity higher than that of commonly used materials, will be configured in a well-defined intricate porous matrix; Secondly, both the void fraction and the ratio of surface area to solid fraction of the regenerator matrix will be tailored using a new approach, addressing that both form and thermal characteristics are essential to achieving a high efficiency.","Astrophysical, astrobiology and exploration missions planned by NASA depend on the availability of reliable and efficient multi-stage cryocoolers.  Advanced astrophysics missions such as the James Web Space Telescope (JWST) require low temperature cooling for detectors and their associated optics directly.

The MG Syntactic insulation includes a combination of (1) CRG's proprietary high temperature stable MG Resin as a binder, (2) light weight and high temperature insulation fillers for reduced weight and thermal conductivity, and (3) fiber reinforcements for structural performance as needed. The resulting material is incompressible, inherently tough compared with microporous ceramics, machinable, easy to work with, and highly conformable. Most importantly, its density is approximately 25% that of its ceramic counterparts and its porosity is closed-cell so the density of the gas environment that it's in should have no bearing on its thermal conductivity. All of these benefits translate to a lighter weight, more reliable insulation system in support of longer mission durations.","Supporting NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, this project's technologies directly address requirements of thermal insulation for extreme environments for use in exploration vehicle thermal management systems.  This project's technologies offer dramatic improvements in density relative to the state of the art, microporous silica materials without compromising those materials' fundamental value proposition of being incompressible, having very low thermal conductivity at high temperature, and excellent thermal stability to support long duration missions in extreme environments. The proposed technology has much broader impact for other insulation applications within Space Technology, and is in general a ubiquitous solution for lightweight, high-temperature insulation challenges.","The MG family of materials encompasses a wide array of high-temperature applications, including structural components; ablative and non-ablative insulation; and many other applications. In this effort, CRG will focus on high-temperature, light-weight insulation that is low-cost, robust, and easy to process. Initially, CRG will target aerospace markets and industrial markets where high-temperature thermal barriers are needed such as ceramic processing, petrochemical and fine chemical (refineries), and energy.

The method is based on observing visible planets in the solar system with Star Trackers and being able to discriminate between planets and fixed stars. Thus the proposed method is autonomous and does not require assistance from ground facilities. Space vehicle autonomy is particularly important to enable long term human exploration of space. Star Trackers are ubiquitous in space vehicles, having the function of estimating the vehicle attitude with respect to the inertial reference frame. This is accomplished by observing the fixed stars and comparing them with the on-board star catalog. Planets may also be observed, but the Star Tracker typically ignores such observations. It is possible to discriminate between stars and other bright objects in the image, thus the direction of observed planets in the camera reference frame can be evaluated, and the planet identified combining a number of heuristics, including time. The proposed method is based on a closed-form least-squares solution obtained by minimizing the sum of the expected object-space squared distance errors. A weighted least-squares solution is provided by an iterative procedure. The weights are evaluated using the distances to the planets estimated by the least-squares solution. Such novel weighted approach only requires one  iteration to converge and results in significant accuracy gains compared to the simple least squares approach. The light-time correction is also taken into account. The proposed work includes the development of a library of algorithms to augment star tracker capabilities by providing the interplanetary position estimation function. This can be used in new Star Tracker development or to augment existing capabilities, at no additional requirement of weight or size for the spacecraft.","Autonomous Position estimation is a key enabling capability for all kinds of spacecraft. Existing methods rely mostly on telemetry from the ground (e.g. RADAR, or other form of active tracking) or global navigation system (e.g. GPS). Long term exploration missions, such as human mission to Mars or asteroids, including asteroid mining, will require the ability to perform navigation autonomously, without assistance from Earth (which also involves significant delays due to the immense distances of space travel). This additional robustness is a must for NASA human exploration missions. Other classes of space vehicles would also benefit from having this capability because of the additional robustness granted to space-vehicle operations. Increased vehicle autonomy is a key requirement for the NASA technology development roadmap. The proposed technology favors dual-use of existing assets, the star trackers, and therefore does not burden the system engineers with additional weight, size, and significant power requirements, leaving more options for experiment and support payloads. In addition, the increased accuracy of the autonomous position estimation enables the vehicle to monitor and adjust its own orbit in the critical phases of orbit entry or aero-braking, when the spacecraft is obscured from Earth or the delay in communication proves critical.","The problem of autonomous position estimation is general to all spacecraft manufacturers and therefore is also of great commercial interest also outside NASA. In the future, private entities will also be involved in long distance missions; asteroid mining, for instance, has been proposed as a potentially important application of interplanetary travel. In this case, commercial entities will have the same autonomy requirements that NASA exploration missions already face. In addition, there is great interest in the Department of Defense (e.g. Air Force Space Command), to increase the resilience of their space assets to a deliberate attack to the GPS satellites by a hostile power. Increased autonomy of DOD space assets requires accurate position estimation. The proposed method could be extended to satellites orbiting Earth in GEO, thus providing important redundancy in position estimation in a GPS-denied environment.",Navigation & Guidance,Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

(MIS) proposes the development of an Industrial Crystal Facility (ICF) for microgravity product manufacturing and applied research. The ICF is focused on advanced materials engineering, rather than biomedical research, and serves a complimentary role to existing NASA-developed hardware, expanding utilization of ISS. Intended applications include nonlinear optical single crystals and other relatively large material formulations. This is a critical next step in the development of Low Earth Orbit as an economic development zone, using the ISS National Lab as a proving ground and following the forthcoming Made In Space Fiber (MIS Fiber) demonstration of manufacturing a product in space with economically-significant intrinsic value on the ground. The ISS National Lab serves as an ideal platform to explore whether industrial crystals can be grown in microgravity to larger sizes and/or improved quality as compared with terrestrial sources. Existing low temperature solution growth methods take days to weeks to complete, so parabolic flights and suborbital vehicles are not suitable for establishing process baselines and making effective comparisons. Microgravity production holds the potential for room-temperature production of NLO materials for high-energy applications with size and quality undiminished by the effects of sedimentation and convection. A new facility is needed to explore the feasibility of microgravity-enabled industrial crystals as a new product market for Low Earth Orbit.","The proliferation of photonic sensors and optoelectronic devices for both military and civil applications has no end in sight. From the warfighter on deployment to the commanding officers in the Pentagon, the Department of Defense wants more eyes on the battlefield. Operational needs range from troop-level LIDAR devices to optical and infrared sensors that feed tactical battlefield management systems to early-warning and detection of missile threats from space. Defense researchers are increasingly studying optical computing and other integrated photonic devices to reduce the vulnerability of traditional military electronic devices to jamming and electronic attack.In the civil sector, including NASA, photonic device applications include laser rangefinding, photonic gyroscopes, spectroscopy, and optical communications. For example, the upcoming Laser Communications Relay Demonstration on the ISS, called ILLUMA, relies on a first-of-its-kind integrated photonics circuit to transmit and encode data at orders of magnitude higher rates than traditional digital systems. Future integrated photonics circuits can be lithographically printed on large single optical crystals, much as integrated microelectronic circuits are lithographically printed on semiconductor crystals today.","Demand for optical sensors, laser equipment, and optical switches for computing and communications continues to grow. Nonlinear optical materials alone represent a market of more than $1 billion in the optoelectronics sector. Semiorganic NLO materials are being investigated for fiber optic communications components, laser transmitters, computer memory devices, improved LIDAR, ultrafast optical switches, optical waveguides, and image sensors for automotive-safety systems, medical equipment, video security and surveillance networks, human-recognition user interfaces, and other embedded image collection devices. Technical adviser Dr. Gregory Wurtz assesses that the benign production environment and flexibility in designing their nonlinear optical properties lends microgravity-enabled optical crystals towards applications in deep UV lasers for medical devices and the development of thin film materials for active nanoscale devices that are not currently easily fabricated.",In Situ Manufacturing; Nonspecified; Processing Methods,ISS Utilization and Microgravity Research   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Despite its expense, there is no substitute for helium in most of these applications because of its extremely low boiling point and unique chemical inertness. The price of helium is expected to increase as reserves are drawn down. In addition to helium, the high supply costs and limited availability of hydrogen fuel also requires its conservation. While it is not as expensive as helium and is more abundant, the transport of hydrogen is still costly and poses a great environmental risk due its flammability and highly reactive nature. Therefore, an efficient way to separate the He/H2 from NASA?s purge streams and recover both the helium and hydrogen in a pure form is critical to reduce cost of operations and to reduce risks. In Phase I we will synthesize and optimize a new sorbent and develop a process and cycle scheme that will allow us to achieve the target helium and hydrogen purities with low energy consumption.","The main attraction of our research to NASA is to ensure the long-term sustainability of programs that rely on helium gas for system purging, leak checking, and as a blanket gas for liquid H2 tanks.  The cost of a single recovery unit that is conservatively capable of reclaiming $950,000 of high-purity helium per year is expected to be less than $2.5 million.  Depending on the amount of hydrogen that is mixed with the helium, the hydrogen recovered from purge gases (and boiloff) could be of similar value.  NASA?s future launch systems are built around hydrogen-oxygen rockets, and the need for large quantities of helium will therefore continue for decades. TDA?s He-H2 recovery system can be used to capture large and small He-H2 purge and boil-off streams at their source to save money, conserve resources, and improve the environmental sustainability of NASA?s operations.","There is a real and far larger commercial opportunity for our technology in the chemical and energy industries. There is worldwide interest in storage and pressurization systems for hydrogen as an efficient and clean energy carrier. Air Liquide and Linde are already exploring hydrogen compression using solid-state compressors. Hence, the primary customers would include these technology developers. TDA's technology can be used to recover and purify hydrogen from streams that are currently vented or flared in the oil refining, chemical, ammonia, methanol, chlor-alkali, metallurgical, glass and electronics industries.The technological readiness level (TRL) will be elevated from 2 to 3 at the end of Phase I.

Due to budgetary constraints and lack of reliable access to medium-lift vehicles, the current trend in the space industry is towards smaller, cheaper, and more frequent missions.  Nano-satellites, such as CubeSats, are gaining in popularity due to their low cost and ease of deployment.  These miniaturized platforms impose severe constraints on the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of the payload.  However, relatively large apertures are required to achieve desired spatial resolution.  In this NASA SBIR effort, Phase Sensitive Innovations (PSI) will dramatically reduce the SWaP of our microwave photonic imaging radiometer technology, thus making it amenable to deployment on spaceborne platforms.  Our innovative approach employs distributed aperture imaging (DAI) with optical upconversion of the incoming microwave radiation and subsequent coherent optical reconstruction of the microwave scene.  The sensor features a flexible, two-dimensional form factor that allows the antenna array to be stowed for launch and deployed once in orbit using space inflatables, which enables a large RF aperture to be realized on a small platform.  Besides easing implementation on small satellites, PSI?s imaging radiometer provides capabilities beyond those currently available on conventional microwave sensors, most notably the ability to generate real-time, two-dimensional radiometric imagery with no mechanical scanning.  The end result of our effort will not only greatly reduce the SWaP of our instrument commensurate with deployment on emerging platforms, but also reduce the cost and complexity while increasing reliability and performance.  These improvements in turn will open up new market segments for the technology.","The distributed aperture array technology utilized in PSI?s microwave imaging radiometer can be leveraged in a number of applications of interest to NASA.  Besides passive sensing of microwave radiation from earth and other celestial bodies for weather related data, active operation is a straightforward extension for radar applications where range data is useful.  High gain beam forming is readily achieved by the phased array, which is advantageous for communications and telemetry applications.","The applications for PSI?s microwave and millimeter wave imaging technology and its capabilities are numerous and could have an appreciable impact in many commercial and military areas.  Millimeter wave radiation is attenuated millions of times less in clouds, fog, smoke, snow, and sandstorms than visual or IR radiation, which enables millimeter wavelength imaging systems to ?see-through? obscurants in day or night conditions.  A partial list of applications includes: 1. Marine navigation in dense fog and inversion layers with passive imaging systems2. Navigational aids for landing aircraft in adverse weather, operating emergency response vehicles in poor weather or smoke, piloting ships in poor-visibility conditions, and monitoring highways for traffic safety3. Military surveillance and target acquisition in inclement weather with potential use on unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs)4.

Previous refrigerator/freezer systems developed for this application such as ISS RFR, use thermoelectric thermal control system with overall system COP around 0.36 in freezer mode. Terrestrial cold food storage systems however, utilize a much more efficient vapor compression thermal control systems, making the systems lighter and more compact. Currently, these systems do not have provisions for the load and reliability requirements of space applications, and are also not designed for microgravity operation.To achieve NASA's targets, Air Squared is proposing to develop a scroll driven vapor compression  refrigerator/freezer system. It's a highly efficient (COP ~ 3.5), lightweight (secondary mass penalty of  <0.2 kg) and reliable (oil free & fewer rotating parts) standalone system. Similar to conventional systems, this vapor compression system will include four major components: compressor, condenser, expansion device and evaporator.There are four significant innovations in the vapor compression cycle. For expansion work recovery, a scroll expander will be used to recover power from the expansion process to improve the system performance (Innovation 1). The Air Squared compressor and expander will integrate two stages on either side of the orbiting scroll, to increase the total pressure ratio (Innovation 2), this enhances the performance, without increasing the size or weight of the scroll devices. In order to further reduce the size and weight, both the compressor and expander will be integrated into one hermetic shell with both units driven off a common shaft on either side of the motor (Innovation 3). And last, both the compressor and expander will operate oil-free (Innovation 4). This will remove the cycles operational reliance on gravity while keeping the design compact & lightweight at higher efficiencies.","The proposed vapor compression cycle has several key innovations which can be applied to thermal systems outside of the proposed cold food storage. The following are potential applications of the innovations:Refrigeration System - The proposed refrigeration system will enable a reliable and efficient cold food refrigerator or freezer for spacecraft application.Waste Heat Rejection Heat Pump - The proposed refrigeration system approach can be modified to enable reliable and efficient heat rejection and therefore precise thermal control for spacecrafts operating at high ambient temperature locations.Environment Control Heat Pump - NASA's crewed spacecrafts also require thermal controls systems for the pressurized cabins in order to provide and maintain a livable environment. While systems developed for cold food storage will most likely yield a smaller system than thermal control of crew accommodations, these systems can be easily scaled for larger heat loads in the case of heat pumping for cabins.Regardless of whether it's for thermal management at an electronics component level, cabin atmosphere level, or food storage level, a compact, lightweight, reliable and efficient vapor compression system for heat refrigeration can be applied in a variety of ways.","The proposed vapor compression system has the ability to dramatically influence the refrigeration market. Use of a natural refrigerant such as isopentane and high efficiency scroll machinery makes it environmentally friendly and more efficient. Additionally, use of oil free technology reduces the need of oil separation componentry in the vapor compression systems, thereby reducing cost and complexity. Reliable and efficient oil free cooling/heating systems have substantial potential for both terrestrial and aerospace applications where efficiency and operational cost are critical.","Active Systems; Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation)",Logistics Reduction   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The modulator would be a subsection of a transmitter used in extreme high temperature and rad-hard space applications such as in-situ atmospheric and surface explorations in the high-temperature high-pressure environment at the Venusian surface (485C, 95 atmospheres). Our intent is to complete the phase 1 study and deliver a design roadmap to the implementation and fabrication of the design in Phase 2. The proposed modulator feasibility study would also address the packaging aspect of the HTMX, its miniaturization and manufacturing processes and guidelines to facilitate reliable and repeatable device fabrication and its full adaptation to mission deployment. Our proposed solution offers compelling features such as a rugged package that would withstand atmospheric pressure in excess of 95 bar ambient pressure at +500 degrees C. The design and analysis of the HTMX configuration would include frequency scalable output, and commercially available compact package footprints. Since any hot planet lander system requires reliable communication, the frequency tolerance for HTMX will be optimized to enable reliable transmission fidelity for the Venusians in-situ surface exploration. The underlying objective in evaluating the different modulation schemes is to keep the approach simple. keeping it simple will positively impact the reliability and the eventual TRL of the proposed solution. Considering the harsh operating environment and the limited operating life for the system, we focus on a simple and reliable frequency modulation scheme. Our approach will also enable very efficient adaptation of the design to ASK (amplitude shift key) modulation as well.HTMX in itself would include other side benefit of a reliable and stable rad-hard clock source.","The topic of the proposal reflects the focus on the NASA missions to Venus and other hot planets. Given the high temperature nature of the work proposed, there could be other derivative outcomes from the same technology. There is potential to configure the GaN transistors used in PWM circuits. There are PWM circuits being planned to be used in power processing units (PPU) as part of space based electronic thrusters. The high temperature capable PWM could be positioned very close to the power switches without the need for large and heavy heat sink. Doing so will result in more efficient DC-DC boost convertors.","The non-NASA applications could potentially extend to more than one type of application and maps to multiple market segments.

Inaccurate estimates incorrectly identify demand-capacity, imbalance time periods and metering solutions; resulting in underutilized runways or excessive traffic congestion. Accurate predictions enable maximizing airport and flight efficiency. The Predictor of Airport Runway Capacity (PARC) forecasts the future capacities of individual airport runways under specified operating conditions and a time horizon. PARC uses historical operations data to create and update statistical Bayesian network (BN) models of inter-aircraft spacing, accounting for influencing factors. The BN models are used in Monte-Carlo simulations of airport runway traffic to predict their arrival and departure capacities for the specified operating conditions and scheduled traffic. Traffic managers use PARC's capacity estimates to implement metering programs to efficiently balance runway demand with capacity. For example, forecast weather proximate to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT) will change the prevailing wind direction, ceiling, and Runway Visual Range (RVR), requiring changing the airport runway configuration from South Flow to North Flow and the operational flight rules from visual to marginal. Traffic planners want to know if these changes will cause excessive traffic congestion warranting implementation of a departure metering program. PARC determines that the number of scheduled departures will exceed capacity on runway 36C under the forecasted runway configuration, visibility, and traffic conditions. The traffic planners implement metering of runway 36C departures using PARC's runway capacity estimate. Because the estimated runway capacity is accurate, metering neither starves the runways of flights nor creates excessive runway departure queues.","PARC supports NASA Airspace Technology Demonstration-2 (ATD-2) and FAA Surface Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) concepts of operations for maximizing the efficiency of airport departure and arrival traffic. PARC could be applied to the NASA ATD-2 integrated arrival-departure-surface traffic management tools for planning and management of airport departures and arrivals. Specifically, PARC could be used to provide accurate estimates of the individual arrival and departure capacities of the airport's runways. The estimates could be used to schedule airport takeoffs and landings to comply with the capacities, and to plan departure gate pushbacks accordingly; to guide airport ground controllers in clearing aircraft to enter the movement area, or to plan the use of holding areas on the airport surface. PARC could be applied to the FAA Surface CDM Concept of Operations. Specifically, PARC could support the airport traffic control tower, aircraft operators, the airport operator and other stakeholders in predicting demand-capacity imbalances under future operating conditions and plan traffic management strategies to mitigate the imbalance. The PARC-estimated capacity values could be used to plan departure metering programs, and to schedule movement area entry times for departures to balance demand with runway capacity.","The first application is to use these technologies to create standard products.  PARC would become available to anyone wanting to predict runway capacity, including air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) and airport authorities around the world. For example, ANSPs could use PARC to support their traffic planning and management, and airport authorities could use PARC to estimate peak capacity for facility and operations planning.The second application is to license the technology. PARC would be made available to large system integrators/prime contractors providing ATM automation solutions. For instance, PARC could be licensed to Lockheed Martin for use with the Time Based Flow Management (TBFM) traffic metering automation or to the Tower Flight Data Management (TBFM) airport traffic planning and management system; or to Harris Orthogon for use with the OSYRIS Departure Manager (DMAN) departure metering automation.The third application is to retain the PARC technology and components, and to use them to provide analytical services to customers. The customer defines the problem or issue for which analysis is required, and ATCorp applies PARC or its components, and our professional services expertise, to analyze the problem and produce a report of the results. PARC would fit into this business model as an advanced tool augmenting existing analysis tools.

Semiconductor technologies capable of meeting these demanding requirements tend to have limited capabilities, are expensive, and are not easily configured for specific mission requirements.  Leading-edge applications will benefit from the ability to implement high speed interconnect protocols between host processors and system slaves, such as sensors, actuators, power managers, imagers and transceivers.  The development of a Radiation Hardened Double Data Rate (DDR) embedded macro is proposed for insertion into digital integrated circuits (ICs) suitable for scalable single and multi-core processors, special purpose logic functions and scalable memory blocks on a space-qualified, radiation hardened integrated circuit digital fabric.  A NASA-funded Structured ASIC architecture is under development at Micro-RDC, capable of meeting space-grade requirements while creating a cost-effective, quick-turn development environment.  The SASIC fabric will implement known Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) techniques on an advanced 32nm Silicon on Insulator (SOI) CMOS process, supporting high-density, high-speed low-power implementations.  A unique Master Tile architecture with through-seal-ring connections allows the designer to define dedicated logic functions, scalable memory blocks and user-defined I/Os; all on a single, scalable integrated circuit.  The 32nm SOI CMOS process technology platform incorporates RHBD building-blocks (e.g. flip-flops, gates, distributed memory, block memory, I/O) required for the systems designer to implement functional blocks for application-specific requirements.  During this project, key blocks for a DDR3 macro will be specified and evaluated for optimum inclusion into the Micro-RDC SASIC.","NASA supports various requirements ranging from science missions, space station, and deep space missions requiring high-performance computing and controls.  Interplanetary and long term low Earth orbit systems require radiation tolerances capable of ensuring that the on-board electronics outlast the life expectancy of the systems.  These demanding requirements of radiation tolerance and harsh operating environments force satellite systems developers to consider capabilities that are uniquely optimized for their applications.  The Structured ASIC solves the dilemma of balancing performance, cost, risk and time to deployment against alternative solutions.  Scalable, high performance control systems can support a wide range of applications when integrated circuit flexibility is available.  The ability to right-size integrated circuits while adding functional blocks, such as a DDR3 SRAM memory interface, while maintaining performance at low cost, enables NASA to use this technology across a wide range of programs and applications.  NASA programs and missions that could benefit include the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) mission, Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO), BOReal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) and the Methane Trace Gas Sounder. Longer term missions include lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions (MAVEN), solar system exploration (e.g. Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS)).","Companies that deploy satellites for purposes similar to NASA's Earth-centric applications will greatly benefit by gaining access to the advanced 32nm Silicon on Insulator (SOI) CMOS process technology in a cost efficient manner.  There are a number of applications that require this kind of performance within military, intelligence and commercial satellites, which are showing growing demand in units deployed and performance.  The 2014 FAA Commercial Space Transportation Forecasts predict that an average of seventy eight commercial payloads will be launched annually over the next decade.  A reasonable estimate of the number of classified military and intelligence payloads at least equals the commercial deployments.  Micro-RDC currently offers a 90nm CMOS platform, 50MHz Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) Structured ASICs capable of handling low to mid-range control and compute requirements in space.  The 32nm SOI CMOS platform will increase to 300MHz, and will greatly improve densities and processing speed, including the ability to add DDR3 SRAM memory.  This type of memory will enhance functionality for computing applications and peripheral functions such as sensors, actuators, image capture and processing subsystems.","Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Computer System Architectures; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Image Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Network Integration; Quality/Reliability; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)",High Performance Space Computing Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

With Jupiter as a bright light behind the moon, NASA was able to observe Europa in silhouette, and with ultraviolet light saw what appeared to be evidence of the plumes. If plumes exist, this is an exciting find, lead researcher William Sparks said. It means we may be able to explore that ocean, that ocean of Europa, and for organic chemicals, he added. It would allow us to search for signs of life without having to drill through miles of ice. The apparent plumes seem to be mostly around the south pole, Sparks said, although one appears farther north and may be a likelier candidate for a mission. ""We presume it to be water vapor or ice particles because that's what Europa's made of, and those molecules do appear at the wavelengths we observed.In preparation for such a mission, spacecraft will have to pass through dense clouds of ice particulates, which could damage vital instruments. Accordingly, NASA has indicated there is a need for simulating the production of ice in the size range of 50nm up through 2 microns. The NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range was designed to sent solid projectiles for studying the effects of meteorite impacts on celestial bodies and potential micro-meteoroid damage to spacecraft. At the far end of the barrel, a gunpowder explosion is used to compress hydrogen gas to as much as 1 million times atmospheric pressure. The compressed gas gets released and sent down the launch tube, firing a projectile pellet at speeds between 7,000 and 15,000 mph.  No ice particulate could survive being subjected to such massive transitory input of kinetic energy. The Ames gun was not designed for accelerating ice projectiles, so a new technology is required. Here is proposed an electrospray ice plume generator, with electrostatic acceleration.","Europa is one of the most active bodies in the solar system: about the size of Earth's moon, and at its warmest only about -260F (-160C), and covered in an icy shell. But the moon also has rarer qualities: evidence of abundant liquid water, a rocky core that would have a range of chemicals, and energy generated by tidal heating the moon is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one face always toward the gas giant. Should the moon have water, energy and organic chemicals, it could have the basic building blocks that developed into life on Earth. For a long time humanity has been wondering whether there is life beyond Earth, NASA astrophysicist Paul Hertz said. ""We're lucky enough to live in an era where we can address questions like that scientifically. We have a special interest in any place that might possess those characteristics. Europa might be such a place. The finding, NASA's Hertz continued, increases our confidence that water and other materials in Europa's ocean, Europa's hidden ocean, might be available for us to study without us landing and digging on those unknown miles of ice"". In order for NASA to probe water plumes that produce ice particulates, a source for creating such high speed particles is required to see whether a spacecraft will survive passing through a plume, and to test the sampling technologies for these plumes.

AdvR is proposing a beam steering mechanism for space-based Lidar based on AdvR's electro-optic deflector technology with no moving parts, making it favorable for space-based operation. The system operates on the principle of electro-optically controlled prisms engineered into a ferroelectric substrate, and is designed to have low loss, fast switching speed and settling time, good isolation and operation from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.  AdvR has previously built and tested electro-optic switches and scanners and the demonstrated performance shows promising potential for use in discrete angle beam steering for Lidar.  This Phase I SBIR will investigate the use of the EO deflector technology for a fast beam steering mechanism to improve the sampling density, coverage and signal to noise ratio of NASA's Space-based Lidar systems.","A fast electro-optic beam steering mechanism can improve the sampling density and coverage in all four of NASA's primary Lidar instrument types: backscatter, ranging, Doppler and differential absorption.

This single point comparison method does not directly enable a POA analyst to identify the root-cause for a particular observed inefficiency, nor does it help in identifying a solution for mitigating that inefficiency. This SBIR develops a machine learning based approach for improving POA and for potentially making it more autonomous. We call this tool Collective Inference based Data Analytics System for POA (CIDAS-P). CIDAS-P will provide airport, airline, FAA and NASA personnel with a fast, flexible and streamlined process for analyzing the day-of-operations, rapidly pinpointing exact causes for any observed inefficiencies, as well as recommending actions to be taken to avoid the same inefficiencies in the future. It does this by developing an innovative, collective inference algorithm for cross-comparing performance of the same facility on different days as well as cross-comparing performance across different facilities. The algorithm leverages sophisticated probabilistic modeling techniques that consider the subtle nuances by which cross-facility and cross-day operational scenarios differ to enable apples-to-apples comparisons across traffic scenarios and identify what works well and what does not in similar situations. User acceptance of NASA Trajectory Based Operations research products stands to benefit from CIDAS-P because CIDAS-P's automated recommendations can help identify and fix problems with these products early on in their deployment life-cycle.","The proposed innovation, CIDAS-P, is applicable to NASA research in the areas of Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) and Airspace Technology Demonstrations (ATD). It provides a tool for evaluating performance of airport, TRACON and enroute traffic under the management of new NASA research-products developed by these projects.CIDAS-P can also be used as a 'grading' system for ATD-2 operations, for evaluating and classifying operation types in real-time to inform switching between multiple ATD-2 scheduling strategies (e.g., conservative gate-holding, aggressive gate pushbacks).As applied to NASA's Data Science research group's work on identifying operational anomalies, CIDAS-P can be used to rank or measure safety of operations during the identified anomalies, thus providing a hitherto missing capability to automatically identify scenarios falsely tagged as anomalous by the research group's algorithms.","A direct application for the proposed technology, CIDAS-P, is as a decision support tool (DST) to be used at airports, airlines or FAA facilities for analyzing root causes for observed operational efficiencies or irregularities at the end of a day of operations. ATAC is well-placed to provide an operational POA capability to airports, airlines and FAA facilities by integrating CIDAS-P into one of its commercial tools that have been or are been used by some of these entities for other purposes. Another alternative is for ATAC to license the CIDAS-P software to these entities for direct integration within their own tools.The proposed technology can also be infused into DSTs to support the FAA's Plan Execute Review Train and Improve (PERTI) initiative, whose goal is to translate post-event reviews into operational improvements in a repeatable manner. FAA recently started PERTI to address current impediments to improvements in NAS performance. PERTI defines new operational roles and processes to enable integration of analytics into training, operational planning, post-event analysis and training. The current-day manual POA process is inadequate to fulfill PERTI's ambitious goal of translating post-event reviews into operational improvements in a repeatable manner, and it is recognized that new automated POA tools are required.

Monitoring ocean acidification, which results from the accumulation of CO2, is of critical interest, since progressive acidification is already affecting oceans and coastal estuaries and waterways. To that end, NASA and NOAA are seeking in-situ monitoring devices for oceanic and coastal water monitoring, including a pH sensor for seawater, to support space-based monitoring programs. Monitoring ocean pH accurately over large areas has proved to be extremely difficult, and classic sensor technology, based on potentiometric measurements (pH electrodes), have shown significant limitations: current instruments are expensive, do not monitor pH directly, and therefore need complex signal compensation to yield accurate measurements, and require frequent calibration. Intelligent Optical Systems proposes to develop a novel luminescent sensor for pH, taking advantage of novel materials developed to monitor pH and other parameters of interest in high salinity and elevated pressure environments; it will exhibit high selectivity (direct pH measurements) and stability. A novel antifouling technology with no mechanical parts will prevent sensor degradation in seawater. To contain the cost of the electronics while maintaining high performance in detecting the luminescent signal, we will use Circuit Seed circuits, which process analog signals on 100% digital components. This enables them to reduce size and parts count, simplifying quality control and power requirements, and will enable us to produce high-performance, low-cost optoelectronic units.","A low-cost, high-performance sensor for seawater pH, and multiparameter devices for monitoring dissolved CO2 and dissolved oxygen in-situ, are essential to current and future NASA space missions such as Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), and Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE).","Robust sensors for monitoring pH in seawater will enter the oceanography market for NASA programs and beyond.

According to a study by Grand View Research, Inc., the global aquaculture market is expected to exceed $200 billion by 2020; 40% of that aquaculture takes place in marine and brackish water, where water quality plays a critical role in production. A low-cost, robust water quality monitor will be an important enabling technology, helping this industry collect massive amounts of data to accelerate the development of underutilized marine resources in a responsible manner. Finally, sensors developed for seawater will also find application in the water quality monitoring market, which is projected to reach $3.6 billion by 2020.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)",Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The system will enable the operator to monitor quality of an AM job online and assess quality of the finished part. The system consists of two major developments in hardware and software. The first development is the design of a complete sensor setup. Sensors ensure a high-quality measurement of melt pool and as-spread/as-processed layer surfaces.  Open-source control software will transfer sensing-data at high sample rates sufficient for process monitoring. The second development is the data analysis system to translate and visualize measured sensor values in the format of interpretable process quality images. The visualization is accomplished by a mapping algorithm, which transfers measurements from a time-domain into a position-domain representation.

The rapid development and progress of composites technology has been spawned by the high specific strength, stiffness, and toughness offered with respect to other engineering materials.  However, the performance of a composite material is heavily influenced by the strength and toughness of the polymer matrix, which binds the high stiffness fibers into a cohesive element.  Unfortunately, the highly cross-linked polymers necessary to achieve the high Tg required by propulsion systems are costly and prone to brittle fracture under even small elastic deformations.  While the rigidity of the polymer is required for practical applications, the lack of resistance to crack propagation leads to damage prone materials.  This proposed SBIR will develop a new low cost self-healing thermosetting polymer which exhibit high Tg (>550 F), high strength, stiffness and toughness from a room temperature low viscosity resin that allows processing without heating the polymer.  The self-healing properties of polymer will yield increased reliability of the composite and reduced maintenance costs. HARP Engineering will formulate a polymer that meets or exceeds both the performance and cost metrics required by NASA through the use of multifunctional self-healing resins.  This Phase I will perform mechanical testing of the resin at elevated temperatures and layup composites for ASTM testing to demonstrate the high specific strength, stiffness, and toughness compared to existing high temperature resins.","Throughout NASA's technology roadmap the need for improved materials is called out in nearly all Technology Areas and are highlighted as the enablers behind the structures, devices, vehicles, power, life support, propulsion, entry, and many other systems that NASA develops and uses to fulfill its missions.  New materials are required, as are materials with improved properties, combinations of properties and reliability.  In the field of propulsion, polymers which yield improved processing for fiber reinforced composites and lower cost while providing high specific strength and stiffness at extreme temperatures are necessary for wide ranging impact to NASA systems.  The proposed research will specifically develop low cost resin systems for extreme environments which can be processed out of autoclave and with short mold times therefore allowing lighter weight materials to be designed.  Furthermore, the self-healing behavior of the proposed polymer would provide increased reliability and reduced maintenance costs.","The proposed technology has numerous advantages that make it particularly well suited for commercialization, most notably the low cost, low room temperature viscosity and high thermal stability.  Commercialization of the resin will be initially focused on aerospace related applications where high temperature stability is required.  However, our commercialization efforts will go beyond aerospace, with focus on the transition of the resin to wind turbine and automobile production, which are currently two of the fastest growing areas for composite materials and place a primary focus on resin cost and mold time both of which are unprecedented for the proposed resin.",Composites; Polymers; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Smart/Multifunctional Materials,Propulsion Efficiency-Propulsion Materials and Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The process uses an array of evaporation filaments powered by batteries contained in pressurized vessels placed in the vacuum of space.  The vacuum coating process is scalable for large mirrors several meters in diameter, but is applicable to any size mirror.  By simultaneously discharging batteries through individual evaporation filaments, a tremendous amount of energy may be released rapidly.  By placing iridium (or a multi-layer interference coating) on the mirror initially (coated on earth), followed by a fresh coat of aluminum in space, the broadband response of the telescope could be extended down to 30-nm.  Current coating technologies limit the reflectance response to 90-nm because of the absorbing fluoride coating which protects the aluminum from oxidation on earth.  The ability to coat optics in space offers a tremendous potential benefit to astronomy because the 30-nm to 90-nm region is rich in spectral lines. Since molten metals such as aluminum are held onto a hot tungsten filament by surface tension, the proposed evaporation process will work in zero-gravity.  A high aluminum evaporation rate has been shown to produce the least scattering and most highly reflecting aluminum coatings, particularly in the vacuum UV spectral region.  To achieve future wavefront requirements over a large primary mirror, it is likely that many evaporation sources will be required.  By placing the power supply (the battery) very near each evaporation filament, electrical losses are minimized. In Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility using prototype battery-powered deposition (BPD) units previously manufactured at ZeCoat Corporation.In Phase II, miniaturized battery-powered unit will be designed and manufactured, and the coating process will be developed and tested in a simulated space environment.","The primary focus for this research is a space-based coating process for future space telescopes, however, additional commercialization potential lies in coating mirrors on the ground with a battery powered process, for use in space, or, for use on the ground. Creating a EUV-quality aluminum coating with minimal impact on WFE, over a large area, is not a trivial task (and currently the state-of-the-art is far short of requirements).  ZeCoat will commercialize the new technology by offering coating services, through licensing agreements, and by selling or leasing the individual BPD sources. We will advance this coating technology for broadband, UVOIR telescopes to TRL-6 by 2019 (end of Phase II) and we expect sales to begin at the end of Phase II. It is likely that future large monolithic mirrors will require new coatings facilities to coat them. Even if the final bare aluminum coating is applied in space, either an iridium coating, a multi-layer EUV coating, or a fluoride-protected aluminum coating, will be applied prior to launch.  A battery-powered coating technology offers the possibility of building a coating facility on earth to make UV-quality aluminum coatings over-coated with the traditional metal-fluorides.   ZeCoat is prepared to install larger coating facilities to meet the government's needs, when these technologies are mature. The marketability of the new coating technology depends primarily on the optical performance of the coating.",ZeCoat will commercialize the battery-powered coating technology developed in this research for other ground-based applications such as large mirrors for ground-based astronomy.  Large mirrors for aircraft simulators are also a candidate commercial application for the new technology.  We will also market the technology to prime contractors such as Northrup Grumman for applications such as coating repair in space.,"Coatings/Surface Treatments; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Metallics; Mirrors; Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ultraviolet","X-Ray Mirror Systems Technology, Coating Technology for X-Ray-UV-OIR, and Free-Form Optics   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

UAV's are not typically equipped for icing avoidance and many have been lost close to airports when encountering icing hazards or un-forecasted weather conditions. Current aircraft weather radars that operate at X-band (8-12 GHz) have limited or no ability to help pilots detect and quantify icing potential due to atmospheric attenuation. Use of 3D LIDAR technology for ice and snow avoidance could significantly expand the mission envelope of aircraft and UAV's during cold weather operations. IDI is proposing development of a multi-channel 3D LIDAR that will identify low altitude cloud layers - as well as provide runway surface hazard information for UAV's. Unique wavelengths are chosen to identify both cloud moisture content and runway surface contaminates (ice, water, snow, slush) within the local surroundings of the aircraft. During the Phase I IDI will demonstrate a 3D scanning LIDAR in the icing chamber with multiple wavelengths and multiple channels. The LIDAR design will be optimized and packaged to meet the desired range and accuracy requirements during the Phase 2 program.",The proposed 3D LIDAR sensor will provide icing cloud imaging and ranging information for NASA's all weather  UAV operations both in-flight and during take-off and landings. The LIDAR will identify cloud layer location at night to allow safe separation distances from icing clouds and identify clearings for safe decent and landing. The LIDAR also has the capability for ground obstacle avoidance and detecting hazardous surface conditions such as black ice that require increased stopping distance.,"The proposed compact LIDAR instrument will have widespread application to aircraft that do not currently have certified on-board ice protection equipment, such as police, air ambulance, and search and rescue helicopters.

Active balancing is an attractive technique that can be used to increase battery pack life. If performed efficiently and accurately, active balancing can translate into longer battery life and more efficient battery utilization. Active balancers presently equalize either voltage or State of Charge (SOC) in a group of cells or super-cells in series. The more accurate in-operando SOC active balancers depend on on-line SOC estimation algorithms that are typically based on terminal voltage, current, and temperature. These algorithms (e.g., Coulomb counting, Kalman-based filter estimation, etc) accumulate errors and/or become unstable as a consequence of measurement errors, model simplifications, and the lack of an accurate battery parameter determination and tracking method, which is critical as the battery ages and/or operates under unforeseen conditions. To address this problem we propose an active balancing electronic system that can jointly balance the battery pack and measure battery health related parameters without additional hardware. We propose to use this efficient electronic system to demonstrate an improved active balancing system capable of battery life enhancement and safety operation.",NASA has great interest in methods and approaches for intelligent monitoring and innovative techniques that enable extended and safer operation of aircraft with electric propulsion systems.

Because of the light distances involved, this close collaboration will not be practical for inter-planetary exploration. This proposal seeks to develop a software cognitive architecture for space exploration (CASE) that will autonomously carry out exploration operations by using the same knowledge and executing the same plans and procedures as those developed on Earth. Over the past several years, TRACLabs, in support of NASA and other government agencies, has developed a number of components that can be used in such an architecture, and now proposes to design an exploration agent based on that architecture and to show that it is feasible for use in space exploration. These components include a procedure development system known as PRIDE that allows for variably autonomous execution of both crew and robotic procedures, an automated planner that plans and re-plans the execution of procedures to achieve overall mission goals, and an ontology data management system that makes system states available to all the components. In this work we will develop two new but vital elements for the architecture: a process manager that will manage the use of distributed computing resources to support the CASE components, and a natural language dialog system to allow the crew access to any part of the architecture. CASE will provide a feasible approach to agent design for space exploration, provide on-board autonomy in nominal operations and human-computer solutions for off-nominal operations, allow for the interchange of components from external sources and be robust in the face of computational failures.","After Phase II the CASE components or the architecture as a whole will be available to be reworked for exploration systems development and testing.  While there may not be a planetary base in the near future, Orion and other spacecraft that will combine life support systems and EVA operations can benefit by using an autonomous or semi-autonomous CASE agent. An excellent example is the ""Proving Ground"" phase asteroid redirect mission (ARM), which will involve EVAs to obtain samples from captured asteroids.  A CASE agent could also be used on the ISS to support testing of life support and the SSRMS in an exploration scenarios as precursors to future exploration missions. In the past, at Johnson Space Center (JSC) we have worked with EVA personnel and flight directors in migrating PRIDE and planning technologies into mission control. These are the same people working on EVAs for the potential ARM as well as planetary base operations.  We plan to speak with our contacts in the MCC to exploring ways to minimize the number of personnel working the flight control stations using the technologies in this work. This work will also provide a connection to automated planning technology development through NASA ARC's Automation for Operations (A4O) project and its successors.  We will work closely with Dr. Jeremy Frank at NASA ARC during Phase 1 to ensure our relevance to the A4O projects.","TRACLabs is already selling PRIDE as a commercial product to oil field services companies and is providing automation assistance to other companies for drilling operations. The companies involved have already expressed interest in licensing the new capabilities being developed in this project. We will work with them to make sure that this project meets their requirements. TRACLabs expects additional customers in the oil and gas industry will deploy PRIDE once it has been proven effective.  Sierra Nevada Corporation has also purchased PRIDE licenses for use in their Dream Chaser program, which was recently selected to deliver cargo to ISS. In all of these cases, we will offer the features developed this proposal as an ""add-o"" to the existing PRIDE software we deliver.

Two-phase pumped loops are an ideal solution for these applications.  A critical need for these pumped loops is a microgravity-compatible evaporator having a large cooling area to maintain the temperatures of multiple electronics and instruments. The evaporator must be able to accommodate multiple heat loads with a wide range of heat flux densities and allow heat loads to be mounted on any available locations of its cooling surfaces to facilitate vehicle-level system integration.  To this end, Creare proposes to develop a lightweight, compact evaporator with innovative internal design features to adaptively distribute liquid refrigerant to heated areas, preventing dryout in areas with high heat flux.  This advanced flow distribution feature reduces liquid recirculation flow in the pumped loop and thus the system power input. The design features also provide strong internal structural support for the evaporator, reducing the size and mass of the evaporator cover plates. In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of the evaporator by developing a preliminary evaporator design, predicting its overall performance, and demonstrating its key performance features and fabrication processes by testing.  In Phase II, we will optimize the evaporator design, fabricate a full-scale evaporator, demonstrate its steady state and transient performance in a representative pumped loop, and deliver it to NASA JPL for further performance evaluation.","The proposed evaporator will enable reliable two-phase pumped loops for efficient and precision thermal control of critical instruments in remote sensing science satellites and exploration vehicles, including a future mission to Saturn's moon Enceladus and the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

Future manned and unmanned missions to the moon, mars, and other destinations will require new technologies to maintain spacecraft temperature near a set-point while under variable heat loads and thermal environments under increasingly stringent size, weight and power constraints. Passive components that can assist with this goal can greatly extend and expand NASA mission capabilities. Physical Sciences Inc. proposes to develop a passive thermal skin with set-point temperature control using phase-change-material nanofilms.  Our innovation will allow for simultaneous control of the visible reflectivity and the infrared emissivity of the spacecraft, causing the craft to reflect sunlight and radiate heat when hot, and absorb sunlight and become non-emissive when cold. By simultaneously optimizing both the visible and infrared optical properties, a turn-down ratio (TDR) of 18:1 is ultimately achievable.","The proposed passive skin can significantly reduce the SWaP of spacecraft thermal control systems. For manned missions, the set-point can be near room temperature to reduce the work required by active thermal management components, removing the need for dual-loop thermal control systems. For unmanned missions, the passive skin can be designed such that the temperature set-point is at either the high or low end of the operating range of the craft electronics, depending on the various requirements, heat loads and thermal environments of the mission.Our innovation directly addresses the need within NASA Technology Roadmap Area 14; specifically 14.2.3.7 (Variable Emissivity Radiator), which has been called out as a need for NASA's planned, crewed Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), and more generally, NASA's preparation to send a crewed spacecraft to Mars.","The passive set-point thermal control skin (TCS) has potential applications on commercial satellites. Satellites orbiting the earth, when in direct sunlight, have some of their surfaces receiving solar radiation, while the other surfaces only see deep space. As the satellite warms and heat is distributed throughout the satellite, more of the TCS enters its ""emissive"" state, improving the self-cooling ability of the satellite. PSI's TCS would maximize the passive cooling ability of these satellites, freeing up power for other satellite functionality.",Coatings/Surface Treatments; Distribution/Management; Nanomaterials; Passive Systems; Smart/Multifunctional Materials,Thermal Management   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

KIDs are developed for photometers and spectrometers for astrophysics focal planes, and earth or planetary remote sensing instruments. ADCs employed in space based KIDs are required to combine several features: radiation hardness, low power consumption, high resolution and high-sampling rate to facilitate increase in the number of the readout tones and to reduce the size of the electronics.The proposed SAR ADC aims to achieve a 12-bit resolution and the lowest to date reported figure of merit (FOM) at the 1GSps rate. A number of innovations will be introduced to the ADC in order to combine low power consumption (below 100mW) with the signal to noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) of at least 65dB. Tolerance to at least 4Mrads of total ionizing dose (TID) radiation and immunity to the single event effects (SEEs) will be achieved by employing radiation hardening techniques such as RHBD, RHBL and RHBS. A novel calibration technique for the capacitor mismatch will be introduced to improve linearity and increase the sampling rate. The proposed calibration technique introduced to the sub-ranging architecture with application of the asynchronous SAR logic will facilitate reduction of switching power.Phase I work will provide the proof of feasibility of implementing the proposed ADC. Phase II will result in the silicon proven ADC prototypes being ready for commercialization in Phase III.","The proposed ADC is primarily targeted for application in the Kinetic Inductance Detector and will meet the NASA's expectations for the radiation hardened low power ADC required for the detector's readout electronics. The ADC will also be applicable for other NASA missions since it offers a flexible solution for meeting the stringent radiation tolerance and power consumption requirements that are essential in L-band and P-band radars, an advanced synthetic aperture radar (SAR), an interferometer for surface monitoring, ice topography, hydrology, oceanography. The proposed ADC can be used in digital beam forming (DBM) systems of the future radars.","The potential commercial applications for the proposed low power ADC include electronic systems employed in communication and scientific satellites, high-energy physics instruments, and medical X-ray imaging equipment.

While classic PPT technology is mature, it has historically been limited by its size and propellant load to small Delta-V applications. A recent advancement by CUA, Monofilament Vaporization Propulsion (MVP), uses extrusion 3D printing technology to provide polymer propellant to an electrothermal thruster. APPT will leverage this advancement, using PTFE fiber to allow for class-leading propellant capacity and more reliable feed than previous PPT designs. APPT is inherently safe, containing no pressurants or hazardous materials, significantly reducing range safety concerns. A 1U APPT, operating at 1200 seconds Isp, will provide 10,400 N-s total impulse, allowing for 1,400 m/s Delta-V for an 8 kg CubeSat. Increasing to a 2U form factor increases total impulse to 30,000 N-s, allowing for a Delta-V exceeding 4 km/s. CUA anticipates delivering to NASA an integrated system by the end of Phase II which includes the advanced thruster head, PTFE filament feed system, and an ACS subsystem.","Historically, pulsed plasma systems have targeted small Delta-V applications. With the demonstrated high performance of CUAs PPT-11 (Isp > 1200 seconds) and the innovative propellant feed and storage system of the recently developed CUA Monofilament Vaporization Propulsion (MVP) thruster, APPT exceeds the goals of the Z8.01 topic and outperforms previous state of the art PPT systems, as well as newer technologies such as electrospray and helicon thrusters. With an anticipated 10,400 N-s total impulse from a 1U system, large orbit transfers and even inclination changes of tens of degrees are now available to smaller satellites. The intrinsic safety of APPT and its inert, unpressurized propellant position it as a prime candidate for secondary payload missions where costs and logistics are dominated by range safety concerns. The solid propellant has no handling, storage, or operational restrictions. The ease of handling and storage for the solid propellant can extend operation to planetary missions with no additional monitoring or controls.","Commercial interest in very small satellites continues to grow. In the 1-50 kg satellite sector, launches have shifted from a fairly balanced distribution between civil, government, commercial, and defense (2009-2015) to a distribution dominated by commercial interests.  Moving forward, it is more important than ever that these satellites have access to propulsion systems to extend their asset time on orbit. The proposed thruster offers CubeSats and other small satellites a significant propulsion capability with high total impulse per unit volume. The APPT thruster will provide a compact, light-weight, non-hazardous propulsion technology solution that will be made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in DOD, industry, and academia for CubeSat and small-satellite missions. APPT will require no safety equipment for storage, transportation, integration, and testing, and place no demanding requirements on the launch provider, making it an ideal low-cost solution for industry, research, and academic small-satellite propulsion needs.","Ablative Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine",Small Spacecraft Propulsion Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Current X-band radar transmitters use TWT devices requiring kV bulky power supplies, or 0.25 um GaN solid-state devices operating at 28 V or 50 V at most, with 40 V typical upper limit. Solid-state technology is desirable for its better SWaP figure of merit. However, achieving 400 W at X-band with 28 V or 50 V GaN technology requires power combining of several low-power MMIC or internally-matched 50 Ohm devices. Combiners require space and introduce losses. Integra Technologies proposes a new 400 W X-band GaN amplifier that operates using 0.25 um GaN FETs at 75 V and possibly at 100 VDC with 30% duty cycle and >50 MHz bandwidth and achieves >40% power-added efficiency.The preliminary effort will investigate Integra's 0.25 um GaN devices operating at 50 V and 75 V for a ~50 W output power to determine gain and efficiency at X-band using Class J matching techniques for enhanced drain efficiency. Longer term device investigation will include geometry and epi modifications to optimize the chip size and cell dimensions for 100 VDC operation at X-band; a 2-stage module will target 400 W peak power and an appropriate driver device. The final amplifier module will include bias modulation techniques for efficiency. The amplifier will include material selections and layout techniques for reliability under high RF energy signal levels and low pressure environments","A target application for this pulsed power amplifier can be RADAR for active remote sensing of Earth or potentially other non-terrestrial objects. The use of a very high efficiency power amplifier will allow for higher power levels in an energy limited environment such as in space operations. The high power ratings of this proposal will allow for greater standoff distances and improved signal to noise for the receivers used for remote sensing application.If operation at 100 VDC in X-band is achieved, the transmitter could operate directly from the DC voltage bus of the spacecraft with minimal or un-necessary DC-DC converter. The successful development of this high efficiency X-band amplifier concept can be leveraged by NASA for other RADAR applications at other wavelengths, as Integra's 100 VDC X-band GaN devices can be used at C-Band and potentially extended to Ku-band.","The use of higher efficiency and higher power X-band GaN pulsed amplifiers will allow for improved power management for commercial, weather and military radar applications.

DC-link capacitors used in IGBT and MOSFET switching circuits are one of the largest and least reliable components in DC-DC and DC-AC inverter circuits. Tantalum capacitors used currently by NASA in such circuits, have significant parametric limitations in the temperature range of -125oC to >200oC.   This development proposes the replacement of electrolytic capacitors with high temperature, solid state, Polymer Multilayer (PML) capacitors that have been recently developed for automotive inverter applications.  PML polymer dielectrics can be used to produce capacitors with voltages in the range of 25V to 1000V.  The high temperature PML polymers are amorphous with very high breakdown strength and can operate in a temperature range of -196oC to >200oC.  PML capacitors are smaller than tantalums, they have 10X lower weight, lower leakage current, lower dissipation factor, lower inductance and lower equivalent series resistance (ESR).  The Phase I development will focus in producing and evaluating PML capacitors designed for PPUs utilized in Hall thrusters and roll-out PV arrays for solar electric propulsion.","Radioisotope power systems (RPS), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) and Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) are programs that will directly benefit from this development.  Hall thruster PPUs voltage requirements include a 120V input for a 300V direct drive, a 300V input unit and a discharge module with a wide input voltage range of 300V-600V. Also, roll-out photovoltaic arrays are tailored to 120V and 300V for SEP applications. These are voltage ratings that are ideally suited to PML capacitors.   One PML capacitor can replace multiple tantalum capacitors that are often used in parallel-series configuration.","Capacitors are used in most all electrical and electronic systems ranging from consumer electronics, to industrial electronics, medical instrumentation, transportation, communications and defense.   DC-Link capacitors are needed to absorb ripple currents and transient voltage pulses created by switching devices such as IGBT, IGCT and MOSFETs used to convert lower DC voltage to higher DC and AC voltages.  The proposed PML DC-link capacitors, have applications in inverter circuits used in renewable energy power generation systems, including photovoltaics and wind power generation, hybrid and electric vehicles and modular energy storage systems tied to the smart grid. PML capacitors are smaller, they have lower cost and higher performance, which will improve life and reliability of power converters.  Hybrid and electric automotive drives will particularly benefit from the higher temperature and lower volume and weight of PML capacitors.","Conversion; Distribution/Management; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Generation; Power Combiners/Splitters; Quality/Reliability; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Space Transportation & Safety; Surface Propulsion","Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storageis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The gyro noise is reduced by a factor of at least 4 to 6 by utilizing an innovative approach for the light source noise reduction. In addition the sensor is using a new fiber combined with innovative coil design that results in lower bias drift and up to tenfold reduction of the bias temperature sensitivity compared to the existing FOG products as well as additional x 2 reduction of the ARW. The combination of these attributes supports a smaller, lower cost, high performance and robust IMUs that can serve future NASA mission needs; a 33 cube inch IMU (LN200 size) is expected to deliver Navigational grade performance, with ARW of 0.001 deg/rt-hr and bias residual over temperature of 0.02 deg/hr, while a larger FOG is expected to enable ARW of 0.0002 deg/rt/hr with 0.005 deg/hr bias and IMU volume < 70 cube inch. We also present innovative concept for a miniaturized tactical IMU based on the above technology (< 1 deg/hr bias over temperature and 0.02 deg/rt-hr ARW) with a volume as small as 5 cube inch.","The proposal will develop the key enabling component of low cost, high precision inertial navigations systems. Low cost, higher precision and low weight/power (SWAP) inertial sensors are necessary components for future NASA applications. Such applications include scientific exploration of Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system using smaller and lower cost spacecrafts to meet multiple mission requirements. Our suggested system offers significant performance improvements over the state of the art in the areas of spacecraft attitude determination and control, spacecraft absolute and relative orbit and attitude navigation and pointing control. Some specific examples include control capabilities for large space telescopes; autonomous onboard flight navigation sensors   and  high accuracy pointing applications.","The Navigational and high-end tactical IMU market is an expanding market with a push for higher performance.

COBRA-Bee will support target acquisition and tracking experiments for high performance optical communication. It can also support sensors which have limited field-of-view, such as cameras, as well as sensors/end-effectors requiring high pointing accuracy and/or independence from spacecraft attitude control. The 3-DOF (azimuth, elevation, and extension) of COBRA-Bee will support Astrobee experiments with pushing operations for fanless microgravity mobility. COBRA-Bee will provide this precise multi-purpose pointing and positioning capability in a small-scale tightly integrated COTS product, with an interface to support third-party sensors, end-effectors, and tools.  The Phase I effort will define requirements for a detailed design, based upon a crew safety analysis and a survey of candidate Astrobee end-effectors. A demonstration will be performed with existing COBRA hardware, maturing the COBRA-Bee TRL to 4.  The Phase II effort will develop, test, and deliver an engineering unit and control software.","COBRA-Bee delivers benefit to NASA's human spaceflight and ISS operations by reducing the need for astronaut time to perform recording and documentation of spacecraft experiments and mission operations. Astronaut time is a finite, highly valuable resource, and reducing dependency on it increases NASA's mission capabilities and cost efficiency. NASA's ISS and future long-duration human spaceflight missions (ie Journey to Mars) represent direct applications for COBRA-Bee.

The concept is inspired by hot-film anemometry, but extends the capability from a point measurement to a distributed measurement. With a spatial resolution of 1.25 mm, thousands of data points can be collected along an optical fiber to enable 1D, 2D or 3D field measurements, depending on the routing of the sensor. The benefits of this approach compared to particle image velocimetry (PIV) include: no seeding of the flow is necessary; the sensor can be used in non-line-of-sight locations; velocity and temperature profiles can simultaneously be acquired; and the technology can potentially be implemented in a flying vehicle. Measurements of boundary layer velocity and temperature profiles, transition location, and skin friction can be attained with this technique. Phase I will prove the feasibility of flow velocity measurement from a distributed fiber optic sensor over a range of temperatures and Mach numbers to quantify its accuracy. During Phase II, the technology will be matured for implementation in NASA wind tunnels and commercial jet engines. During Phase III, Luna will work with NASA and industry partners to commercialize the technology.","Distributed hot-film anemometry can revolutionize ground-based aerodynamic testing for wind tunnels and air-breathing engines. Instead of sensor rakes or traverses to probe the flow, thousands of velocity measurements will be acquired simultaneously from a single optical fiber. This capability can be used in wind tunnel calibration to document boundary layer profiles, uniformity of the tunnel flow, measurements of flow fore and aft of a model, and identify areas of unsteady or separated flow. For engine testing applications, radial and circumferential distributed anemometer sensors will fully document the engine inlet flow and distortion entering the fan and compressor. Further adaptation of the technique can allow for flow measurements in the hot section of engines. The high-resolution velocity and temperature profile data can be used to validate CFD models and optimize future vehicle designs for maximum efficiency.","Luna?s high-resolution flow velocity measurements will provide unprecedented data to better understand flow fields being ingested by turbofan jet engines. This will allow for optimization of inlet geometry, fan blade design, and serpentine ductwork flow profiles. The end result will be more efficient engines with reduced specific fuel consumption (SFC) that weigh less than current state-of-the-art engines.

To meet this need for space exploration vehicles to reject waste heat to high temperature heat sinks, Mainstream proposes adapting our oil-less vapor-compression (V-C) refrigeration compressor technology for operation at high temperature and high lift.  Vapor-compression systems use two-phase heat transfer which reduces component size and mass over single-phase heat pumping cycles such as reverse-Brayton or Stirling.  Mainstream?s current oil-less V-C compressor technology is gravity-insensitive, has a long operating life, can be scaled to match various heat loads, and has been mission-proven on the international space station (ISS) placing it at a TRL 9.  The proposed development effort will extend this compressor technology to operation at high temperatures and high lift, to which it is inherently well-suited.  The resulting compressor will be an enabling technology for the needed high temperature heat pumping systems.","The proposed research is targeted at enabling equatorial lunar exploration.  NASA has identified a need for improved heat rejection systems in this environment, where surface temperatures can reach 400 K.  The required heat rejection temperature exceeds the maximum heat rejection temperature of commercially available compressors.  Our technology will enable space-based heat pumping systems at these temperatures.  Mainstream expects that this will result in other NASA applications, such as non-lunar exploration vehicles with very high heat rejection loads.","In addition to NASA?s lunar exploration mission profile, Mainstream?s compressor technology has potential to benefit any space-based system that must reject large amounts of heat through radiation.  In these cooling systems, radiators are almost always the largest contributor to size and weight.  By increasing the rejection temperature through a lifting cycle, such as the V-C refrigeration cycle, radiator size and weight can be significantly reduced.  It can be assumed that any satellite or exploration vehicle that has high electric power consumption (1000s of watts or greater) is going to have large heat rejection requirements, due to the inherent inefficiencies of any real system.

For larger commercial aircrafts operating in the mega-watt range, power turboelectric and hybrid electric aircraft propulsion will continue to rely on gas turbine engines/generators to provide part of the thrust, charging batteries and driving generators. As a result, reduction of emissions such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) remains a key concern. The innovation proposed is a software toolkit supporting high-fidelity yet computationally-tractable predictions of NOx emissions and other pollutants in gas-turbine engines/generators within the context of unsteady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. A well-known difficulty limiting the accurate prediction of NOx levels in turbulent flames is related to the fact that NOx production can evolve through several different chemical pathways characterized by drastically different time scales. In this regard, the overall objective of the proposed SBIR program is to develop and implement an accurate modeling extension to CRAFT Tech?s parameterized LEM-CF turbulent combustion modeling framework to address pollutant formation such as NOx in a computationally-tractable manner and by capturing the relevant characteristic chemical time scales. The Phase I effort is intended to build the foundation of the proposed software toolkit by addressing the feasibility of the key attributes of predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, software portability and general applicability.","This product addresses NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) core needs for enabling safe and reliable operation of next-generation (e.g., N+3 generation and beyond) ultra low-emission power turboelectric and hybrid electric aircraft propulsion, where gas turbine engines will continue to play a critical role. With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, reduction of emissions, including NOx, remains a key concern, in particular for larger aircrafts operating in the mega-watt range. This product also addresses core needs of NASA?s vision for next-generation aircraft systems with hybrid integrated wing/body systems that feature significant improvements in engine performance, emissions and noise reduction. Since low-emission gas turbine engines/generators tend to operate at fuel lean conditions near the flame lean blow-out limit while avoiding the occurrence of combustion instability, a detailed understanding of flame dynamics and unsteady combustion effects is required to develop fuel-efficient, low-emission, stable combustor designs. In this regard, advanced CFD design tools can provide fundamental physical insight that is difficult or cost-prohibitive to obtain experimentally. Given the inherent modularity of the LEM-CF approach, interfacing with the National Combustion Code (NCC) will provide NASA with a powerful design support tool.","The commercial market for this product includes the broad aerospace, power-generation and defense industry. The primary driver for the commercial market for this product is represented by commercial aircraft gas turbine engines. The proposed software toolkit directly addresses the resulting increased demand for high-fidelity design tools that accurately characterize emissions and unsteady combustion effects and will benefit commercial gas turbine OEMs (both commercial and military) by providing them with a powerful and tractable supplement to minimize the need for experimental testing. Other applications encompass power-generation turbines and internal combustion, HCCI and diesel engines, e.g., using engine recirculation (EGR) devices to mitigate harmful NOx production. DoD applications include the design of gas-turbine engines, scramjets, pulse-detonation-engines (PDEs), augmentors, UAVs propulsion systems and rocket engines. Of particular relevance is the Army single fuel policy mandate to use jet fuel in ground vehicle diesel engines to simplify the supply chain logistics in the battle space and to strengthen domestic energy security. Also noteworthy is the DoD growing interest in fuel blends with alternative or renewable fuels, e.g., synthetic paraffinic kerosene or camelina-derived bio-fuel, as an acceptable form of ""drop-in"" fuels.","Generation; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Support",Low Emissions Propulsion and Power-Turboelectric and Hybrid Electric Aircraft Propulsion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The resulting enhanced heat transfer design offers the potential for light-weight and simple design with high efficiency and durability. This effort would be valuable to NASA as it would significantly reduce the known spacecraft technical risks and increase mission capability/durability/efficiency while at the same time increasing the TRL of the solid oxide systems for ISRU application.

However, conventional FTS instruments are bulky, heavy, and frail to environmental vibration, making them not suitable for satellite platforms. In this proposal, Omega Optics, Inc., together with the University of Texas at Austin, proposes a slow light enhanced on-chip FTS array covering compound spectral wavelength range (1.1 ~ 6.2 m) for geostationary imaging of greenhouse gases. Each array pixel is made of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, one arm of which is conventional waveguide and the other is ?fishbone? slow light waveguide. Harnessing the nonlinear phase enhancement generated by the slow light effect of the ?fishbone? waveguide, a resolution better than 0.2 cm-2 can be readily achieved within a limited chip surface. An N x M array can be formed by integrating N pixels on one silicon-on-sapphire chip and stacking M chips. Leveraging the CMOS compatible fabrication process, the imaging unit can be ~$10 per pixel and the whole imaging array weights ~ 30g. In addition, the whole module does not have moving parts, making it an ideal candidate for airborne and spaceborne applications.","Infrared spectroscopy has been widely used in numerous NASA?s missions. Compared to conventional instruments, the proposed greenhouse gas imaging unit has unique advantages in cost, size, and weight.  In addition, it is immune to environmental fluctuations. These advantages make it a competitive alternative, especially for application with stringent restrictions on size, weight and reliability. Besides, the imaging array can cover the whole compound spectral wavelength range. Therefore, it can also be used to identify other chemicals and materials of interest to NASA?s missions.","As a direct identification method, other than greenhouse gas monitor, infrared spectroscopy is also widely used in pharmacy, biotechnology, industrial chemistry, food safety, and other environment monitoring. A typical FTS is composed of an infrared source, a Michelson interferometer (MI), a detector, and a He-Ne laser for alignment and positioning. The whole system is bulky, heavy, and sensitive to environment fluctuations (vibration,etc). These disadvantages make it mainly a laboratory-only tool with extensive human involvement, and unsuitable for field applications such as toxic gas detection in battle field, stand alone environmental monitoring, and personal food safety/allergy monitor.

This technology represents a next-generation high-risk, high-payoff solar sail system for the launch, deployment, stabilization and control of very large (km^2 class) solar sails, enabling very high payload mass fractions for interplanetary and deep space spacecraft.  UltraSail is an innovative, non-traditional approach to propulsion technology achieved by combining propulsion and control systems developed for formation-flying microsatellites with an innovative solar sail architecture to achieve controllable sail areas approaching 1 km^2, sail subsystem area densities less than 5 g/m^2, and thrust levels many times those of ion thrusters used for comparable deep space missions.  Phase I effort will focus on the design of this next generation I-Sail demonstrator, a two-order of magnitude scale up from the prior subscale 20 m^2 CubeSail hardware, along with potential mission selection with requirements.  I-Sail represents the next stage of risk reduction for the UltraSail technology prior to full scale deep space development in the next decade.","The NASA Technology Roadmap calls for an in-space demonstration of a 2500 m2 sail to Earth escape in the 2019-2022 timeframe; the proposed I-Sail can meet this NASA goal.  Examples of solar sail missions include: pole sitter, Earth-Moon Lagrange point, Earth-Sun Lagrange point, deep space science, outer planet rendezvous, and solar polar.  UltraSail is potentially useful for a range of robotic NASA missions of relevance to NASA's science and exploration goals ranging from Near-Earth to Sun-Earth Lagrange point L1 to Mars to the Kuiper Belt, an interstellar probe, and multiple NEO rendezvous missions.  The very high payload mass fraction potential for the UltraSail concept (~60%) coupled with highly efficient packaging and high thrust from large sail area results in economical, high-performance missions.  The use of micro-satellites coupled with UltraSail techniques permits low-cost mission development before committing to much larger systems.","A number of science mission concepts have been identified that make optimum use of solar sails as the next phase in the development of solar sail propulsion as the go-to technology for high C3 missions.  UltraSail has military applications for earth-observing missions at high orbit where stationary observing is useful, e.g. pole-sitting missions.  Also, NOAA and NSF have strong interests in the science that can be returned using sails in non-Keplerian orbits and at Lagrange points.  Mission concepts enabled by solar sails include: Solar Polar Imager, GeoSail, and Heliostorm (NOAA Geostorm).

The physical models used in CFD codes and initial/boundary conditions for numerical simulations carry significant uncertainties. There are also inherent errors in experiments designed for model validation, and numerical discretization. Despite this knowledge, only a limited number of efforts have been undertaken to formally characterize these uncertainties and to evaluate their impact on the predictive capability of CFD tools for hypersonic applications such as isolator dynamics. Major challenges with uncertainty quantification for such simulations include lack of sufficient data to characterize the associated uncertainties in the isolator dynamics phenomena and the computational cost of the required large number of cases. CFDRC in partnership with Virginia Tech and UTSI proposes to directly address these issues and deliver an non-intrusive tool for uncertainty quantification that can be integrated with the state-of-the-art CFD tools currently utilized by NASA and its customers. During Phase I, this team will develop and demonstrate a dimensionally adaptive sparse grid approach for uncertainty quantification coupled with NASA LaRC VULCAN-CFD code. In phase I, the developed tool will be demonstrated on the test rig developed and characterized at the NASA-LaRC Isolator Dynamics Research Lab. Surrogate models including polynomial response surface and gradient-enhanced Kriging will be developed based upon the samples generated from the adaptively sparse grid algorithm, thereby providing a modeling tool to estimate the operability of isolator over the relevant flight regime and ultimately to optimize design of isolator to prevent scramjet unstart. In Phase II, the framework will be further developed to include uncommon probability density distributions of uncertain parameters, and will be validated and demonstrated on more complex problems.","Non-intrusive uncertainty quantification has been identified as an enabling technology to advance the role of computational fluid dynamics codes in the Design Development Research and Engineering community, ultimately leading to utilization for certification for flight. The proposed computational product offers a direct solution to link the various sources of uncertainties to predictions made by CFD tools, thereby enabling the usability of CFD tools for making risk-informed design decisions. The adaptive sparse grid method offers a significant advantage over other uncertainty quantification methods due to the ability to handle non-smooth system response with complex probability density distributions and much smaller number of required CFD simulations. This product can be a highly effective tool for wider applications requiring aerothermodynamics calculations where the lack of confidence in modeling parameters and predictive capability of the CFD codes has limited their impact.","The work established in this project can be transitioned to support a significant number of other applications where reacting CFD modeling tools are utilized.

Hydrogen fire detection is critical for rocket propulsion safety and maintenance. A significant fire at a rocket test or launch facility could be catastrophic to infrastructure or even worse, to human life. Detection monitoring is problematic as hydrogen flames can be nearly invisible during the day. Non-imaging, non-visible fire detection technology has limited range and can suffer from false alarms from sources outside the region of interest. Low-cost visible imagers, commonly used for wide-scale routine surveillance, have limited utility detecting hydrogen fires. Although it has been known for decades that multispectral imaging outside the visible range can be used to detect fires with low false alarm rates, the price of such systems and the lack of processing algorithms and the ability to implement them in real-time has largely prohibited their use. During this project we will develop a low-cost imaging capability that fuses data collected from sensors operating in the (1) solar blind ultra-violet, (2) thermal infrared and (3) visible spectrum, using advanced spectral, spatial and temporal processing techniques optimized to detect and generate alerts associated with hydrogen fires in real-time. This multi-sensor, multi-processing approach will enable us to automate flame detection with extremely low false alarm rates. In addition to control room alerts, we will make use of the wireless communication capabilities found within smart phones and other mobile devices to build an App to alert key decision makers and first responders of a fire detected in real-time. This multi-sensor imaging research could also support NASA's important cool flame microgravity research occurring on the International Space Station.","This technology has near term direct application for monitoring hydrogen fires within several NASA propulsion test and launch facilities. This capability will enhance the safety of these facilities and potentially facilitate required maintenance procedures. NASA rocket motor testing centers that would benefit from this include SSC, MSFC, GRC-PBS and WSTF. KSC, responsible for the SLS and Orion launches that continue human spaceflight within NASA, and the Launch Services Program that provides launch operations oversight at several locations including Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg AFB would also realize safety and maintenance benefits from this technology. NASA is currently conducting experiments on flame interaction and extinguishment on-board the ISS. Fire burns differently in microgravity and although our technology is optimized for hydrogen flame phenomenology, it has wider potential use in NASA's cool flame research portfolio and could, for example, be used to support follow-on Saffire and FLEX experiments. FLEX experiments have shown low-frequency flicker that our temporal algorithms could exploit for terrestrial fire detection and discrimination.","Government facilities managed by the Rocket Propulsion Test Program Office, including Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Redstone Test Center (RTC), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) as well as commercial facilities including SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and Orbital ATK could all enhance their safety and facilitate their maintenance efforts by employing this technology to monitor hydrogen and other flames.There are several established markets and applications that incorporate significant amounts of hydrogen gas in their processes that would benefit from our flame detection technology. These markets primarily include petrochemical facilities, heat treating facilities for aerospace and automotive applications, fuel cell production facilities, and potentially thermonuclear power plants.An emerging application is hydrogen station monitoring. With the advent of fuel cell powered vehicles, hydrogen stations will be required along roadways and at people's homes as a way of storing and refilling hydrogen fuel cells.Another potential application is auto race car monitoring. There have been a number of horrific events involving either race car drivers or pit crew members engulfed by alcohol flames, detectable with our technology. These flames are difficult to detect and extinguish because, like hydrogen, they are essentially invisible to the eye.","Display; Fuels/Propellants; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Infrared; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Radiometric; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Ultraviolet; Visible",Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Currently, vehicles other than aircraft are accommodated in the NAS via manual licensing and planning processes or severe restrictions on acceptable operations. Ultimately, vehicle operators will demand access to airspace, which is a shared public resource. To date, most research has focused on vehicle characteristics and aggregate effects on NAS performance. There has been limited focus on planning needs of the various stakeholders involved in these operations or on envisioning a future NAS that supports collaborative operations planning for a wide variety of vehicles and operations.Planning systems need to evolve to support collaborative planning among all stakeholders' requirements and equitable access to the NAS for different kinds of vehicles used by different stakeholders for different missions that present different safety and planning challenges. Mosaic ATM proposes NICoPS, the NAS Integrated Collaborative Planning System, which works across vehicle types, missions, and planning time scales. Not only does it support a variety of vehicle operators, but it also support traffic management personnel in evaluating different vehicle operations proposals in the context of all other proposed operations, expanding their current capabilities beyond evaluating aircraft operations. It leverages Mosaic's SWIM Gateway and Mosaic Analytics Suite capabilities, among others, to facilitate data exchange and operations analysis.In Phase I, we propose to characterize different stakeholders' planning needs, and design the NICoPS prototype. We will implement the design into an early-stage NICoPS prototype sufficient for initial stakeholder evaluations in Phase II. In Phase II, we propose to iteratively enhance the NICoPS design and prototype, and carry out stakeholder evaluations including field evaluation.","The proposed SBIR will complete work that is highly beneficial to NASA - work that can directly benefit NASA's research into integration of on-demand mobility vehicles and UAS into the NAS, as well as its space vehicle operations. While NASA has been a leader in these areas of research, our effort will provide validated, centralized documentation of multiple stakeholders' planning needs, as well as the NICoPS capability that can be used to evaluate different vehicle mission concepts in the context of NAS planning operations. This can drive new vehicle and airspace concepts. At the end of Phase III, the NICoPS will be available for use by NASA personnel responsible for planning missions by various vehicles.","Beyond NASA, the primary potential applications for this work are with the FAA, vehicle operators, and the research communities associated with various vehicles. As new types of vehicles, such as on-demand mobility vehicles, become feasible, the capability will be available for those operators as well. At the end of Phase II, the NICoPS concept and prototype will be mature enough for transition to the FAA for further concept and system development. The NICoPS will provide a mechanism by which various vehicle operations can be evaluated and negotiated in the context of NAS operations, significantly reducing the amount of work that must be performed manually. Simultaneously, researchers associated with new vehicle types can use the NICoPS concept and prototype to support their efforts to design their vehicles for integration into NAS operations.At the end of Phase III, a prototype NICoPS SWIM service will be developed and available to demonstrate the capability to the commercial market.","Air Transportation & Safety; Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Sequencing & Scheduling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Transport/Traffic Control",Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Luna's revolutionary technology monitors the distributed tension and curvature of a tether that connects a marsupial rover to its base station by turning a passive cable for power and communication into a powerful tool that provides information about the health and state of both the rover and the tether.  The MaRS Tether can alert the base station to possible pinch points, snagged cables, or high tension due to poor traction or steep slope. Luna recently completed a Phase II SBIR with NASA JPL that introduced the first MaRS tether, identifying a snag location on a 50m tether with JPL's Axel rover and showing operation on a 100m tether.  A related Phase I SBIR developed a road map for miniaturizing the tether's acquisition system.  In this Phase I effort, Luna will prove the feasibility of extending the length of the sensing capabilities of the MaRS Tether through a focus on the tension measurement. This will greatly increase the operating range of lightweight, highly mobile rovers enabling more complex missions.","The NASA market for self-sensing tethers is focused on missions featuring robotic exploration, especially using the Axel rover. NASA is planning specific missions including Mid-Size Rovers, Astrobiology Field Lab, Network Landers, Europa Explorer, and Titan-Enceladus Explorer to bring back samples from comets, asteroids, and the lunar south polar basin, and Mars. Market opportunities for tethered rovers within NASA often coincide with Mars exploration missions that are launched every 26 months. Prime contractors supporting NASA's rover missions include Lockheed Martin Astronautics. Extending the range of the sensing technology will increase the scope of missions where these sensing tethers can be used.  For example, missions to explore the large Martian craters that show evidence of liquid water through recurring slope lineae will require tether lengths of several hundreds of meters.","Sensing tether technology has particular application in robotics, where tethered robots range from search and rescue rovers to underwater vehicles, and from tethered military robots to energy sector inspection robots. This technology has the potential to transform tethers from a necessary but cumbersome umbilical cord into a dynamic sensor that can aid in monitoring the health and position of the robot.  Extending the length of this technology will increase the types of robots where this technology can be applied.   In addition to sensing tethers, extending the length of Luna's strain sensing technology will transfer to increased length for temperature sensing, curvature sensing, and full 3-D distributed position sensing, opening markets in NDE tool location, and path measurement markets.  Extended length strain sensing will increase the market in aerospace distributed strain sensing to be applicable to larger aircraft.","Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Tethers","Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The lidar sensor will provide a variable angular resolution of  0.04 degrees by 0.04 degrees to 0.005 degrees by 0.005 degrees with <10cm range precision over an 80 degrees by 80 degrees field of regard and 200 meter range in bright sun light.  This will be accomplished using a unique electro-optic scanner that provides the largest angle-aperture product of any commercially-available non-mechanical scanning technology.","The proposed low-SWaP lidar will have application in many NASA missions needing real-time 3D information such as fixing and refueling space craft, close approaches to asteroids, autonomous vision-based guidance and control for robotic systems and terrain mapping and hazard avoidance for autonomous land, air and sea vehicles. The technology developed in this project, especially the versatile non-mechanical beam scanning system in Phase I, can be also tailored for a number of other NASA sensor platforms such as coherent Doppler lidar for 3D wind sensing or differential absorption lidar (DIAL) for trace gas detection.  Also, a reliable, low-SWaP gimbal replacement would also be useful for several other space-borne applications including active remote sensing using laser-based sensors, satellite-to-satellite communication, and position tracking within a cluster of nano-satellites, to name a few.","The proposed non-mechanical beam steering technology married with lidar sensors have numerous commercial applications.  The platform can provide a low-SWaP package for hazard/collision avoidance for autonomous automobiles and unmanned vehicles, which is currently a very hot area of interest in the commercial sector.   Other potential large markets are 3D imaging for autonomous robotics, noncontact structure analysis, topographical mapping and gesture recognition for augmented reality systems.Additionally, the non-mechanical scanner technology is well suited to deployment on wind farms for guiding and controlling power-generating wind turbines. The sensor is particularly well suited for this application because the low-SWaP package is ideal for mounting directly to a turbine or even packaging in an ocean-going buoy for sea-based wind farms. Such a buoy network would also have weather warning and prediction applications.  Within the Department of Defense, this technology is being developed for applications such as munitions seeker tracking, passive imaging, and conventional hard-target lidar.  Also, there is interest from automotive manufacturers who wish to use the technology for non-mechanical headlight steering.","3D Imaging; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Optical; Perception/Vision; Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)","Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing and Small Body Proximity Operation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

For most trace gas species it is also required that the accuracy of the switching be on the order of 10 MHz.  Further complications for many DIAL measurements are that the platform for the system moves, such as an airplane or spacecraft, and that the lasers used are often high peak power, pulsed lasers. The combination of a moving platform, pulsed laser, and the requirement that the online and offline measurements be made in essentially the same volume implies that the switching time between online and off line measurements be less than ~ 1 ms, and many cases even shorter. To date, most lasers used in DIAL systems rely on piezo-electric (PZT) mechanisms to perform the cavity length changes needed for the frequency switching. In practice, this limits wavelength switching speeds to a few hundred Hz. This relatively slow frequency switching prevents researchers from fully exploiting DIAL systems utilizing the high efficiency, multi-kHz lasers or the lower repetition rate, dual pulse lasers systems that are now available. In order to improve the wavelength switching speeds needed to fully exploit the capabilities of airborne and space-based DIAL systems, Fibertek is proposing to develop a high speed, non-mechanical frequency locking module that allows shot to shot frequency switching of single-frequency lasers at up to 3 kHz with a spectral resolution of <10 MHz. Our approach to the proposed locking module is an innovative synthesis of all electro-optic (EO) based switching and locking, a compact and efficient EO driver design that reduces voltage requirements by 4x over conventional designs, a novel EO voltage that's profile that eliminates electrochromic darkening, and a larger off-set locking capability that eliminates the requirement for an additional phase shifter in the cavity.","1. Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) - This mission will be an expanded scope follow-on to the highly successful CALIPSO cloud and aerosol lidar mission.

Consequently, significant propellant mass will be required. While it is technically feasible to generate O2 and CO propellants by electrolysis of CO2 from the Martian atmosphere, it will only work on bodies where there is significant CO2 in the atmosphere, and the mass of the required infrastructure (electrolyzer, batteries, solar panels) is significant. A recent study has shown that bringing the propellant from Earth is a mass-competitive option. In particular, a hybrid rocket with multi-start capability trades more favorably than either a CO2 electrolysis system or a bipropellant system where the propellants are generated on Earth. Using a high-performance hybrid propellant combination and being able to restart the hybrid rocket are the keys. In previous and ongoing work, Ultramet has demonstrated that electrically heated open-cell silicon carbide foam can be used as an igniter for both monopropellant and bipropellant rocket engines. Due to its low mass and favorable electrical characteristics, the foam can be heated to 1300?C in just two seconds, which enables it to quickly ignite any propellant flowing through it. In this project, the technology will be applied to hybrid rocket engines to give them multi-start capability. A portion of the liquid oxidizer stream (typically oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide) will pass through the foam and be heated such that the high temperature gas leaving the foam will be sufficiently hot to cause spontaneous ignition on contact with the fuel (typically paraffin). Once the engine is ignited, power to the foam heater can be turned off. Ultramet will design, test, and characterize electrically powered foam heaters and perform ignition testing with paraffin fuel grains.","This technology will initially be targeted at hybrid rockets, and the near-term application will be hybrid rockets for a Mars sample return mission. More generally, foam-based heaters that are amenable to use at high temperatures in highly oxidizing environments can be used as igniters for virtually any non-hypergolic propellant combination. These include O2/CO, LOX/CH4, LOX/ethanol, and LOX/RP-1 among others. They can also be used to ignite hydrazine, as well as ionic liquid monopropellants such as LMP-103S and the E, Q, and A blends of AF-M315. This makes the technology applicable to engines of virtually any thrust class, from large booster engines to small attitude control engines. Specific missions of interest to NASA include ascent/descent engines for missions to Mars, the Moon, other planetary moons, and asteroids.","This technology can be used for igniting non-hypergolic bipropellants, ionic liquid monopropellants, and hydrazine in main and attitude control engines on commercial and military spacecraft, as well as main and reaction control engines on commercial and military boosters. Other aerospace applications include ignition systems and catalyst preheaters for aeropropulsion turbine engines and air heaters for hypersonic wind tunnels similar to the Aerodynamic and Propulsion Test Unit at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC).

Its primary function will enable NASA to rapidly identify microorganisms that could affect crew safety.  This near-term deployable cartridge and platform system also has the option to perform isothermal and PCR amplification of nucleic acids.  This highly flexible system will allow previously complicated, labor-intensive, and time consuming processes to be carried out by a turn-key and closed system using pre-filled cartridges.  We have demonstrated on the ground in a laboratory setting that the entire setup for high quality DNA/RNA extraction from urine, whole blood, serum, and saliva can be achieved via simple and reversible retrofitting of a low-cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) based 3D printers ranging from $199 to $750.  The VSPP can also be used to capture and purify cell and protein targets.  The ability of having a dual-use 3D printer in-flight to carry out sample preparation and additive manufacturing in-flight can be an attractive option in long duration space flights.","The ability to carry out sample preparation in microgravity using a small footprint, versatile device and extensible cartridges in an enclosed format will introduce the ability to carry out sample preparation for molecular biology tests from a variety of sample matrices (cell culture, plant tissue, blood, swab, etc.).  The unit can also be easily coupled with suitable downstream detection modules to expand its capabilities to include processes such as PCR, isothermal amplification, and sequencing.  With the development of proper assays, new applications can be extended to include microbial detection in advanced life support systems, in-vitro testing for infectious diseases during space flight, gene expression analysis for radiation exposure monitoring/studies, and effect of space flight on microbial gene expression and virulence.  These processes can be completed inside the Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG) or disposable glove bag to minimize sample transfer or contamination concerns.  By offering a medium throughput sample preparation platform, our VSPP unit will enable researchers and companies to carry out in-situ life sciences research inside the ISS with near real-time result capability when coupled with appropriate detection systems.","With advances in molecular diagnostics, life science, and forensics, there will be a vast increase in demand for instrumentation that can handle automated sample preparation in a closed format to eliminate cross-contamination.

The system is remote in the sense that it does not mount any sensors onboard any aircraft, nor does it add any software to Flight Deck (FD) avionics systems. The system exploits data mining to search through thousands of aircraft surveillance measurements in real-time as aircraft fly in the NAS.  We propose to use Automatic Dependent Surveillance ? Broadcast (ADS-B) information as the basis of atmospheric wave and turbulence detection, and combine this with satellite-based visual and infrared imagery to complete the diagnostics.  We design the system to access a large network of ADS-B receivers across the NAS. Automated analysis of ADS-B aircraft altitude and velocity information is used to detect the presence of mountain waves and Mountain Wave Turbulence (MWT) in the vicinity of steep terrain as well as atmospheric waves and turbulence from other sources, for instance, Convective Induced Turbulence (CIT).  When combined with other weather state information gained by in situ sensors, satellite, and radar-based technology in the NAS, our SBIR effort will allow for a total situational awareness of mountain wave, MWT, and CIT information in the Continental United States (CONUS).  Because ADS-B is mandated by 2020, the percentage of aircraft using ADS-B will grow each year, and this in turn will benefit all who use our innovation.","Our proposed SBIR product helps NASA researchers study technologies and concepts that enhance aviation safety.  An example of this would be the identification and mitigation of moderate or severe mountain wave turbulence (MWT) or Convective Induced Turbulence (CIT) detected by our system, distributed to other aircraft via EFBs and PEDs, voice communication warnings, or other mechanisms to tactically adjust the flight levels of nearby aircraft prior to entering into an area of turbulence. NASA can investigate Route Availability (RA), Route Blockage (RB), and flight level congestion monitoring accordingly in NASA decision support tools.","A commercial service can be customized for distributing data collected by our SBIR system for use by airline dispatchers and ATC coordinators, for instance, for flight planning and safety warnings. Key potential customers include all the commercial airlines, other smaller General Aviation (GA) and corporate flight departments, and service providers who market flight management services to corporate flight departments.",Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Data Processing; Process Monitoring & Control,Future Aviation Systems Safety   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

However, the successful design and operation of these systems requires the identification of potential failure modes related to the transition between ramjet and scramjet modes and inlet-isolator-combustor unstart events. High-fidelity computer simulations and detailed diagnostics in a ground-based facility provide invaluable data, but cannot be routinely used for an extensive exploration of design solutions due to cost. Furthermore, it is challenging to formulate efficient design strategies that accommodate performance constraints and guarantee safe operations; as a consequence safety factors (and limitations in vehicle operability) are typically introduced a-posteriori leading to suboptimal systems. Cascade's proposal aims at investigating modern scramjet systems using a combination of computational tools focusing on design strategies that a-priori include safety margins from unstart. The project goal is to combine machine-learning tools, in-house high-fidelity simulation capabilities, and high-throughput low fidelity engineering techniques within a risk-aware optimization framework that can potentially enhance the ability to generate safe and performant design. Machine learning will enable the extraction and categorization of knowledge from in-house high-fidelity data and experiments; the engineering tools afford the exploration of a large set of geometrical configurations and operating scenarios; the QMU (Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties) technique, will provide the optimization framework. Validation of the high-fidelity and low-fidelity tools with data from the HIFiRE experimental campaign will provide an explicit measure of the confidence in the simulations which will explicitly be included within QMU.","The unstart prediction technology is applicable to three main areas within NASA. First, the combination of high-fidelity and high-throughput engineering tools employed and validated in this project enables NASA to design and virtually test the impact of various dual-mode scramjet inlet and combustor chamber designs for hypersonic travel and access to space. Finding the most efficient method to transition between subsonic to supersonic combustion speeds, while avoiding unstart is a key requirement to propel scramjet usage into reality. Second, the image-based machine learning tools can be utilized for detecting physical phenomena across a diverse set of applications, possibly not even limited to fluid-dynamics problems, such as the detection of incipient structural failures. Lastly, the Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) methodology can be relevant for many complex systems beyond scramjets. The methodology's focus on identifying uncertainty and rigorously assessing their impact on performance to create more accurate operability margins based on prediction can lead to a more comprehensive strategy that directly combines performance criteria and safety into the design process.","The unstart prediction technology can be used to detect the precursors to engine failure in military and commercial aircrafts and spacecrafts developed by companies such as Lockheed, Boeing, SpaceX, BlueOrigin, and Virgin Galactic. It can also be used to detect incipient structural failures in other sectors such as transportation and energy. The image-based machine learning tools can be utilized for detecting physical phenomena across a diverse set of applications, possibly not even limited to fluid-dynamics problems, such as the detection of incipient structural failures in the transportation and energy sector (i.e. failure in a power generation turbine). Lastly, the Quantification of Margins and Uncertainties (QMU) methodology can be applied to any engineering application that is required to adhere to certain safety margins relating to uncertainty. The methodology's focus on identifying uncertainty and rigorously assessing their impact on performance to create more accurate operability margins based on prediction can lead to a more comprehensive design process that optimizes for operational profitability and safety.","Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Data Processing; Image Analysis; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Hypersonic Technology-Improvement in Solar Operability Predictions using Computational Algorithms   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

During Phase I we will show the utility and feasibility of the integration architecture by (i) developing operational CONOPs describing envisioned tasks done by autonomous agents, (ii) identifying specific technologies that will be integrated during Phase II, and (iii) developing a software prototype illustrating the agents capabilities in scenarios of interest to NASA.","These technologies will increase the ability for crew members to oversee the operations of teams of robots during lunar and Martian missions and, in the nearer term, during analog experiments on Earth.

Though significant work has been conducted to develop systems for controlled release silver ions in the water systems, there is no sensor for continuous in-line monitoring of the concentration of silver in the water used by the crew, nor a reliable device to analyze silver in space. Intelligent Optical Systems plans to develop a luminescent indicator-based optical sensor probe to monitor silver concentration directly in spacecraft water systems in real time. The proposed sensor will be based on a technology recently demonstrated by IOS for monitoring wastewater in space systems, in which a specific indicator dye is copolymerized with a stable polymer matrix, resulting in highly sensitive and stable sensor elements. The capability of indicator-doped polymer matrixes to detect silver in the ISS has been demonstrated by NASA and its partners, but further development is required to achieve in-line stand-alone monitoring. Our monitor will incorporate robust sensor elements, interrogated via a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The proposed sensor elements will be remotely connected to the electronic circuitry by an electromagnetic interference (EMI)-proof optical fiber cable, allowing flexibility in placing the sensor system, where space is highly valuable. In Phase I we will develop novel sensor elements for silver, and will demonstrate sensitivity, measurements range, and stability. In Phase II, in collaboration with UTC, we will produce prototypes for integration into the ISS Potable Water Systems, and conduct extensive testing under simulated environmental conditions, culminating in delivery to NASA of a monitoring system, bringing the monitor to TRL 7.","Effective use of biocides to assure the quality of potable water is essential for the success and sustainability of manned space missions. The proposed sensor probe responds directly to a NASA need for in-line silver monitoring in spacecraft. Successful development of a compact, low power, fully automated multisensor probe for silver ions will give NASA a powerful tool to maintain water quality in the potable water systems. Real-time knowledge of silver concentration will lead to optimal water disinfection aboard the ISS, and on other manned space missions. Sensors capable of monitoring organic, inorganic, and trace contaminants in water under microgravity could make use of the same sensing technology and optoelectronic unit, expanding the capability of the monitor for silver, and monitoring water quality in all other water streams aboard the ISS.","The antimicrobial coatings market is expected to grow to $4 billion by 2021, with silver being the leading antimicrobial agent. Key segments include the medical and healthcare industry and the indoor air/HVAC industry. The forecasted growth in the antimicrobial coatings industry will be accompanied by an increased demand for technologies to properly monitor and assess antimicrobials such as silver to ensure their efficacy. Silver-based antimicrobial materials for medical applications are gaining share in that market niche. Fiber optic sensors have significant advantages for biomedical monitoring, and IOS has already transitioned its sensor technology initially developed for space applications to blood and tissue chemical monitoring.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment",Environmental Monitoring for Spacecraft Cabins   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The miniaturized module platform, comprised of reduced set of circuit boards, will be structured for easy configuration of spacecraft systems to provide reliable, low-power solutions for operation in harsh space environments.  Each miniaturized module will be designed using a minimum number of components, thus reducing mass, volume and power, while increasing system reliability.  The miniaturized modules will be designed using compact System on Chip (SoC) Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) configurable digital Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) containing multi-core processors, static memory and built-in house-keeping logic, non-volatile memory and various interface components (Analog to Digital Converters, Digital to Analog Converters and other analog elements).  This platform will leverage off of development work recently completed under a contract between Micro-RDC and the U.S. Air Force, where a 90nm CMOS RHBD configurable digital ASIC development platform was invented, developed and verified to produce Qualified Manufacturing Line (QML) qualified RHBD configurable digital ASICs.  This digital ASIC development platform allows systems developers access to higher performance RHBD ASICs at lower cost than previous ASIC solutions.   Miniaturized, advanced technology, multi-functional circuit board modules will enable satellite systems designers to develop lower cost system solutions for the common, present and future needs of spacecraft operating in harsh space environments, providing lower mass, lower volume and lower power solutions.","NASA supports various requirements ranging from science, space station, and deep space missions requiring high-performance computing and controls.  Interplanetary and long term Low Earth Orbit (LEO) systems require radiation tolerances and high-temperature operation to ensure that the on-board electronics will outlast the life expectancy of these systems. These demanding requirements of radiation tolerance and harsh operating environments force satellite systems developers to consider capabilities that can be uniquely optimized for their applications.  This platform of miniaturized modular circuit boards can be configured for many kinds and types of applications, providing low cost, low power, highly-compact solutions, lowering risk and time of overall platform deployment. It is anticipated that the technology developed under this program will enable the use of miniaturized modular circuit board systems over a wide range of NASA and commercial space programs as well as applications involving Command and Control, Data Handling, Sensor Excitation and Processing. NASA programs/missions that will benefit from this effort include new lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions (MAVEN), solar system exploration (e.g. Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS)). Other uses for the miniaturized circuit board modules and radiation-hardened, high temperature ASICs developed under this SBIR program are many.","Military, intelligence and commercial satellites show growing demand in the numbers of units deployed with advanced capabilities of performance.  The 2014 FAA Commercial Space Transportation Forecast predicts that an average of seventy eight commercial payloads will be launched annually over the next decade.  A reasonable estimate of the number of classified military and intelligence payloads at least equals the commercial deployments.Cubesat uses are also positioned to become a huge market for the modular circuit board systems and radiation-hardened ASIC components that will be developed under this SBIR program.

The PHRUIT, intended primarily for layer-by-layer quality control in the power bed fusion (PBF) process, is based on innovative X-ray Compton backscatter microscopy, which enables single-sided, high-resolution (~50 um), subsurface inspection of PBF parts. Due to the penetrating nature of X-rays, the PHRUIT will be able to inspect not only the surface of the last layer, but also the subsurface features, with typical penetration depths of 1-2 mm, and therefore will reveal voids and defects that are not visible with optical imaging. The PHRUIT will enable a user to ""focus"" on a particular depth within the part and localize any features or voids in x/y/z with accuracy of ~50 um. The PHRUIT will have a capability to cover arbitrarily complex part profiles with two dimensional translation, with a total inspection time of typical parts of around 1-2 min. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the PHRUIT high-resolution imaging approach by fabricating and testing a technology readiness level (TRL)-4 preliminary prototype. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional and integrated TRL-6 prototype and demonstrate its NDE capabilities to NASA by testing it with relevant PBF AM systems. At the end of Phase II, the PHRUIT system prototype will be delivered to NASA for further characterization.","The primary NASA application of the proposed PHRUIT system is in-process NDE and quality control of spacecraft parts manufactured by particle bed fusion additive manufacturing. The PHRUIT will extend NASA leadership in AM technologies by providing tools for ensuring the high yield and quality of the produced parts. This will reduce the cost of future AM processes. In safety-critical applications, the benefit of the PHRUIT will be in ensuring the structural integrity and reliability of the produced components, which is crucial for in-space AM activities, where extensive postprocess part testing may not be available. The use of the PHRUIT technology will be beneficial in the AM of critical spacecraft items, such as the repair of components of the propulsion systems.","Non-NASA applications of the PHRUIT system will also be based on its use as a fast, high-resolution NDE tool for AM process quality control, as well as single-sided, noncontact inspection of large aerospace structures. For example, the PHRUIT system can be used for the detection of cracks and fatigue in safety-critical components of aircraft and helicopters, composite bondline inspection, and electronic board testing for defects and integrity. The PHRUIT system can be incorporated by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force as a reliable, rapid, robotic, easy-to-use NDE/NDT system in manufacturing and maintenance operations.

TUI has been working on structural truss joining (Class 1 joints) and robotic connection approaches through separate efforts and has several ongoing and future efforts that will require in-space joining of modular systems (Class 2 joints).TUI proposes to develop and demonstrate an open-architecture Class 2 joining solution called the Automated X-Linked for Orbital Networking (AXON) connector. The AXON connector will be a reversible module-to-module connector that minimizes mass and complexity while maximizing assembled stiffness, strength, power transfer, and data communications. The development of the AXON connector will leverage TUI's existing programs and place emphasize automated robotic mating and de-mating.In the Phase I effort, we will identify a complete set of requirements, develop a concept design, fabricate the concept using TUI's 3D printing and rapid prototyping capabilities, and test the AXON connector using TUI's Baxter robot. In the Phase II effort, TUI will mature the Phase I design and perform reliability testing.","The AXON connector will facilitate in-space assembly of satellites, exploration probes, and habitats for robotic and manned missions to the moon, Mars, and deep space destinations.

Gallium nitride (GaN) offers significant advantages over silicon (Si) technologies for power applications including higher breakdown voltage and power density, rapid switching, lower switching losses, and higher temperature tolerance. Enhancement mode GaN-on-Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are a rapidly advancing technology that are scalable with voltage, offer superior electrical performance, and also demonstrate high tolerance to displacement damage and total ionizing dose (TID). However, prior tests have shown that heavy ion (HI) induced leakage currents and catastrophic damage may occur well below rated voltages. A thorough investigation of the HI response of emerging, higher voltage GaN HEMTs and underlying mechanisms is essential to develop radiation tolerant devices for space applications. CFDRC, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University and EPC, proposes to use an integrated experimental and physics-based modeling approach to address this challenge. In Phase I, we will perform heavy ion testing of commercial EPC GaN HEMTs to generate response data. Detailed TCAD models will be developed for the HEMT structure to investigate physical mechanisms behind measured radiation response. In Phase II, we will perform additional heavy ion and TID testing as a function of temperature and bias. Extensive TCAD and higher-fidelity modeling will be performed to determine radiation and temperature-dependent mechanisms, and to investigate device design modifications for improved radiation tolerance. Promising solutions will be prototyped and characterized via testing. Participation by EPC in Phase II and beyond will ensure advanced space-qualified, GaN power devices.","As described in the NASA Space Power and Energy Storage Roadmap-Technology Area (TA) 03, space qualified high voltage/high temperature power electronics are directly aligned with science and exploration missions including missions using electric propulsion, robotic surface missions to Venus and Europa, Mars polar and lunar polar science missions, crewed exploration vehicles, crewed surface habitats, and others. A higher operating voltage can yield a lower distribution system weight for the same power level and is highly desirable across many areas of PMAD. GaN devices offer high breakdown voltage and power densities, fast switching times and lower switching losses, and increased temperature tolerance, all crucial features for NASA space power applications. The hardened GaN designs from this project will add to the NASA components library.The physics-based models and predictive tools developed in this project to characterize the performance of power-related components are a cross-cutting technology applicable to all NASA missions that require power electronics. They also support the requirements specified in TA 11.2.4 (Science Modeling) and TA 11.3.7 (Multiscale, Multiphysics, and Multifidelity Simulation). The simulations tools will help NASA evaluate device performance under radiation and high temperature at an early stage, and design space qualified power electronics with better understanding of design margins, thereby reducing the development time and cost.","Space qualified GaN power electronics will find applications in power systems in all space-based platforms, including DoD space systems (communication, surveillance, missile defense), and commercial satellites. Other DoD/national defense applications include unmanned underwater vehicles and soldier portable power systems. Applications in the terrestrial energy sector (electric grid) include PMAD system components such as solid?\state transformers, inverters, fault current limiters, high?\voltage direct current, and power flow controllers. GaN HEMT devices are also attractive for high-temperature electronics and smart power applications. Specifically, enhancement mode operation of GaN HEMTs will deliver higher performance in circuit and system levels in power applications such as envelope tracking (converters and power amplifiers), wireless power (high speed switches), light distancing and ranging (LiDAR ?C high speed switches), power inverters (high speed switches with lower losses), and others.  Other commercial applications of GaN include high temperature (> 200 C) power and control systems in electric vehicles and hybrid vehicle engines. For all the applications listed above, physics-based predictive and accurate modeling and design tools reduce the amount of required radiation/temperature testing, thus decreasing their cost, and time to market or field application.","Conversion; Distribution/Management; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)","High Power, High Voltage Electronics   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Completed studies on each approach, have generally favored cryogenic temperature and mechanical compression solutions. Recently, mechanical compression has gained momentum through the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), which utilizes an Air Squared compressor for mechanical compression of CO2. If this approach is pursued further for a larger system, there are still several questions concerning reliability over 10,000 hours of autonomous operation in Mars environment and scalability. Air Squared plans on addressing these issues as part of Phase I.Air Squared proposes the development of a Multi-Stage Scroll Compressor (MSSC) that will be configured to support a store-and-utilize strategy (high pressure) or a collection-only strategy (high flow). If a store-and-utilize approach is required, the MSSC will be set up to pressurize the gas over the triple point (>77 PSIA), which provides the ability to liquefy CO2 downstream of the MSSC as it cools, while N2 and Ar remain a gas. If only collection is necessary, the MSSC will be configured to maximize flow at a pressure above 15 PSIA.There will be two ?types? of MSSCs pursued during the Phase I, an orbiting and spinning MSSC. The orbiting MSSC has the advantage of longer design heritage and lowers associated risk, as this scroll configuration is widely used at Air Squared and the compressor industry as a whole. The spinning MSSC has the advantage of achieving an aggressive size and weight target but has little design heritage. The orbiting MSSC and spinning MSSC both have substantial advancement over state of the art mechanical compression technologies, such as high-speed turbo-compressors. Size, weight, and power requirements are all reduced. Reliability is also improved, as both MSSCs operate at significantly lower speeds than turbo-compressors.","A key advantage of the proposed technology is scalability. The sizes identified for the MSSC concepts are inside the nominal pressure and flow spectrum for Air Squared scroll compressors and vacuum pumps. After the technology has matured, it can be modified to meet a broad range of size and pressure requirements, supporting additional Mars ISRU applications that require increased flow or pressure capacity.With NASA identifying Mars as the primary focus for human exploration programs, ISRU is a crucial component in enabling future exploration or even Mars colonization. ISRU includes the production of rocket propellant, oxygen, and other resources harvested from the Martian atmosphere. As the atmospheric pressure of Mars is approximately 1% of Earth's, acquisition and pressurization of the Martian atmosphere will be a critical component of ISRU, as well as applications with demanding size, weight, and power requirements.","Compared to state of the art positive displacement compressors and vacuum pumps, a spinning scroll compressor offers substantially reduced size and weight. Air Squared realized the potential benefit to the aerospace industry while developing a spinning scroll prototype to replace an existing Air Squared compressor used for the potable water system onboard the Airbus A380. While the prototype functionally operated and demonstrated the feasibility of spinning scroll technology, the prototype had reliability issues related to the outer bellows. The proposed spinning scroll MSSC mitigates this, by replacing the bellows with an internal coupling. If successful, the spinning scroll MSSC will provide a pathway for tailoring the technology to the additional compressor and vacuum pump applications in the commercial aerospace industry. Initial efforts will concern replacing existing orbiting scroll products currently used in aerospace applications, with reduced size and weight spinning scroll products. Air Squared will pursue additional applications after establishing flight heritage.",Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Pressure & Vacuum Systems,"Mars Atmosphere Acquisition, Separation, and Conditioning for ISRU   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The high energy, high density liquid oxidizer improves hybrid motor combustion capabilities and reduces logistical operational cost compared to current state-of-the-art cryogenic oxidizers.  This new system offers all advantages associated with hybrid propulsion, including inherent safety and simplicity in design.  In Phase I, the hybrid system efficacy will be quantified through subscale motor demonstrations.  The results generated will be utilized to conduct a realistic system level design of the propulsion system for full-scale demonstration in Phase II.","The proposed hybrid system will serve as the primary propulsion system for a small launch vehicle, offering a safe, low-cost, and logistically simple opportunity for delivery of small payloads into LEO. The ride-share method is currently the most reliable and most often used option available for delivering CubeSat's (5 kg) and other small satellite payloads (< 180 kg) into Low Earth Orbit.  However, it is anticipated that the number of small satellites delivered to LEO will continue to increase, and thus cheaper and more readily available transport options are required.The hybrid concept also allows for throttling, making it a feasible design for upper stage systems.  Additionally, the innovative system offers scale up capabilities that would allow for development of a hybrid propulsion system for launch vehicles carrying large satellite payloads.","The proposed hybrid propulsion technology will be of significant interest to multiple DoD agencies as well as the commercial space launch industry.  For tactical systems, tailoring of the fuel grain port geometry is often required to achieve specific thrust profiles; this is currently not feasible with state-of-the-art hybrid systems, as multi-port fuel grain geometries are needed to improve regression rate.  In the proposed system, the high regression rate and allows for a single port fuel grain, and thus, tailoring of the port geometry is viable.  Throttling capabilities are provided by the hybrid system, which can also be utilized for thrust modulation.  The composite fuel technology developed for the hybrid system can also be applied to tactical air-breathing systems such as ducted rockets, ramjets, and scramjets.  The challenges associated with poor regression rate and flame stability in these systems can be mitigated by using the innovative composite fuel.  The hybrid system can also be used for launch vehicles being developed within commercial space launch industry.

The tent shape is structurally efficient and packages well with a flexible photovoltaic blanket.  The tent array geometry produces a much more constant power output throughout a day than a non-tracking flat array, and provides significant power at sunrise and sunset.  This results in efficiencies in the power processing and storage system, to which the array would be integrated, that reduce the total system mass significantly.  The tent shape is also inherently resistant to dust buildup due to the slope of the arrays, and is amenable to a number of wind loading mitigations that will be examined in Phase I work.  The module self-deploys and can naturally straddle large boulders.  It can clear 0.5 m obstacles on the ground via two deployment schemes that will be examined.   Phase I work will consist of conceptual design of the module, structural analysis & optimization, performance analysis, module sizing within a large array system, and mechanical design of a module.

The design is also very applicable to the moon, and could be simplified due to the lack of wind loading and the lower gravity.","The SDTA design will be able to deploy in a 1 g environment, and so could be applied to terrestrial applications where a deployable collapsible array is needed.  This self-deploying tent array concept can potentially have military and civilian applications. Providing power for remote camps or isolated equipment operation would be one possible application. Due to its ability to be stowed and deployed easily and its modular/scalable output power capability, it could be viable as an emergency or disaster relief power supply. In such a situation, it could power items such as communications towers or water filtration systems.","Composites; Deployment; Distribution/Management; Generation; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Structures",Mars Surface Solar Array Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Relative to state-of-the-art incumbent GaInP/GaInAs/Ge 3J space solar cells, the proposed phosphide-based 4J solar cell has superior radiation tolerance, higher beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-life (EOL) efficiencies, lower areal mass density, higher specific power, and lower cost. The improved radiation tolerance is enabled by eliminating arsenide-based subcells in favor of only phosphide-based subcells. A reduction in the mass of the solar cell relative to incumbent technology is enabled by removal of the thick GaAs substrate. Cost savings compared to incumbent technology are enabled by the recovery and reuse of the substrate via the ELO process. The superior radiation tolerance can also relax the requirements for radiation shielding, enabling further reductions in array mass and stowed volume.","The proposed phosphide-based 4J solar cells are ideally suited for high efficiency multi-junction solar cell arrays for NASA applications requiring superior radiation tolerance, higher BOL and EOL efficiencies, lower areal mass density, higher specific power, or lower cost relative to incumbent Ge-based 3J space solar cells. Potential applications include solar electric propulsion programs and missions involving extreme radiation environments. Arrays based on the proposed solar cells will be suitable for NASA missions ranging from near-Earth to deep space.

Present state-of-the-art reaction wheels, or similar, actuators introduce vibrational jitter and can ultimately drive pointing error. Busek electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder mission have recently demonstrated nm scale position control. The proposed system will provide vibration-free sub-mas pointing control through integration of follow-on innovations and new deployable boom technologies. Recent thruster innovations have dramatically increased maximum thrust, while retaining control resolution, and reduced propellant loads through increased specific impulse. These gains will be applied in this work to replace reaction wheel actuators for both precision control and slew maneuvers. Accordingly, actuator induced vibrations are virtually eliminated while body pointing will be dramatically improved; resulting in major reductions in ACS SWaP and in the complexity of vibration compensating controllers/active sensors. With applications to, for example, observation and laser communication missions these benefits would both enable high-capability but reduced cost spacecraft and pave the way for new, presently, unobtainable levels of control authority on large spacecraft. Phase I will emphasize acquisition and analysis of precision thrust control measurements using the BET-1mN thruster-head which, uniquely, can be operated in either a high thrust, low Isp, or low thrust, high Isp configuration. The associated complex performance map will be analyzed in the context of highly quiescent ACS needs. These data will then be applied to define necessary control, circuitry and mechanical requirements needed to realize the full-attitude control potential of the technology. A conceptual system level design performed in collaboration with ROCCOR will outline strategies to overcome required developments and produce a complete system demonstration in Phase II.","The proposed technology has numerous applications to NASA missions improving both scientific and practical capabilities. Precision pointing applications include science objectives, such as exoplanet observations, laser communications and space situational awareness (SSA). In all cases, the greatly improved pointing over existing SoA (e.g reaction wheels) afforded by the proposed technology would both enhance pointing accuracy/stability and reduce the need for complex vibration and control accuracy mitigation strategies such as the use of active optics (e.g. fast steering mirrors). Laser communication benefits are particularly relevant with active NASA programs pursuing, for example, optical communication for Mars missions. SSA and identification of solar system objects would benefit from an ability to track commanded attitude profiles to <1 pixel. Long integration times can then be facilitated permitting resolution of very dim (small) objects. This system also applies to precise position control. Disturbance reduction has been demonstrated in space by larger versions of Busek's colloid thrusters on the NASA ST-7/ ESA LISA Pathfinder mission. Comparatively, the BET-1mN offers both higher maximum thrust and enhanced specific impulse; and therefore, lower propellant mass requirements. As an evolution of that work this program will enable other aspects of the NASA Disturbance Reduction System (DRS), such as controllers developed by GSFC to have new application routes.","Potential non-NASA customers include, international partners (such as ESA), the DoD and commercial EO missions. The readily configurable nature of the proposed technology would enable customized applications to simultaneously meet customer needs in precision pointing and disturbance compensation; therefore, maximizing the commercial applicability of the technology. Furthermore, the ability to scale both thrust output and boom moment arm, by virtue of Busek and ROCCORs respective scalable technologies, enables rapid customization of the system. Commercial EO applications may include optical communication pointing, supporting high bandwidth up/downlinks or precision pointing in earth orbit for earth observation organizations. With strong links to the now TRL-7 electrospray system Busek demonstrated on the LISA Pathfinder mission; the time is now right for other organizations to embrace this technology. The proposed effort will ensure such entities have access to a fully featured and versatile system.","Actuators & Motors; Attitude Determination & Control; Command & Control; Deployment; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)","Guidance, Navigation and Control   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The ongoing miniaturization efforts will continue to enable a cooperative approach to the integration of UAS into NAS moving forward.  A critical limitation of ADS-B is the use of GPS-derived position vector in its broadcast, which can be easily spoofed or jammed, or confused by reflections in urban areas.  We present a low-CSWaP solution to secure and verify the GPS integrity using a novel antenna design so that ADS-B can be used as a trusted vehicle to vehicle communications and navigation link for UAS.","Techniques that increase the confidence of ADS-B afford opportunities to equip UAS and other aircraft in the NAS with a reliable tool for air traffic management in the near and mid-term timeframe.

Honeybee Robotics (Honeybee) proposes to develop a Universal Docking Interface (UDI) that provides a common electromechanical connection architecture for free-flying robots. The UDI will enhance capabilities to mount and manipulate tools, sensors, payloads; dock for power and data transfer; perch for short- or long-term storage; and create new modular structures for intravehicular, extravehicular, and surface tasks in support of commercial operations and human spaceflight. The UDI will be based on Honeybee's existing solutions for robotic satellite servicing and planetary rover recharge , modified to meet NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Human Exploration Telerobotics requirements. This reliable plug-and-play docking and manipulation interface will provide an electromechanical quick-connect/disconnect for tools, sensors, and other payloads, as well as enabling truly modular assembly in microgravity. The proposed Phase 1 effort will perform a detailed investigation of tool change, sensor payload interface, manipulation and docking requirements for free-flying robots supporting missions on-orbit, to Mars, the Moon, or NEOs. Interface requirements such as mate/de-mate cycles, stiffness, strength, repeatability, misalignment tolerance, human safety, debris mitigation, and electrical feedthrough characteristics will be derived through contact with potential end users to characterize potential use cases and future mission payloads.","Docking, manipulating and tool change interfaces will be key components to future free-flying robot platforms in support of human exploration missions. The UDI would find extensive applications in systems designed to operate in intravehicular activities, extravehicular activities, and surface operations on Mars, the Moon, NEOs and other dusty environments. Future mission scenarios featuring flexible, modular, universal architectures for robotic manipulation, payloads, and sampling will all call for such an interface. Companion robots such as free-flying robots require ways to dock for modular assembly in free space, to manipulate assets, or to recharge. Applications for the UDI include a range of missions beyond free-flying robots that may include on-orbit satellite servicing, companion robots for the Asteroid Redirect Mission, and next-decade landed Lunar missions.","While NASA applications for this technology are the primary focus of this development effort, non-NASA applications for the UDI technology have been identified. There is a need for highly reliable robotic docking interfaces among a range of autonomous vehicles, including on-orbit servicing vehicles, ground robotics, and AUVs (i.e. drones). By designing for autonomous operations, the UDI will provide misalignment tolerance, low-force engagement, light weight, and other features suited to UGV and UAV markets. Docking and recharge using a common interface can also extend range, function, and operational availability of teleoperated or semi-autonomous robotic systems. For example, DARPA is organizing the  Consortium For Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operations (CONFERS) to define consensus-based technical standards that will enable commercial operations. Honeybee plans to engage with industry standards developers to position the UDI as a common electromechanical interface to improve payload interoperation and functionality of future servicing robots.

The AMWAS removes water from Mars soils using hot, recirculating carbon dioxide gas to provide rapid heat transfer. The AMWAS evaporates water from ice and salt hydrates, leaving dissolved contaminants in the soil residue. The water distilled from the extraction vessel is condensed, treated with activated carbon to remove residual volatiles and organic material, filtered to remove suspended solids, and subjected to deionization in preparation for proton exchange membrane electrolysis. Recuperative heat exchange is employed to minimize heat losses from recirculating carbon dioxide gas. Cold temperatures of the Mars atmosphere are used to facilitate condensation and separation of water from recycled carbon dioxide gas. A vacuum jacket is used to minimize heat losses from the extraction vessel. Much of the net heat input to the AMWAS can be supplied by solar concentrators or waste heat from radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The AMWAS vessel is equipped with a single, stationary seal that facilitates materials handling automation and minimizes potential leakage over the nominal operating period of up to 480 days.","The primary application of AMWAS is for production of clean water from Mars soils for electrolysis, fuel and oxygen production, food production, and radiation shielding. The AMWAS can provide a reliable, low-cost, low-mass technology to produce water, hydrogen, and liquid oxygen on the surface of Mars out of indigenous materials at low power. The ability to extract water from Mars could also serve to supply the crew of Mars missions with water, which is the second most massive logistic component of a Mars mission. Smaller versions of the AMWAS could be used to help make the return propellant for a Mars sample return  mission on the Martian surface, thereby making such a mission both cheaper to launch and much easier to land.","The AMWAS could be implemented in arid terrestrial climates for recovery of water from soils. Even in the driest regions of Earth, the regolith is several times wetter than on Mars, and the AMWAS can operate efficiently under those conditions. Regions that are too far from the coastline to economically pipe water may be potential markets. Units sized for vehicles traveling in desert regions could reduce logistical requirements for the military and civilians operating in remote areas, since it is very lightweight, cheap, and portable. By enabling agriculture in arid areas the AMWAS could also support the production of renewable energy in the form of biofuels.",In Situ Manufacturing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Processing Methods; Prototyping; Resource Extraction,Mars Soil Acquisition and Processing for In Situ Water   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Heritage large space (0-g) deployables are not applicable on Mars, as they require offloaders.  If smaller deployables were used, the number of deployables and mechanisms grows exponentially, as does cost, and mass when sized for 0.4-g and aeolian loads. A robot-erected, power farm from modular components is much more practical, and can have greater performance than any 0-g solar array. The proposed innovation, OmniFlex, a solar array without any deployment mechanism, can be thought of as a pre-deployed UltraFlex that has been perfectly optimized for large area landed PV farm installations.OmniFlex panels are very simple and low cost: Each is a pre-built hexagonal platform composed of a thin composite ribs emanating from a central hub, to which is bonded ultra-light flexible blankets composed of high efficiency PV bonded to a gossamer fabric scrim. The rib design allow stacking at a low (3.3-mm) pitch, enabling 190 panels to stack for launch at only 0.65 m high. OmniFlex is like Ikea for planetary power: Compactly shipped, easily erected, and cost effective. And yet performance is extraordinary, even with respect to the challenging subtopic goals. The technology is extremely light (>300 W/kg) and stacks hyper-efficiently (>100 kW/m3) for transport to Mars. The deployment of the power field will be by pick and place robotics, using modular OmniFlex units. The proposal details and demonstrates the practicality and performance of this approach for construction of a huge array farm on Mars (or the moon, or in-space). Individual units can be re-purposed on rovers, habitats, comm stations, etc. And with viable in-space assembly tech emerging, the potential for OmniFlex panels to be tiled onto robotically-assembled MW-scale truss structures looks extremely promising as an adjunct application.","The path to commercialization is straight-forward, via our proven commercialization partner OAG, who has significant interest in commercializing OmniFlex technology and post-Phase II commercialization would be in the form of sales directly from OAG.The most direct commercialization opportunities may come in the form of a demo-wing for a NASA or Commercial Mars (or Moon) precursor SEP mission or, more likely in the near term, a project enabled by NASA/OA CIRAS activity. Orbital ATK has begun a public-private partnership with NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) to establish a Commercial Infrastructure for Robotic Assembly and Services (CIRAS) in space.Orbital ATK will take the lead in maturing technologies necessary for robotic assembly of large space structures, such as solar-power structures for transport or communications. These capabilities include methods to connect (and disconnect) joints of a truss structure and address precision measuring and alignment and equipment placement via a robotic arm with various end effectors.","The entire space community is interested in higher performance and lower cost solar arrays.

Swedesford Rd, Wayne, PA 19087 - 1858",(610) 964-6131,1,3,"As the power density of advanced engines increases, the need for new materials that are capable of higher operating temperatures, such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), is critical for turbine hot-section static and rotating components. Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials. Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBCs) are required for SiC-based composites used in hot-section components of aircraft turbine engines to limit degradation from reaction of the composite with combustion gases. EBCs themselves are subject to degradation when debris composed of calcium-magnesium alumino-silicates (CMAS) is ingested into the engine melts in the turbine hot-section, and deposits on the coated components. The CMAS reacts with the coating and degrades the mechanical properties of the coating during temperature cycling which occurs during normal engine operation. Models linking the thermochemical and thermomechanical degradation of the EBCs due to CMAS are needed to understand life of the coatings and to identify best strategies for developing improved coating systems. MR&D is proposing a combined analytical and experimental program to develop a mathematical model for CMC EBCs exposed to CMAS.","NASA Glenn has been directly involved in the effort to bring these materials to turbine hot section components. The NASA Ultra Efficient Engine Technology program (UEET) was focused on driving the next generation of turbine engine technology. Currently, the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Thrust 3 for Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles focuses on the development and demonstration of advanced high-temperature materials which are capable of surviving the extreme environments of turbine combustion and CMAS attack.","In the commercial sector, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines are being developed for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, respectively. The Trent 1000 was the launch engine for the Boeing 787. These are large markets where the benefit of this technology will have a lasting impact in efficiency and cost. By workingclosely with Rolls Royce during the early stages of this development program, MR&D has ensured that the resulting products will meet the requirements of future customers. Rolls Royce has expressed a serious interest in this technology and, as demonstrated above, has a sizable market for its application. The aerospace industry is not the only potential beneficiary of this technology. The Department of Defense (DoD) is working hard to improve environmental barrier coatings' resistance to CMAS attack. The proposed modeling effort could be used to both improve existing CMAS damage models for in-service components and to aid in the evaluation of new coatings exposed to a wide range of CMAS compositions.","Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Propulsion Efficiency-Propulsion Materials and Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

There is a need for adequate circuit protection in these high powered electrical systems to achieve safety, reliability, and ultimately airworthiness. Solid State Power Controller (SSPC) modules already exist for aircraft applications but they were developed for the lower power levels seen in existing aircraft branch circuits. Hybrid-Electric aircraft have electrical power levels that are one or two orders of magnitude higher than existing aircraft and the presently existing SSPCs are simply not appropriate for use in these vehicles. SSPCs at the power levels required for a GA aircraft propulsion motor hardly exist; and SSPCs at the power levels required by small electric UAVs are too heavy and bulky. The LaunchPoint SSPC unit will incorporate all of the capabilities of existing SSPCs but with a few distinctions. LaunchPoint's SSPC will utilize Silicon Carbide and Gallium Nitride semiconductors to create SSPCs that are not only significantly smaller but can operate at much higher power levels. In addition to utilizing a different MOSFET element, the LaunchPoint SSPC would incorporate a microcontroller that would perform high bandwidth monitoring of current and voltage waveforms and derive low bandwidth metrics that can be reported back to the system Hybrid Power Controller. These metrics could include transient peak currents and voltages, RMS currents and voltages, and frequency content. In addition to these metrics, LaunchPoint would like to evaluate the feasibility of using the smart SSPC to detect imminent insulation failures resulting from coronal discharge, a particularly troubling problem associated with high altitude flight. This could be accomplished by real time analysis of partial discharge currents and other characteristic phenomena. These advancements represent a novel contribution to electric aircraft propulsion systems.","NASA spacecraft could benefit from significant weight savings as well as increased safety, x-57 Maxwell aircraft, GL-10 hybrid electric VTOL aircraft, HEIST project could replace heavy electromechanical relays in the power system with lightweight, fast Solid State Power Controller (SSPC) modules.The SSPC modules can also be incorporated into the front end of motor speed controllers and allow the controllers to safely disconnect from the DC bus in the event of a short circuit fault within the controller.  The modules also will have use as battery pack disconnect switches in the event of a pack failure that could short circuit the main power bus.",LaunchPoint Technologies is providing a gen-set and hybrid power system to a potential customer for evaluation on a small UAV they are planning to manufacture and sell.  This customer has expressed a desire for circuit protection to enable the vehicle to survive the failure of a motor speed controller that could short out the entire DC bus of the vehicle.Other UAV manufacturers that wish to conduct operations over people will eventually need to meet some airworthiness requirements and circuit protection that allows the vehicle to remain in the air after a short circuit in a feeder wire or other single point electrical failures will be essential to demonstrate airworthiness to the FAA.

The pump will satisfy propulsion feed system needs stated in SBIR Research Topic Z10.02: Methane In-Space Propulsion. The primary goal is to develop a versatile CSSP, capable of pumping liquid or two-phase methane or oxygen at a wide range of speeds (i.e. 1,000-8,000 RPM) and a wide range of differential pressures while maintaining high reliability and a compact size.For Cryogenic pumping, state of the art (SOA), consists of two vastly different technology options. Centrifugal turbopumps and positive displacement pumps. Turbopumps utilize an impeller-inducer combination that relies on high impeller speeds to create a differential pressure. While the high-speed operation makes turbopumps more compact, it also limits bearing life, differential pressure, and they can't handle two-phase flow. Positive displacement pumps can handle larger pressure differentials and don't have issues with two-phase flow. However, they can't achieve speeds over 3,000 RPM without bulky and high-load bearings. This typically makes positive displacement pumps larger, and consequently, less desirable for aerospace applications.The CSSP offers the best of both options. As a positive displacement pump, it can achieve high-pressure with minimal reduction in flow and pump saturated liquids at low net-positive suction heads. Due to the spinning motion of the pump various centrifugal loads are eliminated, with reduced loading, speeds over 8,000 RPM are possible, making the design compact and lightweight. Additionally, the spinning motion of the scrolls eliminates the need for a counterbalance common in orbiting scroll designs. This further reduces weight by eliminating counterweights and eases bearing loads. Air Squared believes the proposed CSSP is a perfect fit in support of Methane In-space Propulsion.","One of the key advantages of the proposed technology is its scalability. Not only can the speed be varied across a wide range, but the size of the unit can be changed to meet additional applications. Once the technology is proven through this Phase I, it can be modified to fit a wide range of cryogenic applications.A small, cryogenic scroll pump would have several NASA cryo propellant applications. It would enable efficient, low boil off or zero boil off cryogenic systems by circulating cryogenic helium gas from a cryocooler to broad area thermal shields surrounding the tanks. This would eliminate the need for high-efficiency heat exchangers that are required with ambient temperature circulator pumps. The pump would also enable thermodynamic vent systems in which cryo propellants are dropped in pressure and temperature, and heat exchanged with liquid pumped in a circulation loop within the tank. NASA Marshall has done considerable work with such systems involving spray bar tank heat exchangers and destratifiers.NASA topic Z10.02: Methane In-Space Propulsion expresses an interest in a cryogenic methane pump for high thrust in space chemical propulsion capabilities. These thrusters are critical to enable human and robotic missions to Mars and beyond. For these long duration missions, zero boil off conditions need to be achieved. Therefore, the development of cryogenic circulating pumps with long life, variable speed operation, and very low leakage are required.","A strong demand exists for small cryogenic pumps for use in liquid hydrogen fueled aircraft.  The Boeing Company and AeroViroment, Inc. have developed and flown hydrogen powered, unmanned aircraft as reconnaissance platforms. Typically, these aircraft fuel systems require the hydrogen to be delivered at a pressure of 90 PSIG. Currently, this performed by making the operating pressure of the tanks at a minimum of 90 PSIG. This results in tanks that can operate with a safety margin above this pressure. If the tanks could operate at a lower pressure, such as 30 PSIG, the tank walls could be thinner and lighter. The estimated weight savings of a pump system for the Boeing Phantom Eye hydrogen fueled aircraft is over 400 pounds per aircraft.  The scroll pump is a significant contributor in increasing aircraft endurance or payload.Another commercial application would be a liquid natural gas pump (LNG), for LNG transport. Currently, there are limited options for positive displacement LNG pumps. Progress Rail (Caterpillar Subsidiary) has already contacted Air Squared about using a positive displacement LNG scroll pump for locomotive transportation and has invested in an Air Squared, orbiting scroll type LNG pump prototype. While the size and weight aren't primary concerns, the proposed pump development could be used as an LNG fuel pump.",Fuels/Propellants,Methane In-Space Propulsion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The adaptive venturi eliminates water hammer in monopropellant thruster manifolds by rapidly adjusting flow area to prevent pressure surges. These benefits are achieved with a one-to-one replacement of existing cavitating venturis without added weight, volume, or power requirements. Furthermore, the total lifetime impulse of the propulsion system will increase due to increased flow area during nominal flow conditions. In Phase I, we will optimize the venturi design and measure key performance metrics in full-scale flow tests. The Phase I will conclude with a miniaturized adaptive venturi design accompanied by performance analysis results. In Phase II, a set of geometric models will be created to meet the range of flow conditions required for attitude and reaction control thrusters, as well as divert/insert thrusters up to 100 lbf. Upon successful technology development under the SBIR program, protoflight components and venturis for ground testing will be developed in technology transition programs.","Successful demonstration of the adaptive venturi will have applications in any cost and weight saving efforts ranging from expendable and reusable launch vehicles to small spacecraft. Extending the lifetime and total impulse of DACS and RCS is a critical technology requirement for lengthening the duration of spacecraft missions. The adaptive venturi will provide for an advanced blowdown propellant feed system with lower pressure drop and increased useable lifetime, providing for longer missions that require orbit raising or station keeping.","The adaptive venturi can simplify propellant loading and priming operations for liquid propulsion systems in Air Force satellites and missile defense systems employed by the MDA, Army, and Navy. In addition to DoD monopropellant propulsion applications, the adaptive venturi will provide a simple solution for all high-pressure plumbing systems subject to rapid pressurization and water hammer.

LiAISON makes it possible to achieve absolute, inertial navigation of two or more satellites using only relative satellite-to-satellite tracking data. LiAISON removes the need for ground tracking and permits a constellation to achieve autonomy with on-board navigation software. A good example of LiAISON involves one satellite traversing a libration orbit about the Earth-Moon L2 point (perhaps providing communication services to the lunar far-side) and another satellite traversing a low lunar orbit. The time-series of range data between the two satellites is unique in that it cannot be reproduced by any other two orbits. The uniqueness of these two orbits based on their relative position and/or velocity permits the estimation of the absolute positions of both spacecraft. Another example configuration places one satellite in a distant retrograde orbit about the Moon (a desirable orbit for many mission concepts including Orion, the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), and various Mars sample return concepts) and a second satellite anywhere else in cislunar space. Numerous recent academic studies have shown that processing satellite-to-satellite tracking data for these vehicles yields absolute navigation states for both vehicles. Extensive academic studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this algorithm over the past 10 years. Advanced Space proposes to develop this innovative technology into a robust, expandable in-space navigation system, simulated through a representative real-time environment, positioning it for infusion into spaceflight missions. The resulting system lays the foundation for the proposed Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS), which infuses the strength of LiAISON into an operational network.","Advanced Space anticipates the LiAISON algorithm, used to create CAPS, will enable a rich operational environment for NASA missions within cislunar space as well as other environments where similar field geometries can be exploited to create a local positioning system. There will always be a connection between Earth ground stations and exploratory missions. However, in environments equipped with a LiAISON-based network, that connection is no longer required for navigational purposes. In cislunar space, the specialized CAPS system would help to create a vibrant ecosystem of spacecraft whose navigation would be conducted entirely on-board and autonomously, operating on and around the Moon using a LiAISON-enabled GPS-like beacon. By improving the navigational capabilities of spacecraft in highly dynamic environments, LiAISON will have applications in robotic servicing, formation flying, constellation management, astrometric alignment, and other areas. In particular, Advanced Space expects the LiAISON approach to significantly support the goals of the Science Mission Directorate in moving toward smaller, more challenging missions in the highly dynamic environments. Particular missions and efforts may include (but are not limited to) New Worlds Observer, Lunar ground operations and sample return, and the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM). LiAISON may permit missions that were previously impossible or not realistic without a regional positioning system to reference.","Companies and agencies interested in constructing spacecraft systems to operate in dynamic environments will have immense interest in LiAISON and LiAISON-based networks. NASA, along with other government agencies and private entities such as ESA, JAXA, ULA, and Google Lunar X-Prize teams, already demand technologies that enable enhanced science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower-cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements.","Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Navigation & Guidance; Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Space Transportation & Safety; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)","Guidance, Navigation and Control   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These include 1) electrical wire and cable with room temperature conductivities greater than copper or silver, 2) microelectronic devices based on sub-electron levels, so reduced gate current, power loss and generated heat, so the ability to increase gate density, 3) increased efficiency in motors and generators due to decreased wire resistance and thermal loss, and 4) the possibility of microelectronic devices and storage based on sub-electron levels.  Third, photodetectors that exhibit multiple exciton generation (MEG) and quantum efficiencies >1 will improve the performance of optical communication systems, optical imaging systems, and optics-based instrumentation.  In a broader sense, this program will allow the investigation of quantum device effects themselves, and the integration of such effects into microelectronic and optoelectronic products.","The quantum material technologies demonstrated through this program have multiple potential applications of importance outside of future NASA missions and programs.  Perhaps most important is the transition of sub-quantum conductance and ballistic electron transport effects at room temperature from theory, to NanoSonic's recent experimental demonstration and publication, to practical materials and devices.  Ballistic electron transport could lead to electrical wires and cables that exhibit resistance lower than that of copper and silver at room temperature, so without the need for cooling.  Lower resistance wire and cable could improve the efficiency of the electrical power distribution grid, all-electric operations and weapons systems on military platforms, and electric motors and generators.  Additionally, such materials could reduce heat generation in microelectronic devices and memories, allow smaller size, increased gate density, and reduced cooling requirements.  This is to massive computer systems to personal communication devices.  Finally, improved optoelectronic components have applications ranging from fiber optic communication networks to large area displays to cell phone cameras.","Cables/Fittings; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Manufacturing Methods; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Nanomaterials; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ultraviolet; Visible",Transformational/Over-the-Horizon Communications Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Three-dimensional sensors will be formed by additive manufacturing technology and will employ advanced sensing materials for accurate measurement of structural integrity.  Microwaves are a particularly effective and versatile probe for complex structures because they readily penetrate a wide range of solid materials.  At the highest frequencies (~100 GHz), wavelengths can approach the 1 mm scale, allowing for the possibility of sub-millimeter embedded sensor size, since resonant features can be scaled smaller than the interrogating wavelength.  Structural health can therefore be unobtrusively measured and mapped from locations distributed over a defined volume of material or over a wide area.A potential issue associated with any physical sensor is the size of the sensor relative to the minimum dimensions of the structures being measured. Our team can develop microwave-interrogated sensors with diameters smaller than 1 mm that can be embedded in structures.  Electrically small 3D antennas coupled with capacitive or piezoresistive materials are embedded structural component.  The passive antennas are interrogated by sweeping frequencies in the microwave range.  Pressure and temperature changes in the system are observed by the corresponding changes in resonant frequency of the antenna due to capacitance changes in the sensor material, and captured by the reflected energy spectra.  The sensor in each node has a unique characteristic frequency, enabling mapping the response to a specific node location, and simultaneous characterization of multiple sensors with a frequency sweep. Data acquisition and processing software is used to convert spectral response into changes in temperature, pressure or other measured variables, and to map conditions at each node over time.","The proposed passive RF sensors can be embedded in structural components of space flight hardware. Multiple sensors distributed throughout structures will enable nondestructive evaluation of habitats in real time, enabling warnings and corrective actions when structural health is compromised. In addition to structural health monitoring, chemical sensors based on resistive or capacitive materials can be incorporated in the 3D antenna.  Passive RF-based chemical sensors may be used for applications including leak detection and air quality monitoring.","Electrically small 3 dimensional antennas enables a wide range of passive wireless sensor and sensor network applications.  Passive sensors for temperature, pressure and chemicals can be integrated in the 3D antenna structure.  RF piezoresistive sensors can be embedded in concrete structures to monitor integrity throughout its life, and specifically after earthquakes, floods and other disasters that could compromise structures.  Chemical sensors based on resistive or capacitive materials can be incorporated in the 3D antenna.  Sites such as abandoned mines, landfills and water systems can be monitored for key contaminants with such sensors. Monitoring of soil contaminants in remediation sites (e.g., mercury) can be done by deploying multiple sensors throughout the site and periodically interrogating the sensors for contaminant levels.  Sensors can be embedded in sports helmets to monitor impact force and help prevent long term damage caused by repeated impact.",Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Contact/Mechanical; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Pressure/Vacuum; Structures; Thermal,NDE Sensors   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Experimental measurement systems that offer fast response, high accuracy and reliability, and require minimal modification of the flight vehicle are needed to conduct flight research more effectively. There have recently been significant advances in the use of one such technology, fast responding Pressure-Sensitive Paint. Fast PSP offers a means of acquiring unsteady pressure data at millions of locations on a model surface, a capability that has recently been demonstrated in large transonic wind tunnels such as AEDC 16T, the Ames 11-foot, and Langley 14X22. Demonstration of this measurement technique in flight testing is the goal of this proposal. Use of the fast PSP system in flight involves, applying a polymer paint to the region of interest, illuminating the paint with 400-nm lighting, and then imaging the paint with a fast framing camera. Each pixel on the camera acts as a pressure tap, and therefore, continuous distributions of the unsteady pressure on the painted surface are acquired. While optical access to the region of interest is required, there are key fluid structures on the top surface of a wing, such as shock boundary layer interactions and wing buffet, that are easily viewed from the passenger compartment of a plane. ISSI, in collaboration with Calspan, propose a demonstrating unsteady pressure measurements on a shock wave boundary layer interaction on the top surface of the Calspan Gulfstream G-III wing in-flight using fast PSP. By combining ISSI experience with fast PSP and Calspans existing flight test capability, a successful program is anticipated. During Phase II, we anticipate packaging the fast PSP system for deployment to the NASA flight test bed aircraft, specifically the SCRAT program, and repackaging the system for use in regions with limited optical access, such as the landing bay, to study cavity acoustics.","There is considerable interest in measurements of unsteady pressure for the study of shock wave boundary layer interactions, flow control, landing bay acoustics, and wing buffet. The proposed fast PSP system would give NASA and their test bed aircraft programs the ability to acquire continues distributions of unsteady pressure in flight using a sensor that can be sprayed onto a model and interrogated optically. This measurement capability is of interest to NASA programs such as the Subsonic Fixed Wing and Environmentally Responsible Aviation programs. SBLI impacts aircraft performance at transonic Mach numbers as the shock induced flow separation can cause buffeting and large-scale lift oscillations that can limit an aircraft's flight envelope. Landing bay acoustics are a significant source of aviation noise and flow control concepts are needed for noise reduction and drag reduction. Each of these applications would benefit from the proposed sensor. The Phase I system would establish the technical capability of the fast PSP system and provide data on the top surface of wings and flaps. The Phase II system would be packaged so that it could be integrated into a region such as the landing bay, and allow regions without optical access to be interrogated. The proposed fast PSP system would improve flight test utilization by allowing the flight test vehicle to be instrumented with unprecedented spatial resolution, and do so without physical modifications to the vehicle.","There is considerable interest in measurements of unsteady pressure for the study of fluid flows such as shock wave boundary layer interactions, flow control, landing bay acoustics, wing buffet, and supersonic inlets. Interest in unsteady pressure measurements in flight spans academic, commercial, and military research. Companies that offer flight testing services, such as Calspan, as well as several commercial aircraft companies such as Cessna, Hawker, and Embraer, have expressed interest in the proposed in-flight fast PSP measurement technology. The proposed fast PSP system would improve flight test utilization by allowing the flight test vehicle to be instrumented with unprecedented spatial resolution, and do so without physical modifications to the vehicle. Evolution of the system into a smaller package that could be mounted on inaccessible regions of the flight test vehicle such as the weapons bay will occur naturally as fast camera imaging technology evolves. This will further extend the commercialization of the technology. This system would enable the investigation of fluid flows at flight conditions, data that will advance the accuracy of numerical models and yield insight into evolving flow control concepts. Furthermore, the demonstration of a productive and validated fast PSP system for flight testing would provide a marketing tool for commercialization of the measurement technology.",Aerodynamics; Image Processing; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics),Flight Test and Measurements Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed effort extends computational fluid dynamics capabilities to consider the behavior and effects of turbulence on heat/mass transfer at the tank gas/liquid interface and dispersed-phase droplet vaporization.  Model extensions to fundamental kinetics-based mass transfer models are investigated for application to cryogenic systems.

The models improvements will be readily transferable to alternate codes and support unsteady RANS simulations in an Eulerian-based gas/liquid framework. This technology will support cryogenic system analysis for long duration space exploration activities.","The end-product will be high-fidelity, computational models that would be used in advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics software to support design/analysis of cryogenic propellant management methods in both upper-stage and space exploration systems.

Traditionally, these types of missions would be performed using formation flying or using large, costly satellites equipped with complex deployable structures.

For Class C and D missions, the cryocooler technical requirements for performance, size, and mass, coupled with the programmatic requirements for minimal cost and development time, are extremely challenging.  Flight ready cryocoolers and associated control electronics that have been developed for traditional satellites do not meet technical, cost, or schedule requirements for future small space platforms.  Creare proposes to develop low cost cryocooler control electronics that leverage technologies and capabilities previously demonstrated on prior programs.  During Phase I, we will develop a set of requirements, design low cost electronics to meet these requirements, and assess production cost.  We will also work closely with a leading developer of low cost infrared space subsystems to ensure compatibility and readiness for upcoming missions.  During Phase II, we will work closely with our partners to fabricate and qualify protoflight electronics with representative cryocoolers.  Successful completion of this program will enable advanced sensor systems for space-borne science, surveillance, and reconnaissance.","The successful completion of this program will provide mission planners with high performance and low cost cryocooler control electronics that are compatible with miniature cryocoolers suitable for a variety of small platform missions.  Primary emphasis will be on achieving low cost, small size, and high performance for cost constrained, small space platform missions.  The primary NASA application will be for cooling detectors, sensors, shields, and telescopes for planetary science missions.","The proposed cryocooler control electronics are ideal for small, cost-constrained satellite missions.

A melt probe uses a hot point to melt through ice and penetrate downward.  In this regard, it is a very simple approach - it requires a heat source. However, the power required to melt 50-110K ice is 10s of kW, of which 90% is lost into the surrounding ice.  In addition, melt probes will not penetrate anything else but ice, and if the heat is provided by integrated RTGs, the probe will overheat and melt if the conductive properties of ice change (e.g. if ice becomes porous, it will become a very good insulator). The electro-mechanical approach is an order of magnitude more energy efficient than a melt probe. However, the drill needs to get rid of the cuttings it is generating. The drill can also freeze in-place if it encounters any liquid water.  Numerous drills deployed in Antarctica, for example, froze in-place while drilling down the borehole, because ice tuned into liquid water at the cutter-ice interface. We therefore propose a Hybrid approach that takes the best of both worlds and reduces risks posed by each of the options above. SLUSH is a hot-point electro-mechanical drill that cuts through ice using rotary-percussive action, and melts chips with its hot bit to form slush.  The slush moves up the hole where it refreezes behind the drill. SLUSH is approximately 14 cm in diameter and 2.5 m long. Because SLUSH uses mechanical action to break ice, it is significantly faster than a melt probe and also significantly more efficient, since slush does not have as much time to loose heat into the surrounding ice. Since SLUSH uses a hammer drill, it can also penetrate material with a significant fraction of insoluble material (e.g. silt). An added benefit of SLUSH is that science instruments can draw liquid directly from the outside for analysis.","The primary application of SLUSH is in penetrating to subglacial oceans on Europa and possibly Enceladus. The system could also be deployed on Mars, in either the northern or the southern Polar Regions. Subsystems developed for SLUSH could be used on many other planetary missions. For example power management, motors, and bits, percussive system can be infused into any other surface missions requiring sample acquisition. These missions include Venus in Situ Explorer, Venus Mobile Explorer, Lunar South Pole Aitken Basin Sample Return, and Mars Sample Return and so on.","Main non-NASA applications include penetrating to subglacial lakes in Antarctica as well as penetrating below Greenland ice sheet. Aseptic sampling of subglacial lakes is critical to astrobiology. A drill that can go through DHMR and is fully decoupled from the surface will be ideal for such an application. The SLUSH could also be used to deploy instruments and sensors (e.g. neutrino counters) around Antarctica.

In this SBIR project, CFDRC will develop a software tool for the generation of meshes formed by high-order elements. Our approach consists of (a) linear mesh generation and import, (b) reconstruction of curved boundary using NURBS and B?zier surfaces and optimal high-order nodal distribution; (c) volumetric deformation using elasticity analogy with imposed boundary displacement on curved part of the boundary; and (d) export and display capability of final mesh. Phase I will develop an advanced NURBS fitting procedure and B?zier surface method for retaining boundary geometry and will demonstrate the solution of both linear and nonlinear elasticity analogy to accommodate curved elements and retain high quality for both orthogonal and stretched linear meshes. The resultant improved accuracy will be demonstrated using two high-order CFD codes, including FUN3D with high-order scheme implemented by CFDRC, and a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin code.  Phase II will fully develop the software and bridge the gap between linear mesh generation and high-order CFD predictions for complex configurations.  Parallel algorithms will be implemented to enable execution on NASA HPC  clusters.  Phase II will also increase the TRL by integrating with high-order CFD codes for demonstration on large scale applications.","The developed software will formalize and streamline the process of high-order curved volume mesh generation, and flow calculation within a single all-encompassing framework, removing the bottleneck between geometric definition and flow solution. The software will enable wide use of CFD solvers with high-order schemes. These schemes are especially efficient for the prediction of noise mechanisms and propagation for engine, fan, duct, propellers, and airframes, and for the analysis of wake/frame interaction induced noise and vibrations. The developed technology will fulfill several goals of NASA Technology Roadmap TA15 by a) enabling design of airframe configurations with high levels of aerodynamic performance and reduced noise, b) reduction of turbofan propulsion noise and emissions, and c) reduction of perceived noise and aircraft fuel burn through integrated airframe-engine concepts.","The proposed technology provides a viable tool for several commercial applications such as wing-trailing vortex dynamics of large civil aircraft, analysis of noise generated by the landing gear of civil aircraft, and others.

It can cause chromosome aberrations and negatively affect the lungs, liver, spleen, thyroid gland, and central nervous system. NASA's existing hydrazine measurement technology is sensitive, selective and reliable, but it takes 15 minutes to collect and analyze a sample. For future missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, NASA will need a measurement system that responds within 30 seconds without any performance limitations such as lack of specificity and maintenance challenges. To address NASA needs, InnoSense LLC (ISL) proposes to develop micro-electro-analytical sensor for rapid monitoring of hydrazine (Micro-Zin) in the presence of ammonia in spacecraft cabin atmosphere (SCA) for long-term performance without maintenance. Micro-Zin builds on ISL's nanomaterial-based sensor technology and electronic data processing systems. In Phase I, ISL will design and fabricate a Micro-Zin working model. To establish feasibility, we will characterize Micro-Zin's sensitivity, selectivity, response time, and reliability. In Phase II, we will optimize sensor performance with an appropriate prototype.","Micro-Zin is designed for rapid monitoring of hydrazine for measurements of spacecraft cabin atmosphere to identify and minimize the risks to crew health during Exploration-class missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO). Micro-Zin will offer sensitive, selective and reliable detection of hydrazine with quick response time (T90 ≤30 seconds) in the presence of confounding background gas ammonia (50 ppm) in spacecraft cabin atmosphere. Micro-Zin will be compact (device volume ~480 cubic centimeters) and lightweight to accommodate NASA's mass and volume constraints. One or more of these miniature Micro-Zins can be placed within the crew cabin, thereby supporting crew health and wellbeing for future space missions.","Micro-Zin will find applications in the commercial space industry (including SpaceX, Blue Origin and Orbital ATK), missile defense, the toxic chemical process control industries, environmental/EPA regulatory compliance and biomedical sensor areas.

These communications referenced investigations of accidents that occurred during taxi when a large airplane?s wingtip collided with another airplane or object on the taxiway. In all of the accidents referenced, the pilots of the large airplanes were either unable to determine or had difficulty determining the separation between the airplane?s wingtips and the other airplane or object while taxiing. Typically, pilots look out the cockpit window at the wingtips to determine wingtip path and clearance, but on large airplanes the pilot cannot see the airplane?s wingtips from the cockpit unless the pilot opens the cockpit window and extends his or her head out of the window, which is often impractical. Certain aircraft have cameras to aid taxi operations, but the cameras? view did not include the wing tips. NTSB recommended the installation of an anti-collision aid, such as a camera system, on all newly manufactured and newly type-certificated large airplanes, and existing large airplanes to be retrofitted with a similar anti-collision aid. In view of the recommended camera systems, additional automation is proposed that will take advantage of such sensors to further enhance the safety and efficiency of taxi operations, beyond that made possible by the sensors alone. The envisioned vision-based automation system will provide benefit in three applications: (i) to provide automated collision detection and avoidance for enhanced safety during taxi; (ii) to provide vision-based navigation for enhanced situation awareness during taxi operations; and (iii) to aid in autonomous taxi capabilities.","The proposed vision-based automation system for taxi operations align with multiple strategic thrusts of the NASA Aeronautics Strategic Implementation Plan. For ARMD Strategic Thrust 1 on Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations, the proposed technology will contribute towards NextGen operational performance, surface operations to realize Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO), and autonomous trajectory services. For ARMD Strategic Thrust 5 on Real-time System-Wide Safety Assurance, the technology will contribute towards improved safety through real-time detection and alerting of hazards, and human-automation teaming for optimum threat management. Finally, for ARMD Strategic Thrust 6 on Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation, the automation technology will contribute towards the candidate mission products of autonomous airport surface operations, autonomy-enhanced vehicle safety, and fully autonomous transport aircraft.","In the near term, the envisioned technologies will improve safety during taxi operations, with collision detection and avoidance capabilities that will benefit manufacturers of large airplanes. In the U.S., these include primarily Boeing for commercial transport aircraft, joined by Lockheed Martin when military transports are considered. In the far term, the envisioned automation technologies provide additional navigation data based on recognition of airport signage and airfield features that will improve situation awareness of the flight crew. Another set of technologies will enable autonomous taxi operations to realize Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO).

These may serve as habitats during transfer from Earth to a destination (the Moon, Mars, etc), or serve as periodically-inhabited orbital bases. For all of these deep-space habitats, especially ones left in orbit around a destination planet or Moon, astronaut time at the habitat will be both infrequent, and very valuable. As such it would be extremely desirable to develop ways to enable robots to outfit the habitat prior to human occupation, and to allow robots to perform maintenance and logistics tasks both when humans are present and when they are not. These robotic interaction aids ideally can serve three purposes: 1) helping robots determine their relative pose and position with respect to the target, and their relative location/pose inside or outside the habitat, 2) identifying what the objects are, especially if the objects are mobile like soft-goods bags, and 3) simplifying physical interactions with the object, including anchoring to and manipulating the object. To enable these types of robotic interactions, Altius proposes the development of a lightweight, low-cost, passive ""DogTag"" robotic interface that can be attached to various habitat structures and objects. The DogTag interface includes: 1) a thin (<0.4mm) ferromagnetic material layer that allows robots with magnetic grippers to stick to the DogTag, 2) a printed on long-range optical fiducial on the DogTag face for allowing the robot to determine relative pose and position of the object even from across a large habitat, 3) an identification code and possibly RFID tag for identifying the object, also on the DogTag face, and 4) methods for attaching the DogTag to the desired object. During Phase I, Altius and team will define requirements, develop and test the optical fiducials and identification codes, and develop conceptual DogTag designs and prototypes, raising the TRL from 2 to 3.","The key NASA applications for this robotic interface include: 1) enabling robotic outfitting of orbital habitats and related maintenance and logistics tasks by providing lightweight robotic navigation and capture interfaces that can be easily integrated into habitat structures, tools, and soft-goods bags, 2) robotic navigation and capture interfaces enabling free-flying robots to assist astronauts on EVA missions, 3) lightweight robotic navigation and capture interfaces for cooperative satellite servicing.","The key non-NASA applications of this robotic interface are: 1) robotic navigation and capture interfaces for robotic outfitting, maintenance, and logistics support for commercial human-tended space facilities, 2) lightweight robotic interface tags for drone package delivery systems, 3) lightweight robotic navigation and capture interfaces for cooperative satellite servicing, 4) robotic navigation and capture interfaces for megaconstellation satellites to interface with the magnetic grippers, and 5) robotic navigation and capture interfaces for upper stage capture for on-orbit refueling of upper stages.","Attitude Determination & Control; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Data Processing; Image Processing; Inventory Management/Warehousing; Material Handing & Packaging; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Superconductance/Magnetics; Tools/EVA Tools",Habitat Outfitting   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The low inertia of CubeSats combined with vibrational disturbances and resolution limitations of state-of-the-art ACS presently limit body-pointing and position control accuracy. Busek's electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder spacecraft recently demonstrated precision control at nm scales; this work extends that success to CubeSat platforms. Passively fed electrospray thrusters are highly compact, including fully integrated propellant supplies, and are capable of ~100nN thrust at 10's of nN noise. Thrust can be throttled over >25x, to a scalable maximum of 10's of uN.  These traits, combined with >1200s Isp enable these systems to replace traditional reaction wheel ACS; improving pointing error from arcsecs to 10's of milliarcsec. This work addresses critical development gaps, in both thruster-heads and a multi-axis power processing unit with integrated firmware, presently gating the technology. Phase I will focus on establishing a baseline set of data and methodologies permitting detailed verification of the technology and definition of development gaps. The output of existing designs will be scaled to target ACS applicable performance in Task 1, culminating in assembly of two thrusters. A precisely measured performance map including thrust range, resolution and noise will be measured in Task 2 from both thruster heads. Those data will permit PPU system requirements to be defined and will feed development of control laws to be evaluated, in Task 3, using a hardware-in-the-loop precision pointing test apparatus. Electronics requirements will be assessed against existing single-axis architectures and new HV converter measurements in Task 4, along with identification of thruster head development needs; establishing a path towards a full system development in Phase II.","NASA's 2015 technology roadmap recognizes the importance of electrospray propulsion to attitude control, formation flight and positioning of small spacecraft. Specific applications benefiting from precision pointing include astronomical missions, planetary (including earth) observations, laser communications and space situational awareness. The greatly improved body pointing afforded by the proposed technology would present designers with previously unobtainable levels of stability and resolution; permitting both lower cost/complexity realization of existing needs and enabling new objectives in these fields. Applications benefiting from highly precise position control include formation flights and missions requiring disturbance free flight. This include drag-compensation enabling enhanced mission durations at low orbit altitudes below 350km. The proposed work would allow small spacecraft, CubeSats and larger, to benefit from precision control in a manner akin to the NASA Disturbance Reduction System (DRS), featuring Busek thrusters, aboard the LISA Pathfinder mission. Developing a highly featured PPU and controller would also enable other DRS sub-components, such as GSFC contributed control algorithms, to be applied over a wider NASA mission portfolio.  Moreover, through obviating the need for reaction wheels and their de-saturation RCS, the proposed work would decrease the size/complexity and therefore cost of missions.","Compact propulsion systems that are scalable in both thrust and deltaV without loss of performance are an enabling technology for CubeSat missions and therefore have numerous commercial applications.  Potential non-NASA customers include, international partners (such as ESA), the DoD and commercial EO missions. The modular nature of the proposed technology would enable customized applications that simultaneously meet customer needs in precision pointing and disturbance compensation; therefore, maximizing the commercial applicability of the technology. The virtual elimination of vibrational jitter while superseding reaction wheel precision presents a clear competitive advantage. The proposed system would be applicable to a myriad of CubeSat sizes from ~3U to >25kg; the market size is therefore large and includes rapidly growing platforms. Commercial applications may include optical communication alignment for high bandwidth up/downlinks or precision pointing during EO missions in low orbits. De-orbiting applications are particularly relevant to new LEO EO and telecommunication initiatives. International consensus is forming around the need for orbital debris management, which poses risks to functioning space assets. The proposed system could enable precision attitude control and a de-orbit means from a single integrated system; thus reducing the burden of integrating a de-orbit system.","Attitude Determination & Control; Command & Control; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Small Spacecraft Avionics and Control   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Like the original TRAC boom, T-TRAC has a triangular cross section that flattens and rolls around a spool for packaging.  Unlike TRAC, T-TRAC is applicable to much larger scale boom designs.  The proposed design will advance TRAC technology through: 1) scaling up the cross-section size and length of the boom, 2) light weighting the boom through material re-distribution and removal, and 3) cross-section modification for enhanced strength. Preliminary analyses indicate these steps will achieve more than a 5X increase in TRAC Boom structural mass efficiency over recently developed high performance composite TRAC Booms, while maintaining an extremely compact roll stowed configuration that maintains heritage with NASA's solar sail mechanical architecture lineage.The overarching Phase I objective is to conduct a preliminary design-analysis-fabrication-test loop for a T-TRAC boom capable of meeting requirements for NASA's future mid-sized solar sail mission.  Multi-scale micro-mechanics, laminate, cross-section, and full section analyses will be performed to quickly narrow the laminates and boom designs to a few candidates.  These efforts will necessarily be performed in close communication with material vendors to select a few laminates for short coupon testing prior to building proof-of-concept booms.  During Phase II, a four-boom T-TRAC solar sail system will be developed, and prototype units will be built and tested to establish performance for missions of interest to NASA.","* Mid-scale (~1,000m2) solar sails* Large-scale (>100kW) solar arrays for solar electric propulsion","* Commercial roll-out solar arrays (e.g., RAPDAR and ROSA)","Actuators & Motors; Characterization; Composites; Deployment; Polymers; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Structures",Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The valve is less than 3.5 inches long with a maximum width of 1 inch. It has been sized to flow 0.27 lbs/sec of LOX, sufficient to support either the LOX and LCH4 flow rates of a 100 lbf thruster. A piezo actuated valve has many benefits for RCS thrusters. The speed with which the valve can adjust its throttle position means that with two such valves the thruster propellant mixture ratio can be rapidly adjusted to prevent hardware damage. The valves have the ability to continuously throttle over a range of thrust levels, allowing the thruster to operate from zero to full thrust.  The piezo crystals use very little power, reducing the overall power consumption, again reducing weight.","Potential NASA applications include extremely durable, high-performance, low cost RCS systems for manned space flight to support high performance  propulsion requirements such as orbit transfer, descent, ascent and pulsing attitude control.","The piezo actuated valve and a control system that can make use of the valves high response rate to control propellant conditions to a thruster would make cryogenic RCS systems more viable and potentially reduce the system complexity.

Aviation loss of control (LOC) accidents often result from stall and uncertain weather/flow conditions, often at low altitudes e.g., take-off/landing. The sensor system: (1) uses a robust transduction mechanism, (2) has a one-time lifetime calibration requiring minimal maintenance, (3) provides monotonic output with speed and circulation, and is (4) relatively insensitive to environmental parameters such as flight altitude, pressure, temperature, and density. This technology provides real-time output for energy state awareness under both nominal and off-nominal flight conditions.","The benefits of a distributed aerodynamic force measurement system has a number of benefits: (1) addresses uncertainties in aerodynamics for safe envelope prediction, (2) increases controller robustness: reduces dependency on aerodynamic and structural uncertainties, (3) increases aerostructural efficiency, (4) enables mission persistence at a lower cost. For example, degradation due to atmospheric effects such as moisture and fatigue caused by constant wing stresses provides significant risk over the life of a HALE-type UAV, e.g., DARPA Vulture. Longevity of components is also a major technological risk. Using extremely high aspect ratios reduces drag. The system can utilize turbulence control for further aerodynamic efficiency.","The ability to cruise efficiently at a range of altitudes, enabled by a substantial increase in cruise lift-to- drag (L/D) ratios over today's high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, is vital, providing sustained presence and long range.

This project will develop and validate the Transition Airspace Resource Manager (TARM) concept. The goal of TARM is to increase the efficiency with which capacity-limited transition fixes connecting the enroute and terminal airspaces are used in both clear and disruptive weather conditions, by proactively suggesting reroutes to balance arrival and departure demand across available fixes, relative to capacity, and temporarily reallocating fixes between arrivals and departures when extreme demand or weather conditions warrant.  TARM uses stochastic weather and capacity forecasts.  The TARM concept represents an important step toward Trajectory Based Operations by integrating a traffic management decision with individual flight trajectories, and applying a TBO paradigm in which arrival and departure flights are separated by trajectory rather than procedural airspace regions.","The proposed SBIR will complete work that is highly beneficial to NASA by being directly relevant to future NASA Integrated Arrival Departure Surface (IADS) research, without overlapping ongoing work. NASA has contributed remarkable advances in arrival and departure traffic management technologies. NASA's advanced arrival management technologies, Terminal Sequencing and Spacing (TSAS) and Flight Deck Interval Management (FIM), assume aircraft fix assignments are known.  Similarly, NASA's ATD-2 departure management research, based on NASA's previous PDRC and TDS technology, assumes the fixes as well as the assignments of flights to those fixes are static. The TARM concept addresses an opportunity to reallocate fixes and reassign flights to available fixes prior to NASA's existing arrival and departure solutions scheduling flights.  In this way, this TARM research could be applied to extend NASA's current IADS work, delivering the next generation of IADS capabilities into the NASA-FAA ATM technology pipeline.","The primary application for this work beyond advancing NASA's IADS research goals is with the FAA.  Our goal is for NASA to transfer a validated concept and TARM prototype to the FAA so that the capability may be included in future TBFM and TFDM releases.  The operational need is substantial and current method - manual intervention by controllers - is inconsistent and reactive, not providing the possible benefits. The TARM capability is needed and wanted by the FAA.  TARM's ability to efficiently update trajectory assignments through transition airspace based on current conditions will also prove essential under TBO. Mosaic ATM is also considering offering a cloud-hosted, service-based product to flight operators.  The service would forecast fix capacities and demand, and advise when a re-route using an alternate fix would be beneficial to that flight, or to the operator if the operator represents the majority of the demand at the fix.",Air Transportation & Safety; Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling,Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The first major step of any Mars in-situ propellant production system is the acquisition of carbon dioxide and its compression for further processing.  TDA Research Inc. proposes to develop a compact, lightweight, advanced sorbent-based compressor to recover high-pressure, high purity CO2 from the Martian atmosphere. The system eliminates the need for a mechanical pump, increasing the reliability with relatively low power consumption. TDA?s system uses a new, high capacity sorbent that selectively adsorbs CO2 at 0.1 psia and regenerates by temperature swing, producing a continuous, high purity CO2 flow at pressure (> 15 psia).In the Phase I work, we successfully completed bench-scale proof-of-concept demonstrations, elevating the TRL to 3. In Phase II, we will further optimize the sorbent and scale-up its production using advanced manufacturing techniques such as continuous microwave synthesis.  We will carry out multiple adsorption/desorption cycles to demonstrate the sorbent's cycle life.  Finally, we will design and fabricate a sub-scale prototype to fully demonstrate the technology under simulated Martian atmospheres (TRL-5); this unit will be sent to NASA for further testing and evaluation.","The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact and energy efficient adsorbent based solid-state CO2 compressor system to collect and pressurize CO2 from the Martian atmosphere.

The solution will utilize habitat's real-time system health assessment, anomaly and failure detection, machine learning and active learning techniques to preserve the operational integrity of the habitat system. The proposed effort will result in a novel capability, where the habitat crew will be given clear and concise decision support to improve situational awareness and perform proactive corrective actions. Automated health assessment, crew alerts and future degradation estimates will be generated to facilitate corrective actions in the face of off-nominal and failure conditions. Additionallly, mechanisms to incorporate undiscovered anomalies into the machine learning algorithms will be pursued. The ISHM solution would reduce the cognitive load on the crew given the abundance of information that has to be reasoned upon in a timely fashion. They will be critical for improving mission and system safety. These technologies would reduce the cost and risk of habitat operations, across all its phases: development, flight unit production, launch, and operations.","NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy in its earth and space missions makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. The proposed technology, aimed at improving the reliability and performance of sustainable habitats through the use of diagnostic and prognostic failure and anomaly detection techniques, active learning and trending capabilities, and the software tool for supporting its implementation will allow NASA to better plan and execute future Science Missions. The technology can be leveraged to facilitate endurance in complex systems, such as NASA's long-duration missions in space science and exploration. It is envisioned that the technology will also be ready to be operated as part of NASA's next generation Mission Control Technology allowing NASA to utilize the continuous health assessment and mission satisfiability information from the tool for improved mission execution while improving safety, mission success probability and the overall operational uptime of the habitat platform. This technology can also be applied to NASA's Earth based green initiatives such as the Sustainable Habitat designed for self-sustainment. The application of this technology in habitat systems will enable the next frontier in exploration by providing greater access to deep space environments and by providing greater operational handling that extends mission capabilities.","The application of habitats in government, industrial, and commercial applications makes them an obvious commercialization target for this technology. We envisage the proposed technology to be of significant interest inside DoD's Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), FAA, US Air Force, US Navy, and commercial space vendors (e.g., Boeing, SpaceX).

As software development is a major cost driver for missions, this increased complexity has the potential to significantly increase cost for future missions. To address this risk, Troxel Aerospace Industries, Inc. proposes to develop a robust middleware management technology for spacecraft-focused multicore/co-processor architectures.

The significant improvement in multicore radiation tolerance and co-processor support derived from the successful development of this SBIR effort is of significant interest for all space customers. The Phase I, Phase II, and commercialization plan outlined in this proposal is achievable, has a low risk profile, significantly improves onboard processing capability currently required by multiple NASA missions, and has a clear path to commercialization and acceptance into missions through direct use by programs and infusion via processor vendors who supply to NASA programs. A smooth commercialization path is guaranteed by collaborating with future government and industry customers (i.e. primes and processor vendors) early in Phase I and throughout Phase II to ensure the technology's relevance to their products. The processor-agnostic design of the proposed middleware increases its commercialization potential by being applicable to all processor vendor's present and future technology.","Non-government commercial space customers in all markets will be able to directly benefit from the technology including telecommunications, commercial imagery, launch vehicles, ISS re-service vehicles and exo-planetary commercial ventures (e.g. asteroid mining). Also, non-space markets that require robust fault tolerance from high-performance heterogeneous multicore/co-processor architectures will also be served by the middleware including: radiation test facilities, medical radiation therapy facilities, and other critical performance markets where people's lives or expensive equipment is at risk such as aircraft, automobile, public transportation, and advanced manufacturing where the same processors targeted by the proposed effort are already deployed.

However, these conventional materials will be unable to push the low-temperature operation limit to meet NASA's requirements for Ocean Worlds missions.South 8 Technologies proposes the use of ""Liquefied Gas Catholytes for Ultra-Low Temperature Lithium Primary Batteries"". These catholytes are gaseous under standard conditions, but may be liquefied under mild pressures, showing exceptionally low melting points, very low viscosities and relatively high dielectric constants, allowing for ultra-low temperature operation of Lithium Primary Batteries. South 8 Technologies believes the technology proposed will enable energy storage at temperatures as low as -140 C, whereas the state-of-art allows operation is limited to -80 C. High temperature operation will be similar with operation limited to about +60 C. Further, the energy density of the active cathode material may be increased by as much as 30%, as will be shown. Voltage delay, a reoccurring issue in lithium primary batteries, may be reduced as well. These items will be discussed throughout the proposal.","This SBIR proposal will focus on demonstration of the feasibility of developing Liquefied Gas Catholytes for Ultra-Low Lithium Primary Batteries.

These algorithms include predictive health monitoring, life based management, physics based cell modelling.  Batteries can last longer, avoid thermal runaway, and avoid maintenance.  EPS is proposing development of an active BMS concept, with associated algorithms to achieve a 40% life improvement on the X57 pack.","This project is targeted for NASA's X-planes with lithium based energy storage systems. The X57 Maxwell is the target application, however, other X-planes, as well as Space applications may re-use the research to extend pack life, and avoid unpredicted Thermal Events.  Vertical Take off & Lift working groups studying air taxi transportation.","All commercial aviation applications with a lithium ion battery have the ability to benefit from this research.  No deployed Li-Ion battery system in Aviation today has an active topology.  This is due to the stringent FAA DO311 requirements which require designers to show that their systems can meet a 1E-9 probability requirement of failed condition occurring such as overcharge.  This is achieved through redundancy and the elimination of single point failures. With charge current being transferred from cell to cell, no one has achieved a cost effective design that meets the 1e-9 requirement. If the TRL is advanced on such a topology, the economics of lithium becomes much more compelling given the much improved cycle life.Other key markets who could benefit from Research would be the Air Taxi Manufacturers.  Much of their business model is based on the economic properties of the battery.  Right now cell manufacturers who are achieving the energy density targets for the application are no where near the cycle life requirement to make this market viable.  This technology fills a critical gap in both cycle life and certification aspects.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Distribution/Management; Simulation & Modeling; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Storage",Flight Test and Measurements Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Our approach, with the development of the high performance DBR laser diode and the engineering of compact integration technology, will provide narrow linewidth and high power laser modules for numerous Lidar applications with the advantages of reduced size, weight and power (SWaP). Under this Phase I SBIR we propose to design and fabrication the EPI material and the DBR lasers with a high gain compressive-strained single quantum well (QW) structure, based on Photodigm's proprietary single growth epi, precision gain ridges, and monolithic grating process. We would develop an integrated module that is optically isolated and fiber coupled by investigating the custom build optical isolators of the operating wavelength and designing a compact, hermetic package to achieve high reliability and manufacturability.  Continuing device engineering such as extended mode hop mounting, micro lens beam shaping and package space qualification are expected to be incorporated with this device family under Phase II of this SBIR program.","With the development of high precision 935nm DBR laser diode and matching isolator, NASA's primary application for the proposed compact integration laser module would be the deployment in the air-borne DIAL sensor networks to map atmospheric water vapor with high spatial and temporal resolution. This application is well aligned with the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) instrument development program objective through the implement of smaller and more affordable DIAL transmitters. The compact integration technology applies to the full spectrum of the GaAs material based DBR lasers that Photodigm offers, leading to potential applications in sensing of ozone and other trace gasses.","The proposed integrated laser module would be the most compact and high power DBR laser with embedded optics available in the market. The optical integration concept complements the Photodigm family of DBR laser packages in the 850 to 1000nm range with isolated fiber coupled solution. It is also a high power package alternative to the broader 760 to 1100nm wavelength range devices. In addition to NASA's use in a number of LIDAR systems, a narrow linewidth and high power laser module finds applications in various areas of spectroscopy, atomic physics, non-linear optics, and fiber amplifiers. The high spectral stability is desirable in applications resolving hyperfine structures and applications demanding long coherent length.

The gain and performance of any reflector is a function of the diameter.  Higher communication data rates, longer transmission distances, increased sensor capacity for active radar and radiometers are all directly related to aperture size.  The challenge is being able to achieve these larger apertures and still have the packaging efficiency to enable more cost effective small satellites.  Tendeg has designed, fabricated and surface tested a 1m aperture Ka-band reflector that is able to package into a 3U cubesat volume.  The unique design allows 100:1 area compaction ratios yet the deployed antenna is achieving the surface precision needed for Ka-band operations.  Scaling to larger apertures will require a new rib design.  Trade studies will consider multiple cross sections, materials and fabrication methods.  One configuration is the mini-CTM under development at Langley Research Center.  Detailed design will be completed to optimize the integration of each potential rib configuration.  Finite element analysis will determine stiffness during deployment and deployed buckling capacity.  Testing of a mini-CTM will be done to determine packaging and buckling performance.  At the completion of the program a down selected design will be proposed for a Phase II prototype program.","NASA commercial applications include any Ka-Band 2-4m aperture antennas used for Earth observing science missions (RainCube radar), deep space communications, and any mission needing high data rate downlinks.","There is strong market potential in CubeSat up to smallsat size satellites in the commercial arena.

Southwest Sciences, in collaboration with the Southwest Research Institute, proposes to develop a novel, non-intrusive, laser-based measurement system for characterizing and calibrating the flow conditions upstream and downstream of test articles in wind tunnels.  It uses inexpensive visible diode lasers and could be configured to match the needs of any particular type of wind tunnel, ranging from subsonic to hypersonic.

Improved 2nd generation magnesium diboride (MgB2) superconducting wires potentially provide an order-of-magnitude enhancement in current carrying capacity, and offer many advantages in materials, technological, and engineering aspects over wires based on current state-of-the-art MgB2 and all other classes of superconductors. These proposed wires will be light-weight, low-cost, and have high engineering current density, operating temperatures of 4-30K, and long piece-length, potentially up to 60 km.

LignaMed aims to evaluate LGM2605 as a mitigator of space-radiation induced vascular damage. NASA missions to Mars will expose astronauts to solar and galactic cosmic mixed radiation including low dose γ and proton radiation, but data is lacking on the biological and physiological effects in humans of this mixed source radiation. Research on space radiation effects on cellular systems, molecular targets and ultimately organ systems has identified potential harmful short and long-term effects on the health of astronauts. Work at the University of Pennsylvania identified damage to lungs years after a single exposure to low-dose gamma, 56Fe, 28Si and proton radiation exposure in mice. Acute and chronic radiation effects in organs are closely associated with vascular damage and dysfunction. Multiple studies have confirmed single source radiation side effects associated with significant loss of vascular integrity: increased vascular leakiness (edema), an activated inflammatory phenotype and extensive oxidative damage. However, damage to the vascular network under multiple radiation types simultaneously is not understood. LignaMed will employ gene knockout technology in vascular models exposed to space-relevant mixed radiation regimens to investigate the injury to the vasculature. We hypothesize that LGM2605 will mitigate space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that cause inflammation. This study will confirm that 1) space radiation drives endovascular damage via activation of the endothelial inflammatory phenotype resulting in increased permeability and 2) will validate LGM2605 as an effective mitigator of space radiation-induced vascular damage by inhibiting early events that drive long term adverse sequellae.","LignaMed, LLC is a drug development company with a fast track strategy to approval of LGM2605, an oral small molecule for use as a radiation mitigating agent that reduces harmful effects of radiation exposure of normal tissues.

Manned missions to Mars will expose astronauts to solar and galactic cosmic radiation in the form of low dose γ radiation as well as high dose protons from solar particle events (2-4). A mixed radiation environment is unique to space and does not exist on earth and there is a lack of data on space radiation induced biological effects and thus inadequate resources of countermeasures (5). We propose to identify the pathways that lead to injury and damage from space radiation. Inflammation is one of the earliest triggers for tissue damage and an underlying cause of several pathologies including radiation induced diseases. The vasculature is an initiating and converging site of inflammation which is followed by extravasation into tissue and tissue injury.  Although radiation-induced damage is largely in the form of circulatory problems, vascular damage in response to space radiation in particular, has never been investigated and due to its unique mechanism, LGM2605 has the potential to mitigate these negative effects of space travel related radiation.","Lignamed LLC is a biopharmaceutical company developing LGM-2605 as adjunct therapy to reduce side effects and improve cure rates of radiation treatment of chest cancers.

According to the American Cancer Society, more than 500,000 new chest cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2014 and they project the number to increase in the years ahead. About 50 to 60 percent of cancer patients are treated with radiation at some time during their disease. Combinations of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments are the standard for modern cancer therapy.  Success is often determined by the ability of patients to tolerate the most aggressive regimen. The ability to deliver effective radiation therapy is limited by toxic side effects to healthy normal lung tissues. These side effects often cause breaks in treatment or dose-limiting toxicity after treatment, and, therefore, limit the amount of radiation that can be delivered to the tumor. No current therapies are effective to protect healthy normal lung tissue from the damaging effects of radiotherapy.

Space-based x-ray telescopes currently involve the use of a PC to shield the optics from stray light. Each PC requires extensive build time from highly skilled technicians. The PC cylindrical aluminum ribs (or blades) are individually attached to alignment frames. This hands-on ""place/weld/measure and repeat"" process is ineffective for the thousands of ribs. Build times have exceeded a year, and sometimes the PC still failed to perform. Some telescopes scrap the PC early to avoid these complications and accept the limitations in performance.  Eliminating the hands-on time with CNC unattended wire EDM automates the build, but can't reach the thin walls required. Chemical milling of this large, complex structure is an innovation which will bring fast and affordable PC to market.   Current chemical milling uses HF and HNO3 acids to etch thin films of Titanium. However, etching is traditionally done on thin sheets. Mindrum Precision process will investigate etching of this complex material.

In many cases the requirements for gearbox lubrication, maintenance/overhaul and service life limits are acceptable; but in some extreme applications these requirements become a severe performance limitation.  For example, high altitude long endurance missions (HALE) typically operate at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet and stay in flight for durations longer than 24 hours.

We are proposing to develop a magnetic gearbox technology that can meet the needs of these extreme applications.A magnetic gearbox has many advantages over a traditional mechanical gearbox. The different rotating components in the magnetic gearbox will never touch so the only lubrication required is in the bearing systems.  The magnetic gearbox will be essentially maintenance-free except for periodic bearing lubrication/inspection.  Vibrations that do not exceed the pull-out torque of the magnetic teeth do not add measurably to the mechanical stresses in the magnetic gearbox so fatigue issues will be minimal.

In the case of future human spaceflight programs involving deep space missions, the ground operations infrastructure currently utilized for support of LEO missions will be less accessible or unavailable. This will place far higher emphasis on the importance of automated and intelligent tools for tasking, advising, and monitoring autonomous crew activity.  Augmented Reality systems will play a key role in achieving crew autonomy. With this fusion of real and virtual perception, however, comes challenges to ensure that the information is presented in a way that the user can effective consume it meet the goals of the situation.The proposed innovation is a configurable and extensible Augmented Reality Adaptable Information Manager (AR-AIM) that provides an infrastructure for integration of disparate sensor inputs, task definitions, consideration factors, prioritization algorithms, and output modalities to achieve adaptive augmented reality.  Specifically, it will include a diverse combination of capabilities needed to make user interfaces that dynamically change to increase user precision and reduce stress on the user caused by the system. By being implemented as a reusable library, the AR-AIM controller suite can be leveraged across many systems, use cases, and domains.  Features will include:- FOV Management- Occlusion Engine - Optimal Text Placement - Complexity Scaling - Multiple Modality Support - Data Interfaces - User Contextual Adaptations- Stress predictor - Multi-user Integration","METECS sees opportunity to infuse this technology into existing and new projects within NASA.  Model-based Simulations - The simulation and graphics branch of SRSD at Johnson Space Center develops a variety of analytical and human-in-the-loop model-based simulations for training, analysis and mission development purposes. Additionally, METECS sees benefit in applying the techniques used in our commercial simulation projects to NASA simulation projects and the development of the adaptive AR capability described in this SBIR would support that.Avionics Integration Facilities and mREST - METECS is involved in orchestration of several avionics integration facilities.  One of our main contributions in that area is the orchestration infrastructure mREST.  This software collects data from disparate test equipment and model-based simulations to enable data fusion and incorporation of data from multiple sources for integrated control and display. Because the underlying technology of the software is web-services based, this information is typically (but not always) displayed in a web-browser on fixed desktop computers or laptops.Logistics Management - METECS is a member of the RFID-Enabled Autonomous Logistics Management (REALM) team.  We believe there are both short and long term opportunities for METECS to infuse this technology into our work in those areas.","An immediate application of this technology will be to support our ongoing VR and AR based initiatives in the construction and agricultural industries.

Supported via simple architectural features are highly prioritized Mars application objectives including modular or single large-unit use, self-cleaning and dust abutment, easy operation including tilt, transportability, robust tolerance for thermal and dimensional perturbations, and retractability.  Integration with space transport systems is achieved via toroidal storage that can be designed to encircle any, large or small, core equipment such as a lander or habitat unit or a transportable power module, and seamlessly fits into launch vehicle payload envelopes.  Similar to the recently developed wrapped array concept, rolled in the belt package are support ribs with the surface sectors folded between them; the PV cells are mounted on the latter.  (The ribs concurrently emerge from the package straight and, diverging outward, unfold the sheet sectors.)  When deployed, the PV strips, with gentle cross-slopes, are suspended from the ribs with a sagging/slack cable system that renders the design environmentally robust and permits self-cleaning via the wind effects themselves.  Rib strength is boosted by cable support, analogous to mature crane jib support technology.","Large PV power supplies or power supply modules for extraterrestrial surface missions such as those on the Moon and Mars, including but not limited to initial manned Mars missions where PV array modules of up to 2500 m2 total area (or a single array of that size) need to be prepositioned, validated, and operated prior to human landings.  The proposed concept's application is technologically robust and operationally flexible.  Technological robustness arises from simple mechanics and a ""slack"" design that is inherently insensitive to environmental and dimensional perturbations (including extreme thermal fluctuation) and offers a self-cleaning mechanism in environments where some atmosphere and winds are present and dust accumulation is a risk.  Operational flexibility means applicability both in large units and small, transportable packages.","The concept may mature into spinoff technology for Earth PV array applications with the need for autonomous and rapid deployability, re-deployability, and compact packaging.

David Green,green@qpeak.com,"135 South Road, Bedford, MA 01730 - 2307",(978) 689-0003,3,5,"In response to the development of components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life in the Ocean Worlds, Q-Peak proposes to develop a compact, robust, efficient, and radiation hardened UV laser capable of detecting organic molecules by means of the laser desorption technique. When slightly modified, the laser can be used to advance the development of instruments suitable for deployment on in-situ planetary and lunar missions such as ExoMars and Mars 2020 to analyze mineral composition of rock samples by performing imaging/Laser-Raman/Laser-Induced-Breakdown spectroscopies. The advantage in using these techniques for planetary science is the ability to rapidly collect a wealth of chemical information, by directing a laser beam on target of interest.In Phase I, Q-Peak proposes the development of an ultra-compact, passively Q-switched laser, < 10 cm3 in volume that will produce 0.1-0.3 mJ energy, < 2 ns, 266-nm pulses at 5 kHz repetition rates. This laser will be designed to survive shock, vibration, thermal cycling, and radiation.In order to make a very compact laser, Q Peak will use diode pumped solid state laser technology to produce 1-2 mJ of energy at 1064 nm using a Cr4+:YAG saturable absorber as the passive Q-switch to eliminate the need for a high voltage supply which is required for actively Q-switched lasers. The output of the laser will be frequency converted in two stages to produce 266 nm via nonlinear crystals specifically selected to survive a high radiation environment.  Compact electronics will also be designed from radiation hardened components.   In Phase II program, specially designed optical components will be procured to make the laser very compact and alignment insensitive; for example, bonded nonlinear crystals to minimize wavelength walk-off and maximize nonlinear conversion efficiency. The laser will be subjected to representative environmental condition to bring the TRL to 6.","Besides being useful for detecting present and past life in extra-terrestrial environments, the laser can be used, especially with its small foot print, on the lander/orbiter to provide ranging and imaging for autonomous landing and precision rendezvous to other satellites.NASA remote sensing and LiDAR applications require compact, efficient, reliable, moderate-energy, nanosecond-pulsed lasers. These missions require improved precision technology compared with previously flown LiDAR technologies as well as greatly reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) given the resource-constrained class of missions likely to use this capability. Missions to solar system bodies must meet increasingly ambitious objectives requiring highly reliable soft and precision landing, hazard avoidance, topography mapping, autonomous rendezvous to other satellites, etc. Robotic missions to the Moon and Mars demand landing at pre-designated sites of high scientific value near hazardous terrain features, such as escarpments, craters, slopes, and rocks.Given the high sensitivity of launch requirements to SWaP considerations and to reliability, we feel that the proposed laser source is uniquely positioned for elemental analysis as well as LiDAR remote sensing and autonomous landing based missions. Other NASA mission profiles or applications that would benefit from generically small, light-weight, low power laser sources would be equally well served.","When a nonlinear crystal that generates UV light is removed, the ultra-compact laser source can produce wavelengths of 1 um or 0.5 um which find applications in lidar to map and image objects; a narrow laser-beam can map physical features with very high resolution. It can target a wide range of materials, including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols, clouds, and even single molecules. In particular, the 0.5-um wavelength penetrates water easily and is useful for bathymetry measurements in shallow water. The proposed laser can be used in the automotive safety and navigation, geography, law enforcement, meteorology, mining, robotics, and wind farm markets.The proposed UV source at 266nm would have applications for the military for imaging through smoke, dust, smog, and brownouts. Very small form-factor UV source designs may also offer opportunity for free space communication. Other applications are in mass and Raman spectroscopy, the food and drug industry, material processing, ultraviolet curing, photolithography, medical services, spectral analysis, scientific research, disinfection, decontamination of surfaces and water, protein analysis, DNA sequencing, (DNA absorption has a peak at 260nm), forensic analysis and more.With slight modification the laser can generate eye safe wavelengths. The Department of Defense has a constant need to advance the state of the art in the soldier-carried range finders that operate in eye safe wavelengths.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Characterization; Lasers (Machining/Materials Processing); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Minerals; Prototyping; Ultraviolet",In Situ Instruments/Technologies for Ocean Worlds Life Detection   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Chemically-based actuation is capable of producing high-impulse jets with sufficient control authority for full-scale flight vehicles and speeds, and, compared to other pulsed blowing flow control schemes, this type of actuation inherently requires less energy from other flight systems as the energy used to create the high jet momentum is stored chemically within the propellant.  This general actuation approach has been successfully demonstrated before in the form of COMPACT (in which gaseous fuel and air are repetitively combusted to form pulsed jets for control of separation) and gas generator actuators (in which microfabricated combustion chambers with solid propellant mixtures are utilized for single-shot trajectory control of spin-stabilized projectiles).The innovation proposed here (in which flowable propellant is dynamically supplied to the chambers from an integrated local reservoir) will eliminate the challenges and infrastructure associated with supplying large volumes of air which are necessary for most pulsed blowing approaches and, to a lesser extent, for COMPACT. The proposed Phase I program will investigate multiple propellant chemical compositions, mechanisms for delivering the fuel and oxidizer compounds to the actuator chamber, and methodology for successful repetitive initiation of the chemical reaction within the chamber.  A benchtop prototype with repetitive firing will be demonstrated at the end of the Phase I program.  A prospective Phase II follow-on program will proceed to develop and demonstrate large arrays of these actuators and perform wind tunnel demonstrations of their utility for active flow control.","Active flow control can have a wide range of applications for modifying and improving aerodynamic properties on fixed and rotary wing flight platforms.  Successful implementations can yield reductions in the size of physical control surfaces on fixed wing aircraft with resultant improvements in weight and drag, and subsequently reduced fuel consumption.  Similar improvements in fuel economy may also be envisioned with separation control and drag reduction applied to the fuselage or external stores of rotorcraft.  Active flow control can also enable improved performance at off-design conditions with subsequent extensions of the flight envelope (e.g., short takeoff and landing for fixed wing aircraft and suppression of retreating blade stall for rotorcraft). Actuators with high control authority and minimized infrastructure and energy requirements will be vital to practical implementation of all of these applications and may enable shock manipulation control strategies at even higher flight speeds.","The benefits of aerodynamic flow control as described above for NASA applications will extend broadly to the commercial and military aerospace industry. In addition to external flow control applications for increased lift and reduced drag (with subsequently improved fuel economy and potential extensions of the flight envelope), active control of separation for internal flows is also of interest, including at serpentine engine inlets and even within gas turbines.",Aerodynamics,Aerodynamic Efficiency-Active Flow Control Actuators and Design Tools   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Human Space program has relied on procedures to operate efficiently and safely any spacecraft systems since its inception. Over the past few years, efforts to enhance these procedures using Augmented Reality has demonstrated the possibility to increase crew autonomy from ground support by providing improved guidance and just in time training. Many challenges persist in the following areas: difficult and time consuming development of the AR material, a range of potential AR hardware devices and software platforms to deploy on, and limited flexibility of the User Interface causing underwhelming user experience. Tietronix proposes to develop a toolset that will support the development of robust and adaptive user interface for the electronic procedures that leverages the power of AR technology. The envisioned toolset combines an authoring environment that enables the user to create electronic procedures with adaptive user interfaces which are dependent on their context of-use defined in terms of the user, platform, and environment. The UI can adapt to multiple elements such as the context in which the procedure is executed (workload, stressful conditions), the user skill level, the deployment platform (AR headset type, VR environment, tablet, phone), the type of cues to be provided. The use of this toolset will enable procedure developers to provide to operators enhanced situational awareness during the execution of the procedures by overlaying additional information such as instructions or graphical cues on top of the target system views, and auditory or tactile inputs. The proposed integrated suite of tools will provide critical technologies needed to develop adaptive UI for AR enabled electronic procedures, and execute these within the context of NASA space program.","The proposed AUI/AR-eProc toolset can be applied to a large set of NASA programs and tasks. NASA's vision to support human spaceflight missions beyond Low Earth Orbit will require game changing operational toolsets for training and assistance for maintenance operations. With time delays and potentially sparse communications back to earth, astronauts will face the daunting task of operating and maintaining numerous systems that might unexpectedly fail or may even be required to perform life-saving surgery without support from the earth based operators. Currently, complex assembly and maintenance tasks on-board the International Space Station are good targets for the AR-enabled electronic procedures that our proposed toolset will help create. The Autonomous Mission Operations project is interested in the use of Augmented Reality technology. The Cis-Lunar NextSTEP program is exploring the potential use of multiple advanced technologies. Our working relationship with these programs will enable us to assess the infusion of our proposed concept within these projects.","Complex Assembly and Maintenance tasks in industrial environments are excellent target domains for Augmented Reality electronic Procedures.

The software will facilitate the identification of optimal types of actuation and their locations, will support virtual flight testing with both open- and closed-loop control systems, and will enable quantitative trade studies that compare performance enhancements through AFC to the costs of control.  In subsonic, transonic, and supersonic applications, AFC systems can improve air vehicle performance by reducing and/or eliminating separation and increasing circulation---resulting in smaller control surfaces, less weight, lower drag, and less fuel consumption.  Many AFC applications involve highly unsteady flow dynamics with turbulence, unsteady shocks, separation, and aeroservoelasticity interacting in complex ways that render open-loop systems either ineffective or too costly in terms of energy, weight, and volume.  For this reason, closed-loop AFC system design will be a critical area of focus in the proposed project.  Components of closed-loop systems include dynamical and measurement-based state estimators, regulators, and compensators.  The proposed AFC system design and analysis software will be developed using the X-56 experimental aircraft as a demonstration platform, a long-range, highly flexible air vehicle currently under development at the NASA Armstrong Flight Test Center.","The proposed AFC design and system integration software, using the X-56 as a demonstration platform, targets key aspects of the NASA ARMD Strategic Thrust 3A: Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles Subsonic Transport. The scope of the thrust covers fixed wing commercial vehicles carrying passengers and cargo in both civil and military capacities. The objective is pioneering technologies for big leaps in efficiency and environmental performance: environmental compatibility while reducing cost, increasing range, and maintaining safety. The technology is also an enabler for NASA ARMD's Strategic Thrust 2: Innovation in Commercial Supersonic Aircraft. The targeted ""ultra-efficient"" vehicles will use less energy with less emissions and lower perceived noise.  The centerpiece of NASA's 10-year acceleration for advanced technologies testing is New Aviation Horizons (NAH), consisting of a suite of future X-planes that include hybrid electric, wing-body, and quiet supersonic demonstrators. These constitute potential Phase III applications through direct contracts with NASA and through collaborations with its industry and university partners.","Clear Science Corp.'s AFC software is enabling technology with applications, first, inside NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD) during development of new ultra-efficient, subsonic air vehicles, and, second, among aircraft manufacturers as these vehicles reach the commercial market.  The proposed project will focus on the experimental X-56 program with much broader potential applications relating to active flow control.  These include flutter suppression and gust load alleviation in other types of subsonic, highly flexible airframes, aerodynamic, aeroelastic, and aeroservoelastic flow control in highly maneuverable fighter aircraft operating in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes (with shocks and shock-boundary layer interactions), aerodynamic and aero-optical flow control in fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and aerothermodynamic flow control in hypersonic air vehicles.  The AFC technology to be developed in the proposed project and demonstrated with the subsonic X-56 is directly applicable to higher-speed air vehicles.

STFs are currently being developed by NASA and STF Technologies LLC for use in enhanced puncture and MMOD protective softgoods to improve astronaut survivability.  Here, we propose to exploit the unique energy-absorbing properties of shear thickening fluids and prior work by the team, which developed advanced energy absorbing STF materials for sports and military applications, to meet the challenge metrics of a pressure structure composite capable of withstanding 300J of energy in low velocity impact with a structural density of 1.7 g/cm3 or less and thickness of 0.125"" or less. The proposed work will combine experiments and modeling to determine the optimal integration of STF with the current best composite materials in the Z-2 suit prototype.  The project will leverage the Z-2 suit specific expertise of our partners at UD's Center for Composite Materials (UD-CCM) to develop and test concepts and advance the TRL of new lightweight, damage-tolerant and potentially self-healing hybrid composites. The conformable nature of the STF is amenable to fabrication of complex curved geometries, while the flowable STF within the hybrid laminate can offer healing and leak mitigation after damage.  Rapid prototyping, downselection, and validation will be performed in collaboration with UD-CCM, commercialization partners, and NASA scientists and engineers through a combined computational/experimental program with feedback refinement that exploits the unique expertise of all teams.","The proposed advanced hybrid STF composites are of value for a range of space and ground-based applications. NASA commercial applications of the STF composites include use in the hard upper torso (HUT) of advanced exploration suits. Impact-resistant, damage-tolerant STF hybrid composite materials are directly applicable to the development of a planetary exploration suit (Z-2) that can withstand a variety of operational mishaps, including falling onto rocks or other accidental impact.  Additional NASA applications could include use as advanced composites to improve the durability and damage tolerance of storage tanks on vehicles or surface habitats, vehicle components, helmets, or other hard components that can benefit from the combination of lightweight, impact-resistance with the potential leak mitigation mode provided by STF.","The growing market for carbon fiber and fiberglass composites represents a substantial market opportunity for STF composite materials offering improved impact resistance and damage tolerance.

HISS will quickly detect and locate leaks based on their acoustic emissions or other signature.  It will provide prompt warnings to flight and ground personnel in order to help save the vehicle (and mission).  It will also complement the present Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) capabilities by providing leak location as well as warning of the leak up to several minutes before the ECLSS.  The primary transducers with which HISS interfaces are acoustic emissions.  However, Invocon plans to design HISS so that it will interface with other types of sensors in order to maximize its usefulness.  This will allow HISS to be used for many other flight and ground monitoring applications.","The initial NASA application for HISS is to monitor the International Space Station (ISS) for leaks. HISS will also be simple to adapt to other structural monitoring requirements that will develop as the ISS ages.  This is analogous to the significant increase in monitoring aboard the Space Shuttle as it aged. The experience NASA gains with HISS aboard the ISS will be directly applicable to new manned spacecraft such as Orion that are designed for deep space missions. HISS can monitor the Thermal Protection System (TPS) and other portions of these vehicles to ensure safety during final entry, descent, and landing. NASA can also apply HISS to other flight and ground applications such as monitoring pressure vessels, tanks, aircraft, structures, and test facilities.","Many Non-NASA applications are similar to NASA's applications for the technology.  They include flight and ground testing of aerospace vehicles as well as long-term monitoring during actual missions.  They also include monitoring pressure vessels, tanks, aeronautical vehicles, ground vehicles and terrestrial structures. The adaptable, smart, and connected nature of HISS will enable it to be adapted to many applications with minimal engineering, installation, and maintenance costs. Perhaps the most pressing need for HISS is aboard the commercial crew vehicles being developed in order to ensure the integrity of the Thermal Protection System (TPS) that is needed to protect astronauts during their final entry, descent, and landing.","Acoustic/Vibration; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Processing; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)",NDE Sensors   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Highly autonomous, long-range coherent lidar systems may suffer significant SNR loss due to environment-induced component misalignment.  Although systems can be engineered with the required alignment stability, the overall size, mass, and cost to produce coherent lidar systems will benefit from incorporating technology into the design that allows alignment to be optimized automatically while the system is in the field.  This will especially benefit autonomous airborne and space based lidar systems where maintaining peak performance is critical without regular human intervention.  Auto-alignment technologies will result in lower-cost sensors with greater autonomy and less-exotic mechanical engineering, resulting in high commercial potential due to the rapid introduction of lidar systems into the commercial marketplace for various applications.  The technology aimed at maintaining laser and lidar alignment also has potential to correct for receiver lag angle in scanning lidar systems, which will facilitate faster scan rates, larger apertures, and greater area coverage rate capability.  Beyond Photonics has a strong interest in solving these technological problems for relevant ground-based, airborne, and space-based unattended lidar systems.  This Phase I effort will investigate auto-alignment designs exhibiting a high level of synergy between NASA's and other commercial vendor?s requirements for laser auto-alignment, transmit/receive transceiver auto-alignment, and lag angle compensation.","Potential NASA applications for the lower-cost, higher-reliability autonomous laser and lidar alignment technology include the existing NASA LaRC DAWN lidar system (which currently suffers from thermally-induced environmental system misalignment that would readily be addressed by this technology with very low impact on existing architecture) and future generations of this wind measurement lidar system. The technology can be easily extended to other wavelengths (e.g. 1.55-1.6 um), which could directly benefit NASA programs aimed at atmospheric CO2 or CH4 measurement using lidar systems and other laser remote sensing efforts where long-duration unattended operation is key.  Space-based applications are of particular interest.","Potential non-NASA, commercial applications for the lower-cost, higher reliability autonomous coherent laser radar sensors that would be realized from the proposed work include, use of such systems in wind energy management and site location applications; at airports for detection of hazardous aircraft wake vortices and wind shear, increasing airport operating efficiency; hard-target sensing, identification, and imaging applications.

However, the full potential of Type-II superlattice has not been fully explored and alternate superlattice architectures hold great promise. Despite demonstration of SWIR photodetectors based on this material system, there has been no report about Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors that have been sensitive to visible light. We propose to develop Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors and focal plane arrays for NASA's imaging and spectroscopy applications in the spectral band from visible to extended short-wavelength infrared (0.4 - 2.5 um) with a very low dark current density. In mid- and long-wavelength infrared spectral bands, Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors already offers performance comparable to the state-of-the-art mercury cadmium telluride but at a fraction of the cost due to the leveraging of commercial growth and process equipment. Our goal is to extend that benefit into the short-wavelength infrared. Using the best material currently available and a novel bandgap-engineering design and process, we will fabricate photodetectors and, ultimately, focal plane arrays. In Phase I, we are going to demonstrate photodetector designs based on Type-II superlattices, which can cover spectral range between 0.4 to 2.5 um with a very low dark current density (<10^-11 A/cm2) at temperatures below 100 K.. In Phase II, we are going to continue reduction of the dark current density to <10^-13 A/cm^2 -level at temperatures below 100K. Then, we will use the optimized device design to develop and deliver 1Kx1K imagers to NASA for planetary sciences.","Visible-SWIR photodetectors are of special interest to NASA for planetary observation missions. The Visible-SWIR imagers can be used to study the world's ecosystems and provide critical information on natural disasters such as volcanoes, wildfires and drought. Visible-SWIR imaging will be able to identify the type of vegetation that is present and whether the vegetation is healthy. It can provide a benchmark on the state of the worlds ecosystems against which future changes can be assessed. Moreover this imaging method can assess the pre-eruptive behavior of volcanoes and the likelihood of future eruptions as well as the carbon and other gases released from wildfires. The data from Visible-SWIR imagers can be used for a wide variety of studies primarily in the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem and Earth Surface and Interior focus areas. The large-format Visible-SWIR cameras, with ultra-low dark current, we will be developing and delivering in Phase II of this program will be able to provide high resolution mapping of planetary bodies.","The key applications of visible-SWIR imaging are listed below:* Mineral exploration, resource management, and environmental monitoring.* In agriculture for monitoring the development and health of crops.* In geology for rapidly mapping nearly all minerals of commercial interest* For ecology, surveillance, and historical manuscript research* For research in areas such as nano-drug delivery and nano-toxicology* For use in many research areas, such as vegetation research, forensics, life sciences, food analysis, and mineral research.* FTIR imaging microscopy * Gas imaging (e.g. for the petrochemical industry)* Security and surveillance (day and night) * Missile defense * Space-based situational awareness","Detectors (see also Sensors); Infrared; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation)","Sensor and Detector Technology for Visible, IR, Far IR and Submillimeter   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Such asteroids are mostly dark, small and cold (~ 200K); so they are best detected in the very longwave infrared (VLWIR) wavelength of ~ 16 microns where they glow brightest. To accomplish this, we propose a new cooled VLWIR focal plane array (FPA) of antimony-based strained layer superlattices (SLS) that will leverage the significant advances in quantum efficiency (QE) and dark current recently achieved by QmagiQ in SLS FPAs with cutoff wavelengths upto 12 microns. Compared to the incumbent mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) technology, SLS promises comparable QE, lower dark current, and much higher array uniformity and operability. Most importantly, it offers superb image stability - which will eliminate the need for frequent non-uniformity correction when using MCT.

Alphacore Inc will collaborate with ASU scientists to develop a radiation hardened-by design, digital intensive, unconditionally stable D-LDO with the following features:- A fully integrated digital low drop-out regulator (DLDO) with a fast transient response providing a well-regulated supply for system-on-chip (SoC) power management applications - Wideband operation and fast transient response are achieved through a transient enhanced digital Proportional and Integration (PI) controller, without compromising the stability of the DLDO. - The transient enhancement stage boosts D-LDO loop-gain dynamically during load transients. In the gain boosting mode, the D-LDO closed loop bandwidth is increased, resulting in reduced undershoot/overshoot and faster recovery of the output voltage. When the output voltage recovers to the desired level, the boost mode operation is disabled. LDOs are commonly used in low noise, fast response RF, analog, mixed-signal, and digital core power management applications. Fast response associated with LDOs provide a fast and energy-efficient wake-up, and low noise operation. Lack of high-speed switching and an LC type output filter makes them more attractive for high dynamic range telecommunication signal chain applications. To ensure fault-free operation of the digital cores and memory chips, the supply voltage must remain within a certain error window with minimum deviation under transient events, typical in space application. This supply voltage window is determined by reliability constraints of the process used in the upper boundary and speed requirements on the lower boundary. Alphacore Inc. and ASU's proposed digital linear low-dropout regulator will be fully digitally controlled, enabling portability across various process technologies.","A wide operating temperature range, digitally controlled linear low-dropout regulators (LDOs) ensuring stable operation of low-dropout voltage regulators for space and harsh environment applications will be beneficial to NASA solar exploration missions such as to Jupiter (Europa Mission), to Mars (InSight, Mars Exploration, MAVEN, potential MRS Mars return samples), future Solar Probes, and other missions to explore deep atmosphere and surface of giant planets similar to Juno and Cassini. Other anticipated new NASA missions for science and exploration of the universe are expected to challenge current power management specifications.  Alphacore's LDO voltage regulator can help aide in supporting electronic systems that can accommodate the ever-growing power requirements for NASA's science and exploration missions. WFIRST - scheduled launch mid 2020's - a next-generation observatory to carry out wide-field imaging and slit-less spectroscopic surveys of the near-infrared sky, with an emphasis on studying dark energy and exoplanets has critical power needs.   Future Earth-observing missions planned for 2021 and later that include ECOSTRESS, GeoCARB, HyspIRI, MAIA, InSAR, NISAR, Pre-ACE, TEMPO, and TROPICS are all expected to have increased power management demands. Additional potential applications include solar system exploration missions such as Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions.","Alphacore's rad-hard LDO is a great match for a range of governmental and commercial applications for radiation-tolerant systems including High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments (e.g., CERN) particle detection, medical irradiation and imaging systems, nuclear weapon proliferation monitoring, and space-based sensors. Research in these areas will enable the main avenues of discovery to increase knowledge of human kind and perhaps find answers to mysteries such as the origin and form of the Universe.Boeing has provided a strong letter of support to work with Alphacore. This LDO could enhance the system capabilities of Boeing rad-hard programs that have high efficiency power electronics requirements.  Boeing has offered its radiation testing facilities to carry out this project.

Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) will develop novel broad spectrum antimicrobial (ABFV: anti-bacterial/fungal/viral) coatings for the exposed surfaces of spacecraft metals, plastic, and electronics that will act as a bio-barrier to prevent both forward and backward contamination. The technology will offer a complementary and milder approach to the current, energy intensive sterilization methods such as heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma and vapor hydrogen peroxide. In addition, these current technologies only provide a one-time sterilization. The PSI approach is a permanent coating that will prevent inadvertent contamination throughout the spacecraft assembly and integration.The Phase I work will build upon PSI's previous efforts that developed highly efficacious and broad spectrum antimicrobial (ABFV: anti-bacterial/fungal/viral) finishes for textile surfaces. During the Phase I work, PSI will synthesize ABFV compounds that permanently attach to the surface of metallic materials such as aluminum and stainless steel. PSI will demonstrate high efficacy and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of the treated metallic surfaces as well as compatibility with current sterilization processes. In a potential Phase II, PSI will further demonstrate the technology at a scale relevant to spacecraft applications. In addition, PSI will extend the use of the new antimicrobial technology to other spacecraft hardware materials such polymers, electronics and composites and demonstrate the ABFV treatment on representative pieces of spacecraft hardware.","NASA is planning a wide range of extra-terrestrial missions, often with the goal of detecting signs of life. NASA has the responsibility not to introduce bacteria or viruses from earth into pristine extraterrestrial bodies. In order to prevent contamination of both the sensors and the extraterrestrial bodies, all aspects of the spacecraft must be sterile. Existing systems can clean a spacecraft at any given moment in time, they cannot keep the spacecraft clean. Implementing these procedures for large and complex spacecraft will be time-consuming, and facilities-intensive, greatly adding to the overall mission cost.In addition to the NASA interplanetary market, there is also the NASA manned spaceflight market. Manned platforms require high internal humidity which leads to rampant bacterial and fungal growth on all surfaces and particularly on hidden surfaces that are hard to reach. Cleaning these surfaces is a reoccurring task that occupies much of the crew time. Failure to clean the surfaces leads to significant respiratory problems. A coating process that ensured that an entire spacecraft is sterile and more importantly remains sterile, would greatly reduce the overall mission cost and increase mission success for both unmanned and manned missions. The versatile process proposed by PSI would pay for itself many times over by reducing the cost of the spacecraft processing facilities, the integration times, and the need for frequent decontamination.","It can be said without hyperbole that the terrestrial market for a broad spectrum antimicrobial (anti-bacterial/fungal/viral) coating is simply enormous. The proposed technology is a permanently attached surface coating that kills bacteria, fungi and viruses on contact. There are applications in the medical, pharmaceutical, military, and first responder industries.In the medical community, the proposed technology could greatly reduce the incidence of operating theater contamination and the associated costs of treating post-operative infections. At low enough cost, various other aspects of hospital environments could be treated, again reducing infection rates and improving patient outcomes.Similarly, in the pharmaceutical processing industry, great expense is taken to prevent biological contamination during the drug manufacturing process. The proposed Phase I will demonstrate efficacy on aluminum, anodized aluminum, and stainless steel. These are also the basic material building blocks of virtually all drug-manufacturing equipment. Reducing the decontamination steps and product rejection rates will greatly increase the cost-effectiveness of many drug fabrication systems.Military applications range from defeating bio warfare agents to self-decontaminating medic gear. Equipment that decontaminated itself would help reduce the spread of a bioweapon and help military and civilian first responders deal with such threats.",Coatings/Surface Treatments,Contamination Control and Planetary Protectionis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Technologies which can be used for real-time risk assessment of UAS flights are being developed by UTM Safety researchers, but there is currently no user interface to connect these technologies with the UTM managers and/or UAS operators. We propose to develop a human autonomy teaming interface system (HATIS) composed of tools, multimodal interfaces, and human-autonomy teaming software, which will permit human operators and UTM/UAS automation to collaborate in real-time risk management and mitigation (RMM).  In Phase I, we will work collaboratively with UTM Safety researchers throughout the project to identify hazard categories; make assumptions about UTM RRM roles, responsibilities, and automation capabilities; develop representative use cases; formulate HATIS requirements for interface, software, and interoperability; design and document HATIS architecture; and demonstrate HATIS proof-of-concept through interactive wireframes of interfaces and presentation of software architecture.  In Phase II, we will implement HATIS interfaces and software components, work with UTM Safety researchers to transition HATIS to NASA, and identify technology transition partners and develop a commercialization plan.","We envision that HATIS will be broadly used and play a key role in all future NASA R&D projects that involve UTM safety and UAS and human autonomy teaming.  HATIS will help provide NASA's UTM researchers, such as Dr. Belcastro's UTM Safety research, a human system interface to help visualize, test, and mature the technologies for the Real-time System-Wide Safety Assurance effort that develops risk assessment and mitigation methods for different levels of Autonomy and Authority, Hazard Sources and Risk/Safety Impact, and Application Domains (e.g., sUAS to mixed manned/unmanned operations) in a number of contexts, including UTM's Technology Capability Levels 3 and 4.  Other NASA programs that can leverage HATIS capabilities include UAS-in -the-NAS project, which has a component that establishes minimum operational performance standards for risk management, and NASA's ongoing Strategic Thrust 6 (Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation), which involves R&D with multi-vehicle collaboration.","We envision that HATIS will be a great asset for a number of organizations.  This first is companies that build UAS and avionics systems which will have a need for HATIS to do risk-evaluations and mitigation.  The second is those (e.g., FAA) that have similar research interests to NASA in investigating the regulatory, liability, and socio-policy-economic implications of operating a large number of UAS.  The third are companies that have developed UAS systems for package delivery or emergency response applications and UAS-based cargo companies.

Testing at kilowatt power levels and above has shown that the thruster axis is the optimal position for thruster throttling and plume divergence.  It also minimizes the impact of background conditions upon ground based performance measurements, reducing programmatic and technical risk to the end user.  The proposed compact cathode will extend these benefits to low power Hall thrusters.  The cathode will be compatible with iodine as well as with noble gases.  Hollow cathodes are a critical, life-limiting component for Hall effect thrusters and gridded ion engines.  Failure mechanisms include degradation, poisoning and evaporation of the electron emitter, keeper and emitter tube orifice erosion, and heater failure.  To achieve >10,000 hr lifetime, compact cathode will use a hexaboride (LaB6 or CeB6) electron emitter.  Hexaborides degrade more slowly than state-of-the-art barium oxide impregnated tungsten emitters at equivalent current densities.  Hexaborides are also resistant to contamination from oxygen and other impurities.  The cathode also includes a new, high temperature heater.  To minimize keeper and orifice erosion, the design will be optimized through testing and plasma measurements.In Phase I, Busek shall design, built and test the compact cathode.  The plasma plume will be interrogated with an emissive probe to determine spot and plume mode operating regimes on xenon and iodine.  An integrated cathode-thruster test will also be performed to determine the cathode's performance with a thruster. The Phase II test program will include duration testing of the cathode and thruster-cathode system with a fully modified BHT-600, thermal cycling and plasma modeling.  At the end of Phase II a cathode will be delivered to NASA for testing with a 600W-class Hall thruster.","Topic S3.02 seeks to mature and demonstrate in-space electric propulsion technologies, specifically calling for long-lifetime hollow cathodes for use with iodine propellant and high specific impulse thrusters.  Hollow cathodes are used in Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) and ion engines, two types of high specific impulse electrostatic spacecraft propulsion that can be used for unmanned planetary exploration and support secondary payload options. The compact cathode directly supports several Hall effect thrusters currently being developed at Busek and NASA, including the xenon fueled Busek BHT-600, an iodine compatible version of the BHT-600 and JPL's experimental MaSMi thruster.  These thrusters may propel NASA Discovery, New Frontiers and Explorers Class science missions.  Traditionally, these mission classes would use xenon propellant; however, iodine propellant would expand the mission envelope without increasing the mission cost.  Iodine yields performance comparable to xenon but provides many additional benefits at the system level.  In addition, a fully fueled, non-active system may be stored on the ground or on orbit for long periods of time, which facilitates spacecraft spares and minimizes down-times in the event of a failure.  This program will ultimately lead to flight hardware to support iodine-fueled missions.","Hollow cathodes are used in Hall effect thrusters, a type of electric propulsion that is attractive for military and commercial missions due to high performance, small size, low mass, and relatively low cost.  Low power all thrusters can accomplish all required in-space propulsion functions including orbit raising, orbit circularization, inclination changes, station-keeping, repositioning, and end-of-life de-orbiting.  The design will specifically support small spacecraft with power levels up to 1 kW.  The next stage for commercial users is the all-electric satellite, where apogee insertion and on-orbit functions are both handled by electric thrusters.  The low plume divergence enabled by an axial cathode of the type being developed minimizes spacecraft interactions, which is critical for geosynchronous spacecraft with operational lifetimes of 10-15 years.  The thruster and cathode would be also very well sized for an ESPA-class (180 kg) spacecraft flown as a secondary payload on an Air Force Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV).",Ceramics; Fuels/Propellants; Lifetime Testing; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Main Engine,Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

While loss of a UAS may not be catastrophic, the possibility of catastrophic collateral damage exists. UAS software is therefore safety critical, and safety-critical software remains expensive to build and certify. The full economic benefit of autonomous UAS operations cannot be realized until the cost of autonomous UAS software can be reduced without negatively impacting safety.Software architectures providing software fault tolerance through reconfiguration to a trusted backup, such as runtime assurance, offer fixed-cost assurance for autonomous software. They obviate traditional V&V by shifting the assurance burden from the autonomous software to the architecture.Traditional V&V approaches focus on rigorous testing, but providing the level of assurance required to enable UAS autonomy through testing remains infeasible. Formal methods offer an alternative, but comprehensive application of formal methods remains too costly. Application must be targeted at elements of the architecture for which assurance is most critical. Determining where formal methods should be targeted is a challenge.Rigorous safety arguments link safety claims to evidence gathered and not only provide justifiable assurance of safety, but also enable developers and certifiers to identify the most critical elements of the system.  Rigorous safety arguments can identify where formal methods should be applied.Argument-driven application of formal methods to runtime assurance therefore provides high assurance of safety while reducing development cost. This circumvents traditional V&V of autonomous UAS software without sacrificing system safety, enabling low-cost high-assurance UAS autonomy.","Argument-driven application of formal methods is applicable to all NASA safety-critical systems.Safeguard represents a current NASA project that provides runtime assurance. Currently, Safeguard is being developed following NASA software safety practices and will be undergoing a rigorous test and evaluation phase as it seeks to transition to a commercial system. Safeguard will benefit significantly from the argument-driven application of formal methods that will be developed under this effort: the application of the technology will result in a safety argument for Safeguard and an alternative set of high-assurance artifacts developed using formal methods.  UAS and increasing autonomy for UAS are significant focus areas for NASA. The application of an argument-driven application of formal methods to runtime assurance represents a particularly appealing approach to addressing the risks posed by autonomy as well as enabling low-cost UAS operations. In addition to increasing confidence in autonomous UAS in a reduced-cost manner, this approach provides an argument that can be leveraged to demonstrate compliance with appropriate regulations.Argument-driven application of formal methods to runtime assurance can also be applied to autonomous spacecraft, whether operating in Earth orbit, on Mars, or in the Kuiper belt. This approach can provide the requisite very high levels of assurance that such missions require at reduced costs.","UAS and UAS autonomy represent areas of significant interest for other government agencies, in particular the DoD. AFRL, for example, is beginning a major development project named Loyal Wingman, in which an autonomous UAS will operate with a manned aircraft to conduct military operations. Runtime assurance backed by argument-driven application of formal methods would enable a high degree of autonomy for the UAS while ensuring that critical safety properties ? such as minimum distance to the manned aircraft ? cannot be violated during operations. AFRL is specifically interested in runtime assurance and has sponsored its development and application over the past 15 years.Argument-driven application of formal methods to runtime assurance provides high assurance and reduced cost for commercial UAS. The rigorous argument combined with formal method evidence will help commercial users with certification, providing a path to demonstrating conformance to standards. Customers for this technology include companies that want to use autonomous UAS for delivery, and companies that use autonomous UAS for surveillance.While autonomous cars are tested in a wide range of environments, runtime assurance can be used to handle unexpected situations. As standards are developed for autonomous cars, rigorous arguments can be used to demonstrate conformance to these standards. Potential customers for this technology include all companies developing autonomous automobiles.","Analytical Methods; Data Fusion; Project Management; Quality/Reliability; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of carbon nanotubes directly onto high quality mirrors for diffraction suppression and stray light control is critical for use reflective nulling coronagraphs. The development of an integrated optical stack for these applications is new technology that has never been demonstrated.  Sub-micron controlled patterning of carbon nanotubes for extreme stray light control must be made to be compatible with high reflectivity coatings without degrading the near diffraction limited surface figure on the underlying substrate.  The entire optical stack; substrate, reflective coating and carbon nanotube forest, must be able to withstand high power laser pulses without damage and be robust to launch environments.  This is critical to missions that require extreme nulling of bright sources adjacent to dim companions.  The second component required for a nulling coronagraph is a sharp edge low scatter Lyot stop to block light.  Etched silicon has been used as an entrance slit for instruments and have been successfully fabricated and coated with ultra dark nanotubes by proposal team members.  The Principal Investigator at Lamba Consulting is a recognized expert in the development of carbon nanotubes, novel mirror substrates and coating technologies for space flight applications and has formulated a plan for fabricating and qualifying demonstration optics including for both a reflected apodization mirror and Lyot stop selectively coated with carbon nanotubes.","Stray-light and diffraction suppression is critical to NASA instrumentation because it improves signal to noise and observational efficiency in high contrast regions present in Earth, solar and coronagraphic applications. The PI and Lambda Consulting have delivered a large variety of instrument components including, baffles, stops, tubes and beam dumps. Development of a process compatible with reflective coatings and high quality optics for this SBIR, will enable an entirely new class of components and instrumentation for scientific observations.   NASA requires calibrators for all manner of instruments to allow scientific data to be of the highest accuracy.  On-mirror diffraction suppression is enabling for e-LISA as the telescope is used in duplex and requires extreme suppression of the the high power transmitted beam.  This is also a challenge in Laser Communications and of great interest to NASA that will be addressed by this SBIR. Carbon nanotubes have the highest emissivity ever measured and are nearly ideal in this respect.  We expect that further enhancement of the robustness of carbon nanotube coatings demonstrated in this SBIR will result in the use of this technology on more NASA instruments.  The PI has built and tested carbon nanotube absorber thermal detectors with superconducting transition edge detectors; a modified CVD process will make the use of carbon nanotube absorbers compatible with more detector technologies.","Optimization of the optical stack outlined in this SBIR proposal addresses a host of challenges that have created a barrier to the use of carbon nanotubes in commercial stray light control applications.

To achieve this goal Faraday Technology Inc., will work with team members at UES Inc., CalRAM Inc., Keystone Synergistic Enterprise Inc., and REM Surface Engineering to develop the necessary empirical knowledge to produce a manufacturing decision tree model (MDTM) that will enable the part designer to reduce the cycle time required produce the desired part with the required surface finish. The MDTM will be designed to select the appropriate build pathway to form the desired component and improve the as-built surface finish on the required areas while also determining the necessary secondary steps to achieve the desired surface finish on all required surfaces. With this teams combined expertise range from AM part building [ARCAM (E-BEAM), SLM (LASER), Wire Fed (E-BEAM)], secondary AM part finishing [electrochemical and isotropic], and post process AM material evaluation (tensile and microstructural characterization) we will be able to diagnose the best manufacturing cycle to reduce time and cost while ensuring the functionality of the produced material is maintained through each processing step. It is envisioned that the outcome of this Phase I/II program would be a working MDTM that has the potential to diagnose the best manufacturing pathway to produce a wide range of high-value components with various shapes and contours.","The anticipated result of the proposed program (Phase I, II and III) is the development of a manufacturing decision tree model (MDTM) that can inform the component designer the most rapid manufacturing pathways to produce a prototype part. The anticipated results of the Phase I and II programs is a software framework that could be imported into existing 3D design software with a TRL of 5 or greater, and a technology transition plan for implementation at a NASA facility or OEM. Commercial applications of the proposed approach include any component that has the potential to be produced via AM processes.Applications for this technology exist in many turbine and turbomachinery sectors including NASA military rocket applications, DOE ground energy systems, DoD tactical and strategic missiles, enhancing component efficiency, thrust, specific impulse, and maneuvering. We envision this technology application in other areas including: space re-entry vehicles, diver and attitude control systems, gun barrels, hypersonic propulsion, nuclear reactors, gas turbines, or any other technology that suffers from weight restriction and high manufacturing cost due to the large amount of material consumption and extensive machining steps.","In addition to the NASA, the proposed technology will be of interest to other agencies, including Army, Navy, and Air Force. Additional technology maturation, test, and evaluation funding will also be sought from other NASA and DoD program offices for specific AM components.

Bifunctionality will combine pore structure engineered for high capacity and selectivity to polysulfides with metal-like electronic conductivity to support electrochemical regeneration.  The proposed membranes will be fabricated using slurry cast methods that readily scale to continuous roll-to-roll production.  The slurry will combine a nanoporous conductive ceramic powder with a binder and solvent.  Slurries will be castable onto conventional porous polyolefin battery separators.

This novel tactile sensor surmounts the failures of prior tactile solutions with sophisticated multi-modal sensing capabilities, modeled after human hand sensing specifications, coupled with robust design for industrial and space applications.  PolySkin is a perfect choice for measuring space suit interactions with the human body because it was designed for a similar problem: detect contact to allow robots to safely operate in an unstructured environment. PolySkin measures mechanical pressure accurately, has a good resistant to aberrant readings when under moderate bending, shear or torsion, is sufficiently pliant to follow anatomical curves on the human skin without discomfort or lack of mobility, it can be fabricated in thin profiles (~mm) and packaged sufficiently small, free of rigid or sharp points, and it consumes low power. During this project, we will fabricate a flat prototype of our novel tactile sensor and characterize and optimize the elastomer formulation to achieve desired properties: accuracy within 10%, dynamic range: 0.1 to 10N, and high repeatability (<5% error). We will build conditioning electronics to provide serial output signal through a USB port. After passing initial test, calibration, and validation,  the conditioning electronics will be used to test in-sleeve embedded sensor. In a final proof-of-concept milestone, we will fabricate a working prototype wearable sleeve embedded with PolySkin to validate the performance. The deliverables include a 4x4 inch pad sensor at the end of 3rd month, and a wearable sleeve with embedded PolySkin sensor combined with conditioning electronics kit at the end of the project.","Characterizing human suited performance has continued to be a challenge, partly due to limitations in sensor technology. One concept is to use sensors placed at/on the human body, underneath the pressure garment to obtain knowledge of the human bodies movements. This data could then be compared against the suit motion. Various sensors, sensor technologies, and sensor implementations have been attempted over two decades of efforts, but each has had issues. Much of the work within NASA has improved the integration, comfort, and calibration of these sensors, but the accuracy performance characteristics when in use have not been sufficient to meet requirements. A new sensor technology is needed for use in this application.PolySkin meets NASA need to optimize space suit design for ergonomics, comfort and fit while providing critical pressure measurement with high accuracy, spatial resolution, and reliability on a conformable surface. Taken together, these improvements will enhance EVA performance, reduce overhead, reduce personnel and programmatic risk. In the future, alternative space suit architectures such as mechanical counter pressure may be feasible to further verify that necessary physiological pressure requirements are being met to ensure the health and safety of the crew. Our modular sensing system can be customized to have the dynamic range and sensitivity to meet NASA requirements.","While pressure sensitive structures have a wide range of applications, Perception Robotics focuses on industrial automation tasks which can benefit from tactile information.

What is needed to advance the state of the art are sophisticated inversion algorithms that allow layup and impact damage to be determined in localized regions, which means that more traditional methods of model-based inverse methods must be replaced by voxel-based inverse methods.  Thus, one will be able to better distinguish such things as delaminations from fiber-breakage due to impact damage, or other parameters that characterize the mechanical of the cfrp structure, such as elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio on a voxel-by-voxel basis.  This information can then be input to damage evolution models.  We describe two such methods, bilinear conjugate-gradients and set-theoretic estimation.  The challenge is to extend these methods to anisotropic materials.  We do that in this project, and will develop the algorithms for inclusion in our proprietary eddy-current, VIC-3D(R) during Phase II.  In addition, we continue our program of discovering and exploiting parallelism in VIC-3D(R) to speed up the modeling and processing that involve massive data generation.","NASA LaRC already owns a copy of VIC-3D(R) which it uses for modeling forward and inverse problems in eddy-current NDE.  With the enhancements proposed in this project, NASA LaRC will be able to extend its modeling capability to more accurately characterize damage conditions in cfrps, as well as run large problems more efficiently.","There are 35 commercial and university research institutions around the world that own copies of VIC-3D(R) which they use for the same purposes as NASA LaRC.  The will have the same advantages with the enhanced version of VIC-3D(R).  Furthermore, aerospace companies, such as Boeing, that are developing vehicles that use advanced composites, such as cfrps, will be able to use the enhanced version of VID-3D(R).

Advanced manufacturing represents 25 percent of the Indiana economy, and the State of Indiana has a strong background in composite materials research, development and manufacturing, with about 50 companies across the state contributing to this sector.  Though VTL is not a part of this consortium at this time, we expect that our Phase II research will yield an enhanced version of VIC-3D(R) that will not only support the work of this consortium, but would lead to an invitation for VTL to join it.","Characterization; Composites; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Processing Methods; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",NDE Simulation and Analysis   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Unfortunately, the traditional component make-up of a small satellite or cubesats is for short duration missions and not specifically designed for space environment resiliency. NASA has identified several scientific missions which would benefit from highly engineered, space environment tolerant and high reliability components. MMA Design (MMA) proposes new innovations in small satellite deployable solar arrays for theses missions, specifically targeting high reliability, simple and heritage proven designs, and high performance. ? Composite deployable hinge mechanism - due to volumetric constraints and stowed thickness requirements, an innovative composite panel-to-panel hinge mechanism is required. MMA has extensive knowledge in the design, manufacturing and test of composite tape hinges for deployable structures. The challenges that will be addressed in this effort is how to design a composite hinge with a tight stowed radius of curvature and a method of integration to the substrate panels that provides higher thermal conductivity than a traditional clevis hinge. ? Advance high stiffness, high-k solar array substrates, multi-functional - limitations with traditional polyimide or glass-fiber substrates is that they exhibit low stiffness and thermal conductivity properties. Alternatively, High-K Mesophase-pitch based graphite fibers would provide magnitudes higher thermal conductivity, thus providing better heat transfer throughout the solar array panel. Also proposed are innovations in co-cured substrate construction whereby a highly emissive film is cured directly into the substrate panel creating a surface for significant heat rejection a on the backside of the solar array. The front side of the panel will also include a cured in circuit trace, which will significantly reduce wiring routing on the solar panel.","The proposed innovation can immediately benefit NASA missions such as Iodine Satellite (iSat) and the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. The iSat CubeSat is a technology demonstrator mission to research and flight test an alternative to high-pressure gaseous propellant using in Hall-effect thrusters (HETs). (Polzin, 2015) This flight experiment aims to demonstrate a 200W iodine-fed thruster. One of the many challenges with this new technology include iodine corrosion and material compatibility with the ejected iodine during thrust events and ground testing. Also, technically challenging is achieving a high packing factor solar array to power a 200W Hall-effect thruster. Whether through battery charging or a direct-drive solar electric power (SEP) scheme the deployable solar array must be of significant aperature in order to meet mission requirements. Another potential mission that would directly benefit from the proposed HaWK-HR concept is the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission using CubeSat technology. This mission proposes to use a Cubesat platform as a low cost alternative to traditional science and exploratory spacecraft architectures. However, to enable such a demanding mission from a small satellite means new propulsion technologies are required. Currently, MSR is developing a Microfabricated Electrospray Propulsion (MEP) thruster to address interplanetary maneuverability. MEP uses a solid indium propellant and when heated, liquefies and passes through the thruster head.",Post application success relies on a strong transition and commercialization plan. The DoD is tasked with maintaining space capability which includes agile space asset management. The ability to rapidly relocate a critical asset to better support ground operations through the use of advanced thruster technology is a game-changing capability that requires high power systems.

The ITR bonding approach uniquely enables chemical interfacial (surface) self-welding mechanism effectively consolidating pre-cured parts through a smooth strong and continuous bond line. The ITR bonding fully solid-state process, which eliminates approaches that rely on uncured polymer or a meltable interstitial phase. The ITR ensures physical integrity of joint members of the structure and the reversible adhesive within the range of temperatures experienced during day/night cycles in space. The ITR is the first viable composite welding scheme for fully cured thermoset composites. Tailorable ATSP chemistry can be adapted to nearly any polymer processing technique by adjustments in oligomer structure providing unique advantages compared to conventional polymer matrices. In Phase I, we will develop an out-of-autoclave fabrication method to produce solid-state bond consolidated carbon fiber reinforced ATSP composite laminae and ATSP coated aerospace grade metal substrates. Additionally, we will perform physical characterization, thermomechanical property measurements and performance analyses of ITR bonded specimens. Additionally, we will develop thermal-electrical-mechanical finite element analysis models for optimized composite design with tailorable physical properties.","The solid-state ITR bonding approach could potentially find an application space in spacecraft technologies of NASA missions. For example, cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2) tanks used on Earth-departure weight critical architectures and in-space propellant depots to sustain deep space missions could be produced using the solid-state ITR mechanism. Particularly, metal and composite layers of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) can be strongly combined to prevent buckling, leaking as well as minimizing thermal effects. Also, construction of on-site habitable architectures requirements of NASA's foreseen deep space missions beyond low-Earth orbit would be facilitated via orbital replacement units transporting ITR joinable high disassembled packing factor building blocks to build next-generation structures. Additionally, on-going Solar Electric Propulsion project requirements of readjustable (folding/rolling) solar arrays configurations would be enriched through various other arrangements enabled through automated ITR bonding assembly.","The ITR bonding scheme could have a broad impact on other U.S. agencies and particularly aerospace industry is to promote welding-like bonding scheme along with cost, labor and material savings for primary aerospace composite structures. Regarding DARPA/Lockheed Martin X-55 Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft demonstration, utilizing bonded composite components and fuselage structure, substantial weight savings on an aircraft frame were enabled by simply eliminating rivet and fastener use (more than 85%) along with other improvements in fabrication and assembly stages. Also, through a reliable and leak-tight arrangement of fibers, failure of cryogenic fuel tanks could be prevented (Space X Falcon 9 Rocket explosion). Similar improvements can be obtained in polymer composite or metal used structural elements through application of ITR bonding.","Composites; Fasteners/Decouplers; Heat Exchange; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Polymers; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Structural Efficiency-Tailored Airframe & Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Unfortunately, these data are underutilized due to vast computational resource requirements; disparate formats, projections, and resolutions that hinder data fusion and integrated analyses; complex and disjoint data access and retrieval protocols; and task-specific  and non-reusable code development processes that hinder algorithm sharing and collaboration.  Due to these limitations, recent advances in unsupervised machine learning using deep neural nets (DNNs) have not been widely adopted for applications such as pixel-based classification, image preprocessing, feature recognition, and scene understanding.  Creare proposes to develop an open-source, standards-based Python software framework that removes major barriers to widespread exploitation of geospatial earth science data.  This will be achieved through development of PODPAC (Pipeline for Observational Data Processing, Analysis, and Collaboration), a pipeline-based architecture that (1) enables multi-scale and multi-windowed access, exploration, and integration of available earth science data sets to support both analysis and analytics; (2) automatically accounts for differences in underlying geospatial data formats, projections, and resolutions; (3) simplifies implementation and parallelization of geospatial data processing routines; (4) seamlessly integrates with DNN machine learning frameworks; and (5) unifies access, processing, and sharing of data and algorithms via interfaces to existing NASA repositories.  To demonstrate the impact of these innovations, we will use PODPAC to derive an on-demand, high-resolution global soil moisture data product from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) satellite radiometer observational data to support applications in hydrology, agriculture, and humanitarian response missions involving flooding, drought, and water resources.","Through close involvement with the SMAP and AirMOSS programs during Phase I and II of this effort, we are targeting these NASA programs for initial PODPAC commercialization.  We envision that infusion of PODPAC into these programs will enhance publishing, access, analysis, and analytics of ongoing observational data products from these programs, while also generating new model-generated data products such as the global high-resolution soil moisture data sets developed under this effort.  Subsequently, we will also target other NASA earth science observational programs seeking increased exploitation of their products, such as AIRS, AMSR-E, AMSR2, GMI, MODIS, and VIIRS for further program infusion and commercialization of PODPAC.  PODPAC will also be made available as open source software so that any NASA scientists involved in the analysis, exploration, integration, and fusion of earth science data sets can benefit.","We envision the primary non-NASA applications for high-resolution soil moisture prediction and data analytics are in the areas of agriculture, forestry, construction, and recreation.

To address (c), substantial enhancement has been predicted through large intracavity dispersion; we have demonstrated this property in a mode-locked laser with intracavity Fabry-Perot etalon, yielding a decrease in response due to the fact that the Kramers-Kronig dispersion of the Fabry-Perot is positive. The objective of Phase I is to experimentally demonstrate an enhancement using a Gires-Tournois interferometer for dispersion control, in combination with demonstrating the absence of dead band (d) in a solid state laser. A key element is the realization that it is possible to engineer a mode-locked laser where the pulse envelope velocity is controlled by other parameters than the dispersion. This property will be exploited in Phase I by inserting in a ring mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser a Gires-Tournois and a Rubidium cell, to demonstrate simultaneously the enhancement of the gyro sensitivity, the use of a solid state gain medium in a gyro, and the absence of deadband. We will also prepare for Phase II, in which these results will be implemented in a mode-locked fiber laser gyro, to demonstrate the light and efficient instrument required for space applications.","A light weight expandable gyro has application in commercial and space navigation in earth orbit as well as in deep space.

During Phase I, Mentis will develop the Silica-Silica manufacturing process, and obtain preliminary modulus, cte and thermal conductivity data. In addition, a top-level feasibility study will be conducted and a small-scale piece of silica-silica honeycomb sandwich panel will be manufactured.","Silica-Silica composites, can be fabricated into low cte, lightweight, and affordable sandwich panels using unique manufacturing techniques developed at Mentis.  The resulting structures would be suitable for use as mirror substrates. These mirror substrates have potential applications as components on NASA UV/Optical Telescopes. The technology is suitable for monolithic mirrors up to 8 meters and segmented mirrors that are even larger. Missions that meet these requirements would be Large UV/Optical and Habitable Exoplanet missions. The predicted light weight of the system also make the technology suitable for use as a mirror for Ultra-Stable Balloon Telescopes and Exoplanet balloon telescopes.",Within the Department of Defense there are several applications for affordable mirror structures that are lightweight and have a low cte. Two potential applications would be integration into the optics train on a missile interceptor or use as part of the Gun-launched Tactical Satellite System (GLTSS). Performance optics with a low weight are critical to both applications and the unique ability to affordably manufacture sandwich panels from the silica-silica material make this material a true contender for insertion on these systems.,"Composites; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Mirrors; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Polymers; Project Management; Prototyping; Textiles",Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

However, due to the complexity associated with the waveguide problem, direct interpretation of large amount of NDE/SHM data is difficult. A rapid and accurate simulation tool is needed to keep up with the demand automated and timely detection and assessment of damages in complex aerospace structures. We propose to develop a ""virtual inspection"" simulation toolbox (UGW-Sim) specifically for ultrasonic guided waves. This tool will be able to help analyze and interpret ultrasonic guided wave signals obtained from NDE/SHM measurements for damage detection and identification. It will include modeling of critical structural components such as stiffener and bonded joints and various types of damages that are commonly encountered. The tool will also help determine the optimal sensor placement and inspection parameters to maximize the detectability of various damages. Phase I will focus on the feasibility demonstration of the approach on metal structures and simple defects. Phase II will fully develop the software tool and extend to composite material with complex geometries and defect types.","Substantial budget expenditures and schedule delays are often required to develop and demonstrate effective NDE techniques for critical components not designed for inspection. As NASA moves forward in the Journey to Mars Program and Space Launch System to develop the Orion crew module and launch vehicles, it is essential to provide design tools that will enable rapid assessment of the feasibility of NDE methods as part of the design process for critical system components (thermal protection systems, pressure systems, composite structures, etc.) and computational NDE data analysis capabilities to help predict the response from a variety of NDE methods (ultrasonic, radiographic, thermographic, electromagnetic, optical, etc.) in complex aerospace structures.","NDE and structural health monitoring is also important for many military and commercial systems such as aircraft, automobiles,  nuclear reactors, bridge and pipelines etc. A computational NDE tool will help the maintenance staff and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for better design of the structures and inspection practices to ensure the structure integrity. The success of such software toolbox will greatly benefit the NDE community for enhancing the structural safety while reducing the maintenance costs.","Acoustic/Vibration; Analytical Methods; Composites; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety",NDE Simulation and Analysis   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

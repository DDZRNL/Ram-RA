RIMSS would be an extremely affordable (less than $5,000) system which would improve safety and security within an aircraft by detecting abnormal events (including but not limited to unusual passenger or crew activities, losses of pressure, deviations from flight plan, movement or fire in cargo areas, and so on), automatically alerting the crew to these events, and recording the entire event. This will be accomplished through the combination of proprietary and innovative imaging hardware, acoustic monitoring, IEM?s unique and proprietary event and object detection, tracking, and identification software. RIMSS would continue to function even in the event of power loss through a unique backup system, and would be able to transmit data securely to designated ground stations. The imaging portion of the system will work in all lighting conditions and the entire system will be rugged and able to endure for many years of reliable service. RIMSS is made possible through IEM?s extensive experience in all relevant fields, including imaging, 360? vision systems, acoustic /visual target detection, and many others.","The RIMSS system and its components offer significant opportunity in the field of air safety and security (military and commercial aircraft). They can assist in the detection and/or prevention of violent behavior by passengers (terrorist or air-rage), early warning of situations such as shifting cargo or fires in cargo areas, and with the audio subsystem's signal recognition and beamforming capabilities offers significant ability to localize sounds which signal mechanical anomalies.","Similar applications of security and safety exist in other transportation areas -- maritime (cruise ships, military vessels), railroads (passenger and possibly freight), etc. Spinoffs or adaptations of the specific elements of RIMSS, such as the neural-network based behavior recognition and IEM?s AED algorithm, have wider applicability in any security or surveillance monitoring application, yielding a considerable market opportunity amongst the over 300,000 local, state, and federal personnel authorized to make arrests and the organizations to which these personnel belong, and another in static security arenas -- military bases, shopping centers, commercial installations, etc."

Utilizing differences in wavelength-dependent optical absorption between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, pulsed laser diodes of selected wavelengths and symmetrically-placed photodetectors will be used to monitor the scattered light signals.  Changes between these light signals and those established by prior baseline measurements will be monitored and interpreted using appropriate algorithms.  Continuous monitoring of the mental state of personnel engaged in critical activities could provide a means of protection against human performance lapses resulting from unforeseen circumstances.  Operational crew members are often subject to stress, increasing the possibility of operator mistakes or oversight.  If a deterioration of the state of consciousness of an individual can be detected before that individual?s performance is affected, serious accidents or lapses in operator performance could be avoided.  Phase I will establish feasibility, and Phase II will produce and evaluate a prototype monitoring instrument.","NASA applications specifically revolve around real-time, non-invasive monitoring of crew performance and state of mental consciousness.  This is of major importance to mission safety and performance.  Brain activity measurements, as determined by direct measurement of cerebral blood oxygenation, are expected to directly monitor crew health, stress level, state of duress, and general performance.  The proposed cerebral oximetry method holds the potential for providing a reliable, low-cost, supplemental method of crew health monitoring.","The benefits of the proposed technology are expected to be of great importance to the government, industry, transportation and medical sectors of the economy.  In the transportation area, operational crew members are often subject to stress, increasing the possibility of operator mistakes or oversight.  If a deterioration of the state of consciousness of an individual can be detected before that individual?s performance is affected, serious accidents or lapses in operator performance could be avoided.  Similar benefits are expected for other public industries such as in the medical and military sectors, where crew performance is critical."

The proposed LPS consists of several interconnected modules: (i) FDIR module that detects and identifies the failure; (ii) Achievable Dynamic Performance (ADP) calculation module that calculates the maximum performance that can be achieved with the control authority available after failure; (iii) System's Variables Prediction (SVP) module that calculates the relevant variables of the system over a prediction horizon to predict if the system will enter an Unsafe Mode Set (UMS); and (iv) Command Limiting System (CLS) that recalculates the new command constraints and corresponding commands that prevent entering the UMS. In Phase I the emphasis will be on the loss-of-control due to the hard-over failures of the critical flight control effectors. We plan to demonstrate through computer simulations that the proposed LPS will effectively prevent the loss of control and assure the avoidance of unsafe modes of operation. Boeing Phantom Works (Mr. James Urnes, Sr.) will provide technical and commercialization support throughout the project.","One of main directions of NASA is to improve flight safety in the 21st century. A system that prevents the loss of control in critical flight regimes is an important contribution toward that goal, and will result in numerous commercial applications. An effective LPS will also be very beneficial for NASA programs involving hypersonic and re-entry vehicles that operate in regimes where the danger of the loss of control is highly pronounced.",The proposed LPS will have an immediate application in commercial aviation since it would substantially improve flight safety in critical flight regimes. The problem of loss-of-control handling in the case of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is even more pronounced since it involves a human operator. Effective decision-making aids in this context would substantially improve the flight safety and prevent collisions and unnecessary loss of the vehicle.

In essence, this new ?r-Gamma? display concept will ?fuse? flight information on one display that the pilot must now gather and correlate from among five separate indicators whenever the aircraft experiences loss of the Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Heading Indicator (HI) due to vacuum system or gauge failure.  The innovative technology that makes this concept feasible and affordable, with a projected cost similar to that of today?s Turn Coordinator, is derived from a technique called ?Air-Data Tracking,? recently developed and flight tested by our firm under an SBIR contract that involved tracking the flightpath of a small USAF sensor vehicle.

The r-Gamma instrument will provide substantial additional functionality and greatly improved safety for GA aircraft, and at price comparable to that of the Turn Coordinator and substantially below that of available alternatives.  It is currently reported that there are roughly 200,000 GA aircraft registered in the U.S. alone.  The nearly 70% of those are light single-engine aircraft, probably equipped with conventional Turn Coordinators or equivalent are potential candidates for the r-Gamma system."

An aircraft-based, imaging probe is being proposed for the reliable and accurate measurement of liquid water content (LWC) and droplet size distributions in environments variously referred to as freezing rain, freezing drizzle, supercooled drizzle drops, and supercooled large drops (SLD). The innovative aspect of the proposed probe is the use of multiple laser beams (of differing wavelengths) to create high quality shadows of individual particles (droplets and ice crystals) on a 2-d CCD array.  Conventional aircraft-based probes such as the OAP suffer from measurement uncertainties arising from the detection of droplets that are out-of-focus. The use of multiple intersecting laser beams will also minimize the background noise created by other particles that may be present along the laser beam path but outside of the measurement volume. Finally, the incorporation of a means for differentiating between ice-crystals and droplets, while counting and measuring both, allows computation of water content in both liquid and solid phases. These innovations, and the other features of the probe to be discussed later, directly address the need for aircraft-based icing monitoring systems that NASA has identified in topic A1.02 of the 2003 SBIR solicitation.",There are wide ranges of applications for an instrument that can characterize sprays and droplet fields over a wide size range. The immediate goal of producing a probe for measuring icing clouds and other cloud drop size distributions is of immediate interest to NASA and other agencies involved in cloud physics and icing research. We have been approached by NCAR and other commercial groups requesting us to develop such a probe for cloud and atmospheric studies. The obsolescence of the PMS probes has left a market opportunity for new probes based on advanced technology.,"There are also significant applications requiring an imaging probe for process evaluation and control. For example, in spray drying, the usual light scattering methods fail because the drops are not transparent or homogeneous. In such cases, an imaging system is the best method to use since it is not affected by the peculiarities of the droplet material. Another area deals with research in fire suppression systems used in commercial buildings. A system is needed to characterize sprays from sprinklers and to help develop these systems. No system exists for these applications whereas the number of spray drying processes including food processing, drug manufacturing, and other industrial processes is enormous. One of the complaints about the PDI method is that it cannot cover the entire drop size range in many sprays and that the larger nonspherical drops can produce significant measurement error. The integration of a second method will expand the areas of application of this important diagnostic."

These unfavorable interactions are caused in part by deficiencies, called ?dynamic distortion,? in the manual flight control system. Many sources of dynamic distortion such as friction, preload, and backlash have been reduced or eliminated in modern aircraft by improved hydraulic systems and by the replacement of mechanical linkages with fly-by-wire systems. Other sources of dynamic distortion remain, such as rate and position limits, power reductions, jammed effectors and mis-rigging. In older systems with mechanical linkages the pilot was at least aware that distortion was occurring, whereas in many modern, powered systems these cues are missing. An innovative concept is proposed whereby the pilot is provided with manipulator tactile cues when dynamic distortion occurs. These cues are hypothesized to improve aircraft safety by reducing the likelihood of unfavorable pilot-vehicle interactions. This improvement will be demonstrated in Phase I, first by modeling and simulation and then by conducting a PC-based manned simulator experiment. In Phase II the concept will be further developed and then validated with a flight test experiment.","Improved aviation safety is a major objective of NASA. This work will contribute towards this goal in two ways. First, improvements to modern manual flight control systems will be developed that will significantly reduce the likelihood of unfavorable pilot-vehicle interactions. These improvements will be available to NASA for their fleet of aircraft and for new NASA vehicles entering flight test. Second, this work will validate an important but largely unrecognized cause of decreased flight safety ? the lack of pilot cues that tell the pilot when the flight control system is acting in a deficient manner.","The same improvements to modern manual flight control systems will be available for commercial and military flight control systems. The continuing record of unfavorable pilot-vehicle coupling provides evidence of the need for improvements such as this. Licensing agreements are a potential way to commercialize these developments. The concept of dynamic distortion applies to any powered manual control system, including ground vehicle manual control systems. Power steering is a mature application, which works in part because direct links provide dynamic distortion cues, but new concepts in ground vehicle control are being developed that can benefit from this work."

ZONA will develop, implement, and verify FILM-ID a general-purpose package based on a Boundary Element Method (BEM) inverse algorithm for accurate retrieval of multi-dimensional film coefficient distributions (h) using either transient or steady temperature inputs. This method can be used with broad-band or narrow-band thermochromic crystal or laser induced fluorescence thermal imaging techniques and incorporates a new technique which provides robustness to input temperature uncertainties. The proposed method is flexible and easy to implement for examination of arbitrarily complex geometries encountered in turbomachinery as it requires only surface mesh.Phase I will focus on: (1) establishing the importance of the multi-dimensional modeling of the inverse boundary identification problem, (2) developing analytical methods for narrow-band thermochromic liquid crystal, and (3) fine-tuning the regularization process. Phase II will focus on code development, extensive verification, extension to 3-D modeling, and development of user-friendly interfaces and help manuals. It is anticipated that the proposed method will replace the conventional 1-D method for heat transfer coefficient retrieval.","The proposed tool will impact the turbomachinery design and test facilities at NASA for whom an accurate prediction of the film coefficient distributions over advanced turbine blade designs and other components is crucial in the determination of the system efficiency and capacity. In addition, an accurate prediction of the temperature field over such components will provide with a realistic thermal stress distribution, vital in the advanced mechanical design of turbomachinery systems. A user-friendly Windows-driven package, FILM-ID, will be produced. Graphical interfaces will be provided for display of input data, boundary conditions, and resulting h maps (steady and transient).","FILM-ID will be of immediate use for the power generation and aircraft engine industries towards which distribution and sale will be targeted. In addition, heat transfer R&D labs will be targeted. The commercialization potential of FILM-ID not only finds its place in industry where novel heat transfer design processes are undertaken but also in academics as it can serve its purpose as a learning tool for experimental convective heat transfer and inverse problem methods in heat transfer.

However, in order to maintain this position, it will be necessary to reduce the very high cost of reaching low Earth orbit by using single stage or two stage to orbit vehicles.  Some components of these vehicles have exceptionally high heat loads and require additional cooling capacity, which can be accommodated by utilizing the additional fuel heat sink capacity available from endothermic cracking reactions.  Unfortunately, cracking reactions lead to coke deposition in the heat exchanger, which can be a potentially serious problem if it is allowed to accumulate. Therefore in this Phase I proposal, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) will develop methods to remove the coke from the heat exchanger flow path.  Previously, several different coke formation mechanisms were though to occur during cracking and the selection of an appropriate method to remove the coke would depend on the mechanism responsible.  However, as a result of previous work, we have identified the mechanism primarily responsible for coke deposition with JP-7 and JP-8.  Thus, the methods we develop in this SBIR Phase I proposal have a high probability of success.","The most immediate application of this technology for NASA would be in the removal of carbon deposits from fuel flow paths in vehicles that require a substantial amount of cooling from the fuel.  Coke deposits will reduce the heat transfer and inhibit fuel flow, both of which can lead to total failure of the unit.  Since coke deposition accompanies the cracking reactions required to provide the necessary cooling, methods to remove coke are critical to the continued development of reusable launch vehicles.","Our technology would find substantial commercial use in removing hydrocarbons and other compound from high precision components such as semiconductors, magnetic disks, medical devices, optics, flight hardware, etc.  Because of the current limitations in the use of chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons, alternative methods using more environmentally and less toxic compounds are of current interest.  Because the goal of our project will be to identify conditions and solvents that are more effective for high molecular weight compounds, it will lead to significant improvements over cleaning methods currently used."

We are developing a computer-controlled semi-portable LITA system for robust, long-baseline measurements. This novel system automatically adjusts its own alignment to optimize accuracy. In prior work, LITA velocimetry was incorporated into this system and demonstrated. System level requirements for multi point LITA measurements were identified and system components, which as a whole, meet these requirements were designed or identified.

A dual mode ram/scram engine is the most likely cycle for the high-speed propulsion flowpath of turbine and rocket based combined cycle engines, but its feasibility with storable liquid hydrocarbon fuels remains to be demonstrated.  A key reason is that a stable, low drag engine pilot for the needed operational envelope has eluded us.  Due to its simplicity, the cavity flameholder is the subject of renewed investigation, but it suffers from acoustically coupled combustion instabilities originating in the shear flow.  Active control of the shear flow over the cavity could substantially improve flameholding stability.  Therefore, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes an active control strategy having no moving parts to manipulate the spectral content and amplitude of shear layer disturbances, and hence control the coupling responsible for resonance and unsteady flow response that leads to premature flame extinguishment.  The proposed experimental and analytical development effort will produce a robust, stable and low drag scramjet engine pilot.","The control of shear layer dynamics is central to all cavity-flow control strategies due to coupling between the separated shear layer dynamics and cavity resonance characteristics.  Therefore, the cavity flow stabilization technology proposed by TDA has wide-spread application to combustion flameholding and acoustic noise reduction.  For example, future high speed aircraft powered by turbine-based combined cycle engines would benefit from low Mach transition to scramjet mode.  In addition, the aircraft wheel wells are a large source of noise pollution during take-off and landing, which could be alleviated through shear layer control.Countercurrent shear layer technology has also been shown to be effective in thrust vector control (TVC) resulting in increased aircraft agility.  Improved short takeoff and landing capability for military aircraft is expected because of increased lift from a TVC system.","We can also apply this technology to automotive noise reduction for neighborhood and passenger comfort.  Noise due to separated flow in wheel wells and off of side mirrors could be reduced.In addition, a counterflow TVC system can increase missile agility resulting in reduced time-to-target and increased probability of kill."

The largely manual nature of the current process and lack of existing automation tools leaves great potential for significant errors in the data sets.  We propose to develop a powerful automated system for future demand generation.  This tool will be able to input a variety of existing FAA and NASA flight data sets, provide the user with extensive options on defining the future demand data set, and output new flight data sets in formats compatible with major research simulation and analysis tools. This capability will provide NASA and FAA research programs with significantly better analysis conclusions through the new ability to perform extensive sensitivity studies on new concepts to ensure they are robust to alternate potential future demand scenarios.

There is even less information about expected future configuration changes.  The airport configuration is a primary factor in various airport characteristics such as arrival and departure capacities and terminal area traffic patterns.  These characteristics, in turn, are central to a variety of Air Traffic Management (ATM) decisions, such as setting arrival restrictions to avoid airborne holding.  Consequently, uncertainty about the current or future airport configuration can result in traffic management decisions that under-utilize or overload airports, resulting in unnecessary or inefficient delays.  Moreover, air carriers would make use of configuration information.  FedEx, for example, selects parking gates for arrivals to Memphis based on expected departure runways to minimize taxi congestion and time.  The proposed effort will develop an airport configuration recognition and prediction system.  The airport configuration depends on a variety of factors; Phase 1 will consider local weather, arrival and departure demand, noise restrictions, and airport-specific considerations.","The product of Phase 2 could be used by NASA to improve SMS or other future automation.  SMS predictions currently depend on knowledge of future configuration changes, which currently must be entered manually.  Errors in SMS?s knowledge of future configuration changes reduces the accuracy of SMS predictions.  The proposed system could be integrated into SMS to remove the need for manual configuration entries.","Automation capable of recognizing the current airport configuration and predicting future configuration changes would likely be deployed by the FAA at a large number of airports.

Currently, the major emphasis of tools like NASA?s Surface Management System and the FAA?s Departure Spacing Program has been on improving the performance of the FAA.  However, to fully achieve the potential benefits, corresponding tools must be made available to NAS users.  To this end, we propose to develop a sophisticated suite of tools for the NAS users that make integrated use of data about airport surface and airspace operations, and that will allow them to work more effectively in coordination with FAA staff.  Two classes of tools will be explored under this SBIR.  The first class will consist of programmable alerts and critiquing functions that monitor for important events.  The second will focus on the design of advanced algorithms that assist with departure planning and execution.

An integral concept in the future of TFM is a more collaborative process in which TFM disseminates airspace constraints and the users react with a selection of a (possibly) limited number of rerouting options. With the advent of more elaborate and collaborative traffic management initiatives, the NAS operators are now confronted with a myriad of options in rerouting and delay absorption that they have never before encountered. The only decision support tools currently available to the airlines are flight planning tools, which choose an optimal route for an isolated flight given the physical properties of the aircraft and some forecasted winds. This completely ignores the effects of traffic congestion and, therefore, the potential intervention of air traffic service providers. We propose to develop a flight rerouting decision support tool for use by the airlines that will allow rerouting choices to be made in the face of forecasted airspace constraints and traffic congestion.","The NASA Ames Research Center has designed the FACET tool to provide a simulation environment for exploration, development and evaluation of advanced air traffic management concepts.  FACET is currently capable of modeling system-wide en route airspace operations over the contiguous United States.

Metron Aviation designs and maintains the Route Management Tool (RMT) to allow users to choose reroutes from among a list of known departure routes, or coded departure routes (CDRs).  The Collaborative Routing Coordination Tool (CRCT), developed by MITRE, is a graphical tool that allows the user to define flow problem areas, identify affected flights, and construct and evaluate proposed reroutes.

This significantly reduces the search domain, enabling rapid convergence to feasible solutions.  This key idea will be coupled with a numerical optimization approach known as Piecewise Linear Programming (PLP), which has been used successfully in related programs requiring on-line, real-time optimal solu-tions. A generic bootstrapping capability: To improve the speed and robustness of the on-line procedure, a method will be developed to generate initializing trajectories for the on-line optimization that are suitable for all recoverable ranges, vehicle configurations, energy conditions, and abort scenarios.

Depending on the Mach number spacecraft surface temperatures are as high 4000?F.   The shape of the RLV leading edge, primarily the radius affects the functionality of the spacecraft including RLV drag, lift and leading edge aero-thermal heating. Sharper leading edges create lift and re-entry cross range capabilities. The downside of sharp leading edges is that aero-thermal heating is increased, resulting in steep thermal gradients. These thermal gradients create high thermal stresses. Blunt leading edges leading edges have less thermal gradient and therefore thermal stresses are lower. However, the cross range capabilities of the vehicle are reduced.  Tasks include parametric definition of hybrid composite material architectures RLV leading edge for maximum lift, cross range and durability at temperatures of 4000?F for radii in the 0.03 to 1? range. The goal is finding the optimal hybrid composite material combinations/coatings and architectures for given leading edge radii. RLV.Analyses for hybrid leading edge designs include: Micro-mechanical material computations for hybrid material property, calculation of leading edge aerothermal heating heat transfer coefficient, heat rate and pressure load as a function of leading edge radius. Transient heat transfer analyses for calculation of leading edge thermal gradients. Thermal stress analyses using temperature gradients.

Dramatic field improvement from nanometer CNTs is a big advantage to increase the FEEP thrust more than 10 times under constant specific impulse (power).  The CNT based FEEP thruster with low specific power and stable long-term operation will meet spacecraft needs with micronewton to millinewton thrust capability.  The new FEEP device will be constructed innovative in three aspects: (a) Integration of CNTs into the ion emission anode, (b) Structural combination from the metal tip emitter and the slit emitter, and (c) Selectable operating thrust units.  In addition, a solid state thruster based on Cs intercalation with CNTs will also be investigated.  The power consumption of the thruster will be reduced by a factor of 5 and more.  The CNT ion emission design may also lead to the development of miniature ion source, benefiting ion source based analytical and material processing facilities.","Major applications of field emission electric propulsion (FEEP) thrusters are spacecraft attitude control and constellations, such as stationkeeping, orbit repositioning, and orbital adjusting.

Applying an electric field transverse to the incoming sample and opposing this field with a carefully configured buffer flow a sample constituent can be selected and focused into the collection port for subsequent analysis. Monotonically changing either electric field or buffer cross-flow will yield a scan of the entire sample population.  Stopping the scan increases the collection time for minor constituents.

The present state of the art for solid waste stabilization using lyophilization is very effective at removing water (up to 99.9%), but suffers from long processing times and high specific energy, because system equipment must operate continuously over the duration of the process.  For conventional freeze drying operations, the system vacuum pump and the heat transfer system are in continuous operation.  By utilizing microwave power to provide the necessary phase change energy to convert solid water to water vapor via sublimation at low pressure and temperature, the conductive heat transfer rate limitation that plagues conventional freeze dryers can be short-circuited.

H2O2 is an attractive biocide for space-based missions, because no harmful chemical residues are produced, yet planktonic, biofilm-forming, and surface microorganisms are effectively controlled using low concentrations.  The major hurdle to expanding the use of H2O2 aboard spacecraft has been the absence of an effective H2O2 generator. A new cell design employing new materials will be used to accomplish this goal.  First, an innovative conductive polymer cathode will be utilized to form H2O2 efficiently and selectively.  Second, a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) combined with an innovative anode - SPE - cathode design will be utilized to efficiently transfer H+ ions from the anode to cathode, where H2O2 is formed.  This approach circumvents problems encountered with previous electrochemical cells designed to produce H2O2.  The Phase I will clearly demonstrate the feasibility of these concepts by producing H2O2 in pure water.  The Phase II will improve cell efficiency and decrease equivalent system mass (ESM) through cell miniaturization.  Long-term performance tests will validate the basic cell design, forming the basis for a multitude of applications in space and commercial markets.","The primary application of an H2O2 generator will be for disinfection of areas that accumulate significant microbial contamination over time.  Hydroponic enclosures, plant growth chambers, waste handling areas, and moist surfaces among others have potential for microbial outbreaks that will degrade performance or endanger crew health. H2O2 offers an ideal solution to these challenges, as an effective disinfectant without problematic residues. H2O2 can also be used to sterilize medical equipment during emergencies without bulky and costly chemical solutions or autoclaves.  The ability to efficiently generate H2O2 on-demand will significantly reduce logistics and costs in these and other areas.","Efficient H2O2 production using only power, water, and oxygen has high commercial appeal.  One market is the on-site production of an environmentally friendly bleaching agent for pulp and other products, where transportation costs currently dominate.  A miniaturized H2O2 generator can automatically dispense H2O2 as a bleaching agent in washing machines, or as a biocide in water supply units used in medical equipment.  At remote locations, and during emergencies or military actions, the on-site production of a powerful disinfectant is another attractive commercial use.  Based upon a successful Phase I, a very strong potential exists for the development of this technology."

In addition, the use of the system in ground support facilities such as launch pads and other Obiter or ISS processing facilities could assist in asset and tool tracking and manifest verification, eliminating labor-intensive data logging activities currently employed.  Ground security and safety functions could be enhanced and further automated with the proposed system, allowing the movement and location of assets and personnel to be monitored continuously with reduced human intervention.","Potential Non-NASA applications include commercial supply chain monitoring, asset tracking, and security monitoring.  Military applications include equipment location tracking, personnel tracking including friend or foe identification, and security functions.  In addition to simple ID tag functionality, the proposed system could utilize low-cost tags as sensor elements, where the temperature or strain of a given passive tag is monitored remotely by an interrogator, allowing for extremely small, large temperature range sensor elements."

One of the risks is the physical wounding, burning, and inflammation during in-space/in-flight construction, fabrication, assembly, and testing of the infrastructures designed for the exploration, including the International Space Station.  Such circumstance will severely undermine the implementation of NASA-defined plans and greatly overrun specified budget and time frame, if physical damage is not effectively controlled.   Several cases of minor cuts in microgravity have been reported not being able to heal until return to Earth.  While the exact cause for the slow healing in space environment is still been theorized, initial studies on cells exposed to micro- and hyper-gravity have suggested that the growth of human cells is heavily regulated by the gravity.  As the gravitational force increases or decreases, the cell function responds in a linear fashion.  Typically, the faster the cell growth, the quicker the healing process.  Thus, development of technologies that can accelerate the wound healing is crucial to NASAys space exploration mission.  The objective of this work is to develop an in-situ/in-flight wound healing device using wavelength-specific light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) biostimulation to accelerate the healing process.  Pioneering work conducted by Medical College of Wisconsin shows that biostimulation is able to increase DNA synthesis in fibroblasts and muscles cells, which could contribute to fibroblast proliferation and healing process.",The commercial potential for NASA and the other government sectors will be unlimited. As new space transportation hardware comes on line NASA will need an emergency medical suit or a section that will include an LAPC LED source on each transportation vehicle. In addition each space station or docking platform will require emergency medical facilities. Planetary exploration will require deployment of a base camp at the initial landing site equipped with a complete medical care facility including a LAPC LED source. Surface exploration will require vehicles with emergency medical facilities equipped with emergency versions of LAPC LED source.,"The initial thrust of this research is to develop a device using LED biostimulation for in-situ treatment of wound, injury, and inflammation encountered during space exploration, which will enhance crew safety and health for long term exploration of space. There is no doubt that this type biostimulatory enhancement, once demonstrated for space, can be immediately applied to military applications and will have profound economic implications for the health care industry here on earth. With the development of a low cost LED source, this technology will no doubt find its way into rural area medical facilities thereby making the technology readily available to everyone. The world wide commercial implications for this device technology are enormous."

Such plant genetic engineering will not only benefit the agricultural industry by creating elite crop varieties with improved qualities and unique features but also benefit the pharmaceutical industry by developing plant-based antibodies and vaccines, which is cost-effective and safe.  A fundamental requirement for the development of transgenic plant materials is to have an effective gene transfer system, which is able to produce high transformation events.  Literature survey shows that existing transformation technologies face severe challenges with most of monocots and dicots cultivars.  However, gene transfer experiments conducted by WCSAR during STS-95 and STS-101 showed that the transformation rates were significantly higher than the same experiments conducted on ground, which opened a door for the commercial investment of space-based plant genetic research facilities.  The challenge is to develop in-flight analytical capability so that the science return is less dependent on the post mission process/analysis and the success of each flight.  For example, the gene transfer experiment WCSAR conducted during STS-107 experienced 100% science loss due to the lack of analytical data during the flight.  The goal of this proposal is to develop an automated and ground-based controlled ISS-based research tool that is able to in-situ detect fluorescent proteins, the reporter genes widely used for in-vivo monitoring gene expression, using active imaging spectroscopy sensors.  Such technology can be incorporated into existing research facilities to enhance the science return, and minimize crew involvement time.  This is crucial to research fields of plant transformation, gene manipulation (sequencing/knocking out), and plant genomics.","Development of genetically engineered crops (or transgenic crops) and plant-based biopharmaceuticals is of major interest to the US and other countries around the world.  Every year, the life science companies and government agencies worldwide invest hundreds millions of dollars in the development of high-throughput transformation and event screening technologies to reduce product development cycles, costs, and manual efforts.  The targeted customers will be NASA enterprises, NASA affiliated research/academic institutes, and aggressive life and science companies who will investigate the impact of microgravity on plant molecular biology, plant genetics, and other related subjects, which will meet NASA's mission requirements and will contribute to the improvement of human life on earth.","The targeted customers will be the commercial companies and research institutes who are primarily engaged in developing plant transformation technologies, plant-based pharmaceuticals, and plant genomics, which require massive event screening and DNA detection.At the present time, the technology proposed here is not commercially available.  Therefore, we hope that this initiative will lead to the development of a commercial product, which can be used for space and terrestrial applications."

The proposed device is well-suited for the rapid, automatic and highly sensitive detection of a wide variety of biomolecules of potential interest to NASA.  Interest in MHD microfluidic devices has previously been limited by their tendency to generate obstructive bubbles and to suffer quick erosion of the electrodes.  The proposed approach solves these problems and provides for very high flow rates and long electrode lifetimes.  In addition, the proposed device can be operated at very low voltage, and contain no moving parts, features that currently are not available with other forms of microfluidic devices.  In the present approach, the many significant advantages of MHD-based microfluidic systems are retained, including compatibility with a much wider variety of materials and solvents than electrokinetic based systems.  An integrated, self-contained microelectrochemical detection approach can be used in turbid, colored, or complex samples with a minimum or absence of false positives and false negatives.  Together, the two technologies offer a unique platform for biomolecular analysis.  For space applications where minimum sample handling steps and maximum automation are typically highly desired features, the proposed system should excel.","Potential NASA applications for the device include pathogen monitoring, monitoring of astronaut health during space missions (including in-vivo although that would require additional development beyond the currently conceived Phase I and Phase II projects), physiological research, plant screening, and drug delivery.","Detecting biological and chemical agents, medical diagnostic applications, drug discovery, biological research, DNA/RNA sizing & separation, high-throughput screening, genotyping, gene expression profiling, clinical chemistry / diagnostics, protein separation, sizing, & quantitation, chromatography, proteomics sample preparation, microelectronics heat transfer, and other possible applications."

Our overall objective is to develop a generalized, multiscale, multiphysics CFD (continuum)-based design software where nanoscale effects of arbitrary biosystems are accurately, efficiently and seamlessly integrated with coarse-grained models carrying molecular information. To accomplish this task we propose a three-level modeling effort. First molecular calculations (Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo) are undertaken to elucidate the fundamental and essential molecular behavior. Next, stochastic simulation methods (Master, Fokker-Planck, or Langevin) will be seamlessly integrated with continuum approaches are developed to describe the mesoscale, fast time scale averaged behavior of these molecules.  Finally, the information from the stochastic models is coupled to the continuum CFD model.

Astronauts are exposed to tremendous environmental challenges, such as cosmic radiation, microgravity and confined space.  Their immune systems are easily compromised.  To study these effects, biomarkers such as nucleic acids and protein are measured to determine how the body reacts and adjusts to the stresses.  Current detection methods rely on traditional molecular techniques that are time-consuming and require skillful operators.  Also, the equipment needed is bulky and require high-power consumption.  Therefore, many measurements are not conducted near real time but are completed after the samples are frozen and returned to earth.  This leads to uncertainty on the reliability of the data.  In order to overcome these problems, Lynntech proposes a novel method to fabrication a nano-electronic biochip that potentially can provide single DNA/protein detection in near real time.  The proposed biochip will be more sensitive, smaller, more reliable, lower cost, and easier to operate for NASA?s mission than the most commonly used optical methods.  The ultimate goal is to develop a small real-time nucleic acid and protein detection biochip capable of conducting measurements for long duration space missions.","In addition to monitoring astronauts? health, the electronic biochip can monitor the microbiology of the closed systems such as spacecraft and space stations.  It can detect the sources and types of microorganisms in places such as crew compartments and in water handling systems.

In addition to living specimens, the module can be used to carry subpayloads that require precise environmental control or continuous data recording. In order to maximize the amount of science for a given mission, many biological experiments require initiation while still on the ground. In these types of experiments, it is imperative that the specimens are housed in a very precisely controlled and accurately quantified environment. The GITM has the ability to control temperature, humidity, light level, fluid level, air circulation and air exchange rate with cabin. Sensors and cameras continuously monitor the contents of the chamber and have the ability to record images. The module meets both the Single Middeck Locker interface as well as the ISIS 6 Panel Unit Interface. By meeting both interfaces, specimens within the module can be launched/returned with power on the Space Shuttle Middeck and transferred to the ISS where it interfaces with the Life Sciences Glovebox. Specimens can then be transferred to the long duration test facility for the remainder of the experiment without direct exposure to the crew.","The GITM will enable better utilization of existing payloads and significantly decrease the amount of overall mass launched to orbit. By using GITM, which is smaller and lighter, for the transportation of the specimens, the long duration specimen facility can remain on-orbit. In addition to saving the weight of the larger payloads, the spares and science equipment weight is also saved.

(BNS) proposes to develop an Electro-Optic Imaging Fourier Transform Spectral Polarimeter (E-O IFTSP). The polarimetric system is based on BNS? patented FTS technology, where ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) polarization switches control device operation. The designed system has simple drive/calibration requirement, and the capability to acquire complete Stokes polarization information simultaneously with the spectral imaging information. This information is collected using short data acquisition times due to the fast electro-optic tuning (sub-millisecond response for FLC switches) and the high optical throughput of the spectrometer.  The spectral region of interest is the 0.5 ? 1.5 micrometers to allow high-resolution, high-speed measurement of a large number of different atmospheric aerosols. Our approach uses non-moving parts in a compact geometry, which is expected to produce a simple and reliable system needed for critical NASA missions. The compact, low-mass E-O IFTSP will be particularly suitable for use on small aircraft platforms to advance capability in the spectral imaging polarimetry of aerosols and clouds in Earth?s atmosphere, and for integrating into Earth orbiting satellites for long-duration monitoring of atmospheric trace gases.","The compact and low-mass E-O IFTSP system is particularly suitable for use on small aircraft platforms to advance capability in the spectral imaging polarimetry of aerosols and clouds in Earth?s atmosphere.

It has also potential NASA applications in Lidar remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and chemical effluent detection.  Its random access analog tunability makes it appropriate for derivative spectroscopy and for dedicated sensing applications, such as differential absorption.","There is considerable interest in spectral polarimetric techniques that improve the capability of imaging systems where the information is difficult to recognize because of background clutter.  This is especially true in the medical industry (e.g. analyzing tissue samples), but is also relevant for many industrial processes. Remote sensing with spectral polarization has potential applications in the commercial market as well, particularly in improved environmental assessment. The proposed technique has a large non-NASA commercial potential because the technology is very flexible (adaptable to a variety of applications) and is light efficient."

(LCI) proposes to develop a direct-detection Doppler lidar (D3L) technology called ELITE that improves the system optical throughput by more than an order of magnitude.  This improvement has the potential to enable wind sensing via Doppler lidar from spaceborne platforms, as well as improving the warning time for on-board clear air-turbulence (CAT) sensors used in commercial aircraft.  The ELITE concept will be modeled and tested in Phase-I, and the feasibility for spaceborne implementations will be assessed.  A prototype D3L system that utilizes the ELITE technology will be built and tested in Phase-II.  The test results will be used to assess the feasibility of ELITE-based spaceborne Doppler lidar.","On average, one commercial flight encounters significant clear-air turbulence (CAT) every other day.  Between 1980 and 1995, the FAA reports CAT encounters injured 316 people and killed two.  Doppler lidar is the only known method capable of reliably detecting CAT at ranges necessary to effectively prepare for or evade violent encounters.  Experimental coherent-based Doppler lidar sensors are capable of detecting CAT at a range of 10 miles at 20,000 ft, which translates into a 45 second warning time.  This meets the threshold-level requirement, and has little commercial utility.  Ideally, much greater warning times at objective altitides are required to make a CAT sensor feasible for commercial deployment.  Moreover, the costs associated with coherent-based systems make it difficult to achieve commercial viability.  Direct-detection Doppler lidars based on the ELITE technology have considerable promise in meeting the objective specifications and cost of commercial CAT sensors.","Global measurement of tropospheric wind is potentially the most significant contribution of satellite remote sensing to existing global meteorological observations.  However, there are large deficiencies in accurate wind measurements over large regions of the world (e.g., oceans), and spaceborne sensors are the only practical means of addressing these deviciencies.  The deployment of spaceborne wind sensors would provide critical data on hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles, planetary scale dynamics, atmospheric-oceanic heat transport, as well as critical wind information for improved operational weather forecasting.  NASA has been directly involved in the development of wind-sensing lidar technologies to address this need.  Direct measurement of horizontal wind vectors in clear air has been demonstrated using lidar from the ground and from aircraft, based on determination of the wind-induced Doppler shift in the backscatter signal.  However, the performance of Doppler lidar systems must be dramatically improved to make wind sensing feasible from space-based platforms.  The improvements and simplicity of the proposed ELITE technology may provide the enhancements required to enable space-based wind sensing via Doppler lidar."

The GOBI model will be based on recently peer-review published analytical inversion models authored by the Principal Investigator and collaborators.","In-situ, analytical measurements of biogeochemical properties of particles in seawater are needed for remote sensing algorithm development in case I and case II waters.  Compatibility with autonomous platforms will enable extensive data sets to be collected in concert with remote sensing imagery over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. NASA research areas involving carbon cycling, global climate change, sediment transport, riverine particle deposition at continental margins, harmful algal blooms, and general water quality monitoring all require an understanding of the concentration and composition of particulate matter in seawater.",There are numerous science applications for in-situ measurements of biogeochemical properties such as POC and TSM that range from carbon cycling studies to environmental monitoring.  Coastal monitoring and observation through the US Ocean Observing program and GOOS is expected to be one of our fastest growing market segments in years to come.  We also expect the GOBI sensor to be applicable to many freshwater research pursuits.

Such a sensor network, which would rely on optically-coupled, non-conductive, ultrawideband probes, would provide an unprecedented combination of negligible invasiveness, freedom from electrical interference, and the ability to capture signal information at frequencies from UHF to W-band. It would impact the development of virtually the entire range of technologies relevant to active microwave earth-science instruments.

First, primarily ad hoc techniques have been developed for extracting information from PolInSAR data with the result that estimated geophysical parameters have lower accuracy than necessary and associated confidence bounds cannot be computed.  This is unacceptable for both scientific and commercial mapping applications.  We have developed a maximum likelihood inversion formalism which yields the optimal estimates with confidence bounds.

The material of construction of this heat sink has four properties that are critical: high normal and specific thermal conductivities, low CTE, high temperature resistivity, and moldability.  Its thermal conductivities are higher than that of copper, so the thermal resistance across this heat sink will be lower than one made of copper.  At the same time, it has a low CTE, which is slightly less than silicon and close to the CTE?s of most semiconductor and optical materials.  CTE-matching is critical in space applications because of the wide variations in ambient temperatures, which can lead to delamination of heat sinks from electronics or their fracture.  This material can withstand very high temperatures, so a faster CVD diamond deposition process is feasible.  The diamond layer maximizes the thermal spreading at the heat sink-device interface (important for devices that are sensitive to temperature gradients) and also provides electrical isolation of the electrical components being cooled.  Finally, the material is moldable, so heat sinks with complex external geometries, e.g. curved for optics, and internal surfaces can be fabricated inexpensively.","Our proposed heat sink technology will satisfy the ever-increasing demands of thermal management in space-based applications.  As more sophisticated and higher power devices are employed in spacecraft, our heat sink will be able to provide the necessary cooling load and increase the reliability of the total system.  Even moderate and lower power systems will benefit from the enhanced thermal spreading and reduced thermal stresses that will be occur with the utilization of our heat sink technology.","We are currently working on developing a similar heat sink using Al/SiC for high heat flux power modules.  The demand for power modules that can handle higher voltages and currents are growing, as these power electronic components are needed for distributed electrical power systems, hybrid and electrical vehicles, and many military programs.  The Navy in particular has been very actively funding the development of power module systems, in support of their All-Electric-Ship program and several new weapon system concepts."

Typically, regenerative coolers such as pulse tubes, many of which are currently under development, have small cold heads that must be conductively coupled to heat loads. However, conductively cooled loads are often linked to their respective cryogenic systems through massive structures that must simultaneously have high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity y a combination not simple or economical to achieve. This work proposes to develop an innovative, light-weight, continuous-flow cooling loop for cooling distributed loads such as those represented by large deployable structures, including optical mirrors, actively cooled sunshades, and on-focal-plane electronics.

Electric arc discharges of the PPT apparently causes only thin surface layers of the energetic propellant to be ignited, without uncontrolled propagation to underlying propellant.  The current Isp of these propellants is ~225 sec. but newer formulations appear to be reaching an Isp of 245 sec., essentially that of ammonium perchlorate propellants. The relative thrust contribution from plasma ionization and thermal expansion of non-ionized combustion gases will determine how much the energetic fuel enhances PPT performance.  All testing and evaluation of the HE propellant will be conducted using the Aerojet Modular Test Unit Pulsed Plasma Thruster.  This modular test unit was specifically designed to evaluate new flight configurations of the EO-1 PPT design.

Several studies have shown that an all PPT attitude control system has a significant mass benefit over wheel, torque rods and thrusters used for attitude control.  Such NASA missions as the Space Technology 5,6 and 7 and THEMIS that require both attitude and translational positioning could benefit from this technology.  Successful demonstration in these missions would provide enabling technology for later Origins missions, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder","Miniaturized PPT?s for onboard propulsion are one of the few viable options for small satellites in the 10 kg and lower total mass region.  Such satellites are of military interests in programs being developed by the Air Force, DARPA and MDA.  In addition there is a growing commercial interest in small satellites that are being developed and built by University and Private companies.  The high energetic propellants being developed in this program also could be used commercially for gas generation systems, such as automobile air bags, turbine starters or valve actuators."

Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to exploit the run-time reconfiguration capabilities of SRAM-based FPGAs to demonstrate an innovative extension to the current state-of-the-art -- an autonomous, adaptive digital signal processor.  PSI?s Reconfigurable Environmentally Aware Computing Technology (REACT) will automatically customize applications executing on a reconfigurable FPGA processing system based on external inputs.  In Phase I, we will validate the REACT concept by processing images from a digital video camera with a variable-precision 2D integer wavelet transform in a Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA.  Wavelet transforms enable image data compression with dynamically tunable compression ratios.  Quantization of the filter coefficients will be controlled by a master state machine with inputs from a GPS receiver and PSI?s SEU Alarm, a compact sensor that monitors the surrounding environment for radiation hazards.  Furthermore, PSI will develop a Phase II system design capable of performing a full-scale demonstration using hyperspectral imagery.","PSI will build a high-performance, agile image compression engine on an FPGA processor.  The compression scheme will be based on the emerging CCSDS standard, ensuring its applicability to a wide array of NASA missions.  The compression ratio and data rate will be adjusted on the fly via plug-and-play inputs to a master controller unit, enabling future NASA Earth Sciences satellites to accommodate next-generation hyperspectral instruments and radar arrays-- with increasingly high data rates-- on platforms that make maximally efficient use of downlink bandwidth, size, weight, and power.  The GOES-R Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES) stands out as a potential near-term beneficiary.","The results of the proposed SBIR effort will be equally applicable to military space missions and commercial communications satellites.  Although PSI intends to develop a specific application during the course of this program, the REACT concept can also be extended to a myriad of terrestrial and underwater digital signal processing applications that would benefit from an adaptive processing component.  Examples include adaptive filtering to autonomously detect countermeasures on torpedo sonar systems and dynamically tuned software radio transceivers for mobile communications."

Meshing is progressive and adaptive to any resolution and for any selected region in the scene, thus making it possible to model certain regions with high resolution while leaving the remaining parts coarse. (2) Meshing is then interleaved iteratively with registration to search for optimal alignment of overlapping 3D models by, in one case minimizing an error objective function, and in another case maximizing a similarity measure for aligning decomposition trees associated with the overlapping models. Following alignment, an integration algorithm fuses overlapping models. The anticipated results are effective 3D modeling and registration technologies that significantly assist NASA?s R&D mission.","The primary application for NASA is a high performance 3D modeling, compression, registration, fusion and recognition engine for use in earth science, deep space and solar system exploration and observation with multisensor data collection and analysis requirements.  This software application would assist NASA researchers, scientists and engineers in R&D and operational tasks.  By providing a radically improved way to model, compress and fuse 3D data, this project will increase the quality of data presented to NASA users and the resulting analysis.Note: This proposal is submitted under E3.04 but it is also highly relevant to E3.01.","Across a number of markets, industries and research disciplines, there is increasing demand for 3D modeling and fusion to understand, model and solve scientific, technical and commercial problems.

This is due to the fact that the number of training samples required is directly related to the dimensionality of the classifier.  In order to avoid this problem, the hyperspectral datasets must be preprocessed, thereby reducing the dimensionality to an acceptable level.  Other challenges include uncertainty associated with measurements and missing/sparse data sets.

Knowledge regarding this meta-information, and methods for effectively portraying it, have the potential of relieving the decision-maker?s workload and encouraging more situationally aware decisions.  To support the decision-maker, we propose to develop visual representations of meta-information in remotely sensed geospatial data.  Three core components characterize the proposed approach.

For instance, the EOSDIS archive data growth rate is currently about 1 petabyte/year. NRC's Committee on Coping with Increasing Demands on Government Data Centers recently made a series of recommendations on which emerging technologies can help data centers meet user needs and build and maintain the long-term record of environmental change. In this proposal, we propose to design, develop and prototype Extrieva - a low cost scalable Archive Storage Management System innovation, which embraces several of the NRC technology recommendations. In particular, Extrieva is a disk-based solution as assessed by NRC to be now competitive with tape for long-term, archival-class storage. Moreover, with its self-management and automation features implemented over commodity Linux clusters using distributed indexing and load balancing algorithms, Extrieva offers a low cost scalable solution with unprecedented ease of management addressing the needs of EOSDIS' diverse global users base.",NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC's) need the type of scalable archive storage management system offered by Extrieva.

Previous methods used Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, which offered only long time separations, and geolocation inaccuracies that were often detrimental to the accuracy of the retrieved velocity vectors.  Also, the previous methods were developed as scientific studies, and as such, require scientific sophistication or computing facilities that make them poor candidates for commercialization.

Acids and bases produced from the regolith are used to aid the preparation of metals (such as iron) and cement ingredients (such as lime and aggregate) for construction of habitats and infrastructure needed for early human colonization.  As more regolith is processed, more acids and bases will be produced for use in manufacture of plastics, metals, polymers, and reagents useful for later, larger-scale human habitation. With the apparent abundance of water in certain locations on Mars, the proposed technology will enable the manufacture and fabrication of a variety of materials using only Mars indigenous materials with the use of processing equipment and catalysts brought from Earth.  The proposed processing methods are capable of extracting and separating regolith constituents via aqueous extraction followed by selective precipitation based on solution pH and oxidation potential. Thermal treatments such as drying (to remove moisture), roasting (to remove volatile sulfate and chloride acid precursors), and oxide reduction (using hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or carbon derived from Martian water and atmosphere) are integrated with the aqueous extraction methods to manufacture the basic building materials required to facilitate human habitation.","The construction of Mars bases will be enabled by technologies that are capable of producing needed structural materials from Mars resources. The proposed MAPS concept uses available Mars resources to produce strong components under less-severe manufacturing conditions than alternative methods. Therefore, MAPS provides the additional benefit of reducing the size and mass of the required manufacturing equipment delivered to Mars from Earth.","Manufacturing technologies aimed at optimizing utilization of raw materials, minimizing equipment mass and complexity, and minimizing operating power have potential payoffs for terrestrial applications.  In particular, developing regions with limited resources could produce useful products if strict composition and manufacturing requirements for export are not needed."

This approach is particularly relevant to future Mars missions, since the Martian atmosphere is comprised of over 95% CO2. The proposed approach will utilize Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) chemistry to selectively convert CO produced by CO2 reduction, e.g., from  reverse water gas shift (RWGS), into hydrocarbons and oxygenates for many applications. The proposed approach is complementary to previous effort by Eltron in which nanoscale catalysts were developed for promoting RWGS. The proposed approach meshes ideally with RWGS in that stoichiometric mixtures of carbon dioxide and hydrogen lead to an H2:CO ratio of approximately 1.5 at the RWGS exit. Phase I will consist of the preparation, characterization, and evaluation of 12-15 candidate catalysts anticipated to have exceptional activity for selective (essentially CO2 free) FTS. Downselection of catalysts and identification of preferred conditions will result during Phase I. Phase II will involve the fabrication and testing of a closed loop system for converting CO2 and hydrogen into fuels, chemicals, plastics, etc.","The technology developed during this proposed project will find use at in-situ resources utilization (ISRU) for conversion of, e.g., Martian CO2 into useful chemicals.  The conversion of CO2 arising from metabolic or other sources would be enabled, providing on-site access to fuels and organic chemicals.","Highly active and selective catalysts discovered under this contract will be immediately applicable toward terrestrial CO2 remediation efforts and even the effective reclamation of fossil fuels.  Carbon monoxide is a valuable raw material utilized for the industrial production of many commodity chemicals including methanol, formaldehyde, and acetic acid. The RWGS reaction is very likely to prove an economically competitive route to conventional carbon monoxide formation processes.

This gives rise to a serious need to develop methods for integrating humans more closely?and more efficiently?than is possible now within hybrid systems.  We propose to apply a recent Raven Research innovation, Achievability Control Theory (ACT) to the problem of integrating multi-agent autonomous and semi-autonomous systems into human-machine teams.

This reality necessitates that we efficiently reconcile two fundamentally different work paradigms: the meticulously planned and controlled world of agents, and the situated, social, context-dependent approach to task execution specific to humans. This proposal investigates the development of interfaces between humans and agents that make the activities of both categories of participants efficient, effective, and robust, while allowing them to operate within their specific work paradigms. Since the work activities in which the mixed human-agent groups will engage will be novel and one-of-a-kind, interface developers will not be able to benefit from the extensive usability feedback available to commercial software developers.

In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to be able to assemble and reassemble modules both on the ground and on orbit.  Therefore, it requires a means to join components that is simple, reliable, and non-intrusive as well as strong and stiff enough to withstand multiple connections and disconnections.  AeroAstro?s solution is to apply a new micro-scale mechanical joining technology, Vaccro, to the modular space systems.  Created by VACCO Industries, Vaccro is analogous to ?metal Velcro? in that two surfaces will mechanically adhere to each other upon contact.  Depending on the type of Vaccro used, these bonds can be either permanent or reversible.  With this technology, the surfaces of space system components and modules would be micro-machined with Vaccro features during the ground fabrication process.  With slightly different channel geometries, the surfaces can be peeled apart and rejoined, or they can be made such that the surfaces lock together permanently.  AeroAstro along with VACCO Industries, proposes to determine the specifications for and material qualities of a space suitable Vaccro product.","The potential of Vaccro technology to NASA, and indeed any significant space mission, is the prospect that it offers for modular construction of space systems either autonomously (when coupled with other technologies) or via robotic and/or EVA methods.  The proposed technology would enable the incremental build-up of complex space systems with an inherent ability to swap-out modules that are in need of replacement due to failure or performance upgrade.  Also, the ability to reconfigure a fully functional space system from a microgravity experiment to a communications experiment could significantly increase the ROI on space systems.","The ability to interconnect space modules on orbit at places where man does not travelvastly expands the envelop of applications.  An ability to connect modules without cables, bolts, or tethers, but simply through an accurate docking process, could extend the reach of man to places that are simply unreachable or unaffordable today.  Defense and commercial systems might also benefit from the Vaccro technology.  Additional transponders launched as piggy-back payloads could be added or malfunctioning transponders replaced, on geosynchronous communications satellites.

However, heat leak into the cryogenic tank causes the stored air to expand and vent, thus limiting the storage life of a charged system.  We propose to develop a storage system for supercritical air tanks that provides cryogenic cooling that will intercept heat leaks to prevent venting and enable long-term storage of charged, supercritical air tanks.  The innovative, mechanical cryocooling system provides flexible coupling and quick disconnection from the storage tanks, as well as high reliability and efficient, low-power operation.  In addition to storage, the system can be used to charge the tanks with supercritical air without the use of expendable cryogens.  In Phase I, we will prove the feasibility of the system through design trade-off and optimization analyses that will produce a conceptual design and operational description of a supercritical air storage system.  The system will be designed to store multiple units of NASA?s existing supercritical air self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) system.  In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate a prototype storage system for supercritical air SCBAs.","NASA plans to use a supercritical air mobility pack (SCAMPTM) for fire rescue from the Space Shuttle launch pad.  The SCAMP SCBA overcomes many of the limitations of current liquid air systems, but the cryogenic tanks still need to be recharged frequently.  The cryogenic cooling system will enable storage for long periods with zero venting.  The system will be very flexible and allow rescue personnel to rapidly disconnect and don the tanks.  The light weight, compact size, high reliability, and high efficiency of our mechanical cooling system will make it ideal for supercritical air storage for future extraterrestrial bases.","By enabling long-term storage of fully-charged SCBAs with zero venting, our cryogenic cooling system will enable the use of supercritical air SCBA for a wide variety of terrestrial applications.  Supercritical air makes an ideal breathing air supply for terrestrial self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) because it can be stored at low pressure in a lightweight system, it operates independently of orientation, the quantity is easily gauged, and the system provides body cooling.  The commercial market for these systems includes firefighters, first responders, search-and-rescue personnel, and HAZMAT teams."

These standards are essential to achieve software agent-based systems whose software is reusable and interoperable.  For NASA, many new developments, from scheduling, to planning and resource allocation, to simulation, to transportation logistics, etc are exploiting the emerging technology of software agents.  Because software agents do not use any form of calling hierarchy to create a total system they are inherently more easily reused and inherently more interoperable than conventional software.  On the other hand, NASA and other users of software agent technology will not fully benefit from this advantage without a better understanding of what is required for software agents to be reusable and interoperable, and without the development of formal specifications and eventually standards that enable diverse developers to build reusable and interoperable software agents. The proposed work will help insure that future software agents developed for KSC are more reusable and more interoperable than what is achieved today.  It also offers Intelligent Automation, Incorporated and KSC the opportunity to make an international impact on agent-based software for the next decade and beyond.",The first NASA application will be the work IAI is already doing for NASA in exploiting software agents in several systems.  The work we propose will help identify and formalize what is required to insure that this code is optimally reusable and interoperable.  Our goal is for NASA to see the overwhelming benefits derivable from this standardization and to then mandate that software agents developed for NASA must conform to the standards.  These standards will not restrict the language in which the agents are coded or the hardware on which they execute.,"IAI already has two products that are used to develop software agent-based systems. Part of the work detailed in this proposal is to modify our products so that they conform to the developing standards, and to use these tools as examples of compliant products.

A scalable, cost-effective, safe, reliable, low mass, robust, high-efficiency, heat-to-electric power convertor is proposed. Innovative aspects include: 1) increased power density through the use of a double-acting MCFPSE, 2) increased system efficiency by improving phase angle and reducing alternator losses, and 3) an innovative duplex linear alternator design with the potential to improve efficiency and reduce mass. This advanced dynamic power system for heat-to-electric power conversion is based on a free-piston implementation of the well-known Siemens four-cylinder heat exchanger interconnection arrangement combined with highly reliable, flexure-supported linear alternators. These proven technologies provide high power density, while retaining the simplicity and long-life inherent with flexure-supported hardware, as evidenced by an on-going 79,000-hour (9-year) maintenance-free, degradation-free endurance test at STC. Power convertors based on this innovative arrangement are scalable up to tens of kilowatts, while modular combinations of coaxially-aligned, opposed power convertors will produce very low net vibration forces.","Potential space applications include solar dynamic and nuclear-reactor power and/or propulsion systems for manned and unmanned flights, and government and commercial solar-satellite power convertors.

Some of the components currently in use such as shelters or transhabs use double-wall thick films with high internal pressure.  All these hollow components are vulnerable in space because of the debris and meteorites that can strike them.  They will lose their functions if hit and damaged by foreign objects. Besides, these deployable structures in space typically rely upon electro-mechanical mechanisms and mechanically expandable booms to deploy structures and maintain them in space for use, which occupy over 90% of the total mass budget in many cases. In this Phase I project, we propose to develop self-deployable, low-density microcellular foamed sandwiches from shape memory polymers or CHEM as structural components of space habitats.   Such a structural module can be compacted into a very small volume to facilitate launching.   The deployment energy is the heat from the sun.  This concept greatly simplifies the entire operation, reduction in weight and cost, and improves reliability.  They also feature great impact resistant.  Foams processed by the conventional chemical-blowing agent have toxicity problems. Our microcellular CHEM foamed sandwiches do not involve any toxicity and will have higher mechanical properties than those processed by the conventional techniques.","The proposed ultra-lightweight microcellular foamed sandwiches from CHEM/SMP have a number of potential applications for space structures including rigidified boom and support structures for Gossamer space structures, rover subsystems like wheels, chasis, insulation boxes masts, solar array deployment devices, shelters and hangars for space habitats, airlocks, electronics boxes, tanks/shells/shields, insulation for propellant tanks, solar arrays radar boards, and support structures for telecommunication subsystems like struts and beams, etc.","Shape memory polymers are fairly recently developed functional polymers that find applications in a broad range of temperature sensing elements.  Shape memory gels have been explored to perform various functions including artificial muscles and organs, drug-delivery devices, chemical valves, and actuators.  Additional potential applications may include self-deployable tanks, coolers/thermoses, construction, toys, automotive components, thermal insulation, packaging, impact energy absorption products, filters, high damping sound and electromagnetic shielding."

AUTOCONNECT not only provides mechanical fastening between modules (irrespective of relative alignments and orientations), but also automatically configures electrical connections among modules. Mechanical attachment occurs due to docking and physical contact between modules with sufficient initial momenta.  The transmitted forces during docking will be much less than the launch forces for which the spacecraft modules are designed. The mass properties of the module assembly are determined on orbit and the entire assembly functions as a spacecraft unit.  Benefits of on-orbit assembly using AUTOCONNECT include: (i) Configurability; mission-specific spacecraft construction by assembling desired subsystem modules (ii) Reconfigurability; adapt to new missions by adding new, advanced technology modules, (iii) On orbit Repair/Refurbishment of existing spacecraft with new, advanced technology subsystems/payloads, and (iv) Lower costs and increased space access by launching smaller and lighter spacecraft modules.  In Phase I, we will demonstrate autoconfiguration of electrical connections between two AUTOCONNECT-equipped modules.  We will experimentally simulate the docking and on-orbit assembly of up to three modules, including real-time mass properties determination and attitude control.","The proposed technology will enable NASA to build large systems in space using smaller, modular subsystems, refurbish spacecraft already in orbit with new technology subsystems/payloads, and service/repair existing subsystems. This modular, on-orbit assembly approach, combined with our concept of modular spacecraft architectures, is especially suited for NASA?s vision of swarms or fleets of spacecraft flying in formation on distributed science missions.  Cost is reduced by manufacturing identical modules in large quantities, but in addition, our approach allows the selection of desired modules and their assembly into a customized spacecraft using AUTOCONNECT and the advanced control algorithms we propose to develop.","Military applications include on-orbit assembly of spacecraft from specific subsystems needed for a particular mission, creation of new spacecraft configurations, or reconfiguration of existing spacecraft. Non-space military applications of AUTOCONNECT include soldiers? clothing, where sensors, communications equipment, instruments, etc, can be simply attached as needed for the battlefield environment. AUTOCONNECT allows assembly of systems without connectors and cables, e.g., computer and home electronic systems, ?smart? walls in buildings, where sensors/monitors can be attached anywhere, etc.  Elimination of connectors and cables will make systems lighter, more compact, and improve both the aesthetics and safety at home and the workplace."

The first feature is the choice of an edge emitter geometry known to be much more robust compared to other geometries such as tip emitters or nanotube configurations.  The second feature is the choice of carbon as the emitter material.  Carbon is well known for resistance to damage from ion bombardment.  The third feature is the deposition of the carbon edge emitter inside one end of a channel plate.  The channel plate provides some shielding from the thruster ion stream.

Previously, electrostatic ion propulsion systems have used ion production mechanisms based on electron bombardment ionization, contact ionization, or direct ion extraction from field emission structures.  In contrast, ceramic membranes operate at modest temperatures and are theoretically capable of forming ions at ion energy costs that approach dissociation energies (e.g., ~1-2 eV/ion).  In addition to being readily scalable to larger sizes, the ion flux through the ceramic membranes is easily controlled over large ranges and this enables deep throttling capabilities.  Ceramic membranes are rugged and insensitive to contamination from atmospheric gases, and they have displayed very long lifetimes in similar applications.  Furthermore, ceramic membranes do not require the high voltages associated with field emission schemes.","The Emissive Membrane Ion Thruster (EMIT) device would perform deep-space to near Earth mission duties very well.  It has the flexibility of throttlable thrust and extended continuous operation.

In this project, Ultramet proposes to build upon its experience with monolithic catalyst beds and develop a small, low pressure drop, monolithic catalyst bed optimized for use with Tridyne.","The proposed technology can be used by any small spacecraft where, due to its low mass, the total required impulse over the life of the mission is small.

Previously, CCD technology has demonstrated EUV instability as well as degraded performance in radiation environments. Fortunately, CMOS imager technology has evolved to the stage that it is now feasible to fabricate multi-pixel arrays of diodes that can be absolutely calibrated and that are robust against radiation damage. CMOS sensors are less susceptible to radiation damage of the type that would disable entire regions of a CCD sensor. Nevertheless, the technology requires improved radiation tolerance. There currently does not exist a high performance, rad hard, EUV CMOS sensor.   To address these needs, Voxtel Inc. proposes to optimize the design of a radiation-hard, SOI CMOS back-illuminated EUV sensor with enhanced sensitivity and stable operation. The innovation?s reduced optical cross section (app. 500nm) increases the imager?s resolution, reduces radiation effects, and reduces the operating voltages required for silicon depletion. The ultra thin charge collection region is achieved through a novel, back-thinning method that offers superior manufacturability, stability, and reliability while maintaining compatibility with mainstream semiconductor fabrication processes. The low capacitance of SOI combined with our ultra-low noise amplifier design achieves previously unobtainable EUV imaging capabilities.","EUV imagers are used to study the structure of the Earth's plasmasphere and its dynamic response to changes in the level of magnetospheric activity during geomagnetic storms and magnetospheric substorms, as well studies for general Solar Research, Aeronomy, Auroral Physics, Sodium- Dayglow measures, Diffuse Far UV Backgrournd, EUV Spectroscopy of Astronomic Objects, Plasma Physics, Study of Helium Geocorona, and Galactic X-ray Astronomy.","Unique to this proposed device is the APS imagers?s radiation tolerance and its capability for wideband sensitivity from the EUV through to the NIR spectral range. These characteristics make it ideal for the growing market for commercial satellite star trackers. Additionally, the nearly ideal responsivity benefits a broad range of optical microscopy, spectroscopy, nondestructive test, machine vision, surveillance, autonomous navigation, remote sensing, and astronomy applications. The EUV response of the detector benefits submicron photolithography, x-ray spectroscopy, plasma diagnostics, and nuclear physics."

The manufacturing process combines three critical technologies: a slip cast, Reaction Bonded (RB) SiC, an amorphous silicon (Si) coating, and Computer Controlled Optical Surfacing (CCOS) technology.  This combination of technologies addresses two critical areas required for enabling cost effective precision optics for large aperture UV and EUV applications:  lightweighting of the optical substrate and polishing effort required for reaching final figure and finish.  The proposed optical manufacturing flow provides solutions in both of these areas.  The ability to near net shape lightweight RB SiC significantly reduces the machining required to prepare the substrate for optical surfacing.  The use of a Si-coating on the RB SiC makes it possible substantially improve the removal rate-reducing the time and cost required to precision figure and finish the optic.  CCOS superpolishing techniques will be developed that deterministically achieve excellent figure accuracies (<0.01 waves RMS) and low microroughness (< 10 Angstroms RMS) for very low areal densities (~10 kg/m2 at an aperture of 1 meter).

Two proposed NASA missions will require anticoincidence shielding for gamma-ray spectrometers: the Mars Lander and a Space Science Vision Mission expected to visit Titan, one of Saturn?s moons. Shielding improves the performance of gamma-ray spectrometers by reducing the effect of charged particle interactions which can not be distinguished from true gamma-ray interactions by the spectrometer. Active shields produce a blanking signal when a charged particle is detected, so that the signal from the spectrometer can be ignored during the spectrometer?s charged-particle interaction. While it is well know that this technique produces significant improvement in gamma-ray spectrometer performance, the technology to implement it is lacking. The attributes of mercuric iodide make it an excellent candidate for anticoincidence shielding detectors. Because of its detection characteristics, light weight, small size, low cost, robustness, and ease of application to non-planar geometries, this material can replace the costly, heavy, and bulky scintillator/photomultiplier tube (PMT) systems currently in use. The application of this new material for space-based astrophysical observations will provide excellent background suppression with improved mass and volume characteristics.","Space-based gamma-ray spectrometers will benefit from the proposed polycrystalline mercuric iodide active anticoincidence shield. Gamma-ray spectroscopy is a widely used tool in planetary science and astrophysics, providing valuable information on such diverse topics as planetary composition and the nature of gamma-ray bursts. Both the proposed Mars Lander and a proposed Space Science Vision Mission for visiting Titan will require anticoincidence shielding for their gamma-ray spectrometers.","Because of the small volume and flexible shape of the proposed mercuric iodide detectors, they have a potential application as coincidence or anticoincidence detectors for charged particles in complex high-energy physics detectors, where detector volume near the emission point is often extremely limited. By placing the material onto a curved surface, detectors may be placed in spaces previously unused because planar detectors do not fit.

The detection is by free carrier absorption in  doped emitter layers followed by internal photoemission of the carrier over the interfacial workfunction and collection of the photoemitted carriers. The workfunction, and hence cutoff, can be adjusted by varying the composition of the emitter and barrier layers. The key properties of the proposed detectors are broadband response and the ability to tailor cutoff and a NEP of 10^{-20} W Hz^{-1/2}. In Phase II, the HEIWIP detector will be combined with an LED to form an up-conversion device whose output can be read with a conventional NIR CCD. The HEIWIP-LED detector system would have the ability to cover the range from 40-300 microns or longer in an array format without the use of a multiplexer with spatial resolution determined by the NIR CCDs. Because the HEIWIP would not be divided into pixels, the HEIWIP-LED would not have the difraction problems affecting focal plane arrays responding to 300 microns.","The ability to use a single power source for the detector and LED will reduce the mass and power requirements, fulfilling low cost, mass, and power requirements for NASA missions. The Filled Aperture InfraRed  instrument will require detectors in this range. For planetary missions the HEIWIP could provide useful new capabilities for studying solar system objects. HEIWIPs could enhance the current remote sensing capabilities for mineral components, and the composition and structure of atmospheres. HEIWIPs will be useful in studying composition of gas clouds identifying features such as the 158 micron C+ line, HD in  planetary atmospheres and nonequilibrium molecules.","Aside from astronomy applications, the IR detector market covers a wide range, with a market capitalization of tens of billion dollars.

Of critical importance to success of the PT/RB is the development of the small-scale turbine required for the reverse-Brayton stage. We propose to build such a turbine for inclusion in a brassboard PT/RB soon to be constructed under a separate contract. The turbine will incorporate pressurized bearings that generate a supporting force by applying a high-pressure source of gas to a flow restriction that exhausts into the bearing clearance and onto the turbine shaft surface. Pressurized bearings provide support even in the absence of shaft rotation and therefore eliminate rubbing contact and increase the life and reliability of the bearing. Also, because pressurized bearings do not directly depend on viscous action for operation, relatively larger clearances can be used without significantly sacrificing rotordynamic performance at low temperatures, thus making them cost effective.","The proposed turbine with pressurized bearings will make the pulse-tube/reverse-Brayton cryocooler currently under development by Atlas Scientific possible.

Below about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators.  One is that the heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thereby, severely limiting the number of useful materials to a few in common use.  A second factor is that these commonly used materials are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues.  In this effort, we will address both factors.

These missions will require optics of unprecedented optical tolerances to achieve scientific success and extremely low weight in order to be deployed. The optics will most certainly be adaptive in order to obtain initial optical figure and eliminate aberrations due to thermal or other environmentally induced drift. New actuation and control technology will be required to obtain areal densities well below that of 15kg/m2 currently being considered for the Webb Telescope.

The device consists of Segmented Membrane Arrays (SMA) and bottom electrodes with Backside Solder Bump (BSB). The design is going to use arrays of mirror pixels to eliminate the cross talk with adjacent elements, which is usually observed in continuous membrane devices. Each mirror pixel could perform both piston motion and tip-tilt motion to eliminate diffraction noise from the mirror edges. Since each mirror pixel is independent from each other, the resonant frequency of the arrays will not decrease as the array aperture scales up. The BSB provides the packaging solution for high-resolution devices by direct electric contact through solder bump, instead of conventional wire bond techniques. It opens new opportunities to make ideal deformable mirrors with large-throw and independent addressing capabilities.","The success of the prototype development will lead to the engineering product. The proposed device could dramatically reduces the cost of making deformable mirrors and boost up the resolution of addressing elements. The immediate applications would include sever aberration corrections in the telescope systems, optical pickup head in the 3D data storage systems, etc.","Due to the nature of batch fabrication process of SMA, the cost could drop dramatically. The typical cost to manufacture a 6 inch wafer using a mature CMOS (pure electronic) process is approximately $10K per wafer. Additional processes to bond the BSB and electronic circuits will add an additional $10K. After factoring in other possible costs, as well as a 100% makeup in the price, each wafer should cost no more than $50K. Now, we know that the total resolution of this 6inch wafer will be 1000X1000, i.e. one million elements. Therefore, the cost per element is $0.05. We compare with currently available 6 inch diameter deformable mirrors with actuators in the order of 10X10 elements, the total cost per device will be $100K because each actuator cost $1K typically to perform both tip-tilt and piston motion. Considering the price per actuators drop from $1K to $0.05 (5 orders of magnitude) due to MEMS batch fabrication process, it seems reasonable that the development of MEMS will open up more potential applications in both commercial and military fields which were previously impossible to consider due to the high-cost of deformable mirrors."

UVDM was cryo-tested from 300 K to 27 K at NASA MSFC in the 4-foot XRCF chamber on 2 separate occasions, once uncoated and once with a multiple-layer dielectric coating.

More importantly, we intend to build on the standard models, which describe the effects of radiation, and develop software that would enable the modeling and simulation of radiation effects.First we will consider conventional nanoelectronic devices --- that is those where charge transport is based on the usual principles of drift and diffusion.   Then a tool for the effects of radiation on single electron transistors and amplifiers (including those based on carbon nanotubes) would also be developed. Using the software, methods to mitigate the effects of radiation by rad-hard designs will be examined.","In many of NASA's spaceflight programs, commercial off-the-shelf  (COTS) components are the only components that can provide the required performance, and meet physical requirements such as weight, power consumption, volume, etc.  The effects of radiation on COTS integrated circuits are fairly complex. Hence there is ongoing work at NASA in the development, selection or preparation of electronics that can operate in the space radiation environment. This proposed software tool would assist in the aforementioned development efforts, and can contribute to the program on radiation hardness assurance of electronics components.","Modeling and simulation tools are essential during every stage of the design and fabrication of electronic circuits --- such tools enable tremendous savings in time and cost.There is general agreement, among engineers who must tackle the issue of radiation hardness, about the urgent need for software tools in this area.The primary customers are expected to be engineers in industrial laboratories, researchers in the DOD and government laboratories, academic researchers, and chip designers."

For Space Station Freedom the structure is grounded to the negative of the solar array and hence is about 140 volts below plasma potential. The discharge across the discontinuities caused by the micro-meteoroids can generate electromagnetic interference and even sputtering of the underlying metallic layer. The rub-primed binder that fills the micro-porosity resulted from the anodized aluminum at the  surface can help with prevention of electromagnetic interference. This has potential to simplify the grounding schemes and minimize the costs associated with the same.

In the MSBL concept, a dark colored or metalized zero pressure balloon is inflated with Martian atmospheric CO2 during initial descent suspended by a parachute.. As a result of the favorable optical qualities of the balloon?s coloration, the gas inside the balloon is warmed to temperatures considerably exceeding the surrounding ambient atmosphere, thereby providing buoyancy. The MSBL can thus achieve stable level flight during daylight, or can be used to deliver payloads to the ground with arbitrarily low rates of descent. After the payload is landed, the balloon can be released for a free flight remote sensing mission, or can be  retained as a tethered asset by the lander serving many useful functions, including local aerial imaging, communications, or lander towing. Key technical challenges to the MSBL concern dealing with horizontal velocity during terminal descent. However the MSBL is competitive on a mass basis when compared to alternative landing technologies such as airbags, and offers many novel additional capabilities for combined surface and aerial operations.","The primary purpose of the MBSL is to provide a low cost, low mass means of soft landing payloads on Mars. The system can also be used to tow the lander at considerable speed across the Martian landscape, simultaneously providing aerial context imaging and other remote sensing data from its own gondola carried aloft. The solar balloon can increase its lift and fly the payload across chasms, as necessary. Such a mission could travel long distances across the Martian pole in summer, producing a science bonanza as it images and samples the surface across a wide swath of sites.","The MBSL perform surveys across the polar regions of the Earth, mapping the circulation and sounding the ozone layer at many altitudes through long periods of polar summer. The MSBL landing system is also an attractive means of delivering payloads to the ground. Currently, the primary means of air-delivering payloads to areas where aircraft landing is impossible (and helicopter capacity is inadequate or too expensive) involves paradrop, which can be very violent and damaging to the payload. Using a solar balloon lander, much gentler delivery of equipment from air to ground could be achieved."

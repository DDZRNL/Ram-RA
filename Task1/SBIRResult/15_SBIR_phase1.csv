The HD6D imaging consists of high resolution, rapid framing 3D LIDAR and RGB camera images fused to give an HD resolution image.  The LIDAR output and RGB camera output feed TAMU feature tracking algorithms which give 6DOF relative pose information to all bodies in the FOV.  The images are fused into rigid bodies continuously updated as the imaging continues.  The 6DOF relative pose information simplifies navigation and rendezvous activities and greatly reduces HD6D image transmission, as the up dated Voxels (volume pixels) of each body can be sent at longer intervals.  Range resolution for the HD6D is 3mm at close range, 28mm at acquisition range.  Maximum range for the HD6D LIDAR is 30Km.   The 32 channel receiver 3D imaging rate is range fold over limited to 12.8Mpps to 375m varying to 160Kpps at longest range.  The laser transmits a phase coded pulse train which allows a 13/1 pulse compression increasing signal to noise level by 13x and reducing peak power by13x for a given joule transmit.

NASA in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has been conducting research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control (DEC) architectures. Realization of such future intelligent engines depends on the development of both hardware and software, including high temperature electronics and sensors to make smart components. NASA is particularly interested in the design and development of these applications for assessing the benefit they bring to the engine system. Compressor discharge pressure measurement has long been a key aspect of turbine engine control to manage stall margin. Given that, there is a need for a high-temperature, smart P3 sensor as a key building block for distributed engine controls. Given the current limitations of high temperature electronics, the business case for smart control elements (sensors and actuators) can be made in the fan/compressor section of the engine. The long-term objective of the proposed effort is to advance high-temperature P3 sensor technology for DEC applications through working with OEM partners and industry working groups to: (1) to iterate the current technology toward DEC formats/functions, (2) advance the digital electronics design/firmware and high temperature electronics, and (3) (through demonstration and stakeholder collaboration) present the viability (technical and business case) of the proposed sensor.","The proposed sensor directly supports NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) research thrusts including vehicle safety, efficiency and carbon emission reduction.  The sensor is also directly applicable to a planetary exploration mission to Venus since a high temperature sensor that does not require cooling will significantly reduce payload weight, volume, and complexity. Space propulsion systems, including chemical rockets, nuclear thermal propulsion, launch and station keeping, all exhibit high temperatures and would benefit from the proposed technology. Energy generation systems such as Stirling engines and fuel cells also have high operational temperatures that could be monitored by the proposed sensor. In situ resource utilization systems utilize high temperatures and pressures and would benefit from the proposed technology.  Derivative sensor technology could potentially be applied for sensing conditions in thermal protection systems for alloy and ceramic matrix composite structural components.","Aero propulsion turbine engines, communally used in commercial and military jets, would benefit significantly by having a non-invasive, small mass, on engine component sensor allowing for visibility of the conditions in the turbine engine. The technology and sensor product described in this proposal would allow exactly that, while existing sensors fall well short of the application's demand. The conditions in this application are harsh, and sensors must be able to withstand high temperatures, high pressures, high flow rates, jet fuel, and exhaust. In order for existing and future aero propulsion turbine engines to improve safety, reduce cost, and emissions while controlling engine instabilities, more accurate and complete information is necessary. The technology described in this proposal would allow the next boundary in sensing technology to be achieved: direct measurement from the point of interest within the turbine. Commercial applications abound for the successful results of this proposal in commercial and military turbine engine industries, which are made up of companies such as GE, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce.

The FAA is currently developing the regulatory framework for safely integrating small UAS (sUAS) into routine national airspace System (NAS) operations. The introduction of UAS in the NAS offer advantages over manned aircraft for applications which can be hazardous to human pilots, are long in duration, require greater precision, and require rapid response.  Startup UAS companies have proposed using UAS for remote sensing, disaster response, delivery of goods, agricultural support, and many other beneficial applications. One significant aspect in an efficient NAS is the development of autonomous capabilities for UAS and the technologies that supports the safe implementation UAS autonomy.  AI proposes to support NASA's UAS autonomy effort by developing an imaging sensor based command and control system that takes advantage of the 3-axis accelerometers that are in smart devices prevalent in the consumer electronics market for autonomous UAS operations.  The paradigm shift from human piloted system to an autonomously operated aircraft will require both successful development of sensor technology and image processing techniques to allow for the systematic translation in the human to machine interface.While the majority of current UAS operators are trained UAS pilots, the availability of these specialized pilots may not meet the demand that is anticipated for future commercial UAS companies.  Additionally, more intuitive piloting controls are needed to enable wide spread adaption of this technology and the subsequent evolution to a more autonomous operation. The work described in this proposal will provide the foundation to enable development of a UAS with intuitive flight controls","The potential NASA commercial application exists in continued development of autonomy in UAS for the integration in NextGen.   NASA researchers could use the resulting designs and/or prototypes of this research to extend their current work in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate to develop and evaluate the efficacy of newer, more human-centric autonomous control systems for UAS. Additionally, the identification and evaluation of operational functions will help NASA in developing a hierarchical taxonomy of autonomy of UAS functions. The results of the image processing techniques can also be used in manned aviation systems and potentially for interplanetary robotic missions where autonomy would provide more independent, but safer exploration of unknown environments.","Demand for more intuitive and autonomous control system for UAS will increase in the future as more applications are being developed for UAS in the NAS.  Technologies that will help UAS operators perform their intended functions while maintaining the equivalent level of safety will be essential for their acceptance and inclusion in the NAS.  Development of a low-cost airworthy all weather imaging sensor system can be incorporated into commercial UAS to help maintain safe operations in the terminal and enroute area in the NextGen. Safe, reliable, autonomously operating UAS can reduce the cost of monitoring infrastructure that span across physical distance, challenging terrain, and normally inaccessible places.  While the paradigm may shift at different rates, it is clear that the development of autonomous functions will help pave the way to a better defined national airspace where piloted and unmanned system can coexist to increase the productivity of our national economy and improve the human condition where UAS will be working to monitor our safety and provide assistance when needed.Image processing techniques to improve the sensing capabilities is desired across many disciplines and within other non-NASA agencies.  The ability to derive information from pixels in low visibility or inclement weather is important to the Department of Defense, NOAA, National Weather Service, Department of Interior, and agencies where imagery is a critical source for information mining.",Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Processing; Electromagnetic; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Infrared; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems); Visible,Autonomy of the National Airspace System (NAS)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These characteristics enable accurate robotic operations under conditions of uncertainty.  Operating in SWIR will permit LIDAR operation without inducing noise effects in Vis/VNIR passive sensors which may be operating simultaneously and near the LIDAR.  The technical approach will support a wide ,UV to MWIR,  spectrum of operating wavelengths by change out of photocathode and optimization of the subsequent amplification and readout parameters.","The proposed LIDAR is directly applicable to deep space missions that involve planetary, asteroid, or comet autonomous landings and missions that involve operations near small extraterrestrial bodies.  In addition to these primary mission candidates, the LIDAR technology can be exploited to aid operations of Unmanned Air Vehicles in the National Air Space and for precision wide area 3D mapping missions that can exploit the high resolutions and high sensitivities provided by the technology.","The principal attribute of the proposed LIDAR system is its significantly increased area search rate capability while simultaneously achieving very high resolution and very high sensitivity.

D. Miller and Associates proposes to investigate a new class of thermal insulations that will enable thermal protection systems (TPS) on ceramic matrix composite (CMC) hot structures and Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIAD).  One insulation will embed silicon carbide aerogel in silicon carbide fibers to create a super-efficient, flexible insulation optimized for use at temperatures of 3500F and pressures >10 Torr.  Another will demonstrate a lightweight, load bearing insulation that has borosilicate microballoons embedded in a borosilicate fiber matrix.  The research team has prior experience developing a family of thermal insulations that have opacifiers embedded in a flexible fiber matrix.  Testing has proven that these opacified fibrous insulations (OFI) are twice as efficient as unopacified insulations at temperatures >2000F and pressures <10 Torr.  The proposed work will build on that proven concept by developing super-efficient, flexible insulations with aerogels, intumescents and microballoons embedded in silicon carbide, zirconia and silica fiber matrices.  This will significantly reduce the weight of TPS on future NASA missions, reducing the cost of missions to Mars and other planets.","Research at NASA by Walker et al. ""Preliminary Development of a Multifunctional Hot Structure Heat Shield"" indicates that the TPS on the SpaceX Dragon could be reduced by 151 lbs. if super-efficient flexible blanket insulations are used in combination with a CMC hot structure.  It is predicted that weight savings could be even greater on Mars entry vehicles, depending on the size of the vehicle and the entry trajectory.","The Army, Air Force and DARPA have strong interest in long range, high speed vehicles.  The proposed class of insulations will make those vehicles more efficient, more reliable and more effective.  The methods of making these materials are expected to be lower than some less effective alternate materials, which may enable industrial applications in oil refineries and automobiles.","Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Extreme Temperature Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The sources of vibroacoustic excitation are mainly due to noise generated by the launcher during ignition, lift-off, and atmospheric flight.  Typically, foam or fiberglass claddings and cores or acoustic liners which incorporate resonating chambers are used to prevent the transmission of sound through such structural locations. However, this approach is found to be ineffective for vibroacoustic sources with dominant frequency content below 400 Hz.  It is proposed to develop a metamaterial-inspired composite structure incorporating low-frequency vibro-impact resonating elements coupled with conventional high-frequency acoustic absorbers. The idea is to employ structurally-integral tuned resonators to pick up energy from incident low-frequency sound waves and utilizing the mechanism of frequency up-conversion via impacts, transfer the energy to higher modes in the sandwich primary structure for subsequent dissipation with conventional acoustic absorbers. The advantage of the proposed structure would be in reducing the transmitted pressure of low frequency waves, for which conventional methods are ineffective.  Our initial bound for the attachment mass is within 5 to 10% of the baseline structure to show significant peak pressure reduction for LF waves. The state-of-the-art conventional absorbers provide about 10-20% sound transmission loss (STL) in the 100-150 Hz range. Our performance objective is to achieve STL of about 50-60% in frequency range below 400 Hz with 5-10% mass increase without deteriorating stiffness response of the structure. Successful completion of Phase I work will result in a ""proof-of-concept"" MIAS unit cell. In Phase II, detailed design and fabrication of the MIAS prototype panel will be completed.","The NASA applications primarily include launch vehicles. The proposed solution can be used in primary and supporting structures to reduce the transmission of vibroacoustic energy to subsystems and payloads. In case of manned flights, the transmission of acoustic and vibrational energy to modules accommodating astronauts has to be minimized. The proposed MIAS panels directly integrated into module structure is highly desirable as long as weight and size constraints are satisfied.  Aeronautical applications to increase fatigue life and quieten the internal space are also aggressively pursued by NASA.  The proposed concept is equally applicable to aeronautical structures.","Obvious commercial and general aviation applications to increase fatigue life and reduce internal noise level has the largest potential for commercializing the technology. The defense aerospace applications will also benefit from the technology. As cost of technology is reduced, it opens up limitless applications in all ground and ship transportation market sectors. Structural cladding for protective packaging systems and civil infrastructural partitions where low frequency acoustic insulation is critical can be the next potential market. As multifunctionalities are incorporated into the technology, energy harvesting for field-deployed equipment in remote locations where ambient low frequency acoustic environment is prevalent can be a niche market for the technology.

Fuel consumption represents a significant factor in powered flight operations; it is desirable therefore to limit the fuel consumption in order to extend an aircraft's flight range and/or flight duration. Glider pilots use their knowledge in micrometeorology to locate and exploit sources of lift. The same soaring techniques could be used with UAV, to exploit atmospheric energy that is renewable. The exploitation of this source of energy can be automated using a controller that will correct the aircraft trajectory in order to optimize the climb rate and thus the average cruising speed. Dynamic soaring is the final source of energy that exploits the differential wind velocity at different heights.  In Phase I, we propose to build a map of potential updrafts based on terrain and meteorological conditions and test the validity of this map using actual data extracted from sailplane contests. The data will provide the horizontal and vertical glider speeds; using glider polars will allow us to extract information of the vertical movement of the surrounding airmass. This information will be used by a novel controller that will direct the UAV through locations or rising air, while keeping the aircraft on trajectory to target. The flight of a model UAV through selected topographic and atmospheric conditions will be simulated. Comparisons to actual archived flight data will be made. In Phase II, we will fabricate, program and integrate the developed controller on a real UAV. With the UAV equipped with cameras, it will be possible to visually locate the updraft columns that are marked by fair weather cumulus clouds and manually direct the UAV to such columns. The controller performance in optimizing the aircraft climb rate will then be tested.","NASA will be able to develop novel UAVs that will exploit atmospheric features and increase the efficiency of these aircraft. Moreover NASA expressed a need for improving dropsondes. In order to explore more efficiently atmospheric features, these dropsondes need to be guided.  The technology developed in this proposal can be applied to these devices.","The development of an autopilot optimizing the fuel consumption is of interest to the civilian and military market.Usage of UAVs by military forces is rapidly accelerating. One of the advantages of unmanned systems is that they can be very light since they do not need to carry a pilot. When unmanned aircraft are piloted from the ground, the communication can be intercepted and the aircraft cannot remain stealthy.  Therefore, it is desirable for a UAV to fly autonomously for the longest period of time. Our approach that allows the aircraft to fly autonomously for extended periods of time has strong support from Boeing and Lockheed-Martin (see letters of support at end of proposal) and can be used with their fleet of vehicles such as the K-MAX, Desert Hawk III, Sky Spirit, SURGE-V, EER, Samurai, and Nighthawk Micro UAVs.","Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems); Verification/Validation Tools",Unmanned Aircraft and Sounding Rocket Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

NASA is currently requiring improved mobile robotics navigation solutions for operation in both man-made and unstructured environments based on emerging state-of-the-art sensors and software. A common theme in planetary exploration missions is lacking access to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), making autonomous navigation of vehicles such as rovers significantly difficult. For addressing NASA's needs, the proposed technology will provide terrain-aware and infrastructure-free navigation with: (1) advanced vision processing; (2) robot localization without GNSS based on fusion of various odometry sources; (3) terrain traversability estimation, where measured terrain parameters are matched to terramechanics models for assessing trafficability; and (4) local map generation. Phase II work takes these technologies as a foundation for adaptive collision avoidance of semi/fully-autonomous robotics based on consistent global maps generation and optimal route planning navigation.","The RT-INSPEX will directly support NASA's future missions ranging from the exploration of remote planetary surfaces (assuming very limited and time-delayed Earth-based communication) to assistive operations in man-made structures. The pervasive use of intelligent robotics with accurate navigation capabilities will enhance exploration and facilitate mapping of uncharted regions. NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers and Mars Science Laboratory rover are examples of robotic systems that can be deployed with the developed technologies. An immediate application would be the ""K10"" series from the NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group, but also other systems such as the Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity Mars Rovers, ATHLETE, and Robonaut 2. Parts of the technology would find use in unmanned aerial vehicles such as when VTOL flight on Mars is possible. NASA exploration missions involving Mars, small planetary bodies such as asteroids, and the moons of the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn would benefit from this system.","One of the main objectives of this SBIR is the commercialization of the research results. The RT-INSPEX is a highly useful GNSS-free robotic navigation system and therefore presents significant application potential for a wide range of non-NASA systems within both the civilian and military sectors. Examples of areas the technology would find application in include: (1) robotic supply chain logistics support; (2) GPS-free navigation for both manned and unmanned ground, air, and sea vehicles; (3) military missions involving unmanned platforms such as the XM1216 Small UGV and XM156 Class I UAV; (4) accurate floor plan mapping of GPS-denied indoor environments that pose risk for human intervention; (5) Robotic surveillance applications (ranging anywhere from large commercial facilities to dangerous battlefields); and (6) search and rescue missions (for example, in mining accidents with the leakage of poisonous gases).",3D Imaging; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Inertial (see also Sensors); Intelligence; Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Perception/Vision; Ranging/Tracking; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),"Human Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystem, Manipulation Subsystem, and Human System Interaction   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The choice of the flow management technique to employ and the timing, extent, and other parameters associated with the technique are determined by controller judgment informed by experience.  However, experience is only as useful as the information that can be assimilated from it, and in the case of flow management decisions the available information is limited and biased.We propose to research and prototype a system that will provide controllers with the metrics they need to understand how their past decisions fared.  Our proposal in this Phase I SBIR is to perform the research to determine how well such metrics could be made to function. Phase II would extend the work to implement metrics that could be used within NASA efforts and later transitioned to the FAA for its use.The proposed metrics do not attempt to determine what the ""correct"" level of restrictions would have been.  The appropriate amount of restriction to apply in any situation is a matter of judgment that must weigh the certainty of the information on which it is based as well as the outcomes that would result from errors in either direction.  Rather, the metric would quantify the restrictions' performance in hindsight.  To quantify performance of a GDP, for instance, it would measure the degree to which tactical flow management had to make up for excessive airborne demand for the airport, and the degree to which insufficient demand was available to fill the airport's capacity.  Second-order effects the metric would quantify include the degree to which the traffic originating in-center, in tier one, in tier two, and farther away gained or lost priority relative to each other, indicative of the GDP's timing relative to the timing of the demand/capacity imbalance.","This work is central to NASA's mission to understand and to improve the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS).  Flow management is critical to maintaining the safety of the NAS, but when overdone results in large but unquantified costs to the system.  The results of this work would lead to metrics that would quantify the costs and risks in the NAS due to overly or insufficiently restrictive flow management.The main product to be used by NASA from this research will be a system to measure these inefficiencies in flow management actions taken across the NAS.  The quantification of the need for more research into flow management techniques, decision aids, and related systems will be greatly improved by the product of the proposed research.  Further, the design of solutions to the flow management problems identified will be guided by the product's findings.The proposed product would allow NASA to understand not only how great the inefficiencies in the real world are, but it would also be embeddable in simulation tools such as SMART-NAS for measurement of the inefficiencies of proposed improvements to the NAS.Without a solid understanding of the problems inherent in the operation of the NAS, it is very difficult to identify solutions that need to be developed.  The product to be developed from this research will provide NASA a clear understanding of the problems, which will point the way to effective solutions needed to further NASA's objectives.","The two anticipated non-NASA commercial applications are applications for ANSP's such as the FAA, and applications for airspace users such as major commercial airlines.  Both applications are anticipated to help the customer refine their approach to flow management. Large commercial airlines that dominate operations at an airport at times run ground delay programs on their own to avoid the need for an ANSP-run GDP.  UPS and others have experimented with more tactical flow management as well, such as by coordinating airspeeds and spacing to try to deliver an efficient flow of aircraft to the destination while minimizing fuel burns.  In undertaking either type of flow management, the airline must weigh the tradeoffs in their decisions of when to start restrictions, when to end restrictions, the level of the restrictions, and the flights to be involved in the restrictions.ANSP's have to make the same types of decisions, but for a broader set of operators and with less detailed knowledge of each flight's operating and financial characteristics. In both cases, the ability to measure past performance is critical to improving performance in the future.  The results of our proposed research will be applicable to helping both types of organizations to improve flow management decisions.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Sequencing & Scheduling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This concept uses a combination of proven composite manufacturing processes, such as filament winding, pultrusion, and UV curing resins systems.  The system has the capability to ""print"" advanced composite truss (ACT) structures from raw materials carried up during launch.  This concept minimizes launch volume allowing for space for other mission-critical equipment, and allows for the deployment of much larger structures than the current state-of-the art.  Deployed structures using SDC's continuous Advanced Composite Truss (ACT) printing system would be limited in length only by the ultimate structural capabilities of the material and truss structure.  While the application addressed for this particular proposal deals with structures in the hundreds of feet, this concept could be extended to create structures in excess of 1000s of feet if tailored for a different given integration platforms.There are many advantages to this methodology.  First of all, the entire produced structure is load carrying without fasteners, joints, or secondary materials.  Secondly, high modulus fibers can be used as the primary load carrying material creating the efficient structure from a stiffness/weight perspective.  Another advantage of the process is that it can be programmable for ""printing"" the optimized structures.  Also, the structures are manufactured and cured in space after all of the high vibration loading associated with launch are over.  SDC's continuous ACT printing method can also be integrated with the deployment strategy for a solar sail or array.  This would maximize the use of the hardware and help to justify the light-weight machine.","The SBIR Phase I project focus is on the near-term Asteroid Redirect Mission which requires deployable structure capabilities. SDC will demonstrate feasibility of continuous ACT structure printing for use with deployable structures based on the ARM system design and mission objectives. The ultimate intent of the Phase I project is to develop and evaluate a new, novel deployable structure mechanism with mission and structure tailorability. SDC has aligned the schedule and scope of the SBIR project with NASA's proposed ARM development roadmap. A Phase II SBIR will develop the continuous ACT printing process by developing a prototype machine to perform the manufacturing.  The Phase II will also see improved analysis and design techniques with the manufacturability, strength-to-weight ratio, and structural capabilities of the structures at the heart of the development effort.  According to NASAs current plans for ARM, the mission will be developed in the early 2020 decade, for which SDC is confident that working continuous ACT printing machine will be available for deployable structures.  Further development plans for continuous ACT printed structures include all space missions that require deployable structures for SEP, as well as in-situ structural repairs for any and all spacecraft such as the ISS.","The need for a low-cost, light-weight, space deployable structure is far broader than the proposed scope of this Phase I project. SDC recognizes the high potential for continuous ACT structures to be an enabling technology for future satellite and ISS or other future space station structures.  Long-term low-earth orbit satellites could utilize these structures minimize launch volume/weight. This type of deployable structure could be applied and tailored to each mission's specific structural needs, with the process being easily scalable and reprogrammable.  Continuous ACT printed structures could be used as in-situ structural repairs for the ISS, additional deployable structure for solar arrays for all types of space crafts, as well as numerous other structural applications.","Actuators & Motors; Characterization; Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Photon Sails (Solar; Laser); Prototyping; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The ModelLab will address this concern by providing an entirely new type of user experience that will make geospatial modeling capabilities available not only to trained geospatial professionals, but also to non-technical users in a broad range of public and private sector positions.  Further, it will both simplify and shorten the development process for a host of model-driven software applications by providing developers with a growing catalog of well-crafted models to build and innovate from.","The proposed ModelLab will support NASA applications across three critical areas of interest.  First, it will address NASA's   need for creative new methodologies that can harness computing power necessary to process large geospatial datasets efficiently.  Efficiency in this context is largely a matter of faster processing times, and the proposed project promises to increase these speeds significantly for geospatial modeling.  Second, it can assist the Langley Research Center's GIS Team, which is recognized as a leader in GIS technology.  ModelLab will be designed for integration with existing geospatial data processing toolkits from both commercial and academic sources that can be aligned with Langley objectives on a project-by-project basis.

Each PC consists of cylindrical aluminum ribs (blades) with varying radii, alignment frames to guide the blade positions and the blade housing body. The alignment frame and the housing are made of Aluminum 6061 and 7075 alloy, respectively. A heat-forming process with thin aluminum sheets is used to produce the ribs that run between the alignment frame.We are proposing a new method to build a PC out with emerging technologies, using Additive Manufacturing (AM) to build a blank that is the rough shape of the PC but with thickened ribs and then using wire Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) to cut the final shape. This will result in an easier to produce PC, with more rigidity due to its integral structure and potentially thinner and better positioned blades. It will also be made of Titanium instead of Aluminum and have a less shiny surface finish, both of which are more favorable characteristics in stray light blocking.We plan to design a Test Article that mimics the size and location configuration of the current PC technology. We plan to investigate the competing AM processes of Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Electron Beam Welding (EBM) to determine which one is a better process for the blank fabrication and if there are any potential limitations to either technology.

NASA is currently seeking more sophisticated thermal control technologies for this class of spacecraft, thus enabling revolutionary capabilities within small satellites.In response to the need for advanced heat transfer components for improved thermal management onboard CubeSats and SmallSats, i2C Solutions proposes to develop space-rated flexible 2-phase thermal straps with vacuum survivability and operational capability.

Additionally, a world-class CubeSat team including LoadPath, leaders in the thermal analysis of SmallSats, has been assembled to assist in application development and demonstration.  The Phase I program will culminate with a proof-of-concept demonstration of a 2-phase thermal strap designed and manufactured for operation in the harsh space environment.

However, NASA's unique missions with extreme conditions and difficulty in replacing batteries require even greater specific power improvements in conjunction with long life and performance at extremely high or low temperatures.  Predictive models, incorporating the thermodynamics and electrochemistry that dictates device performance and degradation, are needed to accelerate development and insertion of these systems.  To provide this capability, CFDRC and our collaborator Dr. Partha Mukherjee, TAMU, will develop and validate detailed models that link chemical composition and elementary reaction steps with the properties and reactions of electrochemical system constituents.  The proposed electrochemical models will be based on fundamental chemical and electrochemical properties of the materials, as opposed to empirical fits of observed properties for a specific battery electrode material and electrolyte mixture or fuel cell catalyst, support, and electrolyte combination.  A property database and software library will be used and extended, allowing application of the developed models in performance simulators of NASA preference.  The ability of the developed models to incorporate detailed thermodynamics and electrochemical kinetics of degradation processes will be demonstrated during Phase I, with extension to additional materials and validation during Phase II.  The resulting models will significantly reduce the need for iterative, trial-and-error tests of new materials to accelerate development and increase confidence in projected device lifetimes.","The proposed models will allow the results of first-principles modeling and systematic characterization of electrochemical system component materials to be applied in predicting the performance of electrochemical energy storage and energy generation devices.  This technology will accelerate development by enabling prediction of the rates of both desirable and undesirable processes for a given material system, without extensive calibration for each new device.  The models will support transition of new materials from laboratory to program-specific hardware by enabling confident estimation of performance under baseline and extreme conditions.

One method that can dramatically reduce the cost of test operations is to recover these gases using an electrochemical process.  A Hydrogen Recovery System (HRS), which has recently been the subject of a highly successful Phase II SBIR conducted by Sustainable Innovations, LLC, selectively removes hydrogen from the mixed stream, leaving behind the high-value helium.  In 2014 a prototype unit was successfully delivered by Sustainable Innovations to SSC to demonstrate the ability to capture, separate and compress helium from a mixture derived from test operations.  The innovative step in this Phase I proposal is to increase the gas capacity capability of the electrochemical separation cell while maintaining optimal operating efficiency and durability.  This will be achieved by:  Implementing high electrical conductivity, high durability coatings on cell components that support operation in the hydrogen environment; Evaluating and demonstrating robust, high strength, high conductivity proton exchange membrane materials that support the separation process; and Integrating all elements within a one-piece flow field structure to minimize interfaces and facilitate coatings.It is expected that these innovative steps will allow for at least a doubling of throughput capacity per unit cell area.","Hydrogen/Helium Separation – NASA has significant needs to separate and recover hydrogen and helium from its large rocket engine test stands. Hydrogen Separation for Resource Recovery – Sustainable Innovations is working with Marshall Space Flight Center on a system that can separate and compress hydrogen from a mixed stream containing  CO, methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene.  An SBIR Phase I research program has shown that electrochemical hydrogen separation and compression is an enabling technology for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction System that facilitates further closure of the oxygen loop in an Advanced Life Support System. Pressurization for Mechanical Actuation – The NASA In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) group is very interested in the utilization of hydrogen as a working fluid for mechanical actuation.  In this application, hydrogen would be compressed electrochemically using the core architecture of the HRS.  Reformate Separation –There is a need by NASA to convert carbon dioxide to fuels as well as convert fuels to hydrogen.  As part of this collection of cycles, there is a need to separate H2 from environments containing CO, CO2, and excess fuels.

However, NASA has a vital interest in developing much larger solar arrays (up to 1 MW of power) for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions.  Scaling to this size will require fundamental changes in many aspects of the solar array system design as embodied by NASA's Compact Telescoping Array (CTA) reference configuration.  To address this emerging need for larger scale practical solar array systems, and to evolve NASA's CTA design into a design that is practical to manufacture and flight qualify, Roccor proposes the mega-watt-class ROC-Array.  The ROC-Array is a CTA-derivative design that yields improved packaged volume and deployed frequency through a tension-stiffened hierarchical structure.Exploiting structural hierarchy through the use of tension guy wire elements and next-generation deployable boom systems will afford an improved packaging efficiency, increased stiffness, and reduced mass.  Performance enhancements will be achieved by replacing the solid wall telescoping mast in the CTA reference design with a deployable tension-stiffened boom structure.","The value proposition for the proposed ROC-Array technology is to enable the next-generation of large-scale space deployable solar arrays with considerably higher performance (e.g., reduced mass, increased mechanical properties, increased packaging efficiency and increased scale-ability) at reduced system complexity and cost.  Of critical importance to NASA, the proposed technology could enable future space exploration missions in which Solar Electric Propulsion is a key element of mission design.","While the proposed ROC-Array technology is tailored to best serve the needs of horizon missions for high-power NASA and military satellites, scaled versions of the proposed technology have broad applicability within the space deployables market. Specifically, the proposed technology could enable larger-scale systems that may otherwise not be achievable using conventional space deployable technologies, and scaled versions can bring value in reduced cost/complexity over competing designs for lower-power applications.","Composites; Deployment; Navigation & Guidance; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The steps of our proposed process for manufacturing lightweight 3D printed mirrors: first, a geometrically complex substrate is easily and cost-effectively manufactured using 3D printing.  After printing, the mirror surface is lapped and polished using traditional manufacturing methods to final figure specifications.  Then, a flight or space ready mirror coating is applied to the surface and the part is tested for performance.Additive manufacturing will permit lightweight mirrors with support structures that are impossible with traditional manufacturing methods for lightweighting. In addition, these structures will be optimized in size, shape, and location to negate thermal effects from changes in temperature and mechanical effects from stresses during manufacture, mounting, and flight.  Technical Objective 1: Demonstrate feasibility of additive manufacturing a lightweight substrate with mechanical and thermal stability at flight temperatures  Our goal for this objective is to manufacture a spherical mirror substrate suitable for light focusing applications at a range of temperatures for flight applications Technical Objective 2: Demonstrate feasibility of depositing mirror coatings at low temperatures for flight applications   A low temperature deposition process minimizes shape distortion of the 3D-printed substrate that would occur during a typical coating.

The planned New Horizons Mission to Pluto is such an example that requires a lightweight telescope system. The NASA's Next Generation X-ray Optics (NGXO) project is an example of a need for a lightweight x-ray mirror system. Balloon missions are a specific application that would be perfect for lightweighted 3D printed mirrors. Balloon missions are highly recommended for next generation observatories. Additionally, the Astro2010 report identified that lightweight mirrors for both x-ray and UV/Visible applications are necessary for several different future missions.

Firing an airborne laser is significantly cheaper than firing an anti-missile missile. In addition, there is no recoil or after effect. However, to make airborne power lasers realizable to many applications, a weight reduction of the laser system is required.  A reduction in weight increases the available time in flight as well as improves the speed and accuracy of tracking. It has been estimated that the optical assembly may comprise 40-50% of the total weight of the laser system. Thus, a significant opportunity exists to advance airborne lasers by reducing the weight of the optical assembly.Freeform optics are quickly becoming part of many commercial and military optical systems. Many optical designers are starting to use freeform optics to achieve optical performance (less aberrations), lighter weight optical systems through a reduced number of components, and an increased ability to go off axis with smaller and tighter packages.

An innovative efforts for the space environmental stable TCMS is suggested for leveraging IR&D at AMSENG for the multifunctional, low (?S/?T) material systems that can meet these aggressive goals in cost reductions in reliable manner. The suggested efforts emphasize developments in two material science areas: the first one considers the development of intercalated  boron nitride nano structure that includes nanotubes and nano mesh and the second area proposes the synthesis and processing of various compounds with proton and electron conductivity along with its plasma sprayable versions. The material system that integrates these technology aspects can allow higher leakage currents at affordable costs. Thus the envisioned affordable material systems can provide the needed reliable TCMS in typical space environments in (LEO), (GEO) & beyond.

The primary objective of this research is to develop the fast-light enhanced optical gyroscopes in a coupled cavity scheme to remove the necessity of using an atomic medium to produce the required anomalous dispersion.  Producing fast light in a coupled cavity system is not a simple proposition, however, because it requires the stabilization of one cavity to the other due to the inherent presence of independent amounts of noise and drift in each optical cavity.  In addition, no simple way to control the cavity scale factor exits in this scheme.  Our proposed innovation is a new method of fast light cavity enhancement that implements mode coupling between orthogonally polarized modes in a single cavity as an alternative coupled cavity approach.  The use of both polarization modes in the cavity result in common mode rejection of the noise and drift, resulting in a stable relative mode detuning and provides a simple control mechanism for the scale factor by rotation of the polarization, which is reproducible and stable. The results of this effort will contribute to development of gyroscopy technologies feasible for flexible path and deep space exploration to advance significantly current navigation systems.","The proposed technology would increase the time for standalone fully-autonomous spacecraft navigation by improving attitude and position determination aligning with Space Systems Tier 3 Priorities: Technologies for Space Situational Awareness and Space Object Interactions, as well as Small Spacecraft and Enabling Technologies.  These sensors can also be used for gravity-wave detection and tests of general relativity. NASA's needs for deep space missions would achieve substantial operational benefits from navigation systems that take advantage of the proposed fast light optical gyroscopes (FLOG) as a result of high-precision on-board autonomous navigation technology.  FLOG addresses a critical needs for new technologies to meet challenges in NASA's Space Technology Roadmap Technology Area 05: Communications and Navigation Systems including minimization of mass, power and volume while increasing performance, avoiding navigation from becoming a constraint in planning and executing space missions, and eliminating Earth from the real time decision loop.","As generalized rotation sensors, ring gyros in general find application in a wide range of markets. They are used as motion sensing elements in platform stabilization systems. In both manned and unmanned aircraft system, they are critical components in the navigational systems. They find use in attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) used in marine navigation. Potential customers in the navigation space include major players such as Honeywell, Draper, and Thales. Since the proposed design does not include any exotic optical components, such as an atomic vapor cell, it will readily lend itself to miniaturization, especially since the FLOG approach enhances the gyro sensitivity through a mechanism other than increasing the cavity size. With this added method for increasing gyrosensitivity, by about two orders of magnitude over the equivalent ring laser gyro, the possibility of detecting gradients in gravitational fields becomes possible. Besides enabling tests of general relativity, this capability could be used to detect subterranean geological features of interest in a number of industries.","Attitude Determination & Control; Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z)",Slow and Fast Light   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Low Earth Orbit operations such as rendezvous and docking between spacecraft, and space debris search and collection can also be accommodated.  Such versatility is made possible system by a system architecture which merges the architectures of two high performance imaging lidars - the Sigma Space 3D Imaging Lidar and the Imaging Lidar for planetary landing developed by the European Space Agency. The result is a highly modular architecture that is scalable and ""open"" in terms of future development of the underlying technologies thus providing a path for reusable NASA investment. The design combines several advanced technologies which have matured independently of each other into a state-of-the-art system with performance parameters and flexibility greatly exceeding those of the existing instruments. Its key advantage is the operation at the ultimate single photon sensitivity level which minimizes instrument Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP). It is combined with other useful features such as high spatial and range resolution, wide FOV, highly flexible scanning with variable field of regard (FOR), autonomous target acquisition and tracking, and  programmable surface measurement  rates up to several  3D Megapixels per second (Mpix/s) during orbital mapping and spacecraft entry, descent and landing operations.  It advances the state of the art by extending the range of 3D measurements from 10m to 10km, improving the measurement accuracy and the spatial resolution and significantly reducing the impact of incorporating such sensors on the spacecraft in terms of SWAP, spacecraft accommodation complexity, and cost.","The technology developed  here can be used to map the surface during descent and landing operations on a wide variety of extraterrestrial bodies, including  asteroids, comets, planetary moons, and even  planets.  Comparable high resolution mapping from higher orbits about large planets or moons, however, would require appropriate increases in laser power and/or receive aperture to sustain the ranging link at the desired resolution. For these larger bodies, the scanner can be placed behind the telescope in order to significantly reduce scanner size and weight.

In order to accomplish these tasks, nuclear thermal rockets have been identified as the propulsion system of choice; the technology proposed here would find extensive application in the field of nuclear powered space flight. The smart neutron sensor can enable increased safety, efficiency, and control for nuclear thermal propulsion engines. Additionally, this technology will be applicable for fission surface power systems. These power systems utilize nuclear fission to generate electricity, and are intended for use in environments where solar power is not a viable option, such as a Martian outpost, or where the weight of solar cells would greatly increase the cost of a surface power station, such as a lunar outpost. The neutron smart sensor can again find application in these harsh environments, where their installation could again address the safety and control concerns for the nuclear power plant.","In nuclear power plants, a neutron monitoring system is used to monitor power generation and, for the safety function of the neutron monitoring system, to provide trip signals to the reactor protection system to initiate reactor scram under an excessive neutron flux increase condition or neutron flux fast rising condition. The system also provides power information for the operation and control of the reactor to the plant process computer system. Newer nuclear power plant designs have increasing reactor temperatures and neutron flux rates; for example, the Generation IV type reactors contain the Very-High Temperature Reactor (VHTR), which is graphite moderated and helium cooled. The reactor outlet temperature on such designs may approach 1000 degC, as soon as the appropriate materials technology has been developed to accommodate the increasingly harsh environment. Such high temperature reactors will need to have a neutron monitoring system as well, and the DND smart sensor system can find many applications here, replacing current lower temperature neutron sensing solutions.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Radiometric; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Transmitters/Receivers",Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Fault Management (FM) is a crucial mechanism to ensure system functionality from system design through the operational phase of a mission. FM is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software and information redundancy, ground-based software and procedures. A major issue in the development and operation of Fault Management (FM) is the determination of the value of the various components of FM design within a system. Without comprehensive measures of value, FM designers and system engineers are left with qualitative arguments often tied to fault tolerance requirements (for example, single fault tolerance, fail-operational-fail safe) or one-off, ad hoc analyses to estimate the risks associated with particular failures and design measures to mitigate them. Qualtech Systems, Inc., in collaboration with Dr. Stephen B. Johnson of University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) and President of Dependable System Technologies, LLC, proposes to develop techniques and concomitant software tools for evaluating FM metrics by using TEAMS® as the underlying platform. This proposal aims to utilize recent advances in the theory and practice of FM, and in particular in the theory and practice of FM metrics, to enhance the ability of system and FM engineers and operators to measure and document the value, cost and risks associated with the FM design. In turn, this provides the information needed to compare alternative FM designs, quantitatively evaluate how well a system is achieving its goals, and enables more effective verification and validation (V&V) of selected FM design.","NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy, fault tolerance, and fault mitigation capabilities for space vehicles and support systems makes the proposed effort worthy of funding. Model-based techniques involving FM are being employed in several NASA projects, including the Space Launch System (SLS) at Marshall Space Flight Center, Orion at Johnson Space Center, Ground Systems Development Operations at Kennedy Space Center, and the Europa project at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In addition, Ames Research Center and Glenn Research Center are directly supporting the efforts at MSFC, JSC, and KSC, further spreading the concepts and practices of a discipline-based FM. All are beginning the quantification of FM using newly-developed metrics. Establishing the FM metrics computation technology and the software tool for supporting their implementation will allow NASA to better plan and execute the future Science Missions. The envisioned Software tool(s) from the proposed effort satisfies both design-time and operation-time FM goals. Thus the technologies can be applied for design updating of existing systems and towards improving their operational capabilities and health management systems. The improvements can be made in the areas of utilization of monitored information or analytic outputs, health condition assessment and forecasting, and dissemination of information in efficient manners such that those can be used for updating design and/or operation-related aspects.","Among the other agencies, DoD's Air Force and Navy are the most likely customers for the resulting technologies. Design verification and validation of complex military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD), etc. for the purpose of uninterrupted (failure-immune) operations can be ensured by using the targeted capabilities implemented in TEAMS. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets could also be potential target for the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems and the vendors supply health management systems/schemes for them.","Air Transportation & Safety; Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Fault Management Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed method is primarily based on the differential photoacoustic (DPAS) technique and will also take advantage of the current rapid development on high-power semiconductor lasers. The proposed RGB DPAS Aerosol Absorption Monitor will eventually be less than 25 pounds in weight and consume approximately 300W electrical power. It will also be capable of being remotely controlled and being operated at a variety of sampling pressure conditions for the airborne measurements. Since all the major components of the proposed system are commercially available except the home-designed acoustic cells, its total manufacturing cost could be less than $20,000 per unit.","The primary NASA need for this technology is to measure spectrally resolved light absorption by atmospheric aerosols for its Airborne Measurement program. At present, aerosol light absorption is measured by collecting sample on a filter subtract and measuring light extinction and scattering of the collected samples during the airborne measurements. This method suffers from a number of intrinsic errors. The proposed DPAS technique will be far more sensitive than the filter-based techniques, and is capable of providing 1s data acquisition measurement. Additionally, past NASA programs such as EXCAVATE, APEX, UNA-UNA, and AAFEX have had as a major focus, on the measurement of black carbon emissions from civilian aircraft engines. Since mass absorption coefficient of black carbon is known at several visible wavelengths, the proposed DPAS aerosol absorption monitor can be used as a black carbon emission monitor.","We expect that the 3-color RGB DPAS aerosol absorption monitor developed under this program will significantly benefit the scientific community interested in characterizing the radiative properties of ambient aerosols.  The ability of one instrument to simultaneously measure spectrally resolved particle absorption with good time resolution and high precision will enable continuous measurements of the particle optical absorption that can be directly used by regional and global climate forcing models.  In combination with the Cavity Attenuated Phase-Shift (CAPS) extinction monitor, which represents a dramatic improvement on current particle extinction measurement technology, single particle albedo of ambient aerosols could be directly determined. Since aerosol scattering of solar radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming, direct measurements on single particle albedo of ambient aerosols are critical in understanding aerosol effect on the Earth radiative balance.","Aerogels; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Characterization; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Diagnostics/Prognostics; In Situ Manufacturing; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Nanomaterials; Visible",Airborne Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This feed system features a low mass plastic propellant tank that may be manufactured through additive processes.  This allows low cost, complex shapes that can maximize the use of available space inside the spacecraft.  The feed system also features an innovative piezo valve that will save volume, mass, cost, and energy with respect to the state of the art alternative for iodine. Iodine stores as a solid and sublimates as the molecule I2, which allows many benefits with respect to traditional Hall Effect Thruster fuels such as xenon and krypton.  These advantages include higher storage density, lower storage pressure, the ability to test high power systems at space-relevant conditions in modest facilities, the capability to store propellant in space without active regulation, and the capacity to transfer propellant at low pressure conditions in space.  In a space-limited spacecraft, the use of iodine instead of state of the art xenon could increase available delta V by a factor of 3 or more.  Iodine is especially beneficial for small CubeSat sized spacecraft.  In Phase I, Busek will design a feed system featuring the new, advanced components.  The system will then be demonstrated with an iodine fueled thruster in space relevant conditions.  In Phase II, an improved feed system will be designed, built and tested.","The proposed feed system supports iodine Hall thrusters, ion engines, hollow cathodes, and other plasma generators currently under development for NASA.  Specific applications include iSat, Lunar Cube, and future Game Changing missions.  The Phase II feed system will be ideally sized for a Hall thruster operating at 500 to 1000 W.  This thruster would be used for orbit raising and interplanetary transfers of spacecraft up to several hundred kg.  Missions of current interest include resource prospecting at the moon, Mars, asteroids, and NEOs.  The technology is also applicable to much smaller spacecraft, such as CubeSats, and much larger spacecraft, such as future MW-class cargo transports supporting human exploration. The ability to flow iodine as a HET propellant is ultimately the game changer.  Iodine is efficient, compact, highly storable, and an order of magnitude cheaper than xenon.  Full power thruster demonstrations and throttling in space conditions are feasible because iodine is efficiently pumped by liquid nitrogen cooled panels.","The proposed feed system supports many types of plasma generators used in space and on the ground.  In the near term, the innovative feed system components are most likely to be used as part of a space propulsion system.  The next stage for commercial users is an all-electric satellite, where electric propulsion accomplishes all propulsion functions including orbit raising, orbit circularization, inclination changes, station-keeping and repositioning.  Beyond stored density and pressure, iodine has many additional benefits with respect to xenon.  For instance, a fully-fueled, non-active system may be stored on the ground or on orbit for long periods of time.  This reduces the cost of on-orbit spares, and minimizes down-time in the event of a failure.  Low pressure on-orbit refueling is also feasible.  Due to its these and other advantages, iodine may be very attractive for commercial missions such as asteroid mining.","Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Material Handing & Packaging; Polymers; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Prototyping; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine",Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The modified BHL (mBHL) technology provides significant reductions in weight while exceeding the helium permeability requirements needed to meet NASA long term cryogenic propellant storage requirements.  The proposed effort builds upon a substantial DARPA investment in BHL cryotank technology for shorter storage duration mission applications and takes the next step, extending the technology to long-term storage cryogenic propellant applications.  The phase I effort conducts trade studies to identify and define the optimum metal laminate coating technology that can be incorporated into a BHL cryotank composite.  The proposed effort will also evaluate several lightweight multifunctional insulation design concepts synergistic with mBHL technology and identify optimum solutions to be incorporated in the phase II program. With the proposed development of mBHL, the advantages of the technology will be achieved for long term cryogenic propellant storage, providing the means to significantly lower cryotank mass, reduce permeability and provide a significant improvement in propellant tank insulation performance reducing propellant boil off, thereby enhancing NASA's ability to achieve its exploration and science mission goals for less cost.","The successful development and test of the mBHL composite tank system would provide significant weight and cost savings for cryogenic propellant tank applications. The mBHL technology offers a four times weight improvement over metal isogrid cryotanks. When fully qualified for use in long-term cryopropellant storage requirements, mBHL technology could be used for space propellant storage tanks, Mars missions and space/launch vehicles.  The mBHL could be applied directly to all NASA launch vehicle initiatives including the Space Launch System development and commercial space transportation initiatives. Including the commercial cargo and crew program and space exploration programs.  NASA would reap significant benefits from supporting the implementation and commercialization of the mBHL technology into the commercial US launch vehicles industry. Including systems built by Lockheed, Boeing, Orbital Sciences and Space-X.  Incorporating mBHL into NASA space vehicle systems would achieve significant performance and cost advantages that support NASA exploration requirements.","Non-NASA commercial applications for the mBHL composite technology includes both storable and cryogenic spacecraft propellant and pressurant tanks, including commercial and DoD vehicles and applications.

To that end NASA-JPL is involved in an ongoing effort to design and demonstrate a full-scale (30-32m diameter) starshade which utilizes a radially deploying and optically precise perimeter truss with 28 circumferentially mounted petals.  The perimeter truss structure deploys from an initial diameter of 3 m to 20 m and is configured much like a bicycle wheel when deployed in that the only components connecting the center structural hub to the perimeter truss are a series of spokes, which largely determine the deployed shape of the ring truss and petals.  In addition the spoke component must also bend and fold to a tight radius upon packaging for launch.  Although high performance carbon fiber cable has been used for space applications in the past, there are no commercially available cable products with the specifications necessary for this starshade application.To meet the needs of the starshade system, Roccor proposes to develop a Dimensionally-Stable Structural Space Cable (DS3 Cable) consisting of advanced fibers that enable linear and consistent behavior at very low operational tensions as well as a near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).  This work will also address feasibility concerns with manufacturing consistency and package-ability by fabricating a large quantity of test articles for evaluation at JPL.  The DS3 cable is widely applicable to many variants of precision space deployable structures and will be made commercially available for alternative uses.","The development of Dimensionally-Stable Structural Space Cable has numerous applications to both current and future NASA development efforts.

A few examples of their utility include aerial surveying in difficult-to-access terrain, precision agriculture, package delivery, moviemaking, infrastructure inspection, fire fighting, search and rescue, etc. Recently there has been a lot of interest in autonomous air vehicles for cargo delivery to improve cost and time associated with shipping goods. Finally, much of the technology for autonomy could be used as a pilot's aid to help in difficult tasks such as landing a helicopter on an oil rig in the high seas or in the personal air vehicles of the future which are envisioned to be operated by people without significant pilot training.While the technology for unmanned air vehicles operating day in and day out without constant human supervision is maturing steadily, much remains to be done to make these vehicles commonplace. We have identified a number of challenges that must be addressed for these vehicles to safely and efficiently conduct their tasks in the National Airspace System (NAS). Civilian applications of UASs must ensure that they can:1. sense and avoid other vehicles and follow air traffic commands,2. avoid the terrain and land without operator intervention,3. react to contingencies such as engine out and lost link scenarios, and4. be reliable and cost-effective.We propose to a combination of software algorithms and low-cost, low SWAP sensors that simultaneously solves the navigation and obstacle detection problem, especially as relates to operation in cluttered environments. That is, in this program we will show that it is possible for small autonomous air vehicles to reliably and safely fly in the first and last 50 feet of operation.","The development of technology that enables autonomous and safe UAS operations during the critical (near earth) phases of take-off and landing will directly contribute to NASA's testing and validation of technologies and concepts for UAS operations in the NAS.   Additionally, Near Earth's technology will provide an enhanced capability, enabling more comprehensive UAS flight-testing for NASA's collaborative efforts with the FAA to accommodate UAS operations in NextGen.  As the capabilities mature and are integrated into more air vehicles, they will also be of direct use to NASA in their flight testing of ground-based air navigational aids and guidance systems located in remote areas.  The proposed autonomous technology will enable greater utilization of UAS in other NASA areas, particularly for experimentation and testing in the various research centers, for example expanding the utilization of UAS in the Ames FINESSE volcano research. The mature technology will ultimately enable greater use of UAS in space.  A UAS that knows its position and is able to set down, avoiding obstacles in a cluttered environment can be used to accomplish repairs both inside and outside a spacecraft, as well as performing exploration of planetary surfaces.   In essence, the successful development of the technology specified in this solicitation will enable NASA and any of its contractors involved with autonomous systems to accomplish testing with increased safety and decreased cost.","Other Government agencies, both military and civilian, will comprise a much larger market for the technology. The UAS market is forecast to explode into hundreds-of-thousands of units within just a few years of the FAA establishing the appropriate regulatory procedures for the operation of UAS in the NAS.  An enhance capability for safe, autonomous take-off and landing will fuel the market's forecast growth. Technology ensuring the safe operation of UAS, particularly during the first and last 50 ft. of flight, will contribute to testing that verifies the safety of UAS operations as well as providing regulators, legislators, and the general public with increased confidence in UAS operations. UAS are already in high demand, and they are being used in an increasing number of applications.  Military UAS requirements are well documented and tens-of-thousands of UAS are already in use worldwide. The ability to take-off and land in tactical cluttered environments will allow UAS to be used more extensively in support of forward units.  Additionally, the commercial market is forecast to grow to as many as 160,000 UAS.  As soon as UAS operation in the national airspace is fully implemented, the cargo transportation market, in particular, is forecast to be the largest market segment.

Simultaneous volumetric measurement of flow parameters enables accurate capture of temporally dynamic or transient flow phenomena.  Nanohmics, Inc. proposes to develop a high-speed, high-resolution plenoptic lightfield flow imaging system to capture a rapid time sequence of simultaneously measured density, velocity and pressure throughout a test volume seeded for laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).  The plenoptic imager leverages Nanohmics' existing AOI Plenoptic technology based on commercial-off-the-shelf components, providing a rapid route to commercialization.  The proposed Nanohmics plenoptic flow imager is instantaneous and therefore able to capture rapidly evolving or oscillatory flow phenomena such as turbulence or vortices (unlike existing plane-scanning techniques).  Our Phase II objectives include capture rates of 200,000 Hz or more, and volumetric resolution of over one million volume elements (voxels) – well beyond existing volumetric flow imaging demonstrations.  We will leverage two of Nanohmics' current core technologies: our AOI Plenoptic lightfield camera (currently at TRL 7) and our FlashLED illumination system (currently at TRL 6).  Leveraging efficient computation hardware developed for plenoptic (wavefront sensing) applications, we will extend our existing plenoptic 3D processing algorithms and to enhance the extraction of volumetric flow density, and combine these with iterative application of fluid equations to extract volumetric velocity and pressure fields.  The Phase I objective is to design and fabricate an instantaneous volumetric 3D plenoptic flow imaging system, tested in a wind tunnel seeded for laser-induced fluorescence.  The Phase II objective includes increases in speed and resolution, and advancing to TRL 7.","A plenoptic flow imaging system would provide fast, instantaneous volumetric flow capture for use in aerodynamic development and testing, including for future NASA vehicles with non-traditional aerodynamic geometries or advanced propulsion or flow control surfaces.  The plenoptic approach may be the only means for capturing volumetric flow data simultaneously, allowing researchers to see for the first time rapidly evolving volumetric flow features – with time increments as small as 5 microseconds or less.  Our cost-effective, high-performance plenoptic flow imaging system would be a valuable tool for aerodynamic research and the development of faster and more efficient air vehicles.","Leveraging our on-going commercialization and sales of plenoptic imagers, we expect our cost-effective, high-performance plenoptic flow imaging system to be a valuable tool to government (including Department of Defense), commercial, and university aerodynamic R&D, for the development of faster and more efficient air vehicles, and for use in aerodynamic development and testing, including for future vehicles with non-traditional aerodynamic geometries or advanced propulsion or flow control surfaces.  The plenoptic flow imaging system will allow researchers to see rapidly evolving volumetric flow features – with time increments as small as 5 microseconds or less.  Nanohmics spin-off – Austin Optical Innovations – will help reduce cost of our core plenoptic camera technology through commercialization, including for applications such as plenoptic wavefront sensing.  Other potential applications go beyond aerodynamic measurement.  A number of applications involve fluid flow that can be seeded or perhaps provide their own photon emissions, for example: visualizing flow and reactant concentration in chemical reaction vessels; semiconductor deposition processes like chemical vapor deposition (CVD).",3D Imaging; Aerodynamics; Emitters; Image Analysis; Lenses; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Simulation & Modeling,Ground Testing and Measurement Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

(ACT) proposes the development of an active Two-phase Thermal Management System (TPTMS) that relies on a single-phase liquid pump to drive two-phase flow through multiple heat sources and sinks distributed in parallel and in series while providing phase management using the momentum of the working fluid.  This system is designed to address challenges discussed in the NASA Thermal Management Systems Roadmap, Technology Area (TA) 14.  The use of a liquid pump to drive the system allows the working fluid to overcome large pressure drops with low power consumption.  This feature, in turn, provides the ability to transfer waste heat over large distances, which is defined as a top technical challenge in TA14, Section 1.4.  Additionally, flow can be driven through multiple heat exchangers or cold plates to either collect or release thermal energy.  Arranged properly, this feature allows for heat load sharing, which is also defined as a top technical challenge.  Added to these benefits are those intrinsic to two-phase heat transfer: near-isothermal operation, a two order of magnitude increase in the heat transferred per unit mass (TA14) and the ability to handle high heat fluxes with the appropriate heat exchanger design.  Lastly, Section 2.2.3.2 of TA14 discusses the need for microgravity separators, which is an integral part of the proposed TPTMS.","The primary application is spacecraft thermal management.  If the program is successful, the TPTMS proposed here will provide a two-phase thermal management solution for spacecraft that is versatile with respect to heat load requirements and location, allows for efficient use of available mass, volume, and power budgets, can handle heat load transients, and is capable of scaling heat rejection with cooling demand through control of accumulator pressure.  In addition, these functions are accomplished using relatively simple, low-cost components, such as a single-phase pump and the accumulator design.  Applications for this thermal management system would include spacecraft with thermal demands beyond the capabilities of capillary systems and those interested in low-cost alternatives to conventional thermal management systems.  In addition, since the TPTMS aims to provide gravity-independent and acceleration-resistant operation, ACT will also investigate potential aircraft applications.","In Phase II, ACT will develop two additional test systems.  The first will demonstrate an on-demand TPTMS using a dynamic, automated control system.  The second will demonstrate reduced gravity operation aboard NASA or private test aircraft.  During this phase, ACT will investigate application with the growing commercial satellite and spacecraft market.  Depending on the phase separation performance of the MVS integrated with the TPTMS, ACT will also consider military and commercial aircraft applications.",Active Systems,Thermal Control Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The Weather Aware Route Planning (WARP) system will provide weather-based Indicators and Warnings (I&W) and navigational recommendations for UAS in order to improve their autonomy, safety, and energy efficiency.  Using all available environmental and navigational data, WARP will assess environmental impacts to planned/executing flight plans and generate alerts and recommendations for those plans based on expected environmental impacts.  Operating within a ground-based control center, WARP will incorporate position and environmental data from existing and emerging Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) sources.  Using a combination of rules-based/heuristic and computationally-intensive approaches, WARP will assess environmental impacts to individual UAS flight plans and provide I&W and recommendations for each UAS to avoid negative environmental impacts and take advantage of positive environmental impacts.  WARP will assist ground-based pilots, and eventually UAS autonomous controllers, in performing safer and more efficient flight.","NASA is a key partner in the development and maturation of NextGen technologies.  Specifically, the Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP) matures and integrates NextGen technologies into major vehicle/operational systems (http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs_isrp.htm), and the UAS Integration in the NAS Project (http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/isrp/uas/index.htm) within ISRP is focusing on demonstrating effective UAS operations in relevant test environments.  In Phase I, we will begin discussions with this NASA program in order to pursue potential Phase II-E and/or Phase II-X partnerships to help develop UAS and Command and Control (C2) performance standards regarding environmental conditions and to integrate WARP (upon successful prototype development in Phase II) into a realistic test environment, such as their planned live virtual constructive (LVC) distributed environment (DE).","Commercial (Phase III) customers for WARP outside of NASA include a host of government agencies (e.g., FAA, DHS, DoD, DoT, etc.) and prime contractors (e.g., ITT, Raytheon, Leidos, etc.) working on UAS and their associated C2 systems, within the NAS and operating anywhere in the world.

The CAVoR thermally extracts ice and water bound to clays minerals, which is then combined with small amounts of oxygen to gasify organic matter contained in carbonaceous chondrite asteroids. In addition to water, CAVoR produces hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide that comprise precursors to produce oxygen for propellant and breathing gas and to produce organic compounds including fuels and plastics. Additional CAVoR byproducts include nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus compounds that have potential uses as buffer gas for life support and reagents for more-advanced asteroid materials processing. Process residues are thermally stabilized by the CAVoR system, which renders them suitable as bulk shielding, as feed to mineral separation and concentration, or as raw material for manufacture of structural components.The CAVoR is a low-pressure, non-catalytic, batch process aimed toward maximum recovery of valuable constituents in a difficult operating environment using steel or other light-weight reactor alloys. Key elements of the CAVoR will be systematically developed and demonstrated through a progression from an Earth laboratory environment to experiments in zero-g flights and ISS with appropriate scale up and performance validations leading to implementation on a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA). Hardware designs to achieve required sealing and operating performance over long durations in microgravity will be derived in part from Pioneer's heritage in lunar and Mars ISRU. A combination of modeling and experimentation will be used to overcome the lack of current well-established state-of-the-art process methods and conditions for resource recovery from Near Earth Asteroids.","The primary application of the Carbonaceous Asteroid Volatile Recovery (CAVoR) system is to provide a compact, high performance apparatus for the extraction and recovery of water and organic matter in support of propellant production, breathing gas, and life support. These capabilities are key to extending NASA's mission beyond low earth orbit to include long-duration space habitation, lunar, and Mars colonization missions.","The autothermal steam reforming technology proposed for the CAVoR has applications in the recovery of water and energy values from terrestrial wastes and resources. Steam reforming technology has mostly been applied to feed matter containing only small amounts of inorganic matter. The efficient use and recovery of process heat to be established during the CAVoR program will enable non-catalytic autothermal steam reforming technology to be applied to feeds such as contaminated soils, low-grade hydrocarbon feeds, oil shale, un-sorted municipal waste, and other organic materials. By so doing, many otherwise refractory, hazardous compounds can potentially be broken into syngas constituents for use as fuels rather than being incinerated with no economic gain. The relatively low-temperature residue from autothermal steam reforming will be de-agglomerated, rendered sterile, and made suitable for down stream physical separations and byproduct recovery.The CAVoR technology will be poised for entry into the growing market demand for waste volume reduction and low-grade fuels resources. The device solves a variety of industrial and municipal waste challenges with minimal environmental impact. The primary CAVoR steam reforming technology does not require exotic chemicals or catalysts for the production of water and syngas. Only small amounts of catalysts or sorbents are required for contaminant removal and conventional downstream fuels synthesis.","Conversion; Fuels/Propellants; In Situ Manufacturing; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)",Regolith ISRU for Mission Consumable Production   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Future NASA space mirror requirements call for an order of magnitude improvement in areal cost over current technologies. With this goal in mind, Semplastics will leverage existing in-house technologies to develop an ultra-low cost, lightweight, molded, chalcogenide glass-silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) composite mirror component. This novel silicon oxycarbide substrate has the advantage of using an extremely low-energy process to produce a molded bulk ceramic substrate with weight-reducing rib patterns on the back of the substrate. This silicon oxycarbide ceramic is much lighter in weight than bulk ceramics like silicon carbide or lithium aluminosilicate glass ceramics such as ZerodurTM, resulting in an additional benefit in the potential for reduction of on-orbit mass for space missions using this technology. Chalcogenide (ChG) Glass is used to fill in the pores of the porous bulk and support transitioning to a smooth, thermally matched surface ready for aluminization for mirror formation. Successful completion of this development effort will meet both the cost and optical performance targets for next-generation Ultraviolet/Optical and Infared mirror components.","Several NASA activities benefit from improvements in mirror performance as well as a significant reduction in areal costs. Earth-observing and space-observing telescopes that are either balloon-borne or on-orbit have a constant need to reduce the cost and mass of their optical systems. In NASA's search for extraterrestrial life, the mission is to locate stars with planets similar to Earth. Mirror technology is a significant key in determining whether an exoplanet's atmosphere has atmospheric water vapor or carbon dioxide as well as measuring other atmospheric chemicals. Other NASA programs with interest in improved mirror technology include the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractory Observatory (CLARREO) and the European Space Agency (ESA)/NASA dark-energy mission Euclid. The CLARREO effort is a future Earth-observing mission that will establish climate benchmarks in order to assess optimizing strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The Euclid space observing mission will address questions related to the fundamental physics and cosmology on the nature and properties of dark energy, dark matter, and gravity. Reduced areal costs translate directly to cost savings on these projects, increasing chances of success.","Commercial applications for this technology outside of NASA are numerous. Other agencies and entities such as the Department of Defense (DoD) also make use of Earth-observing satellites. While the DoD may be less sensitive to areal cost than other agencies or the commercial sector, they are very sensitive to on-orbit mass. The need to make frequent adjustments to satellite orbits requires a large amount of fuel; by reducing the mass and moment of inertia of the optical system, this technology will enable mission extension through onboard fuel savings. Further commercial potential is identified in the planned large-aperture, multi-segmented, ground-based observatories. The 39-meter European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the 74-meter Colossus telescope are examples of these upcoming projects. Enormous optical components will be acquired for these instruments; for example, the E-ELT has been designed with an array of 798 hexagonal 1.4-meter wide main mirror segments, as well as three large downstream mirrors, and the mirror material has yet to be selected. Because the technology being developed in this Phase I effort uses a molding technique, mirror segments can have a light weighting rib pattern easily created for each mirror. This feature, along with the inherent low density of the ceramic material, leads to a major weight savings which propagates through the entire telescope support/pointing system, representing potential cost savings in the billions of dollars.",Mirrors,Advanced Optical Systems and Fabrication/Testing/Control Technologies for EUV/Optical and IR Telescope   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This multi-functional capability will further reduce cost and improve reliability in launch or in-space vehicles by increasing component production rates and reducing part count. The focus of the proposed effort is to prove the feasibility of this novel oxygen/methane pintle engine. The in-space engine can be designed to operate at lower chamber pressures, lending itself to the use of composite and additive manufactured components. The design offers an inherent combustion stability allowing simpler combustion chamber designs and ease of fabrication due to the omission of complex acoustic damping devices. Therefore, an expensive development programs can be avoided due to the very low risk of combustion instability.",The engine has the potential to be utilized with an efficiently optimized nozzle in a planetary ascent/descent pressure-fed system with a vacuum specific impulse of up to 360 sec with throttling capability for future exploration of Mars. The proposed program addresses the need to support investments on key technologies and design concepts that may transform the path for future exploration of Mars or other near earth objects. Additionally the LMPPE can be used on KTE's Radially Segmented Launch Vehicle (RSLV) family of earth-to-orbit launch vehicles that will provide transportation for NASA payloads ranging from nano-sats to Delta II class planetary missions.,"The proposed program is an enabler to the Radially Segmented Launch Vehicle (RSLV) system currently under development by KT Engineering. KTE has been developing an integrated earth-to-orbit space transportation system, ground infrastructure, and a business concept that challenge aerospace paradigms regarding vehicle design, hardware fabrication, and operations.   Several US Government customers, including the US Air Force, US Army, DARPA, and other DOD agencies have, along with NASA, invested over $20M to develop the RSLV to support a wide range of payloads, from nano-sat size to Delta II and EELV-class missions.","Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Fuels/Propellants; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Launch Engine/Booster; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Main Engine",In-Space Chemical Propulsion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These missions have very limited access to solar power and therefore reducing the cryocooling system power is more critical than for earth-orbiting satellites.  On this program, Creare proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative Stirling cryocooler that efficiently produces refrigeration at 30 K and rejects heat at about 150 K.  A key component of the proposed cryocooler, its regenerator, will be optimized on this program  to obtain high efficiency over this operating temperature range.  The innovation is a regenerator fabricated by a unique process to enhance its heat capacity near its target cooling temperature and therefore increase the overall thermal efficiency of the cryocooler.  The proposed cryocooler is built on technologies developed for  commercial Stirling cryocoolers that are extremely compact and efficient while rejecting heat at 300 K.  In Phase I, we will develop the regenerator fabrication process, measure the performance of a subscale regenerator under prototypical conditions, and optimize the cooler design for optimum performance.  In Phase II, we will fabricate full-size regenerators, characterize their performance, integrate a regenerator into a Stirling cooler, and optimize the cryocooler operating parameters to maximize its performance.  At the end of Phase II, we will deliver a cryocooler to NASA for further performance characterization.","The successful completion of this program will provide mission planners with a high performance, lightweight, and compact cryocooler that can meet requirements for a variety of missions.  The cryocooler is efficient, reliable and low cost.  The primary application will be for cooling detectors, sensors, shields, and telescopes for planetary science missions.","The proposed cryocooler requires minimal input power and is extremely compact making it ideal for small satellites.  Military space applications for this cooling system include space-based surveillance for Operationally Responsive Space missions.  Commercial versions of the cryocooler will operate at rejection temperatures of near 300 K with heat lift at temperatures of and below 30 K, a temperature range that is currently unachievable with commercial Stirling cryocoolers.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems,Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

A distributed electric propulsion system for a VTOL aircraft can exploit aerodynamic benefits increasing the lift to drag ratio by 4 to 5 times (Fredericks et al, Intl Powered Lift Conf, Aug 2013) to that of conventional rotorcrafts.Basic physics principles can demonstrate that weight and efficiency optimized electric motors and propellers of the same power rating will rotate at different rpm making a transmission system/gearbox desirable.  High speed electric motors have excellent specific power whereas low speed propellers are more efficient.  In distributed propulsion systems there may be numerous individual propulsors making gearbox maintenance a significant effort that will detract from the potential cost savings of electric propulsion.  We propose a magnetic transmission (magnetic gearbox) design that will allow optimal matching of high specific power electric motors to efficient propellers for use on electric or hybrid-electric air vehicles.  The proposed magnetic transmission will have a mass of no more than an equivalent rated mechanical gearbox.  Unlike conventional gears the magnetic transmission will have no lubrication requirements, gear tooth wear, will be immune to vibration fatigue in the gear teeth, and will have minimal acoustic noise.  If overloaded the design will benignly ""slip a tooth"" and then re-engage.   We propose to design, build and test a magnetic transmission optimized for specific torque, and compare the weight of the system to an optimal mechanical gearbox of the same power.  We will also perform design studies to show how a magnetic gearbox could scale up to a helicopter main rotor gearbox.","NASA has done significant research in electric and hybrid/electric propulsion.  Non-contact magnetic transmission technology would be a key enabler for full sized aircraft propulsion systems in order to meet the specific power requirements.  Furthermore, some NASA research areas are focused on cryo-cooled propulsion. The magnetic remanence of the rare earth magnets we will use in the magnetic trasnmission actually increases as the magnets are cooled down to 100 degrees K. This potentially results in a ~30% increase in torque capability for a magnetic gearbox that is cryo-cooled.","At first, rotorcraft applications would be the most obvious for our magnetic transmission technology because the maintenance cost of the system could be reduced while increasing reliability without impacting weight.  Key rotorcraft manufacturers could start building technology demonstrators using our technology within the next several years either with hybrid electric or conventional drive systems if the basic development proposed in this Phase I effort is completed and the technology is proven effective.  We have been in contact with various research groups working on electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and they have expressed interest in our motor and hybrid-electric drive technology.

Such a drill system could selectively extract just the fine-fraction of regolith from depths which have not been exposed to significant space-weathering (e.g. by utilizing its unique oversize-particle-rejecting drill-head feeder).  The flexible drill system could be utilized to create horizontal wells for direct insitu extraction of volatiles on the moon, for instance, without removing the bulk of the regolith (e.g. see Walton et al 2014a, b) or it could excavate subsurface volumes of regolith of the order of 0.5m3 through a single small entrance hole, for small body applications.  If the near-surface regolith on a small body is primarily comprised of small particulates, with say at least 70% by mass being particles smaller than 2mm, then such a system could create a subsurface excavation on the order of 0.3m3 to 0.4m3 during a sunlit operating time duration of less than 100hrs (assuming the bulk density of the regolith is on the order of 1g/cc). Microgravity capable storage and transfer vessels and conveying lines (demonstrated in previous phase-1 SBIR projects, Walton et al 2012; 2014) could be utilized to store, dispense, or transfer the material in continuous or batch modes to other equipment for processing (i.e., the microgravity storage vessels could act as a buffer volume to provide a uniform rate of delivery for a continuous process, or they could dispense material in batches, as needed). The entire regolith extraction system is enclosed with minimal loss of volatiles and no extraneous debris after initiation of the drill-hole.","Subsurface access, material extraction, transport and storage are important for fulfillment of both Science and Exploration mission goals. Microgravity material handling is significantly different than our terrestrial engineering, mining and material-processing experience. The material handling equipment and components developed under this project resembles some terrestrial drilling, and material-transport, storage and handling equipment, but also offer significant improvements in both function and robustness for microgravity applications over more conventional drilling or excavation approaches. These new tools could facilitate development of robust ISRU processing operations under microgravity. Access to unweathered subsurface material is crucial for evaluation of both the origin of a body and for extraction of resources. The ability of extract a significant quantity of subsurface material without exposure to the space environment and without the addition of any diluting gases offers a significant benefit over alternatives that have been proposed. In addition to the prototype regolith extraction and handling equipment, the simulation tools developed and calibrated for predicting their performance, could also be utilized by NASA programs designing future microgravity missions.","Deep Space Industries, Shackleton Energy, and Planetary Resources are three of the relatively new commercial entities planning to make use of extraterrestrial resources. These entities and others seeking to utilize resources on small solar system bodies could benefit from the tools being developed here. The drill-head feeder developed here also overcomes a well-known problem with conventional vertical screw conveying, namely, that the vortex or swirl-action of the material near the entrance to a screw conveyor can prevent material from entering the conveyor, often causing vertical screw-conveyors to operate in a 'feed-starved' mode unless they are 'force-fed'.  The feeder/drill-head design developed here accomplishes the function of force-feeding the attached screw-augers so that they are not feed-starved. Eight out of ten suppliers of large industrial conveying equipment which includes vertical screw conveyors, only offer them with separately powered horizontal screw conveyor-feeders, to supply material to a force-fed transfer point where the vertical screw conveyor picks up the material fed into it, and elevates it. The other two suppliers of large vertical screw-like conveyors (Olds Elevator and Siwertell) both utilize rotating scoops at the bottom of their vertical conveyors to gather material and force it into the vertical conveying pipe. The drill-head feeders developed here could greatly simplify feeding of vertical screw conveyors and improve their performance.",Resource Extraction,Regolith ISRU for Mission Consumable Production   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These two innovations will enable the construction of the In-situ Nitrate/Nitrite Analyzer (INNA), a deployable microfluidic system for the continuous, autonomous, long-duration analysis of nitrate and nitrite in natural waters that will feature unprecedented sensitivity and autonomous deployment durations for this class of robust microfluidic system. INNA will be able to detect nitrate and nitrite down to single-digit nano-molar levels, making the instrument suitable for monitoring nutrients even in the oligotrophic open ocean where levels of these compounds can be below 10 nM. The system will rely upon the well-understood and widely-used colorimetric Griess assay for nitrite.","INNA itself is highly-relevant to NASA research involving nutrient cycling in the oceans, such as the study of phytoplankton and carbon sequestration from the atmosphere as nitrate is often a limiting resource for the growth of autotrophs. Because INNA is being designed for high sensitivity and long-duration deployments, it is suitable for making an instrument network so global ocean nitrogen cycling could be studied, potentially informing upcoming missions such as the Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) mission. Additionally, the colorimetric approach taken with INNA, including the on-board of dry chemical reagents and standards, would allow for future incarnations of the instrument to be deployed on other planets, moons, or small bodies such as comets. The colorimetric approach can be easily adapted to study many other compounds, redox potentials, etc. Additionally, the core technology being proposed for this SBIR could augment other existing NASA instrumentation, such as the highly-flexible PISCES microfluidic instrument, being developed by Peter Willis at JPL. The ability to mix dry chemicals in-situ will benefit all mission instruments which require liquid reagents and standards which would otherwise have a limited shelf life.","The robust nature of INNA, its projected compact size and low-power requirements coupled with its expected sensitivity and long-duration deployments allows it to be integrated into many different research platforms including ocean gliders, buoys, research vessels, autonomous underwater vehicles, underwater observatories, etc.Because nitrate and aquatic nitrite are very important to measure for understanding the oceanic nitrogen cycle, it is a very important quantity to measure. Government agencies have recently been spending hundreds of millions of dollars on large-scale ocean observation networks, such as the Ocean Observatories Initiative. Many of the instruments being purchased for that research are designed to measure ocean chemistry which INNA and INNA-like instruments could measure, but with higher sensitivity than what is being utilized.Additionally, any time there is a need to measure nitrate or nitrite with high resolution, INNA would be cost competitive. This includes healthcare where the measurement of nitrate and nitrite in plasma, urine and other bodily fluids is becoming recognized as important for a variety of reasons including assessment of the NO cycle in organs, markers for bacterial infections, and cardiac health.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Manufacturing Methods; Mirrors; Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Visible",Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Current methods of non-intrusive airspeed measurement include techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) and Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV). However, some common drawbacks of all these standoff methods for 3D airspeed sensing are that they require precise alignment of separate transmitters and receivers; and it is expensive and unwieldy to extend these measurements to a large enough volume to be practical for use in medium and large wind tunnels. The proposed instrument uses range-resolved elastic backscatter data from a lidar beam that is scanned over the volume of interest to generate a 3D map of aerosol density in a short time span. Aerosol density fluctuations are cross-correlated between successive scans to obtain the displacements of the aerosol features along the three axes. Thereby, temporally and spatially resolved velocity measurements are possible at high resolution.In Phase 1, AeroMancer proposes to conduct a requirements analysis to identify the functional and operational needs of wind tunnel application and of the instrument. A signal link budget analysis tool of the proposed lidar will be developed  to aid in instrument design and scaling. A conceptual design of the instrument will be developed, where the system architecture and main components will be identified. The preliminary design of the software for extraction of 3D airspeed information from the lidar data will be developed. The design studies will be supported using experimental tests with a previously developed lower-fidelity prototype of a different configuration.","A remote velocimetry system for measuring winds and turbulence can become an integral part of NASA ground test facilities such as wind tunnels, hover chambers and anechoic facilities.

A number of very promising architectures for designing high energy lasers at 1651 nm have been described recently, but the performance of the lasers developed in these earlier efforts has been limited by the lack of a sufficiently high-power tunable seed laser.  For this SBIR Phase I program, we propose to develop a robust seed laser that is fiber-coupled, narrow linewidth, tunable, highly reliable, compact, and which ultimately will allow the realization of much higher performance high energy laser sources designed for methane detection.","Development of a new high power seed laser at 1651 nm will push the performance of LIDAR systems for methane detection to levels not currently possible, and it will allow for the deployment of significantly longer range systems with higher precision measurements of methane concentration and distribution in the Earth's atmosphere.

Because the lidar uses readily available laser diodes and the diode laser can be digitally controlled unlike a solid state laser the system can be reconfigured to more than one application. The approach uses very straightforward, high-TRL component technology; does not require specialized lasers, laser scientists, or advanced focal plane technology; and can support 5- to 15-year mission lifetimes. The 2U cubesat form factor means the lidar can be incorporated into a 3U or 6U cubesat that includes the flight avionics and solar panels. The lidar's NASA applications include 3D imaging lidar for asteroids, comets and planetary bodies proving topology, ranging and mapping.

Until recently, the large and delicate instrumentation required for schlieren photography mostly restricted the technique's use to ground test facilities. Previous work has shown that full-scale schlieren images of an aircraft in flight can be synthesized by analyzing high-speed video of the aircraft flying across the sun. The solar schlieren method is especially useful for air-to-air schlieren photography, because an airborne observation platform provides a unique perspective view of the second aircraft. We propose to advance this technique via a new self-nulling schlieren imaging method which has the potential to substantially increase the sensitivity of the technique. This technology could be also used to study large-scale aerodynamic problems where conventional laboratory schlieren imaging is impossible.","Flight tests are often used as a final critical validation of aerodynamic designs developed by computational and wind tunnel methods because the information obtainable in wind tunnels is subject to interference. Outdoor schlieren systems using the sun and moon as background edges make it possible to visualize shock waves, intense noise features, jet plumes, and other phenomena from full-sized aircraft in flight. The proposed software makes it possible to obtain schlieren images using relatively simple camera hardware that may be deployed aboard research aircraft. Applications exist in all forms of research and development associated with turbulent flow fields including aero optics, flow control, drag, boundary layer transition, and flow separation. A possible future application is characterizing wingtip vortices from aircraft. The proposed development of schlieren imaging software will be extremely important in flight tests, where few aero-optical instruments can visualize airflows around full-sized aircraft in a flight environment.","The commercial aviation industry is pursuing new designs for small supersonic jets that have low boom-shape profiles. A successful design will stimulate a market for supersonic air travel, and new aircraft are expected to roll out within the next decade. Flight tests will be necessary as a final critical check of aircraft performance, and schlieren imaging is very effective at visualizing the shock waves generated by aircraft. The proposed software provides a means to obtain schlieren images using image data collected by camera systems that are already in use aboard research aircraft. These developments will provide aircraft manufacturers with an inexpensive means of visualizing aircraft boom shape profiles in full-scale flight tests.","Aerodynamics; Characterization; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Image Analysis; Image Processing; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT)",Flight Test and Measurements Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These components are nonreciprocal and thus highly useful for controlling standing waves and directing signal flow in frequency multiplier cascades, heterodyne, radar, radiometer, and other systems commonly deployed by NASA. However, at the higher frequencies the performance is degraded in terms of bandwidth and loss which severely limits their usefulness.Although there is a demonstrable need for these components, there are relatively few vendors. Most of the commercially available components were developed more than forty years ago and there has been little effort at modernization. Recent advances reported in the literature suggest that the loss in Faraday rotation isolators can be significantly reduced. Using modern electromagnetic simulation tools, we propose to design millimeter-wave and sub-millimeter-wave ferrite components that exhibit significantly reduced loss, and improved power handling and bandwidth.Initial work on the development of a W-band isolator is underway. Ferrite cores have been manufactured and the impedance matching structures have been designed. We plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach within the six month timeframe of the SBIR Phase I program. We have also successfully modeled Y-junction circulators that accurately predict performance similar to those available in the commercial market and are now working on several approaches to increase the bandwidth of these devices. A preliminary design operating at 160 GHz has been completed. In the Phase I program, the design will be refined, built and tested. Beyond Phase I, our goal is to develop a full line of ferrite components operating from 75 GHz to over 320 GHz with significantly improved performance over the current state-of-the-art.","The proposed ferrite components would find immediate application in heterodyne receivers used in NASA's Submillimeter Missions such as Marvel, VESPER, MACO as well as earth observing satellites such as SIRICE. They are also useful in a broad range of laboratory instrumentation for the development of millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave sources, detectors, receivers and systems. They are broadly used in scientific instruments for plasma diagnostics (ITER), chemical spectroscopy, biomaterial analysis, and radio astronomy. These components are fundamental building blocks that find application in virtually any system working at millimeter-wave, submillimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies.","High frequency ferrite components find a broad range of application in military systems that include compact range radar, imaging systems, covert communications systems, and chemical and bio-agent detection systems. There are potential applications in biomedical systems for the real time analysis of skin diseases, portal security scanners, high frequency data links and industrial process control systems. There is an immediate need for these components in frequency extension modules for vector network analyzers operating from 75 GHz to over 500 GHz.

The technological approach is an adaptation of a Busek patented technology, US patent number 8,550,405, entitled ""Solar Powered Spacecraft Power System for a Hall Effect Thruster."" This technology will immediately benefit the deep space 6U CubeSat currently being developed under NASA's ""LunarCube"" program, which is equipped with Busek's groundbreaking, iodine-fueled RF ion thruster BIT-3.  The HDD concept will take advantage of the solar array's raw voltage, which is much higher than the conditioned voltages typically supplied by the spacecraft's electrical power system (EPS), and directly feeds it into the propulsion system's PPU to minimize efficiency losses during high-voltage conversion.  The end result is increased available power for thruster utilization, which in turn can help maximize the vehicle's thrust, specific impulse (Isp) and delta-V maneuverability during the continuous-thrusting phase of the mission.  Operating the ion thruster at higher power will ultimately help reduce time spent on trajectory transfer, thus saving mission operation costs and lessening burden on electronics in high radiation environments.In typical Cube-Sat systems the bus voltage is quite low.  This requires additional power conditioning using step up DC/DC converters when high voltages are needed (such as the grids on the BIT-3 RF ion thruster).  In the proposed approach the HDD unit conditions the high voltage directly from the solar array and passes it to the PPU, thus eliminating redundant power processing of step up converters and improving system efficiency.  This topology also offers the novel feature of thruster dependent peak power tracking, providing direct control of the power flow from the arrays to the PPU by throttling the thruster.","The application of the Hybrid Direct Drive PPU is best realized when coupled to Busek's miniaturized RF ion propulsion systems.  Exploring our solar system with low-cost robotic/scout vehicles as precursors for human missions or science missions will benefit from these technologies.  For small vehicle platforms such as CubeSats, maintaining high thruster power (hence high Isp and delta-V performance) through management of PPU efficiency will be paramount to the mission's success.  Although the initial application of the Direct Drive PPU targets the LunarCube's BIT-3 RF ion thruster, this concept can be easily scaled up to adapt to other EP systems of different sizes and power levels.Potential NASA applications of the Direct Drive enabled EP system include missions to the moon (such as the upcoming EM-1 mission), inner planets, dwarf plants on the asteroid belt and near-Earth asteroids.  Additionally, small ion propulsion system like the BIT-3 is ideal for drag make-up applications for earth observation (EO) missions from low flying platforms, down to altitudes of ~200km.  Altitude reduction is essential for high resolution EO from small, low-cost satellites that are by definition unsuitable for large optical or RF apertures and thus lower altitude is the only option for higher image resolution.","Potential non-NASA customers of the Hybrid Direct Drive enabled EP systems include commercial human exploration and presence in space, commercial asteroid missions, DoD and commercial EO missions.  NRO may also have interest in such technologies for long-duration LEO missions.  The high-efficiency power processing topology may also find markets in other satellite subsystems or UAV related fields.This technology could also provide a compact, universal energy harvester for solar blankets for infantry soldiers.  Soldiers are increasingly dependent on batteries and power sources to power the wide array of electronic gadgets they are equipped with.  This Direct Drive unit could potentially be adapted to interface with a solar blanket or vehicle battery to provide a regulated source of power to charge/power soldier devices.  Programs such as the Army's Nett Warrior PEO Soldier could potentially benefit from this technology.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Conversion; Distribution/Management; Process Monitoring & Control; Prototyping","Small Spacecraft in Deep Space: Power, Navigation, and Structuresis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Humans require faster learning curves for introduction of more complex robotics in space, but the only way to accomplish this is to acquire open source software on easily adaptable hardware. This will enable astronauts to perform multiple design cycles while they are in space, such as on the ISS. Swift Engineering is proposing a lightweight surround visual and sensory feedback system for robotic pilots that can easily be transferable, and is modular and scalable to any robotic system. Using 360 degree cameras, LIDAR, and a Myo armband, the robotic pilot will be able to quickly adapt to any environment from anywhere, including mission control. The key is that all of this work is being built from open source platforms so that nothing becomes overly proprietary, and astronauts can perform design cycles in space quickly and efficiently.","Swift Engineering's solution to robotics development in space will provide astronauts with a surround sensory feedback system that can be modified to adapt to any challenge that is presented. The missions that are in NASA's technology roadmap that will benefit from this technology include collaborative manipulation of robotic arms in extreme environments. This technology will allow the robotic pilot to be stationed on Earth or inside a spacecraft and have a fully immersive experience while the robot is outside in space, on a foreign planet, or dealing with a hot/cold/caustic environment that humans cannot be exposed to. In addition, this technology opens up multiple doors for gesture control of devices such as scooping up dirt from a rover or grabbing items next to a spacecraft and moving it on-board the spacecraft.","Swift is interested in exploring robotic assistance inside autoclaves, freezers, cutting rooms, and on the factory floor. Swift would like to understand the impact that human assisted (and ultimately autonomous) robotic arms can have on the factory floor, but also investigate what problems can be solved when placed in environments that humans cannot withstand, such as autoclaves, ovens, and freezers. This will be completed while utilizing both hand layup composite processes and resin infusion processes (out-of-autoclave). A fully surround feedback system allows an engineer to remove material from the freezer while sitting at his desk, have it laid out on the cutting table, and subsequently cut. It also would allow modification of items placed inside an autoclave such as thermocouples and vacuum ports. This would save immense amounts of time for pre-preg composite lay-ups, which is directly transferrable to NASA and other terrestrial programs.",Man-Machine Interaction; Metallics; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),"Human Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystem, Manipulation Subsystem, and Human System Interaction   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In our Phase I program we will also demonstrate a novel resonator, designed to reduce the pulse width and increase the extraction efficiency on low-gain, three-level laser transitions. Our proposed innovation has the potential for improving the operating efficiency of water-vapor DIAL laser transmitters by about a factor of two compared to current lasers.","The laser technology to be developed under this SBIR program lays the foundation for an affordable class of space-based remote sensing instruments that are compatible with Earth Venture or ISS-class missions.  Because of the lower cost, we expect the frequency of these opportunities to be far greater than those of major missions such as ICESat-2 and those recommended in the decadal study: ACE, ASCENDS, and LIST.

However, those techniques are intrusive, bandwidth limited, time consuming to implement, require extensive data processing and the resulting data may ultimately generate false results in the form of pseudo (noise) sources. Advanced Systems & Technologies Inc. proposes an optical non-contact sensor fusion concept which, for the first time, enables direct capture and observation of full-field non-stationary dynamic structural intensity (DSI) and unsteady radiated sound fields or transient flow fields around the structure of interest. DSI depicts the flow of energy in a structure and provides an unambiguous identification of structural noise sources and sinks. Additionally, the ability to capture and correlate the acoustic/flow field data with the structure borne intensity offers an unprecedented and rapid diagnostic capability for noise source characterization and evaluation of noise abatement systems. In addition to being non-intrusive the measurements are fast, can be made at operationally relevant bandwidths, which extend to the ultrasonic domain, and provide deeper insight into the complex structural dynamics which are the root cause of noise emission.","The ICARUSV contributes towards current and future noise reduction goals by providing a diagnostic tool for evaluation of a wide range of aircraft structures designed to effect noise reduction. Examples applications include testing of continuous mould line wing structures, drooped leading edge, active flow control, adaptive and flexible wing structures, smart cheverons, and toboggan fairings. Related applications include evaluation of engine noise reduction systems such as Ultra High Bypass engines, distortion-tolerant fans and variable fan nozzles. The ability to visualize energy flow paths between sources and sinks on the structure will elucidate the contribution of specific design features in determining these paths and suggest design modifications which mitigate or redirect this energy away from specific locations. ICARUSV also offers a new tool for identification of vehicle specific aero-elastic instabilities and for fundamental aeronautic studies related to ground testing, wind tunnel tests, and flight experiments.","The parallel sensor architecture of the ICARUSV overcomes limitations in existing technology, introducing, for the first time, a true imaging modality to the laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The ICARUSV concept and related instruments is thus anticipated to appeal to a broad spectrum of applications and industries where existing commercial single beam LDV's are currently employed. In addition to performing routine vibration measurements much more efficiently (orders of magnitude faster than LDV) the imaging modality of the ICARUSV is anticipated to find new diagnostic capability beyond those of traditional LDV, including aerospace, automotive, electronics and industrial plants applications. Numerous industries (automotive, aerospace, medical and computer electronics) employ LDV for modal vibration analyses.

ATA has a long track record of producing stabilized platforms to host small optical payloads.  Building on a previous NASA SBIR, ATA now produces the stable platform used in NASA's Lunar Lasercomm Space Terminal (LLST) and Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) programs.  ATA will create a Stable Platform for Optical Communications (SPOC) that could host the laser communications collimator telescope and provide a stabilized platform to prevent the 150-microradian spacecraft disturbance environment from reaching the laser communications terminal.  Advances in the suspension flexure, the platform structure, and actuators will be required to meet the size, weight and power requirements.  One challenging requirement is that an angular-motion sensor is required for the control system.  Gyros exist that can measure adequately but they are too heavy, too large, and use too much power. ATA will develop a small, lightweight, nanoradian-noise class angular rate sensor based on our proven MHD technology to meet the challenging angular disturbance attenuation requirement.","ATA's proposed Stable Platform for Optical Communications (SPOC) and Magnetohydrodynamic Low-Frequency (MHD-LF) precision angular rate motion sensor package could host the laser collimator for NASA's Deep-Space Optical Terminal (DOT) program, which seeks to implement beacon-aided or beacon-less laser communication to and from Mars and beyond by the next decade.  Beginning with a NASA-funded Phase I SBIR, ATA developed the stable platform concept that serves as the basis for the lasercomm terminal that NASA will be flying on the Lunar Laser Comm Demonstration (LLCD) on the LADEE spacecraft and is planned for the Laser Comm Relay Demonstration (LCRD) program that will be hosted on a Loral communication satellite.  Similarly, under this NASA SBIR the SPOC could be developed to meet the need for long-range precision optical pointing and propel NASA to the forefront of laser communication.","ATA is committed to commercializing NASA SBIRs, as evidenced by our recently delivered space-qualified inertially stable platform to a government customer for a laser communication application.

Conventional approaches scale down poorly, due to the size, mass, and power requirements of components needed for high pressure propellant storage and flow control.  For small spacecraft already facing significant mass and volume constraints, these systems severely limit the amount of propellant storage capacity.  Systima proposes to develop a miniaturized low power propellant feed and flow control system for green monopropellant thrusters that enables use of very low-pressure propellant storage vessels and high efficiency packaging.  The proposed system can provide full feed system and flow control functionality for 0.5 to 1N-scale green monopropellant thrusters while consuming less than 1 Watt.  There are no limitations on the type monopropellant that can be used with Systima's miniaturized pump.  This program will target development of the pump for use with propulsion systems operating with advanced green monopropellant AF-M315E.  This monopropellant has low-toxicity making it easy to store, integrate into modular designs and launch without added costs associated with handling toxic propellants such as hydrazine. In the Phase I program Systima will demonstrate the technology through analysis, and fabrication and testing of critical components.  Phase I testing will evaluate preliminary system operation parameters that will be used to develop an integrated pump concept design.  In Phase II, Systima will design and fabricate an integrated prototype pump system to demonstrate system performance and capability to meet thruster feed system requirements.  Optimization of the design to minimize the system size, weight and power requirements will be conducted for chemical propulsion system integration onto small spacecraft.","The proposed feedsystem has applicability for all liquid-based propellant applications where low power and high packing density are critical design constraints.  Specific application to green monopropellant thrusters addresses NASA's need for 1N-scale chemical propulsion for its small spacecraft and CubeSat development efforts, such as NASA Edison.  Spacecraft micropropulsion systems with Systima's miniaturized pump can be used for orbit maintenance, fine attitude control, troubleshooting and maintenance, and potential needs for quick response at relatively high Isp.  Green monopropellant micropropulsion systems offer safer handling, reduced system complexity, decreased launch processing times and increased performance compared to conventional hydrazine micropropulsion systems, and are well suited for a wide range of NASA spacecraft missions.","Green monopropellants offer advantages in performance and reduced handling infrastructure for commercial and military micro satellites, and allow for modular designs for low cost rapid access to space capabilities.

This unique gripping solution overcomes the shortcomings of vacuum grippers by eliminating the need for a compressed air system and offering more rapid actuation, thus achieving significant cost savings and throughput improvements in customers' manufacturing processes. The ESG gripper utilizes an adhesive element inspired by gecko feet coupled with an electrostatic adhesive.  When the electrostatic and gecko adhesives work together, a positive feedback cycle is created that, depending on surface type, can be greater than the sum of its parts–as the gecko adhesive engages, it brings the electrostatic adhesive closer to the surface, thus increasing its adhesive force; in turn, the electrostatic adhesive helps engage more of the fibrillar stalks of the gecko adhesive.  Previous experimental results have shown that the combination adhesive technology can provide up to 5.1x greater adhesion that the electrostatic or gecko-like adhesives alone (Ruffatto, Shah, & Spenko, 2014). The adhesive and grippers have been developed significantly over the last decade, since the first gecko-like adhesives were fabricated in 2003.  Based on prior test results of the adhesives and grippers presented here, the ESG Gripper will offer the following benefits:?

The application of thermally-reversible polymers combined with a plastic recycling, blending, and extrusion process would allow current and future packaging materials to be processed into a copolymer blend filament suited to the 3-D printing system.  This will provide NASA with a means to generate 3-D printer feedstock from on-hand packaging plastics without the need for separate 3-D printer raw material payloads.  CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of thermally-reversible bond structures in commercial adhesive applications, and the proposed concept not only has the potential to enable reclamation and 3-D printing from currently employed packaging materials, but to advance the state-of-the-art in 3-D printing materials technology.

Ultimately, this defines the maximum operating pressure for the engine. For regeneratively cooled engines, even those using film cooling, the practical limit has been reached, and further increases in chamber pressure are simply not possible. Transpiration cooling does not have this limitation. Furthermore, because a transpiration-cooled engine pumps only a tiny fraction of the fuel through the wall, a smaller and hence lighter pump can be used, which will significantly reduce the dry mass. Finally, because transpiration cooling can keep the wall much cooler than regenerative cooling with film cooling, a transpiration-cooled engine can use less refractory (i.e., lighter weight) materials, thereby achieving additional reductions in dry mass. The net results are significant increases in the thrust-to-weight ratio and specific impulse and a significant decrease in the dry mass of the system. The perceived limitation of transpiration cooling with a porous wall is coking and blockage of the pores if a carbon-based fuel such as methane is used. In previous work using LOX/H2 propellant, Ultramet showed that with minimal transpiration flow, the wall temperature can be kept well below the point at which methane would form coke. In this project, Ultramet will work with Purdue University to build on previous success with transpiration cooling in LOX/H2 engines and design a lightweight LOX/LCH4 engine in the 10,000- to 25,000-lbf thrust range. The transpiration model will be physics-based and applicable to both LOX/LCH4 and LOX/H2. Key component demonstrators will be fabricated and used to collect empirical data on the thermal, structural, and hydraulic characteristics of the wall architecture. Transpiration rates on subscale hardware will be verified through flow testing, and empirical data will be used to verify the predicted lack of coking.","The primary NASA applications will be for high-performance, high-thrust O2/CH4 rocket engines in the 10,000- to 25,000-lbf thrust class, which can be used on booster upper stages, as well as for ascent/descent engines for Mars and lunar landers. Smaller engines in the 1000-lbf thrust class can be used for Earth departure stages and orbital maneuvers of large spacecraft.

The tests will be conducted on clean and 'dirty' seals. The results of the Phase I will be one or more options for hermetic sealing. During some approaches (Shape memory Alloy and brazing) additional data will be acquired to determine the temperature rise of the inner sample chamber. In the follow on Phase II of the proposed investigation, we will design and fabricate multiple high fidelity prototypes of the hermetic sealing canister and sealing system. The size and shape of the canisters will be designed to fit the requirements of any proposed or current sample return missions, such as Mars 2020. These canisters will include thermal insulation to protect and preserve volatile material within the samples, and will be optimized for mass reduction. We will test the hermeticity of the canister seal when exposed to dust accumulation, as well as thermal cycling, shock and vibration environments. This testing will result in a technology readiness level for the sample canister and sealing of TRL6 at the end of the Phase II investigation. We will also develop preliminary spacecraft requirements (mass, power, volume, etc.) for the sealing system.","Future robotic astrobiology and geology missions such as Mars Sample Return, as well as Lunar, Comet and Asteroid sample return missions will benefit greatly from the ability to hermetically seal samples in a dusty environment. These missions will require long periods of time where the samples are either in transit back to Earth, or awaiting pickup. A robust sample canister that is dust tolerant will greatly reduce the complexity of support equipment that may otherwise be required to clean containment vessels prior to sealing. This will contribute to reductions in mass and program cost, making sample return missions more feasible.In addition during future human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and Asteroids, astronauts will be collecting samples for earth return (in a similar manner as Apollo astronauts). The seals will therefore be directly applicable to those missions as well. Although originally not designed for other applications, one can imagine that test data and certain parts of the technology could potentially be used for space suite designs, spacecraft airlocks, and fluid transfer lines (as in on-orbit refueling).","Terrestrial uses of robust hermetically sealed containers might include telerobotic inspection and sampling of hazardous materials. Tele-operated robots can go into many hazardous areas which humans cannot. These robots could be outfitted with canisters with hermetic seals which function in the presence of dirt, dust and chemicals. The canisters could be robotically filled with hazardous material, and hermetically sealed using the induction brazing technique. For example, when using a double walled cylinder approach, the outer contaminated sleeve could be separated, leaving the internal chamber sealed and safe for human handling and laboratory analysis.These canisters could also be used in field geology work, where cleanliness is not available. Samples could be obtained in the field without the need to protect sensitive sealing surfaces. These samples would be hermetically sealed and free of contamination for the journey back to the laboratory for analysis.",Characterization; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Prototyping,Contamination Control and Planetary Protectionis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Recent advances in the technology of optical detectors for high-energy physics (such as photomultiplier tubes), together with manufacturing techniques for flat-panel displays, have enabled a breakthrough in microfabricated solar cell arrays that are broadband and highly efficient, extremely lightweight, as well as extremely resistant to radiation damage and degradation with time. Efficiencies up to 50% are expected (80% theoretical) for space-based solar power. A prototype array of solar panels is proposed, consisting of 8 panels, each the size of a 3U nanosatellite (10 cm x 30 cm). Such an array would provide 150 W of power, while weighing only 100 grams, and being easily stowed, before deployment, inside a small portion of the 3U package.

The unsteady pressure results from this test demonstrated excellent accuracy and spatial resolution, establishing the technical readiness of the fast PSP sensor. During the program, two issues were identified that would significantly improve the fast PSP system performance, 1) real-time data processing, and 2) acquisition of both mean and unsteady data using a single entry. Here we propose the continued development of the fast PSP system by addressing these issues. To enable real-time data processing, a system composed of a computer with a large block of memory, a multi-core processer, and several high end video cards (GPUs) has been assembled. Modern GPUs include thousands of floating point processors and large blocks of memory which enable parallel computations to be executed on individual images. Fast PSP data is an ideal application of this technology as many of the computations can be performed on each image independently. Preliminary tests by ISSI have demonstrated improvements of a factor of three to thirty in processing time using this approach. Acquisition of both mean and unsteady pressure during a single tunnel entry would increase tunnel productivity and can be used to improve the accuracy of the unsteady pressure data. Unfortunately, fast PSPs are generally very temperature sensitive which limits their use in acquiring mean pressure data. ISSI has recently developed a fast PSP formulation with low temperature sensitivity. This formulation will be optimized for use in large wind tunnels and enable acquisition of mean and unsteady pressure data using a single PSP.","There is considerable interest in measurements of unsteady pressure for evaluation of computational models and study of flow physics on hypersonic inlets, compressors, aeroelasticity, and rotorcraft aerodynamics.

The fast PSP technology could be deployed to wind tunnels at Ames, Glenn, and Langley for testing on a variety of programs that have need of unsteady pressure measurements.

Previous research at STI successfully concentrated on the invention of an improved method to design rad-hard analog circuits called ADONIS.  ADONIS is a structured approach which uses a cell matrix method where the designer places symbols representing circuit elements at locations that give optimum analog performance critical for small geometries.

Such low-modulus, conformal nanomembrane sensor skins with integrated interconnect elements and electronic devices can be applied to new or existing wind tunnel models for multi-axis surface pressure analysis, or to lightweight UAVs as part of active flutter control systems. NanoSonic has demonstrated the feasibility of NM transducer materials in such sensor skins for the measurement of dynamic shear stress and normal pressure. Semiconductor NM sensor skins are thin, mechanically and chemically robust materials that may be patterned in two dimensions to create multi-sensor element arrays that can be embedded into small probe tips or conformally attached onto vehicle and model surfaces. Sensors may be connected to external support instrumentation either through thin film and ribbon cable interconnects, or potentially wirelessly using RF communication directly from electronic networks incorporated into the sensor skin material.","The anticipated initial market of the NM sensor skin arrays is for flight testing and wind tunnel testing of flow models for NASA flight research centers. An appreciation of the instrumentation issues obtained by working with such centers would allow improvements in sensor materials, electronics and packaging, and potentially allow the transition of related products to operational vehicles. The commercialization potential of the NM technology developed through this NASA SBIR program lies in four areas, namely 1) NM sensor skin arrays for the measurement of multi-axis surface pressure, 2) Broader sensor skin arrays for the measurement of pressure, 3) Single-element air or water flow sensors, and 4) NM material itself.","Primary customers would be university, government laboratory and aerospace industry researchers.

EM Photonics has found that the majority of the coding and debugging time is not spent defining the problem physics but instead on balancing computation between multiple heterogeneous devices, handling communication of data, and managing distributed memory systems. The time spent improving, modifying, or debugging device specific code paths and common code sections could be better spent improving kernel performance or adding new features.To address the problem of separating physical science from computing science, we have been developing a solution that decouples the problem definition from the platform-specific implementation details by expressing algorithms as a series of tasks and data dependencies and handing it off to a managed runtime that efficiently partitions and schedules the problem tasks for execution. We have proven this technique in the field of linear algebra, and in this project we will bring these benefits to mission critical NASA solvers. In this SBIR, we will construct a powerful system that, by virtue of decoupling algorithms from dispatch and execution, will be suited for both current and upcoming computer architectures.Writing a new application will require only an understanding of the algorithm to be implemented, and abstracts away details of heterogeneous resource management and scheduling, thereby removing this responsibility from the scientists that develop this software. Our solution will provide future compatibility, as going to a new version of the same hardware involves no changes and adding new hardware types will require only writing specialized computational kernels. Higher performance is attained because the scheduler will adjust the software's execution based on factors such as the hardware availability and its current performance, as well as the run-time characteristics of the program's execution.","Our proposed technologies will directly improve the performance, resource utilization, productivity, and fault tolerance of many high performance NASA solver codes. Codes such as GEOS, ModelE, Snowflake, OVERFLOW, and FUN3D can achieve both short and long term benefits by adopting our proposed task-based methodology and scheduling tools. Our proposed technology is truly broad-base, and has no domain-specific requirements. It can benefit every NASA application that utilizes this task-based framework.In the short term, these tools will be able improve current hardware utilization and performance. Additionally, productivity will increase as the main focus of the codes will become the underlying science rather than the parallelization and communication needed to implement a high performance code base. Another short term benefit includes improved fault tolerance as a scheduled task-based approach will be able to recover from a scenario in which communication with a node is lost.Long term benefits focus on future-proof algorithms and increased scalability for many of the aforementioned applications. By decoupling the algorithms from the underlying hardware implementation, we will provide a framework that allows for rapid adaptation of new architectures. Scalability will also improve as the proposed scheduler will automatically distribute work to any additional nodes that were added to the cluster.","Our scheduled task-based methodology has applications outside of NASA. Since our proposed technology does not have any domain-based restrictions, it can be utilized by any software system wishing to increase utilization and performance.Math libraries for heterogeneous architectures such as CULA, Arrayfire, NMath, and others will be easily scale and work across platforms. They will also be able to easily scale performance to multiple GPUs in both workstation and cluster environments. Additionally, we will be able to solve problems where there is insufficient memory on the GPU to hold the entire problem.Other non-NASA domains where our technology is immediate applicable include, but is not limited to: molecular dynamics, financial analysis, and graphical ray tracing.

Indeed, what is currently being done for ""colloidal propulsion"" parallels the requirements for an effective vapor-jet pump. The attractive feature of colloidal droplets produced by the electrospray phenomena is significant. Principal among these is the lack of volatility of the working fluid, negating the need for diffusion pump heater concepts, and the ability to produce ions or droplets at a known velocity that exceed the thermal velocity of target pump gases using only milliwatts of power. Over the past 30+ years, no significant advance in vacuum pump concepts save for the turbo-molecular pump has been realized. The proposed technology offers a potential for game-changing new technology that may obviate a turbo pump in many applications while promising to provide significant cost savings with unprecedented reliability and longevity.","Spacecraft laboratories, such as on the ISS, could benefit greatly from the success of the proposed technology. Using the vacuum of space for an analytical instrument is highly undesirable due to the safety factor of deliberately creating any leaks on a spacecraft or space station, and the discharge of atmospheric gases could affect the space vessel station keeping or trajectory. As a result, there is a need for a means to create a vacuum for analytical devices such as mass spectrometers used on the ISS, probes for interplanetary missions, and possible future hand-held use by astronauts. The proposed electrospray diffusion pump offers the potential to be applied to all aforementioned applications.","Over the past decade, especially the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there has been an increasing demand for sensitive chemical, biological, and explosive detection devices. Mass spectrometers, unlike some spectrometers such as ion mobility (IMS), require a partial pressure region to scan for a given mass number indicative of the trace species of interest. Probably the most significant hurdle yet to overcome is how one can create a cost effective, small, and low power vacuum system to make mass spectrometers portable. The proposed technology offers a radical new method to achieve cost, weight, power, and compatibility goals for a new generation of portable analytical instruments.","Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors)",In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Efficient propulsive performance and long-duration storage attributes have made the use of hydrazine widespread across the aerospace community. However, hydrazine is highly corrosive and toxic, creating a need for non-toxic, high-performance propellants for NASA, other government agencies, academia, and the commercial space industry. Handling and safety concerns with the current toxic chemical propellants can lead to more costly propulsion systems; the use of new non-toxic propellants has the potential to reduce the cost of access to space by lowering overall life cycle costs.

Current state-of-the-art parallel systems like Hadoop and Spark offer horizontally scalable analytics and reduced costs for enterprises, but weren't built to natively consume and process large remote sensing raster datasets. Conversely, GPUs can vastly accelerate image processing operations. Some open source projects have arisen that showcase hybrid Hadoop/GPU computing. However, there are no mature open source projects that utilize GPUs within Spark (an eventual replacement of MapReduce) and none that were built to process large remote sensing imagery. This is the primary role of the proposed innovation, Spark-RS.Spark-RS contains three primary components. One is a parallel large image loading component that quickly loads large multi-band imagery into a Spark cluster. The second component is a remote sensing library for Spark applications. It provides an API for reading and writing large images and wraps many common image operations from existing open source and NASA-built remote sensing libraries. The third component is a GPU management library for Spark. It simplifies and abstracts utilization of GPUs within a Spark application.","Each of the datasets listed in this SBIR's description and their corresponding applications are all potential candidates for use by Spark-RS since they involve large multi-spectral and hyper-spectral raster-based observations. These include HyspIRI, JPSS-1, NPP, SDO, MRO, MERRA, MERRA2, LandSat among many, many others. Thus, any NASA datacenter that has a Hadoop-based cluster will benefit from the proposed innovation, Spark-RS.","Spark-RS can equally be applied to myriad other remote sensing and GIS applications across U.S. government agencies moving towards big data platforms like Hadoop and Spark. There are at least 28 different U.S. government agencies that utilize or produce geospatial data. Not all utilize raster datasets, but many do. In particular, the Department of Defense (Army, Air Force, Navy, USMC) and the Intelligence Community (NSA, CIA, NGA, DIA, etc.) all produce and consume large amounts of image-based data. With the increasing amount of non-ortho-rectified oblique imagery-based datasets from sensors from aerial photography (WAMI/FMV), Spark-RS could also play a critical role. In addition, domestic agencies like USGS, FBI, EPA, FEMA, etc. also have vast quantities of raster-based datasets. Lastly, industrial applications including GIS mapping companies, aerial photography companies & medial imaging companies all can benefit and, importantly, contribute back to the sustained success of Spark-RS.","Data Processing; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)","Algorithms and Tools for Science Data Processing, Discovery and Analysis, in State-of-the-Art Data Environments   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The thermal gradient measurement can be achieved by using several temperature sensors equally spaced along the length of the probe.Thermal conductivity can be measured by one of two methods: the 'steady state' method or the 'transient with a variant' or 'pulse heating' method. The steady state method was used by the Apollo 15-17 missions , whereas the pulse heating method was developed by Lister  (1979) after the Apollo period In the steady state heating method, heat is applied to the regolith around the probe for a long period of time and thermal conductivity is derived from the rate at which temperature rises. This will affect the measurement associated with the diurnal and annual wave as it adds a significant amount of heat to the regolith, which will take a very long time to dissipate. In the pulse heating method, more heat is applied for a short duration of time. The temperature of the probe increases instantaneously and slowly falls off as the heat dissipates into the regolith after the heater is turned off. In this case, the thermal conductivity is derived from the cooling rate. In the pulse heating method, less heat is required and less time is required for a measurement. For the most accurate results, sensors must extend below the depth of the multi-year thermal fluctuation detected during the Apollo missions (>3 m).  If the hole is deep enough to avoid the effects of the insolation, the geothermal gradient obtained in a lower portion of the hole should accurately reflect the endogenic heat flow. The spacing between sensors should be small (approximately 30 cm), because thermal conductivity of the regolith is heavily affected by its texture, which varies with depth.  Determining the in situ heat flow, as well as the site-specific thermal wave depths, requires that measurements be taken over long durations (6-8 years).","The National Research Council's 2011 Decadal Survey on planetary sciences recommended performing heat flow measurements on network geophysical missions to the Moon. The heat flow probe therefore meets payload requirements for the International Lunar Networks. In addition to measuring heat flow on the Moon, the probe can be deployed on the future Discovery- and New Frontier-class robotic missions to Mars, and other planetary bodies. The instrument may be used by astronauts on Sortie human lunar missions. The percussive penetrometer can also be used to deploy other sensors, such as Neutron and Gamma spectrometer and Electrical Properties probe. Since the penetration rate relates to soil's bearing strength, the tool could also provide geotechnical measurements (incl. in situ density) of lunar subsurface to a depth of 3 m.","Non-NASA applications include measuring of heat flow in areas on earth, where optimal thermal isolation of heaters/temperature sensors is of paramount importance. These for example include areas with hydrocarbon potential. Therefore exploration companies, such as Shell or Chevron, would in particular be interested in this technology. Since these heat probes are small and can be made relatively cheaply, they can be left in earth forever. Thus, the heat flow data can be accumulated indefinitely. This in particular would be important for tracking global climate change and to understand the nature and causes of climate change. Thus, proposed heat flow deployment method, because of potential cost savings, may allow more heat flow probes being deployed around the earth. The possible 'customer' may for example be the International Heat Flow Commission of IASPEI, who initiated the project ""Global Database of Borehole Temperatures and Climate Reconstructions"". Prof Nagihara is working with Oil and Gas companies in the Gulf of Mexico in the area of heat flow measurements and he will be the best segue for identifying commercialization opportunities.","Actuators & Motors; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Composites; Deployment; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Thermal",In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

As an alternative to OOA prepreg systems, infusion of dry fiber preforms made by dry fiber – AFP can mitigate out-time issues and shelf-life problems combined with lower cost manufacturing.  Although improvements in automated dry fiber placement (ADFP) products have continued, use and application of these ADFP products have been limited due to the necessary balance of processing and performance of the infusion resin.  This is a result of not only the low permeability of the ADFP product preforms but also the inadequate damage tolerance and micro-crack sensitivity of the developed composites.  Accordingly, Applied Poleramic, Inc. proposes to develop a novel low viscosity, long pot-life infusion resin for use with ADFP product preforms that results in cured performance similar to that of unidirectional Hexcel 8552 prepreg parts.  Specifically, the infusion resin will have more than twice the pot-life at lower viscosity as compared to commercial infusion resins along with significantly improved fracture toughness.  This will be accomplished through the development of a novel eutectic aromatic amine curing agent and self-assembly nano-modifier.  This innovative epoxy infusion resin will enable large complex composite structures to be developed using ADFP product preforms with reduced production time, higher part quality, and a new level of performance not attainable with current commercial infusion resins.  Ultimately, the technology will lead to a new generation of low cost composite materials, critical to future NASA space programs and missions.","This composite technology can provide cost, performance, and design advantages where traditional prepreg and OOA prepreg materials have been used or specified such as future production of spacecraft, large space structures, space stations, satellites, orbiters, landers, rovers, and habitats.  Some specific programs include the Orion (MPCW) and future MMSEVs.  The technology may also find use for cryogenic tanks where thin-ply ADFP product preforms would be resistant to micro-cracking.","Opportunities for commercial applications come from NASA funded crew and cargo space transportation partners, commercial aircraft, rotorcraft, satellite, and transportation structures.  This OOA infusion composite technology will be targeted for future large structures in which layup and manufacturing time has excluded the use of commercial prepreg materials due to out-time concerns.

During Phase II and follow-on phases, the proposed technology will be refined, optimized, and scaled to larger size production. The proposed materials will also be tested in various environments. Packaging methods will be investigated and the final product will be integrated into working CubeSats with the assistance of a CubeSat design company.","As spacecraft's size reduces, damage resulting from the effect of thermal fluctuations becomes increasingly detrimental.

In Phase II the team will use UAM to 3D print an aluminum structure capable of carrying structural loads with integrated thermal management passages as may be used in a pumped integrated heat exchanger. This demonstration unit will be delivered to NASA for testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.","UAM-enabled thermal management + structural devices are an important enabler for not-too-distant deep space missions, where UAM-enabled devices permit more system integration and autonomy while reducing mass and volume. For application in deep space missions this paradigm shift is similar to the change from a few day Lunar mission (Apollo) to a multiple year low earth orbit habitat (Space Station). Typical initial UAM applications would include integrating structure and thermal control of parts of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover, followed by components of advanced small spacecraft that have very small masses with their temperatures highly sensitive to variations in the component power output and spacecraft environmental temperature. In both applications, UAM addresses competing system requirements for managing primary load paths and integrating thermal management into the structure.","The initial application of high performance UAM-enabled thermal management devices will likely be in NASA, defense and commercial space structure programs, in that order. This estimate recognizes the high performance technology leading nature of the organizations and their missions. The project team already services aerospace customers.

We propose a novel approach to fabricate reinforced composite materials for radiation shielding applications using a powder metallurgy approach with sintering via the innovative Field Assisted Sintering Technology (FAST). The composite materials that we propose include various compositions of boron carbide (B4C) and tungsten carbide (WC) in either an aluminum matrix or in a polymer matrix of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). FAST (also called spark plasma sintering- SPS) is an innovative process that sinters powder with near 100% theoretical density and very limited to no grain growth. FAST is a one step process that is highly flexible and robust, with short processing cycles (100-1000 times faster).  It is much more cost effective in comparison to conventional compaction and sintering methods, and it is also amenable to large scale production.","Lightweight innovative radiation shielding materials are needed to safeguard humans in next generation exploration.

The concept, called DRIFT-UAS (Distributed Resilient Framework for Trajectory Management of Unmanned Aerial Systems), is a cloud-based system that consists of algorithms and an information-sharing framework that would enable autonomous trajectory planning and strategic deconflicting of trajectories of manned and unmanned aircraft, while optimizing system-wide objectives such as safety, efficiency, and equity.DRIFT-UAS envisions four information signals that are exchanged in a cloud-based environment.  The signals are (a) trajectory intent from an aircraft to DRIFT-UAS, (b) trajectory feedback (e.g., level of congestion on the proposed route as well as nearby routes in time and space) from DRIFT-UAS to the aircraft (c) loading projections from DRIFT-UAS to NAS ATC resources, and (d) capacity signals derived from weather forecasts, dynamic airspace restrictions, or acceptable loading levels at various NAS resources.  The signals are processed by a centralized MDM (Master De-conflicting Module) to generate a trajectory feedback signal, and ATGMs (Autonomous Trajectory Generation Modules) autonomously generate trajectories for aircraft based on the feedback signal. DRIFT-UAS is based on a new class of algorithms for solving large-scale TFM problems by separating TFM optimization into two problems---a master problem, equivalent to the MDM that checks for capacity violations and allocates resources to competing aircraft, and a sub-problem, equivalent to the ATGM solved by each individual aircraft that generates 4-d trajectories for each flight.  The master problem exchanges dual prices that signal congestion across ATC resources to guide the sub-problems to an optimal solution.","The core application of the work in this project will be to further NASA's and the FAA's goals to enable safe and efficient Trajectory Based Operations for UASs.  If successful, it is envisioned that DRIFT-UAS will provide the platform though which all aircraft (unmanned or otherwise) would strategically interact with the ATC system to signal trajectory intent and receive feedback on delays and congestion.  DRIFT-UAS would also serve as a centralized repository for trajectory intent and ATC capacity.In the short to medium term, the platform could be integrated within a simulation environment such as SMART-NAS to help simulate the behavior of a large number of UAS systems to test various TBO concepts.","Outside of achieving NASA's and the FAA's goals for NextGen, DRIFT-UAS's algorithms provide a platform for similar large-scale optimization of autonomous entities in a distributed environment.  Examples of such environments include robotic pickers at warehouses, in which large groups of robots autonomously perform missions in the presence of system-wide costs and capacity constraints.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Autonomy of the National Airspace System (NAS)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The use of composites in aircraft manufacturing is growing dramatically. The assessment of structural integrity of composite materials after automated manufacturing becomes vitally important for the safety of the aircraft and its crew members. Conventional NDE methods, e.g., ultrasonic C-scan and tap test, use point-by-point scan scheme, which is labor intensive and time consuming. New NDE sensor systems that can quickly scan defects in large, complex composite structures are highly desirable.To address this critical need, X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII), teaming up with Prof. Fuh-Gwo Yuan at North Carolina State University (NCSU) proposes to develop an innovative Automated Ultrasonic Imaging Technique system, which is called AUIT system, for rapid inspection of large-area complex composites. In Phase I we will prototype an AUIT system and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique. In Phase II, we will focus on refining the prototype system design and development with improved hardware and software. In Phase III, we will focus on transitioning the AUIT technology.","NASA has been of great interest in various nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and/or structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques to detect damage in vehicle structures and airframe components.

Skin-friction drag reduction technology has a very significant impact in the future design of all aircraft, propellers, turbine blades, and wind-turbines, just to name few applications. Experimental and Direct Numerical Simulations results provide evidence that spanwise waves, of appropriate frequency and amplitude in the turbulent boundary layer, produce substantial skin-friction drag reduction. The generation and control of the spanwise waves however has been a significant practical barrier to the implementation of this technology, due to the requirement for complex moving parts that are too heavy and expensive to be added to an aircraft wing. In fact their additional weight and complex installation would essentially reduce or negate the benefits of the drag reduction. Lynntech proposes to use a proprietary technology based on Pulsed Plasma actuators, which are light-weight, simple to build, and easy to control, to generate turbulent boundary layer perturbations that induce significant skin-friction drag reduction. The proposed technology can be embedded in the wing, or propeller blade, to be flush with the wall and be electrically powered, thus avoiding additional ducting and other adverse characteristics that make competing skin-friction drag reduction approaches impractical for aeronautical applications. Lynntech's approach could also be exploited for dual use: the plasma actuators, in a different flight regime, could also be used to delay flow separation and thus delay stall onset, without the need to install an additional system. The proposed technology has a very wide outreach because it addresses a fundamental issue in aerodynamics and could be applied equally well to increase efficiency of aircraft within NASA programs, civilian transport aircraft, and military vehicles.","NASA conducts a very significant amount of research for atmospheric vehicles: thus technologies that directly address aerodynamic drag reduction are well aligned with the agency needs and goals. Skin-friction drag reduction through plasma actuators allows dramatic increase in fuel efficiency, which translates directly in the ability to fly longer, farther, faster and with reduced carbon emissions. Areas of research in which NASA is particularly active are alternative fuels and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) research. Alternative fuels are being researched primarily to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere; improved aerodynamic efficiency would significantly increase the chance of making these alternative fuels viable alternatives, as it would lower the requirements on the engine and fuel systems. Small UAS are typically even more constrained, with respect to payload, due to their limited flight endurance. Reducing skin-friction drag would allow all UAS to fly longer or at reduced cost: long endurance UAS is an active area of research within NASA (e.g. Global Hawk). Improved aerodynamic efficiency does not affect terrestrial vehicles only: future planetary exploration missions could exploit efficient aerial vehicles to explore wider surface areas, faster.","Fuel efficiency for civilian transport aircraft is always of great interest to aircraft manufacturers and operators. Airline profitability depends, to no small extent, on the cost of fuel per mile flown. Reducing aerodynamic drag, through the use of better designs and new materials, is a well established trend. The proposed technology would introduce a revolutionary change in the way transport aircraft wings and bodies are designed, which would result in dramatic reduction in costs for operators. Savings could then be passed on to the general public. The environmental aspect of better fuel economy for transport aircraft is also of increasing importance to both operators and the public. Wind turbine blades are also affected by skin-friction drag; efficiency of the whole wind-power system greatly depends on the aerodynamic efficiency of the blade: wind turbines are halted by the control system every time the efficiency falls below a certain threshold, because the overall economic viability of the turbine is very sensitive to changing wind conditions. The proposed system is well suited for utilization in wind turbine-blades to increase their efficiency, thus increasing clean energy production. Similarly, automotive designs could be improved to realize increased fuel efficiency by using the proposed technology.",Aerodynamics,Aerodynamic Efficiency Drag Reduction Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The method eliminates the use of traditional sample collection methods such as swabs, wipes, or other methods, which have been shown to back-contaminate spacecraft surfaces as well as collected samples. Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy with excitation in the deep UV below 250 nm enables separation of the spectral regions of both Raman and fluorescence emissions, enabling collection of Raman emissions without obscuration by fluorescence from chemicals of interest as well as many spacecraft materials and from trace organic contamination within field of view of the Raman detection optics.  This cannot be accomplished with excitation at longer wavelength including 263 nm or 266 nm from 4th harmonic Nd based lasers. Combining Raman and fluorescence methods in the deep UV enhances the ability to detect and identify the trace chemical or biological materials on these surfaces and have a proven ability to detect biological and other particles and materials on surfaces less than 1 pg, the mass of a single bacterial spore, with dimensions as small as 200 nm.  These methods were first developed under funding from NASA Planetary Protection, but were advanced by contracts with several Department of Defense organizations well as commercial developments with both Pfizer Pharmaceutical and DuPont for chemical and biological cleaning validation of their manufacturing equipment.","The instrumentation and methods proposed here have a broad range of potential applications for NASA as well as commercially.  For NASA, the effort proposed here has directly applicability to a wide range of trance chemical and biological surface contamination related to Planetary Protection and other sensitive surface contamination applications.  For Planetary Protection the application is  not only for non-contact cleaning validation of spacecraft surfaces but also of cleaning validation of facilities to build spacecraft and store samples such as sample caches, etc.  Other critical applications of this technology is for detection of contamination on optical and other surfaces where trace levels of chemical or biological materials cannot be tolerated.  This technology is also adaptable to detection of trace contaminants in liquids such as water or cleaning or processing solvents.","Typical non-NASA commercial applications of the technology being developed here would include chemical and biological surface contamination for the cleaning validation of manufacturing equipment used in the pharmaceutical, food, chemical, semiconductor industries as well a product quality testing for these industries.  Further applications apply to medical industries including hospital surgeries cleaning validation as well as environmental monitoring of water, air, soil, and a myriad of other applications where small spot sizes or photon-energy-specific excitation is needed or enabling.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Detectors (see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ultraviolet",Contamination Control and Planetary Protectionis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Further hindering the utilization of related information is the computational resources required to effectively store, access, and process the data. However, by utilizing the ever-increasing power of cloud computing, recent advances in computational fusion mechanisms, and emerging programming paradigms government agencies and the public at large can efficiently generate tools which utilize this data resulting in an increased return on investment.Geocent proposes the development of the Cloud-Based Open Data Environment and Flow-based Aggregation Science Tool (CODEFAST) a data processing framework and user-friendly platform, which will allow the efficient creation, customization, and processing of Decision Support Tools (DST) by different users in varied fields. The proposed architecture of CODEFAST is comprised of two main components: a Computational Fusion Platform (CFP) and a Flow-Based Programming Interface (FPI). By combining the capabilities of CODEFAST with the flexible and cost effective nature of commercial cloud-computing services the system can provide an easy to use mechanism for processing Earth science data in a high-performance computing environment.","CODEFAST is the logical evolution of data access for both discovery and analysis.  The advent of cost effective sensors and multiband remote sensing is delivering data at an unprecedented pace.  A second order effect of this advance is the multiple incompatible formats, storage methods, and access barriers that result when interoperability is an afterthought of the development as well as programs built for solving specific programs within a domain.  The use of CODEFAST opens new opportunities for analysis and research to add additional data sets that were once through to be isolated due to their formatting or the inability for the user side platform being able to access this information efficiently as well as the computing power that may not reside with the agency attempting the research.  The proposed solution has an immediate application to NASA Earth Sciences but this extends to other organizations and agencies that share a similar dilemma.","Similar situations exist beyond the geosciences that would find use with CODEFAST.  Several government agencies such as National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have needs for data modeling and analysis that combines several disparate data sets.  The true value of data is in its ability to integrate into analysis and study.  CODEFAST would provide this capability and support the extension of current practices and methods for storage, access, and computing.

These concepts have the benefit of saving the tower construction cost and the cost for otherwise staffing the towers with a full cadre of controllers. More recently, the threat of sequestration forced the FAA to announce closure of 149 airport towers; though the closure plan was rescinded, these concepts again appear as viable alternatives for providing control-tower services at reduced costs. Virtual Towers and Autonomous Airport Operations are in fact related concepts. On one hand, Virtual Towers depend on automation to allow a small crew of controllers to manage traffic at multiple airports, and the increase in automation moves the concept towards Autonomous Airport Operations as automation becomes more capable. On the other hand, Autonomous Airport Operations should have controllers available as a fall-back option in a Virtual Tower environment to ensure safety when abnormal conditions emerge. The proposed research seeks to develop practical concepts for Autonomous Airport Operations, and apply state-of-the-art automation technologies to enable such operations. The automation technologies include a computer-based ATC agent that can monitor and plan traffic movement, issue clearances, and communicate with the pilots over the radio using advanced speech processing technologies. In addition, low-cost surveillance systems based on machine vision will be explored to provide the necessary traffic information around the airport and on the airport surface.","Autonomous Airport Operations (AAO) has already been identified as a research topic of interest to the Safe Autonomous System Operations (SASO) Project of NASA's Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP).

Main St., Drexel, MO 64742 - 0068",(816) 619-3375  Extension :109,4,5,"Providing a reliable supply of safe drinking water is a critical requirement for space exploration. Systems that provide recycled, treated water aboard the International Space Station, & that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination.  Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid & reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need.Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminates.InnovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard the International Space Station. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 Liters of potable water into volumes as small as 200 μL – providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X.  It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by InnovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel Wet Foam Elution process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.","The Hydrosol Concentrator for microgravity (HC-ug) will be an important tool for improving potable water monitoring for microbial contamination on the International Space Station and other NASA spacecraft.  As is noted by Yamaguchi et al in a review of current research on microbial monitoring of crewed habitats in space and by Oubre in a comparison study of real-time PCR platforms, rapid environmental microbial monitoring will be required to enable continued success in long-duration space habitation. Per Table 5.2-4 of SSP 50260, International Space Station Medical Operations Requirements Documents, the US On-orbit Segment of the ISS requires analysis of 30 microbial samples in the first 90 days of a mission. After 90 days an additional two samples is required per month.  Further, as noted by Yamaguchi, manned missions to Mars, which may be realized within the next two decades, may further increase the need for rapid, reliable microbial monitoring technologies. Because speed of analysis, instrumentation size, and instrumentation and per sample costs are generally tied to sample size, and because required microbial detection limits for drinking water are extremely low, it is likely that concentration will always be a critical component of any detection method appropriate for this application. The proposed HC-ug system holds significant promise for filling this key component of the rapid microbial detection need for NASA for the foreseeable future.","In the proposed format, the Hydrosol Concentrator for microgravity (HC-ug) will have direct application to the microbial water monitoring needs of the International Space Station and all national and international space agencies and missions.  Further, because small sample sizes are generally a requirement of rapid microbial detection systems, and because required microbial detection limits for drinking water are extremely low, this need is not anticipated to decrease in the near future.  In addition to the needs of the space agency community, many components of the technology developed in the proposed project will also have application to earth-based microbial water monitoring applications.  The small, zero-power format of the HC-μg system will lend itself to development of fieldable concentration devices for applications such as DoD water monitoring needs in austere and remote environments, and to field sampling and analysis for outbreak investigations in remote locations and when sending samples to a laboratory is not acceptable.  Water monitoring in developing countries is an important need that could benefit greatly from low-cost, fieldable kits that allow for delivery of a concentrated sample to rapid detection kits.  InnovaPrep is already working to identify aligned opportunities within US DoD, the national and international drinking water and water utilities marketplace, world health applications, and recreational and environmental water applications.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Process Monitoring & Control",Environmental Monitoring for Spacecraft Cabins   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The prototype will be integrated in at least one NAS Parallel Benchmark. In Phase II we will focus our work on maturing and refining the technology, and will be driven by a concrete target of accelerating at least two memory-access-bound NASA applications.

In previous work for NASA and DoD, Ultramet demonstrated the fabrication of carbon fiber-reinforced refractory carbide matrix composites for missile and railgun projectile nosetip and aeroshell applications using a rapid, low-cost melt infiltration process. The composite materials underwent extensive high temperature testing under laser and arcjet heating conditions and exhibited low or no erosion when tested to nearly 2900?C. The composites also exhibited extremely high toughness and thermal shock resistance and have good potential for operation in adverse weather. Stability in rain, snow, and hail is a critical issue for hypersonic vehicles, and Ultramet composite materials have performed very well in hydrometeor and nylon bead impact tests conducted by NASA MSFC. In this project, Ultramet will advance the state of the art in melt infiltration processing by developing innovative process improvements to optimize the refractory carbide matrix, resulting in enhanced in-plane and through-thickness mechanical properties for operation over the temperature range from 1500 to 3000?C in the hypersonic vehicle environment. Melt infiltrated carbide matrix composites contain residual unreacted metal within the matrix which provides enhanced toughness but, if excessive, can lead to low elevated temperature mechanical properties. This work will further reduce and optimize the percentage of residual metal in the matrix to produce composites with an optimal balance of toughness/impact resistance and elevated temperature interlaminar and through-thickness mechanical properties.

LISA manipulators can provide many benefits to an operational AFF, by providing not only perching/anchoring and pulling/prodding, but also more complex manipulation tasks such as opening storage lockers, fetching items, and emplacing remote sensors, without the need for crew support.In addition to the ISS application, LISA-equipped AFFs may also be useful for crew-tended deep space facilities, enabling routine maintenance, repairs, and crew-preparations to be performed robotically while no crew is present.Lastly, a vacuum/space-compatible derivative of the LISA manipulators may be useful for external assistive free-flyers supporting and in some cases replacing EVAs for repairs, maintenance, and inspection outside NASA vehicles and facilities.","Three potential non-NASA applications for LISA manipulators are: (1) Commercial equivalents of the NASA-developed AFF, for crew assistance on future commercial space facilities, (2) Commercially-operated versions of the AFFs for providing commercial janatorial, maintenance, and support services onboard existing and future NASA facilities, and (3) for fixed-mounted arms for manipulation of experiments in enclosed facilities such as the ISS Microgravity Science Glovebox.",Actuators & Motors; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Composites; Deployment; Inventory Management/Warehousing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Teleoperation,Payload Technologies for Assistive Free-Flyers   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

NASA's stated aim is to use high power density/high efficiency PEBB devices to streamline design and introduce size, weight, cost and efficiency savings.  The formidable challenge is to design such PEBB devices that use materials that can function in Extreme Environment conditions. The proposed high power density/high efficiency PEBB solution employs ceramics, striction and wide bandgap semiconductor materials as to meet these Extreme Environment operation challenges.  The design eliminates transformer magnetics and opto-isolators (required for galvanic isolation) and will eliminate external circuits and components providing lower complexity, enhanced performance, and much higher SWaP specifications than currently available. The new design and novel materials now provide a whole new level of self-monitoring capability that includes voltage, current and temperature at the device die level enabling both robust prognostics and power reconfiguration.","Extreme Environment Power Electronic Building Block (EE-PEBB) devices are applicable to deep space applications such as orbiters, landers, Heliophysics and earth observation platforms.  QorTek's new integrated sensing EE-PEBB devices are also an ideal solution for NASA missions such as inter-planetary probes, outer planetary exploration and deep space probes for use potentially down to cryogenic temperatures, as well as high temperatures Venus Integrated Weather Sensor (VIWS) or high radiation environment Van Allen belts or Europa. The planned design incorporates packaging in a modular formfactor that lends itself to new and existing platforms with seamless integration.  The inherently radhard nature of the sensors and WBG switches introduces further advantages for such missions, as they will reduce risks associated with harsh space environment installations.  It would directly impact the ability to reduce the requirements for radioisotope heating units (RHUs) to maintain higher operating temperatures of the electronics and radiation shielding for the current technology.","Applications include ruggedized, high-temperature switching devices for electric vehicle (EV) applications and high temperature sustainable power electronics for down hole gas exploration. The EE-PEBB will be a smaller/less expensive solution than typical piecemeal power electronics circuits. All existing commercial applications would require external circuitry to condition both the input (gate drive) and output (sensor data) signals and in most cases isolate them. QorTek's system will include all of the necessary circuitry in one modular package. QorTek plans to utilize its ongoing relationship with CREE to further facilitate commercializing a high temperature variant of the proposed technology specifically for emerging Green technology applications.

Repeated recycling is the primary means of replenishing water aboard the ISS in order to minimize the need for costly re-supply of water. There is a critical need to continually monitor impurities in the water supply aboard the ISS in a manner that minimizes the sample volume. Existing technology can measure inorganic contaminants at concentrations established as safe in the Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines, but these methods are inappropriate for the ISS due to the required size and power of the equipment, the size of water sample required for testing, or some combination of these.  Spectral Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a novel water quality monitoring technology using x-ray fluorescence (XRF).  In the proposed method, a small volume of water is diverted into a sampling chamber for XRF analysis, which takes place over a period of several minutes.  XRF from the sample is detected by an energy-dispersive detector. The concentrations of contaminant elements in the sample are determined simultaneously from the fluorescence spectrum and compared to pre-determined threshold concentrations.  After analysis, the water sample is returned to the main plumbing, and a warning is issued if any contaminant is present above the threshold concentration.  This process would be entirely automated and require no crew interaction.  The instrument would use commercially available parts common in portable XRF analyzers.",The International Space Station (ISS) water monitor will be a unique instrument with design elements that pertain primarily to ISS requirements.  It will also serve as a prototype water quality monitoring system for future manned mission systems.  It will be especially important for any planned long-duration missions.  One prominent example would be a human mission to Mars.  The proposed automated in-line heavy metal water supply monitor will operate continuously without the need for extractive sampling.  The Phase I product consists of a laboratory-scale test unit and calibration curves for the analysis software.  This will serve as the foundation for the engineering work which will take place as part of a Phase II effort.,"This technology has potential non-NASA commercial applications for any instance in which a persistent automated analyzer for trace metals in water is required.  Its advantage over current technologies (such as mass spectroscopy) is the reduction in required manpower.   Potential applications include (1) screening soil and water in the neighborhood of landfills and industrial plants for toxicity, (2) the monitoring of industrial and nuclear facilities, (3) monitoring of hazardous waste transporters, (4) disaster management, and (5) damage assessment by first responders in the case of a spill or accident.  We also see potential non-NASA usage for the developing world.  Current environmental regulations are loose and as populations begin to demand clean water, instrumentation to monitor heavy metal content on-site without expensive, operator-intensive mass spectrometer equipment will be needed.  Two examples of heavy metal pollution within the water supply of developing nations are wastewater generated from recycling of circuit boards and industrial manufacturing of printed circuits.

This system will supplement currently used vision-based navigation and wheel odometers to improve navigation precision, location awareness, and platform orientation tracking for lunar and Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), planetary extravehicular activities (EVA), and manned rovers. The RANOTS will offer position accuracy better than 1 m with 95% probability per hour of fast (meters per second) motion without interacting with other positioning systems, and be compact (<10 cu. in.), lightweight (<8 oz), and consume <0.25 W of power. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the RANOTS by creating and testing a preliminary prototype, which will demonstrate technology readiness level (TRL)-4 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional prototype and demonstrate its operation on an autonomous vehicle on rough Earth terrain (TRL-6). The RANOTS development will offer NASA the capabilities to provide precise navigation and attitude tracking to support significantly faster moving platforms on lunar or Martian missions, thus enhancing the scientific output of these expensive enterprises.","The proposed RANOTS will directly contribute to the success of future NASA moon, Mars, and asteroid missions planned within several research programs, especially the NASA Mars Rover program. At the end of Phase II NASA will have a compact, completely autonomous, automatic navigation system that provides fast high-accuracy tracking and positioning of rovers, moving modules, and walking astronauts.

Advanced Space proposes to develop a robust navigation filter optimized for each of these highly dynamic environments. Further, the tool will be designed to be open-source and work with tools such as NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). The dynamic filter will implement state-of-the-art process noise strategies tuned for dynamic environments. These process noise strategies, combined with an extended Kalman filter, will permit the filter to operate on very long arcs without resets, to operate on unstable trajectories, and to operate on trajectories propagated in undetermined systems, such as in the vicinity of an uncharacterized asteroid. The filter will estimate unmodeled accelerations, tuned to be sensitive to the uncertainties present in each of these highly dynamic environments.","A purpose-built navigation tool for libration point orbits, low-thrust spacecraft operations, and proximity operations around small bodies is projected to have a significant impact on NASA missions. The primary goal of this work is to infuse this new navigation capability into existing and future NASA mission needs and projects. It is for this reason that the software developed through this work will be designed for use from mission design and analysis through spacecraft operations. Such extendibility requires specific design trades that will be made early in the proposed work to enable users to obtain information during the mission formulation stage and reliable navigation solutions during operations. In highly dynamic environments such as those the software will be optimized for, initial mission planning is significantly influenced by the subsequent capabilities of the operational navigation tools. Examples of this impact include scheduling tracking time on highly stressed tracking stations such as the Deep Space Network (DSN), identifying mission operations in terms of when maneuvers can and cannot occur, particularly for low-thrust missions, and how much time must be given between maneuvers for a navigation solutions to converge. Specific targeted applications include support for future missions to the lunar libration point orbits, any future mission using low-thrust maneuvering over long or very dynamic thrust-arcs, and missions exploring small bodies such as asteroids.","The highly dynamic navigation filter will be designed to support numerous non-NASA commercial customers. Many spacecraft operators are examining low-thrust methods to transfer from low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit (GEO). The filter designed here will support such activities over long periods of time, without restarting or reconfiguring. The filter will estimate more than just the satellite's position and velocity: it will also estimate the spacecraft's mass, maneuver execution parameters, unmodeled accelerations, and other parameters. The GEO market is very large; smaller markets include commercial entities exploring and mining the Moon and asteroids. Each customer in these markets requires navigation; robust, accurate, and reliable navigation is a significant benefit for their businesses.

This new approach is based on a new tool known as Flightstream.  Flightstream is a surface vorticity based solver which uses an unstructured surface geometry, and a correlation for skin friction which is based on the surface vorticity.  For lift and induced drag calculations, Fligthstream makes use of the Kutta Joukowski Theorem.  The Kutta Joukowski Theorem has proven to be a remarkably accurate method for calculating loads for essentially all lifting configurations in which the flow is attached to the surface.  Research in Flight has demonstrated many compelling capabilities of Flightstream to accurately predict the aerodynamic loads on a range of geometries including high lift configurations.  This fundamentally new approach to aircraft outer mold line evaluation offers the speed and fidelity required for even optimization based design.  The speed of Flightstream is comparable to traditional panel approaches yet the fidelity in calculating loads has been shown to be comparable to high fidelity CFD solutions.  To further compliment the utility of FLightstream as a compelling design tool, Flightstream has been configured to operate seamlessly with NASA's Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) software.  The primary function of the proposed activity will be to develop an automated approach to engine integration by coupling the compelling capabilities of Flightstream with optimization tools, rudimentary engine performance tools, and automated grid generation using VSP.  The goals for the optimization will be related to aerodynamic performance and will include lift to drag and moment calculations in consultation with the technical point of contact at NASA. A report on the progress during Phase I will outline the process and will include preliminary results.",Research in Flight has been working with NASA Langley to demonstrate the capability of Flightstream as a design tool for subsonic aircraft.  Fligthstream has been used to predict the high lift performance of the D8.5 geometry.  The clean configuration of this geometry was tested at NASA Langley in wind tunnels.  Both the clean configuration and the high lift configuration were analyzed by Research in Flight using Flightstream. This included the validation of Flightstream for similar geometries using the High Lift Prediction Workshop data for the DLR wind tunnel model.  The fidelity of the solution for this data set was remarkable and demonstrated the baseline applicability of Flightstream to complex subsonic aircraft configurations.  NASA Langley is now using Flightstream internally with confidence for geometries similar to the DLR including compressible flight regimes.  The proposed activity will substantially enhance NASA's ability to robustly analyze and design a range of subsonic aircraft outer mold lines to include engine integration directly in the design process.  This capability will substantially improve the speed and fidelity of the preliminary design process at NASA.,"The traditional approach to aircraft design involves the development of a concept, initial analysis of the concept using lower order tools which include for example vortex lattice or panel approaches for aerodynamics.  The fidelity of these tools is not always at a level which is sufficient to direct a trade study toward optimal configurations.  Nevertheless, the results of these lower order studies are generally used to direct geometry development and higher order solutions are developed using Euler codes and Navier Stokes solvers.  These higher fidelity solutions offer much more than just loads to the designer but often the higher fidelity solutions reveal inadequacies in the load calculations and some redesign work is initiated.  To streamline this process, a tool is needed which can provide high fidelity load calculations at the speed of the lower fidelity tools.  Flightstream offers this capability but does not yet have the capability to automatically optimize and engine integration into candidate designs.  This proposed activity would provide this capability, working seamlessly with NASA's Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP) to dramatically improve the efficiency of the commercial aircraft design process and offering, on average, better final designs.",Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation),Physics-Based Conceptual Aeronautics Design Tools   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The VORTEX Gimbal will be capable of providing performance characteristics that are unmatched in the current high-fidelity gimbal market at a SWAP (size, weight and power) that has yet to be developed. Included in these characteristics is the ability to slew and rotate continuously in any direction from any position without the need for failure-prone and costly slip rings. This feature will be highly beneficial for coaxial or other cabling that is needed to pass from the payload to the antenna via the gimbal. Due to the lack of slip rings, this mechanism will be significantly more reliable than traditional gimbal mechanisms. The VORTEX Gimbal also provides 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) by nature of its design. This means that in addition to hemispherical-plus pointing (greater than 2 pi steradians), the VORTEX Gimbal has the ability to stow compactly for launch in a much denser volume than its operational workspace.","The primary application for the Venus or Titan Exploratory (VORTEX) Gimbal will be for aerobot-based exploration missions on Venus and other planetary bodies.  The VORTEX Gimbal will provide a reliable, lightweight, autonomous mechanism for pointing high gain antennas used in telecommunications.  The VORTEX Gimbal mechanism will not be limited to this use case, however. This mechanism will be useful for any mission with instruments that require precision pointing and data throughput, such as sensors, imagers, solar arrays, and thrusters.","The proposed VORTEX Gimbal could enable precision pointing in numerous terrestrial applications. The mechanism will be designed for the caustic environment of Venus or Titan and will, therefore, be suitable for many other harsh environments on earth.

The thruster will be fabricated as a monolithic part that includes the injectors, combustion chamber, and nozzle. This thruster design will leverage a propulsion architecture especially amenable to additive manufacturing: ORBITEC's revolutionary Vortex Combustion Cold-Wall (VCCW) technology. Through additive manufacturing, Parabilis will reduce the cost, increase reliability, decrease complexity, and significantly reduce CAD-to-part design cycle time.Lox-methane is an attractive propellant combination for future NASA missions, however significant technical challenges remain.  This proposed innovation provides novel solutions to challenges for lox-methane rocket engines as requested by the H2.01 solicitation.  Specifically, this proposal includes innovations for RCS class thrusters, including advances in additive manufacturing, propellant injectors, and combustion chamber design. Additionally, the use of VCCW technology will likely mitigate adverse effects of multiphase or intermittent gas phase operation. Due to the low wall temperatures inherent to VCCW technology, the proposed thruster will provide almost no additional thermal loading to the main vehicle structure. The proposed thruster should obtain a vacuum specific impulse significantly in excess of 325 s for vacuum operation. Phase I development objectives include preliminary design of the thruster and cold flow testing of a thruster prototype that will be used to test the applicability of several additive manufacturing techniques.  By the end of Phase I testing the technology will be at a TRL 4 level.","The proposed thruster innovations are applicable to a number of proposed future NASA missions such as Mars exploration and sample return.  Future launch vehicles utilizing Lox/methane as their main propulsion system can utilize the proposed innovation as complementary reaction control system thrusters.  Additionally the technology can be scaled for use as a kick stage or orbital insertion engine.This proposed innovation meets NASA's 2014 Strategic Goal of enabling advances in manufacturing technologies for aerospace applications, by utilizing advanced additive manufacturing techniques.  Additionally NASA Strategic Objective 1.1, in-space propulsion is well aligned with this innovation.","Lox/methane is an attractive propellant combination for commercial launch vehicles.

HOT is useful for colloidal research, with the ability to precisely position collections of particles within colloids, and to use optically-trapped particles to measure linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties of fluids. Each HOT beam can be a traditional trapping beam, or can impart rotational angular momentum to particles via Bessel beam profiles. HOT systems are also used in biological research, for example in measuring the mobility and deformability of cells (a measure of cellular health, and an indicator of damage), and in rotating or sorting individual cells.All of these capabilities are possible using the same hardware, with beam configuration, power, and motion controlled entirely by software and voltage applied to a motionless solid-state device. Due to its built-in adaptive optics capability, a HOT system can also diagnose and correct for its own alignment errors. The ability to remotely add, upgrade, or repair capabilities via software alone makes holographic micromanipulation a core capability for ISS research.BNS proposes to develop a HOT module for the LMM, capitalizing on our previous experience in developing a commercially-available standalone HOT microscope, our current efforts toward developing a multibeam holographic photostimulation module for commercial microscopes, and on our widely-used, flight-tested spatial light modulators (SLMs).","A key strength of the HOT platform is that its capabilities can be greatly expanded through software, rather than hardware, upgrade, allowing a wide range of additional experiments to be designed and executed. The instructions sent to the HOT module are simple (x,y,z) trapping beam locations and types, making it straightforward for remote PIs to design new automated routines. For example, remote mixing of a colloidal sample could be initiated by using beams to stir the sample in a preprogrammed pseudorandom pattern. Other functionalities enabled by software alone include 3D imaging of colloids while trapping, automated particle detection and trapping, remote construction of microfluidic valves and pumps from assemblies of trapped particles, and cell elasticity/deformability measurements. In addition, the existence of a space-qualified liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) will enable the development of future SLM-based technologies. An SLM can be used in the imaging train of a microscope to enable simultaneous multifocal brightfield, darkfield, and phase contrast imaging. In addition, SLMs are used in the creation of advanced tractor beams, able to show particle manipulation over tens of cm, with potential applications in remote sampling. SLMs are also a low size, weight, and power solution for steering visible and infrared beams with no moving parts. The prior use of SLMs in the ISS should aid in the development of these and future space-based SLM technologies.","The software and hardware developed for the HOT module in the LMM will be directly usable in other microgravity colloidal experiments, enabled by the growing availability of commercial spaceflight. In addition, these advances will enable progress in colloidal research beyond microgravity. The LMM's underlying commercial Leica hardware will make the HOT module easily adapted for other Leica microscopes, expanding the availability of turnkey spatial light modulator (SLM)-based microscope modules.  Applications for SLMs in microscopy include optogenetics for neuroscience research, micromanipulation, 3D imaging, and aberration correction for imaging deep into tissue. To date, the primary users of SLM technology in microscopy have represented the cutting edge of research in new equipment development, using mostly home-built equipment inaccessible to the nonspecialist research community. A current major effort at BNS is to make SLM-based research equipment more robust and user friendly, broadening its availability and usefulness. The advances in software and hardware robustness involved in building a flight-capable platform will benefit these and future developments.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Characterization; Detectors (see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This system represents the state of the art in out of autoclave, additive manufacturing of advanced polymer matrix composite (PMC) structures. It is particularly suited for manufacture of large scale structures as there is no oven or autoclave requirement while being compatible with a wide variety of thermoplastic polymers. Now that the prototype system has been developed, additional testing is required before it will be ready for production-level manufacturing. This proposal seeks to optimize and validate the Laser AFP process while advancing to TRL 4. This will be accomplished through coupon level mechanical testing to support predictable performance, development of additively manufactured tooling concepts to enable rapid development of structures with complex geometries, and a manufacturing demonstration of this effort embodied in a structure analogous to a pressure vessel.","The potential for applications within NASA are endless.  Obvious applications include pressure vessels (including large cryotanks), composite crew modules, rocket motor casings, shrouds, satellite components (including zero CTE laminates), flywheel energy storage, and many others.  The ability to 3D print structures has caught the public's imagination and is currently in use on the international space station.  The ability to 3D print advanced thermoplastic composite structures opens up entirely new applications and opportunities. Additionally, the technology can be extended to other material systems including metal matrix composites (MMC) and ceramic matrix composites (CMC).  Additively manufactured tools can be automatically fiber placed with continuous fiber reinforced metals or ceramics.  Automated Dynamics and Fabrisonics have collaborated on aluminum matrix composites AFP.  This has applications for higher temperature applications and selective reinforcement aluminum structures.  Similarly, extremely high temperatures can be achieved with AFP ceramic precursors on 3D printed tools.  However, in this case, post processes are required to paralyze the ceramic precursor.  Applications include rocket motor components, heat shields, and thermal protection systems for hypersonic vehicles.","Thermoplastic AFP technology has made great strides in reducing cycle times as compared to thermosets, due to their ability to be consolidated Out of Autoclave (OOA). However, traditional hot gas torches do have some limitations with respect to speed; these limitations serve as a barrier to entry for a variety of applications and markets where higher volumes necessitate faster throughput.The laser consolidation technology in development at Automated Dynamics has thus far shown promise of at least three times the processing speed of traditional hot gas torch solutions. The addition of additively manufactured tooling will provide the capability to additively manufacture true 3D composite structures.  Full commercialization of this technology will allow us to effectively engage many markets where higher throughput needs are necessary. Examples include several applications in markets such as: Automotive, Electronics, Commercial Aviation, Energy, Medical, Chemical Processing, and General Industrial. Automated Dynamics currently manufactures a host of products in these industries such as plain bearings for pumps used in oil and gas exploration, tail rotor drive shafts for military helicopters, and cannulation tubes for medical applications. All of these products stand to realize significant manufacturing benefits from the improvements enabled by Laser AFP.","Characterization; Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Lasers (Cutting & Welding); Lasers (Machining/Materials Processing); Polymers; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Structures","Large-Scale Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) Structures, Materials, and Manufacturing Processes   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

When passed over a warm ruthenium catalyst bed, gaseous nitrous oxide and an ethylene-ethane gaseous blend combust instantly. A small 1 N thruster can be designed to provide small satellite propulsion systems with a specific impulse of approximately 300 seconds. Both propellants are self-pressurizing, capable of delivering feed line pressures in excess of 800 psi at room temperature, and 400 psi if cooled to 0?C. For longer duration missions, both nitrous oxide and an ethane-ethylene fuel blend do not require thermal heating to maintain a liquid state, and as such, can be stored on Earth or in space for in-definite periods of time with no parasitic power drain required to maintain a liquid propellant. Compared to other available chemical propulsion systems, a NEERHI system offers a cost effective solution as other hypergolic engines use hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which are toxic and dangerous to handle, increasing ground costs. As an added capability, the NEERHI engine has the ability to operate as a monopropellant engine if the ruthenium catalyst be is heated with a bipropellant reaction, increasing the lifetime of the catalyst bed and reducing heating loads on the engine.","A NEERHI system is capable of replacing any monopropellant or bipropellant space propulsion system currently used by NASA with a green propellant, self-pressurizing, cold-storable, hypergolic rocket system. The recent MAVEN mission, which uses a propulsion system based off of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, uses a total of 20 hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. A NEERHI system could be adapted to future missions to provide a greater specific impulse with a much lower ground cost due to the low toxicity of the propellants. Future lunar missions, which have historically used an NTO and MMH propellant engine, could use a NEERHI system to not only provide RCS thrust, but the nitrous oxide can also be used to produce a breathable atmosphere for any manned mission. The current technology roadmap for NASA also features a main propulsion unit for the micro-satellite, which could employ a NEERHI engine to provide delta-V maneuvers, station keeping, and even Earth-escape missions. Almost all satellite systems that don't have ion RCS systems could greatly benefit from the integration of a NEERHI unit to reduce the launch cost of the system.","A NEERHI system can be used on any commercial satellite system that requires a simple, hypergolic, RCS propulsion unit but wishes to avoid the difficulties encountered when working with a nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine system. The NEERHI can be used in the emerging cubesat industry, were the primary development teams are university students designing their first space system. A NEERHI engine would provide a safe and affordable system for universities that often have rigorous safety standards, and as such, avoid current hydrazine-based propulsion. In the new field of commercial crew development efforts, the SpaceX capsule currently uses the Draco rocket engine to provide attitude control. The Draco uses an MMH and NTO propellant combination. A NEERHI system could be built to replace these thrusters, and with a supply of Nitrous oxide onboard, future Dragon spacecraft could use the nitrous to produce breathing air instead of bringing along an additional system, taking up mass and space on the craft. A hypergolic and green propellant is the solution sought by all companies to phasing out the use of the dangerous hydrazine-based thrusters, and the NEERHI program could revolutionize the market.","Attitude Determination & Control; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine",Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Resulting aircraft designs such as blended-wing bodies with distributed propulsion can provide the large reductions in emissions, fuel burn, and noise required to make air transportation growth projections sustainable.  The power density requirements for these electric machines can only be achieved with superconductors, which in turn require lightweight, high-capacity cryocoolers.  Creare has previously developed a Cryoflight turbo-Brayton cryocooler concept that exceeds the mass and performance targets identified by NASA for superconducting aircraft with high-temperature superconducting (HTS) materials requiring cooling to 50 K.  Here, we propose to extend the temperature range of our cryocooler with an innovative new cycle concept to provide cooling to 15 K for MgB2 superconductors, which offer price and performance advantages for certain superconducting machines.  In Phase I of this project, we will evaluate the performance advantages of our concept through modeling and preliminary component designs.  In Phase II, we will fabricate and test the highest-risk components to bring the overall TRL to 4.  In Phase III, we will build and test a complete cryocooler to support extended performance testing with MgB2 systems.  This development effort will provide an enabling technology for the superconducting systems needed to make turboelectric aircraft feasible.","Our proposed cryocooler development effort will support NASA's long-term goal to increase aircraft efficiency and reduce aircraft emissions and noise.  By providing a cryocooler capable of cooling MgB2 systems and optimized to meet the aggressive power density target required for aircraft, we will enable an alternative approach to HTS systems and allow a detailed evaluation of the relative advantages of HTS and MgB2 superconducting technologies.  Such an evaluation is needed to clarify the road map for superconducting aircraft.  While such aircraft are still two or three decades from production, supporting technology development needs to begin now if such aircraft are to become a viable alternative to the aircraft configurations in production today.  The results of this SBIR project will support continuing NASA design trade studies, system demonstrations, and eventual superconducting aircraft demonstrations.  Other NASA applications include space applications such as hydrogen cryogenic liquefaction and storage for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, CEVs, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, in-space propellant depots, and extraterrestrial bases.  Terrestrial NASA applications include cooling for spaceport cryogen storage and transportation systems.  The highly reliable and space-proven turbo-Brayton cryocooler is ideal for these applications.","Superconducting materials have the potential to revolutionize the way we generate, transmit, and consume power.  Transformational initiatives that rely on superconducting technologies include power conditioning and power transmission systems, large-scale offshore wind turbines, high efficiency data centers, Navy ship systems, and turboelectric aircraft.

Companies are currently pursuing approaches based on either HTS or MgB2 superconducting materials.  The low-temperature cryocooler proposed here will support MgB2 systems, which offer a number of advantages over HTS systems including lower cost and reduced losses in varying magnetic fields.  The 15 K operating temperature of these systems makes the cryocooler a critical component of any solution.

Launch Vehicle – Load Responsive MLI (LV-LRMLI) should provide unique properties, including ability to withstand direct exposure to aerodynamic free stream during ascent, high performance in-Mars atmosphere and very high performance in-space/on-orbit.A novel system integrating durable Launch Vehicle outer layers (for high performance on-orbit) with Load Responsive inner layers (for high performance in-Earth atmosphere and on-Mars), could withstand launch profiles and achieve both 0.5 W/m2 on-orbit and 5 W/m2 on-Mars surface performance goals.  LV-LRMLI Phase I would review aerodynamic and aerothermal data and determine requirements. Structural/thermal modeling and analysis of LV-LRMLI will be done. Test fixtures will be designed and built that simulate launch loads. LV-LRMLI prototypes will be fabricated and tested with simulated aerodynamic loads and heat flux measured.  This Phase I program would model, design, build and test a prototype LV-LRMLI system, validating aerodynamic durability and high thermal performance both on-orbit and in-Mars atmosphere, and demonstrating feasibility.","NASA has a high priority need for a lightweight, multifunctional cryogenic insulation system (including attachment methods) that can survive exposure to the free stream during the launch/ascent environment in addition to high performance less than 0.5 W/m2 on orbit or <5 W/m2 on Mars surface (with a warm boundary of 220 K).Improved cryogenic insulation for launch vehicles, that can withstand direct exposure to the free stream during launch ascent, and can provide higher thermal performance to reduce boiloff losses of cryogenic propellants, is both an immediate need for current launch vehicles (e.g., Atlas and Delta) as well as a future need for new launch vehicles (Space Launch System) and cryogen storage for In Situ Resource Utilization derived cryogens produced on Mars.The novel Launch Vehicle – Load Responsive MLI (LV-LRMLI) insulation system proposed here might offer durability to the free stream, SOFI replacement, high thermal performance in-air prelaunch, high performance in-Mars atmosphere, and very high thermal performance in-space/on-orbit.LV-LRMLI could help meet cryogenic fluid management goals, reducing propellant boiloff and enhancing the capabilities of current space transportation systems as well as future systems (LH2 storage for SLS for chemical propulsion for future Nuclear Thermal Propulsion vehicles), and insulation for future ISRU derived fuel storage.","Ball Aerospace & Quest are discussing with Boeing & ULA application of advanced insulation on their launch vehicles, including using Cellular Load Responsive MLI or Vacuum Cellular MLI for SLS. ULA is interested in development of LVMLI for use on the Delta cryogenic second stage, a reduction in LH2 boil off in half is needed for certain missions.  LVMLI needs technology maturation before implementation and integration into ULA platforms.Boeing, Ball and Quest are discussing using Load Responsive MLI to insulate Boeing's Phantom Eye LH2 fueled vehicle, and to insulate LNG fuel tanks for aircraft.LV-LRMLI could significantly improve upper stage insulation, reducing cryopropellant boiloff losses and increasing payload capacity for commercial missions with long coast times.  A high performance insulation to replace SOFI would be of interest to Prime contractors, enabling improved performance for Atlas Centaur, Delta and SLS cryogenic upper stages.Advanced insulation technology for space cryogenic applications has relevance to terrestrial commercial/industrial applications.  Reducing thermal conductivity and heat leak could have significant impact on commercial and home appliances, dramatically reducing energy use for high energy efficiency. One early focus market is refrigerator-freezers, where Quest Superinsulation could provide novel design concepts such as thin walls allowing a fresh design and look; increased interior space; and much lower energy usage.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fuels/Propellants; Passive Systems; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Space Transportation & Safety; Structures,Cryogenic Fluid Management for In-Space Transportation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Here, each phase would be imaged and measured independently for accurate assessment of phase boundaries, phase velocity, and phase hold-up or distribution. This innovation is based on exploiting the dependence of electric properties of several materials on excitation frequency at which electrical capacitance is measured. Dielectric and conductivity values of liquids often undergo changes as the excitation frequency used in acquiring capacitance values is changed. For example, previous studies quantified the change in dielectric constant and dielectric loss of aqueous liquids, including de-ionized water, under different frequencies. Their findings show that such liquids often undergo significant changes in electrical properties with varying excitation frequencies. Typically, ECVT sensors are excited at frequencies in that range of tens of Khz to tens of Mh. At those frequency ranges, the electric properties of materials, especially those that contain water in multi-phase flow mixture, undergo significant changes.","The first potential targeted application of this proposal is its transition to NASA applications that already apply ECVT for imaging multi-phase flows, and are actively seeking increased resolution and capabilities with respect to the current state of the art. Particularly, the Packed Bed Reactor Experiment (PBRE) project and the Two Phase Separator Experiment (TPSE) project will be the first immediate applications. Both of those applications involve requiring advanced flow visualization techniques that can be used in the International Space Station. They both have also used ECVT technology in ground testing's. Moreover, ECVT technology can be extended to other potential applications in combustion or life science. ECVT exhibits favorable features of low power consumption, light weight, high imaging speed, and safety. Once the proposed innovation is developed, it will be feasible to extend the developed sensing method to new frontiers. This is possible due also to the flexible and non-invasive nature of capacitance senors.","The multi-phase decomposition system for multi-phase flow reactors can be applied to energy systems that rely on 3-phase interactions. Specifically, the Oil industry relies heavily on 3-phase reactors and is actively seeking advanced instrumentation that can address this application. The competitive advantage of our product is that it will help control advanced refineries and biofuel reactors by providing real-time readings of gas, liquid, and solid circulation rates based on detecting 3-phase concentrations and their velocities in obscure and hard to reach locations of the reactor. This will help reactor operators optimize operations for higher efficiencies and better control of emissions. Our competitive advantage is achieved by implementing novel multi-phase separation technique that enables addressing each phase in the flow system individually using ECVT sensors, for the first time.Our cold flow ECVT has been adopted globally. The system is currently operating in Australia, India, and Japan. We anticipate multi-phase decomposition system to have more potential in terms of global sales. Phase decomposition based on ECVT provides an industrial instrumentation that can be deployed in the field, not just in laboratories.","3D Imaging; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Image Processing; Intelligence; Medical; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Process Monitoring & Control",International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Traditional ultracapacitors exhibit limited operating temperature ranges due to use of high melting point and volatile electrolytes, and activated carbon electrodes. During Phase I, we will demonstrate a new low melting point ionic liquid based electrolyte and engineered CNT electrodes for high power and energy density retention at temperature extremes. The proposed ultracap will enable significant improvements in spacecraft avionics, launch vehicles, rovers and landers – reducing weight, volume and complexity while improving performance and relaxing design constraints on traditional battery technologies. At the end of Phase II, this device will deliver a high peak power density of (10kW/kg and 14kW/L) and an energy density of (8Wh/kg and 11Wh/L) over this broad temperature range. The prototype will have a cycle life of 1,000,000 cycles at room temperature and below, and more than 100,000 cycles at 80°C. Further, the device will be engineered to withstand high shock (up to a 1000Gpeak) and vibration (up to 60 Grms) conditions. In applications where long-lived energy storage devices are critical, dramatic reductions in total weight and volume can be achieved by pairing batteries with the proposed ultracap technology.","FastCAP has identified a variety of applications where the proposed technology will have a significant impact in energy storage weight/volume reduction, complexity reduction and life extension. They include: Energy Storage for deep space exploration missions with extreme wide temperature requirements (i.e. Titan Missions, Comet-Asteroids Missions, Mars Missions, Lunar Quest Missions), Electric Propulsion Systems; GPS/Guidance; Deep Space Transponders and Radars; Satellites; Cube-Sats; Payload Operations; Exploration Vehicles (landers, rovers); Pyro Initiators for the stage separation of the rockets; Flight Termination Systems (FTS); Emergency Detection Systems (EDS); Peak Power harvesters from power sources such as PVs.In addition, there are specific applications suggested by FastCAP's aerospace industry partners for the proposed technology: Power optimization for Launch Vehicle (LV) applications for pyro initiators; Hydraulics power augmentation for the Next Generation Launch System (NGLS) program; Power optimization for Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF) system for the Common Upper Stage program; Power optimization for Lite and Heavy Electric Propulsion Upper Stages utilizing Hall Effect Thrusters to enable heavy USG spacecraft to GSO and NASA Interplanetary Missions.","A new generation of low temperature ultracaps would enable a variety of developments and advances in the realm of renewable energy production. For example, ultracaps are widely regarded as an ideal component to be used to feather the blades of large-scale wind turbines in high wind conditions, but currently available ultracaps are not able to perform effectively in high altitude and other extreme cold locations (Arctic, Antarctic). Similarly, an ultracap capable of extreme low temperature performance could enable significant performance improvements in other exploratory and energy production technologies, including cold water tidal and wave energy production operations, and deep sea drilling operations.

Our ""CloudTurbine"" innovation eliminates the distinction between files and streams to distribute live streaming sensor and video data over cloud file sharing services.  Streaming and static data have long been considered separately, with unique mechanisms for data transmittal and viewing of each.  Files are the greatest common denominator linking static data across all computers.  However, real-time streaming data distribution is widely presumed to be sensor-centric; i.e. up-front requirements to ""keep up"" with live data trump all other considerations.  A great unification of cloud based services for static data has recently occurred.  There are now many providers of ""file sharing"" cloud based services. The paradigm for all is simple:  (1) put data in a local file folder, (2) it automatically shows up at other linked systems via a cloud service.  Wouldn't it be nice if one could unify an approach to streaming data that leveraged this file-sharing cloud infrastructure?  That is precisely what we propose. Building upon a functional prototype, we propose to characterize, evaluate, refine and adapt CloudTurbine technology to NASA and commercial applications.  CloudTurbine is a streaming data interface to and from standard file sharing cloud services. It delegates much of the data transmittal, security, and server resources to the cloud service provider.  It provides robust continuous streaming for high data and frame rates while trading off manageable amounts of delivery latency (on the order of seconds). In so doing, it eliminates the distinction between files and streams, and enables a simple, cost effective new paradigm for streaming data middleware.","CloudTurbine significantly enhances the NASA ""Virtual Presence"" technology for flight research, wind tunnel testing, and other forms of collaborative data monitoring. It provides secure video distribution using existing cloud and web infrastructure.  It brings the power and advantages of modern cloud computing to streaming data for flight operations. It is synergistic and compatible with both DataTurbine and WebScan systems, and leverages the investment and utility of these legacy technologies.","Potential non-NASA applications include scientific sensor applications such as environmental and Earth observation systems, a DataTurbine compatible enhancement for scientific researchers at http://dataturbine.org, smartphone photo/video sharing, and a new paradigm for streaming data content delivery networks.

Based on the results of that project, Ultramet received a Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) award from the Air Force to further develop the technology into a flightweight system, including qualification testing of a 22-N AF-M315E thruster by Moog-ISP to bring the technology to TRL 8. Leveraging the previous and ongoing Air Force work, the proposed NASA project will scale the igniter and thruster technology to enable sizing of propulsive capability to a level appropriate for secondary payload satellites, i.e., 1-N and 5-N green monopropellant engines. In Phase I, Ultramet will design and fabricate a 5-N AF-M315E thruster and igniter and hot-fire test it at Pennsylvania State University. Phase II will further miniaturize the thruster and igniter to the 1-N level and bring the technology to TRL 8. Potential Phase II teaming partners include propulsion system integrator Moog-ISP, satellite integrator Ball Aerospace, and Aerospace Corporation for technical oversight.","The proposed technology will eliminate the catalyst degradation and washout issues plaguing AF-M315E catalysts, make hydrazine systems more robust, and/or simplify ignition/restart of non-hypergolic propellants. Potential applications will be numerous as it will enable use of advanced monopropellants that offer performance beyond that of monopropellant hydrazine and bipropellant NTO/MMH. The ignition system can be used in attitude control and apogee engines on NASA spacecraft. Potential NASA applications for the foam igniter system include orbit transfer, maneuvering, station keeping, and attitude control for satellites. Any satellite employing hydrazine propulsion will benefit. Promising near-term applications are attitude control systems for planetary spacecraft. The thermal igniter can be used with any monopropellant including hydrazine, thereby removing concerns over catalyst life and inability for cold starts. The technology can be used in virtually any NASA flight mission because the igniters can be used with hydrazine or higher performance advanced monopropellants (e.g. ADN and AF-M315). Using AF-M315 monopropellant can increase specific impulse relative to hydrazine and deliver higher performance, reduce cost, and increase flexibility beyond that of NTO/MMH.","The proposed ignition system can be used in attitude control and apogee engines for commercial and government satellites and divert and attitude control system engines for kinetic kill vehicles. The use of toxic propellants such as hydrazine will be eliminated in gas generators on military aircraft and fuel pressurization systems for tactical missiles. Because such a fast ramp rate and high ultimate temperature can be achieved, it may also be applicable to use in divert and attitude control systems for kinetic kill vehicles and other missile defense systems.

As an example, three of the primary instruments aboard the NPOES/Suomi NPP mission require high precision motor controllers for cross-track observations (ATMS, VIIRS, and CrIS).  These instruments will fly again on JPSS-1 and JPSS-2, and the latter will also add RBI, which itself also incorporates high precision scanning action.  In all of these cases instruments of these types are heavy, expensive, and complex, and all such missions would benefit from mass and volume reductions in their electronics architecture – both directly from the SiP motor controller as proposed, but also from the development of SiP electronics modules in general.","A large number of flight opportunities presently exist for nongovernmental actors to access space – many of these programs and launches are also sponsored by NASA.  However these programs are frequently lower cost opportunities that make use of shared or surplus capacity on launch vehicles and satellites.  This means that CubeSat and small-sat style launches are often extremely mass and volume constrained and motor controllers such as Honeybee's standard products are orders of magnitudes too large.  Miniaturized electronics using SiP technology could be a game changer for these types of programs, as hardware that presently cannot be flown at all due to excessive mass or volume becomes feasible.In addition several high profile commercial space ventures have mentioned planned constellations using very large numbers of satellites in constellation format (e.g. Google, Skybox, WorldVu, and recently SpaceX).  Again, such programs by definition take advantage of shared launches to reduce launch costs, and so any technology that can reduce launch mass and volume may translate to enormous reductions in program cost and viability.

One of the critical needs for these systems is a gravity-insensitive condenser to collect water in a high-temperature gas stream from these systems, as requested by Topic H03.3. To this end, Creare proposes to develop a gravity-insensitive, high-temperature condenser. The condenser has capillary structures to cool the gas stream, separate the condensate, and drain the liquid water.  The condenser has design features to ensure its operation is insensitive to gravity. The entire condenser is constructed from metals that have excellent resistance to chemical attack from contaminants and biofilm growth, and are suitable for operating at high temperature.  The capillary structures in the condenser are removable and can be regenerated during scheduled maintenance if it becomes necessary.

Rapid or snap freezing eliminates the artifact caused by ice crystal formation within the tissues.  Ice crystal nucleation and growth occurs between 0 degrees C and -20 degrees C typically.  To avoid this damage and minimize destruction of proteins, RNA and DNA by lytic enzymes, cells or tissues have to be rapidly cooled through this temperature band.  This is typically done in an isopentane bath cooled by liquid nitrogen (LN2) to -150 degrees C.  This 2 step process eliminates artifacts caused by ice nucleation as well as artifacts caused by nitrogen bubbles that surround the tissue as it boils if submerged directly into LN2.  While these open methods are acceptable for terrestrial laboratories, they would not be compatible with experimentation on the International Space Station.  Our proposed argon based Snap Freezer clamp would provide an alternative means to rapid cool through ice crystal nucleation and growth temperatures without exposing the crew to the spill hazards of LN2 and chilled isopentane as well as the extreme flammability of isopentane.","Techshot has a more than 25-year-history of developing and integrating spaceflight hardware, and it serves as an official Implementation Partner to NASA and CASIS. The company's success with microgravity facilities such as the Avian Development Facility, the Advanced Space Experiment Processor and the Bone Densitometer position it as a leader in offering these unique services. When coupled with the innovative capabilities of other research devices aboard the ISS, the Snap Freezer will give NASA an even greater ability to serve the investigator community it supports.  Furthermore, with the ability of commercial launch vehicles to get more experiment samples into orbit, the economics of transporting and processing materials in microgravity should become far more compelling. Eventually, given sufficient economical commercial launch vehicle transporting capacity, when coupled with Techshot's cadre of space processing equipment, the Snap Freezer could become an important tool for processing larger quantities of high-value materials for NASA customers aboard ISS.","Our product is expected to be of particular interest to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, academic researchers and terrestrial national laboratories, and Techshot is committed to investing in its commercialization.  Beginning with this Phase I award, the company will build a technology demonstrator with internal funds.  While typical laboratories snap freeze tissues by plunging specimens into liquid nitrogen or an isopentane bath chilled by liquid nitrogen, this may not be compatible with all experimental protocols or facility safety standards, which will provide commercial opportunities.  Much like the safety concerns on the ISS, significant burn hazards exist from liquid nitrogen spills and isopentane is an extremely flammable liquid.  When these conditions exist in terrestrial labs, researchers use cold blocks to freeze samples.  But even actively-cooled plates in cryostats do not typically reach temperatures sufficient for effective snap freezing.  This may not freeze sensitive or thick tissues at a fast enough rate to preserve the most sensitive DNA, RNA, proteins and crystal structures.",Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Contact/Mechanical; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Heat Exchange; Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Thermal,International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Yet there are many sources aboard the spacecraft known to generate particles in this ultrafine size range. Our technology provides a means to make this measurement in a compact, low power, unit that may be made suitable for spacecraft. With a newly developed, self-sustaining water-based condensation particle technology, particles from the nanometer to micrometer size range are enlarged through water condensation and counted optically. Yet, unlike other condensation-based counters, our unit recovers all of the evaporated water within the wick itself.  It needs no water reservoirs, and can be operated in any orientation. All water transport is by capillary action, and gravity is not needed. Coupled with a size selection device it can provide data on mean particle size. Measurable concentrations are from 1 to 1 million particles per cubic centimeter. We aim to adapt our existing technology to the long-term, zero-gravity, robust monitoring needed by NASA. Specific objectives are to verify a prototype self-sustaining condensation particle counting system that can be operated in any orientation; that can detect and count individual particles from 10 to 2000 nm; that contains the controls and on-board diagnostics to ensure long-term performance; and whose critical components are compatible with an ultimate package weighing less than 2 kg, and requiring less than 4 watts of power.","NASA will use this instrument to monitor airborne particle environmental in manned spacecraft.

DSSP's GEM propellant is currently being developed as a chemical propellant whose density specific impulse is superior to any currently available monopropellant and is competitive with many state of the art bipropellants while remaining space-storable, has low toxicity and low sensitivity, and needs no bulky catalyst bed or long preheating to function. DSSP's solid propellant formulations have also demonstrated the ability to fire thrusters at up to 1,000 seconds of specific impulse when used as an electric propellant- the thrust versus specific impulse balance is determined by the amount and 'shape' of the electric power applied. DSSP intends to develop a PPT that can be commanded to fire at high specific impulse depending on mission requirements which is fed by plumbing and a fuel tank to enable more ambitious and more efficient missions for future satellites.","In addition to 1U-3U satellites, mostly used for earth observation missions and technology demonstrations, there is particular interest by NASA and private sources to use larger CubeSat configurations (12U) for low cost planetary exploration, starting with the moon.

The single-stage monopropellant system offers the substantial advantage of simplicity, while providing operational flexibility. The projected result offers low cost at high reliability. Our proposed concept employs a gelled hydrazine monopropellant which provides low temperature capability (-54 ?C/ 65 ?F demonstrated), thus reducing the thermal conditioning demand on the Entry Descent Lander (EDL). Precision pointing at the time of launch is not required due to the relatively low, under 10g's, initial acceleration and high control gain provided by the articulated plug nozzle, enabling the use of a single degree-of-freedom EDL launch platform.  This proposal combines the strength of a previous proposal submitted to NASA's Planetary Sciences Division, in May of 2010, with the particular expertise of Microcosm Inc. in space mission design as well as its advanced all-composite pressurized structures technology for significant vehicle performance/weight reduction enhancements. The MAV concept and its CONOPS are built on experience by Aerojet, Raytheon and Avaliant and employ a single stage mono propellant design. The proposal takes advantage of the vast experience of the team members from programs such as VIKING, Sidewinder, and AMRAAM, missile guidance algorithm design, communications and health monitoring systems engineering.

The two main types of regions that are found in a typical hypersonic flow field around a vehicle are addressed by developing separate diagnostics for each. In regions far from the body where the flow is mostly non-dissociated, femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging (FLEET) is proposed for velocity combined with planar Rayleigh scattering to measure temperature via the imaging of an acoustic wave triggered by the FLEET pulse. In the highly dissociated region near the stagnation point of the reentry body, either backward air lasing or radar REMPI will be applied to spectrally resolve a transition of atomic oxygen. The latter two techniques use the same two-photon excitation scheme, but backward air lasing relies on a population inversion induced in the measurement volume, and radar REMPI relies on the microwave interrogation of an induced plasma. The goal of the Phase I study will be to determine which of these two techniques provides the best signal-to-noise ratios in the dissociated regions, and to establish the performance of the combined FLEET/Rayleigh scattering method in the non-dissociated regions.","The diagnostics using the proposed techniques would be a welcome addition to aid ground tests at NASA arc jet facilities, hypersonic wind tunnels, and shock tunnels. Non-intrusive measurements of velocity and temperature are required for validating computational fluid dynamic modeling and simulation codes that incorporate real-gas kinetic and transport models that are used to predict aerothermodynamics associated with planetary reentry flights. The diagnostics can be used as tools in experiments that focus on the understanding of high temperature gas physics and chemistry. Also, simultaneous acquisition of velocity and temperature is needed in understanding dissociating flow environment such as those occurring in hypersonic inlets, scramjets, and over heat shields and other thermal protection systems.","The unique capability to measure temperature and velocity in high enthalpy flows will be attractive to the private space industry, including companies developing space launch systems for low Earth orbit and planetary exploration.

The instrument will be based on a recently introduced room temperature interband cascade laser (ICL) operating in the 4830 nm region.  This laser has a substantially reduced (by a factor of approximately 12) power requirement than quantum cascade lasers operating in the same region and should be better-suited for use in atmospheric field instruments.  The Phase I effort will concentrate on characterizing the sensitivity and precision that can be achieved for OCS measurement, using this laser in a laboratory prototype.  The Phase I work will also include direct measurement of ambient carbonyl sulfide in the local outside air.  The follow-on Phase II project will emphasize development of an airborne-worthy prototype instrument that can be field tested.Carbonyl sulfide is the most abundant naturally occurring sulfur species in the atmosphere, with previous measurements of its concentration yielding results in the range of 500 parts-per-trillion (ppt).  The lifetime of OCS in the troposphere is believed to be several years, allowing its transport into the lower stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to sulfate particles.  Improved understanding of the tropospheric – stratospheric exchange of this important species is needed to gain a better understanding of the role of OCS in sulfate particle production.  In turn, the sulfate aerosol layer may significantly influence the earth's energy budget through increased solar scattering.Existing instrumentation for measurement of OCS is bulky and expensive and is complicated by several indirect steps.  In contrast, this R&D effort will result in an instrument that measures OCS directly, in real time, with 1-second time response or better.","Phase I and Phase II will result in an instrument for measurement of carbonyl sulfide that could be used by NASA to measure this important sulfur species from airborne platforms or in ground-based studies.  The instrument platform could be adapted for measurement of other atmospheric species (including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon gases, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other sulfur species).","This type of instrumentation is of interest to other government agencies involved in atmospheric research, including NOAA, the Department of Energy, and NSF-supported institutions such as NCAR.  The instrumentation, if adapted for measurement of pollutant gases, could be of interest to EPA and industrial customers concerned with pollutant monitoring and control.  Southwest Sciences intends to manufacture and sell instrumentation based on the project technology to NASA, other government agencies, and the general atmospheric research and evironmental monitoring communities.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",Airborne Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This system can be used on Mars, the Moon, as well as Asteroids (a Spider concept with self- anchoring approach was developed).We propose to focus this Phase I on the two approaches of water extraction: Sniffer and Corer. At the end of the Phase 1, we will trade all 3: Sniffer, Corer, MISME and select one for further development in Phase 2.After the Sniffer and the Corer tests, a trade study will be conducted to compare Sniffer vs Corer vs MISME approaches. The trade study will include figure of merits (e.g. extraction efficiency etc), potential for scaling production up, easy of deploying on more than one planetary body, as well as mission implementation challenges and risks. During this time we will also work closely with our COTR to determine mission preferences. The end result will be selection of the best approach.During this trade study we will also consider different properties of planetary regoliths as well as environmental conditions that would affect excavation and processing (e.g. poorly sorted particle size distribution and agglutinates on the Moon which make regolith very cohesive, perchlorates and clays on Mars which make soil very sticky etc).","NASA applications would satisfy goals of HEOMD and SMD. In particular, Planetary Volatiles Extractor could be initially used as a reconnaissance tool to map and characterize volatiles distribution around the area before deploying ISRU plant. Depending on the required water (or other volatiles) production per day, the PVEx could be used to extract water to support human habitats or for LOX/LH2 propulsion system to enable return of humans or samples back to Earth or a journey to outer reaches of Space. Because of the system flexibility, the PVEx could be deployed on any extraterrestrial body that contains volatiles or hydrated minerals: Mars, the Moon, Europa, Enceladus, Asteroids, Comets, Phobos and Deimos. For example if the system were to be deployed on the Moon or Near Earth Objects, the water produced by the system could be returned to ISS.","The system could be used by several commercial companies that are interested in In Situ Resource Utilization for financial gain. These include Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries targeting Asteroids and Shackleton Energy Corp, targeting the Moon. Brining water from the Moon or NEOs could be very profitable given that launching water from space costs ~$20,000/liter. The major market for water could be human consumption (e.g. once Bigelow Space Hotels are established) or refueling of existing satellites. The latter is of particular interest, since satellites come to the end of their life not because of electronics, or power, but because there are running out of fuel for station keeping. NASA and industry have been developing in space refueling technology, the first step in enabling refueling of satellites in space.

This is a low cost, autonomous, high reliability and long-life solution. This technology can operate at high temperatures up to 1,000 K to either provide heat transport for reactor cooling or to dramatically increase thermal conductivity to provide the waste heat transfer for heat rejection systems. This innovative technology is based upon Peregrine's proprietary technology in pulsating heat pipes. Pulsating heat pipes are autonomous thermal transport systems that operate by pulsating action initiated by the introduction of heat and the extraction of heat to make a self-contained thermal transport device. This innovation will enable NASA missions to be more successful, more durable and of higher reliability, while also being very cost effective, lightweight and highly efficient.This innovation relies upon pulsating heat pipe technology where serpentine micro-channels are embedded within the plane of a sheet or plate of material.  The micro-channels are partially charged with a working fluid. When heat is introduced to the PHP solid state device, vapor pressure locally increases (due to the serpentine pattern resistance) and vapor bubbles are created until the local increased pressure pulses from this high pressure area. At another area on this PHP device is the condenser (for thermal dissipation). In this area, heat is removed and vapor pressure is reduced, shrinking or contracting the bubbles. The pulsing from the evaporator and the contraction at the condenser, along with the system perturbations due to fluid contact angles and resistance within the serpentine channels, produces an autonomous, self-contained two-phase cooling system, in essence, the transfer of heat due to pressure changes.","The development and characterization of Pulsating Heat Pipes to cool high thermal loads for Space Nuclear Power Systems will have an impact on many fields. This technology will not only provide higher thermal performance but does it with equal to or less mass of the current state of the art and can readily be substituted into existing designs. Potential uses, first and most obvious are for the application currently under consideration for space nuclear power systems.   In addition, this technology should be adaptable to many other NASA applications like; Cooling of High Heat Flux Electronics, Advanced Spacecraft Radiators and Thermal Control of Instruments that require tight temperature control.","Currently all satellites/spacecraft have thermal control issues and will benefit from this pulsating heat pipe technology, since any material that is embedded with these devices will result in a substantial increase in thermal conductivity (>>1000 W/mK).

For example, UAS platforms such as the ScanEagle or the Sierra require at least one operator to handle the routing / navigation tasks for the aircraft and another operator to handle and operate the mission-specific payload. In this setting, the UAS platforms actually become a force-divider instead of a force-multiplier. The requirement of multiple operators for each individual UAS platforms is problematic for commercial applications where the high cost of human operators would inhibit many key applications such as package delivery from becoming financially viable. To address these issues, Opto-Knowledge Systems Inc (OKSI) and Analytical Graphics Inc (AGI) are joining forces to design, demonstrate, and deliver a robust multiple Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) semi-autonomous command and control tool that will enable a single human operator to manage multiple UAS platforms concurrently. Though there has been significant research into the single-operator multiple UAS control paradigm, there are currently no existing commercially available tools for this application. This work is aimed at shoring up this gap by creating the Single-Operator Multiple Autonomous Vehicle (SOMAV) command and control tool that will be integrated with AGI's Systems Tool Kit (STK) software and sold commercially at the end of the Phase-II program.","NAS Integration and Air Traffic Control (NASA NextGen Program):  For the past decade, NASA has been working to develop NextGen Air Traffic Control (ATC) Management capabilities that will provide increased efficiency and throughput of the National Air Space (NAS) to meet growing system demands. The SOMAV STK module for multiple-UAS command and control directly promotes these efforts in several ways. First, it provides a high-fidelity simulation environment for testing potential ATC routing algorithms, particularly those for systems of UAS platforms. Second, our tool reduces human operator workload by pushing much of the low-level control onto the UAV platforms themselves and having the routing/coordination performed autonomously. Reducing operator burden is listed as a specific goal of within Topic A2.02 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology of this SBIR effort. Third, our UAS routing and coordination tool will automatically optimize separation assurance for the UAS platforms in each team, which relates to the goal of safely and seamlessly integrating UAS platforms into NextGen. Fourth, the proposed module directly promotes autonomous operation for systems of UAS platforms using machine intelligence for decision-making. Finally, the UAS coordination tool addresses NASA's goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous navigation under uncertain conditions (e.g., collision/hazard avoidance) and cooperative task completion.","UAS Communication Networks): Recent advancements (e.g., Aerial Communications Node platforms) have resulted in UAS-based aerial communications platforms that are able to provide up to 10 times more coverage than traditional ground-based communications towers, and that are able to dynamically move to address changing customer needs. There has recently been a great deal of talk about bringing these capabilities to the civilian communications sector. This forms a complex UAS route coordination problem: Given a set of UAS platforms and a dynamic set of customers that have changing bandwidth requirements and move throughout the environment (e.g., traveling from work to home, or 50000 people being packed into a stadium on gameday), how should the UAS platforms optimize their routes and coverage areas in order to optimize the total bandwidth coverage available to customers? The SOMAV module will readily address this routing and coordination problem in a way that concurrently maximizes coverage over a mobile set of customers and minimizes the total fuel consumed by the fleet of UAS communications nodes. SOMAV will provide high fidelity simulation and modeling of the entire UAS fleet and the RF communications links between the ground-based users and the UAS communications nodes including effects due to radio and antenna characteristics, weather, terrain, and communication protocol.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Navigation & Guidance; Process Monitoring & Control; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Simulation & Modeling; Verification/Validation Tools",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The simulator is based on SystemVerilog, an IEEE-standard language with a long pedigree in the electronics world. Digital simulators offer the potential to scale to very large systems since they are already being used to model circuits with millions of events. SystemVerilog, additionally, can easily connect with continuous simulation and engineering analysis tools. Conventional commercial simulators lack this scalability. SynaptiCAD will demonstrate how its own implementation of SystemVerilog, encapsulated in a product known as Verilogger Extreme, can be generalized by creating appropriate APIs and model libraries for satellite, robotics, and science mission simulation. SynaptiCAD will further demonstrate that the simulator can connect readily to other engineering environments such as Python and Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter. A synthesis step will also be illustrated at a basic level, where a hardware design is derived from the resulting simulation. Synthesis is common in the electronics industry and carried out at a highly sophisticated level. A path toward evolving this initially rudimentary synthesis capability will be laid out. The new proposed simulator will demonstrate a realistic NASA problem and show how it can be applied to the full design lifecycle, involving multi-fidelity and multi-disciplinary models. The new simulator will eventually allow for a ""digital twin"" of a flying spacecraft that can be used for realistic validation both during the design and after launch.","A major benefit of the proposed simulator is that it can be applied throughout the design process for complex projects across NASA Science, Human Exploration and Operation, and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorates. The proposed technology will provide for realistic simulation, integration with common engineering tools, management decision support, verification and validation, and the use of standardized engineering model libraries. Initial applications will be in the science mission area dealing with advanced telescope systems, satellites, or robotic exploration. Additional applications will be pursued within NASA directorates as case studies and models are developed. In particular, since this work will require a partnership with Phoenix Integration, NASA locations that use ModelCenter would be natural candidates for further commercialization. JPL, for instance, has heavily invested in both ModelCenter and MBSE technology and is thus a strong candidate for the proposed simulation technology. NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics program has been a strong user of ModelCenter and would also benefit from the development work advocated here.  In general, satellite programs, space transportation, and air vehicle technologies can benefit from this technology.","Beyond NASA, SynaptiCAD's commercialization efforts will be focused primarily on the aerospace and defense sector where companies such as Lockheed Martin are already using both SynaptiCAD's digital design simulator and Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter product. SynaptiCAD is well positioned to introduce this technology to leading organizations in this business sector such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, and Raytheon since they already utilize both company's products. By leveraging this existing installed base, it will be possible to quickly achieve initial sales and establish a core user base for the new technology. After establishing penetration in aerospace and defense, SynaptiCAD will build upon these successes to pursue secondary markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, green energy, shipbuilding, transportation, and process industries. Some of these industries are also already users of SynaptiCAD's products.

This is due to the natural and simultaneous presence of gases and liquids in critical life support equipment, thermal control systems, power systems, and propulsion systems. With such a broad-base presence system designers must achieve a greater understanding of low-g fluid interfacial phenomena to assure performance and avoid system failure. This is both a key and critical point. In essence, designers are operating blind to multiphase functions, lacking tools and qualified components to properly design critical systems. Our concept testbed seeks to alleviate that by qualifying capillary two-phase devices in-situ aboard Space Station that when exhaustively probed will definitively qualify devices with clear specifications on performance, operating conditions, and appropriate integration for important families of conduits, container geometries, and devices. The design applies the recent results of experiments conducted on ISS to exploit capillary forces in a novel manner to assure passive phase separation processes that permit continuous 2-phase circulation in a simple closed loop with expectations of dramatic increases in data collection rates. Our Phase I objective is a low-g drop tower-demonstrated, capillary fluidics prototype testbed.

This can be detrimental to situational awareness and operational readiness. During these missions, disrupted sleep, long-term motion exposure, lack of normal gravity, and other operational characteristics result in fatigue, stress, decreased mood, and impaired cognitive and psychomotor functioning. An unobtrusive system to measure, assess, and predict astronaut workload could warn astronauts or mission control when steps should be taken to augment cognitive readiness. This system would also be useful during testing and engineering when tools and systems are being evaluated. Engineers could accurately evaluate the cognitive and physical demands of these tools, and the effects they will have on task performance and accuracy. Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate a system for Cognitive Assessment and Prediction to Promote Individualized Capability Augmentation and Reduce Decrement (CAPT PICARD). CAPT PICARD will: (1) use a suite of sensors to perform real-time synchronous data collection in a robust and unobtrusive fashion, and provide a holistic assessment of the astronaut; (2) extract, fuse, and interpret the best combination of indicators of astronaut state; (3) comprehensively predict performance deficits, optimizing the likelihood of mission success; and (4) display the data to support the information requirements of any user. Phase I goals defined in the solicitation are a literature review and design of an algorithm to assess workload. These will be a major focus; however, there is substantial overlap between CAPT PICARD and related efforts at Charles River. Therefore, we will go beyond that expectation and demonstrate a functional prototype. Meeting these requirements will dramatically improve astronaut mission readiness and the design and development of the tools used to assist them in carrying out mission objectives.","We expect the full-scope system for Cognitive Assessment and Prediction to Promote Individualized Capability Augmentation and Reduce Decrement (CAPT PICARD) to have immediate and tangible benefit for NASA. In particular, CAPT PICARD will help monitor the workload of astronauts over short- and long-duration missions. We seek to enhance the effectiveness of widely-used tools, such as assessments that interrupt task performance, including the Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test used by astronauts on ISS missions (NASA, 2014) by incorporating the innovations developed under CAPT PICARD. Augmenting these tools will enable crew monitoring astronauts to cue astronauts of impending deficits to aid in augmenting mission performance. In addition, CAPT PICARD will enable more effective testing and engineering by measuring workload added by new tools and systems while they are being designed and developed rather than once they are deployed. This capability will ultimately result in increased performance in astronauts and decreased costs in deploying technology to astronauts, furthering NASA's goals of expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space, and developing technologies to improve the quality of life on our home planet.","We see two approaches to commercializing the technologies developed under this program. First, they can be licensed to other commercial entities that will use them directly or incorporate them as added functionality to their commercial products. In particular, we will look at companies in the long- and short-duration shipping market, including UPS and FedEx, as potential licensees of this technology. Second, we will incorporate this new technology into our AgentWorks™ software, which will both increase its appeal as a commercial product and enable us to use the tool to provide consulting services based on AgentWorks to customers within the DoD, other Federal agencies, and commercial markets.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",Unobtrusive Workload Measurement   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed optical isolator design is based on enhanced magneto-optical effects in photonic crystals. With the proper lattice parameter and magneto-optical material, high optical transmission and large Faraday rotation can be achieved simultaneously at a target wavelength. A proposed device, occupying <0.1 cc, is expected to achieve high optical transmittance (forward loss <2 dB) and excellent optical isolation (extinction >40 dB); therefore, it is suitable for applications in various compact atom interferometers. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology in the visible spectral range and provide a Phase II prototype design. In Phase II, the technology will be further optimized and tested in operational environments.","The primary NASA applications of the proposed MOI system are in metrology, magnetometry, and inertial navigation. NASA applications inherently require miniaturization of all system components. Frequency stabilized lasers are currently used in atomic clocks. Next-generation magnetometers and inertial navigation sensors also need optical isolation of the laser sources. In any NASA application that requires frequency stabilized lasers, MOI devices can replace bulky optical isolators to reduce the volume by a factor of >100.","Metrology and inertial navigation are important in various military and civilian applications. Laboratory demonstrations already have shown that cold-atom systems are superior to any other technologies for navigation and timing applications. However, the biggest hurdle in transitioning this technology into field-deployable units is quite often the sheer volume and weight of the system. To take full advantage of the extraordinary performance of cold atom systems, miniaturization of individual components is necessary.

NASA is involved in UAS research that would greatly benefit from advancing the ability of UAS to make real-time decisions based on sensor data with little human oversight.  This SBIR effort is designed to develop and demonstrate this capability by installing and executing an onboard system on an existing UAS platform to provide a fully-automated, agricultural application process managed entirely by EPA-approved software.  This is a high-value civilian application particularly suited to UAS given the dangers posed by maneuvering manned aircraft at extremely low altitudes.  The SBIR effort will be performed by installing a modified version of Continuum Dynamics, Inc. (CDI) AGDISP© agricultural chemical application software onboard a specially modified Dragonfly Pictures Inc. (DPI) DP-14 Field Hawk UAS.  The project would see the development of an onboard sensing and management system to fully-automate the process for agricultural application in a manner that meets EPA regulations for chemical deposition and FAA requirements for airworthiness.  Phase I will establish feasibility by demonstrating an ability to perform the required onboard sensing, communication between the UAS and management software, and execution of the software-determined flight path and spraying strategy based on chemical deposition patterns determined by the software for prevailing environmental conditions.  Phase II would see the design, development and implementation of the fully-automated system along with a flight demonstration.","The proposed effort directly responds to the goals cited in the solicitation to develop technologies that provide the ability of UAS to extract information in-flight and utilize this information in decision making.  This SBIR effort also directly supports current NASA/industry initiatives to establish airworthiness standards for FAA-certification that will provide a roadmap for future implementation of UAS in commercial applications within the U.S.  Specifically, this SBIR effort dovetails with a NASA/DPI partnership to utilize DPI's unmanned tandem DP-14 Field Hawk helicopter to study civil airworthiness certification for use in the national airspace through demonstration of precision agricultural application, a mission that is particularly suited to UAS given the significant dangers faced by manned aircraft maneuvering at extremely low altitudes.  The proposed SBIR effort complements and directly supports this NASA/DPI effort by adding demonstration of a fully-autonomous, flight path management system onboard the UAS tailored toward a specific task, in this case agricultural application.  This adds two key elements that must be demonstrated before UAS can be applied in commercial applications within the U.S., addressing both a need for technical advancement related to autonomous control and decision-making as well as a need to develop airworthiness FAA-certification requirements for autonomous aircraft operations.","The DoD is seeing growing use of UAS in surveillance and urban operations where the ability to extract information in-flight and utilize this information in decision-making with minimal human oversight is critical.  The number of trained operators of DoD unmanned aircraft systems is currently being vastly outstripped by requirements for operating an ever-increasing fleet of UAS aircraft.  UAS operators are currently being forced to work longer and longer shifts with no alleviation in sight.  The technology developed during this effort directly supports addressing this need, providing advancements in the ability for autonomous control of UAS platforms that will reduce the level of direct piloting required.  Private industry will also benefit greatly from this current effort.  First, this SBIR will provide advancements in fully-autonomous, application-specific, UAS platforms.  Autonomous control is critical to the eventual expansion of the customer base beyond those with piloting experience to the general public at large.  Thus this area of research supports an enormous leap in commercialization potential.

The arm will leverage Energid's existing design actuated with modified smart servos to reduce cost and weight and improve performance. A unique feature of the arm is universal end-of-arm-tooling interface that provides extensibility through standard mechanical, data, and power connectors. This interface will allow the arm to host a variety of sensors and tools for broad application. Energid's Actin software toolkit will be extended for control and simulation of AFFs with attached manipulators. Control techniques will be developed to enable novel modes of acrobatic maneuvering and whole-body manipulation. This control and simulation capability will apply to one or multiple arms attached to an AFF. The new control modes will enable use of the arms in perching and momentum conserving acrobatics, where the arm and thrusters are simultaneously actuated to reach a goal. The Actin simulation engine, which supports articulated dynamics, contact dynamics, and sensors, will be extended to include aerodynamics and thruster models for AFF design validation, mission planning, and testing. The new arm and toolkit will seamlessly transition between simulating terrestrial mobile robots and fielded AFFs in microgravity.","The arm Energid proposes will advance the application of AFFs by enabling them to both sense and manipulate the environment. The abilities to perch indefinitely and maneuver using the momentum of the arm will save power and extend the life of the AFF. The software toolkit, which includes both mobile articulated robot dynamics and sensors will support NASA and other researchers in exploring algorithms and missions before fielding. The value provided through these applications will lead to additional work for Energid from NASA. Energid will provide support for the application of the arm and simulation software on upcoming missions both as a prime contractor and as a supporting subcontractor.","Energid, through its Robai subsidiary, manufactures and sells the Cyton robot arms, counting over 300 units shipped to date, on which the new arm for AFFs is based.

It is easily stored in a compact volume on a spacecraft as a solid (greater than twice the storage density than pressurized xenon), which negates the need for a large pressurized tank.  This, combined with its low cost and lower ionization energy, makes iodine an ideal propellant for a smallsat Hall thruster system.  Currently, the heaterless C12A7 electride hollow cathode is the only low power electron source available to operate with an iodine electric propulsion thruster.  C12A7 electride is a conductive ceramic with a measured work function of 0.76 eV.  Busek proposes to mature the heaterless C12A7 electride hollow cathode technology to be conducive to low power applications and compatible with an iodine propellant. The proposed Phase I effort will focus on the design and fabrication of a durable C12A7 electride insert that will be compatible with future efforts to produce a qualification model cathode.  Potential insert designs will be evaluated based on their operation within a laboratory model cathode body. The designed insert will be incorporated into an iodine-resistant cathode barrel and keeper and the full cathode will be characterized and delivered to NASA.","The major aerospace market for hollow cathodes is as the electron source for Hall Effect thruster (HET) propulsion systems.

SES, the world's second largest satellite operator, has announced plans to request bids for electric propulsion GEO ComSat. We estimate the potential HET propulsion system value of these aggregate markets at $20-60M annually: cathodes for those thrusters would account for $3-6M.

The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with The College of William and Mary, proposes the development of hydrogen-rich interpenetrating polymer networks as radiation shields. The program Technical Objectives include selection and design of interpenetrating polymer networks for use in radiation shields, synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks tailored to function as radiation shields as well as structural components, and measurement and test of interpenetrating polymer network materials for radiation-shielding effectiveness and other multifunctional properties.  The innovation is the development of interpenetrating polymer networks for structural radiation-shielding materials to protect humans on NASA missions.  The anticipated result is a combination of high-performance aromatic polymers with hydrogen-rich aliphatic polymers to create composite materials that combine the structural properties of the high-performance polymers with increased shielding effectiveness of the hydrogen-rich polymers.  The proposed materials have multifunctional properties of radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, and structural integrity to permit use in flexible and rigid structures and habitats.","The proposed multifunctional high-performance polymers will find application in NASA missions in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from space hazards, including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing lightweight structures for planetary rovers and habitats.  It is expected that these interpenetrating polymer network systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used within human habitats, spacecraft and protective apparel.  Other missions supported by NASA could also make use of the multifunctional materials for the International Space Station or in other orbiting vehicles involving long-duration small dose exposure.","Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial sector in reducing collateral damage from heavy charged particles emerging as a therapeutic approach in nuclear medicine.  The shielding will lead to decreased fatigue among medical personnel required to wear heavy protective garments during radiological procedures.  Workers in industrial facilities using radiation for materials processing and in nuclear power facilities will also benefit from more-comfortable garments having reduced weight and thermal stress.  The Departments of Defense and of Homeland Security will find applications that include protection of soldiers, first responders and emergency medical personnel against high energy gamma radiation and neutrons resulting from so-called dirty bombs as well as from hazards brought about through accidental release of radiological materials.","Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Nanomaterials; Polymers; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Structures",Radiation Shielding Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

There is optimism that estimates of PSD will be available from ocean color measurements (such as NASA's upcoming PACE mission), and will be able to help constrain global-scale ecosystem/carbon models and estimates of primary production. However, natural PSD variability is not well understood due to the challenges of routine measurement, and there exists little field data over large space and time scales. We propose to bridge this gap by investigating an instrument for ship-based flow-through application that uses laser scattering from multiple wavelengths and polarizations for estimation of the PSD across a wide range of particle sizes from submicron to >200 micron, covering a range from the smallest oceanic pico-plankton to larger meso-plankton.","The proposed instrument for measuring PSD in underway systems has wide applicability in the field of ocean optics and ocean biology and biogeochemistry. Existing methods commonly used in oceanography are time-consuming and expensive, thus the proposed system will be an attractive option for particle size measurement and advancing the state of the art in ocean color and biogeochemistry. NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers--especially those working on developing phytoplankton functional group algorithms and/or increasingly-complex biogeochemical models--are currently hindered by a lack of ground truth PSD data. Given the current push within NASA programs in preparation for launch of the PACE ocean color mission, development of this system is very timely to aid in algorithm development and enhance Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems research.","Similar to the NASA Applications, the target market for the proposed instrument is a broad. Government agency-funded (including NSF, EPA, NOAA) researchers routinely use turbidity, pigment analysis, and cell counting for water quality monitoring and science applications. Adding the ability to make measurements of PSD at higher space-time resolution would be highly significant. One potential application with major societal relevance is monitoring of changes in PSD as a tool for detecting harmful algal blooms.","Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Visible",Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The CWECS goals are to: (a) provide backward-compatibility with the existing SSCS network and SSER; (b) provide enhanced communication between the EMU and space vehicle (or ISS or future space habitat) via 802.11n, including high-speed telemetry from the EMU to the spacecraft; and (c) provide personal area network (PAN) coverage for wireless biomed devices and sensors within the EMU.The Phase I will leverage Innoflight's DeSCReeT IF-SDR, which uses cutting edge radiation-tolerant components as the foundation of a software-defined radio, and transform it into an integrated unit supporting SSCS, 802.11n and PAN.  The end result of the Phase I will be a system-level design for the CWECS that meets all SWaP, radiation and waveform requirements.","The current SSER is provided by NASA as GFE.  To provide back-compatibility to EMU / EVA space suits efforts that use the GFE SSER Innoflight proposes build an SSER-compliant variant of CWECS.  This will enable consideration in upcoming EMU block upgrades for ISS operations, and using the ISS and the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) as enabling capabilities for a Mars surface mission.  Furthermore, for advanced EVA concepts, including the Exploration EVA, the CWECS will be repackaged into smaller form factor and weight.  Deep-space high-speed wireless capabilities will be of interest to the Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) and their robotics efforts.  The NASA SBIR program is ideal vehicle to provide cost savings and/ or cost avoidance for an EMU program overdue for innovation but with budget constraints that prohibit a large scale program to advance the space suit design.","Innoflight will work with JSC to understand the opportunities to pursue opportunities to offer EVA technologies to commercial spaceflight companies, such as Virgin Galactic, and international space agencies, such as ESA or JAXA.Furthermore, deep-space high-speed wireless capabilities will be of interest for autonomous spacecraft.

ASC is proposing to design and simulate the architecture for a high speed (2 GHz) high resolution 3DFPA, running at nearly 5 times the current sample rate (430MHz) of the 128x128, and with compact pixel geometries scalable to 1 megapixel arrays.  This effort would help to push the state of the art of Flash LIDAR from 128x128 3cm resolution arrays to 1024x1024 arrays with millimeter and possible sub-millimeter resolution. Flash LIDAR systems are 3D video cameras that capture an entire frame of data from a single pulse of light. Therefore, platform motion and vibration will not affect the measurements; furthermore this motion can be used to enhance the resolution of the sensor. This is not true for any other laser-ranging systems.  Since Flash LIDAR is a time of flight system, the range maps are a direct real time data product.

Over the past several years, NASA developed two decision support tools to identify opportunities for efficient re-routes. The Dynamic Weather Routing (DWR) system uses information generated on the ground to identify candidate flights for re-routing and the airline operations center (AOC) sends the proposed change to the flight deck for subsequent negotiation with air traffic control (ATC). The Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) system is flight deck-based, using information available on the aircraft and software in the electronic flight bag (EFB) to suggest alternative routes. DWR successfully completed operational tests at ZFW and American Airlines and TASAR will soon begin operational evaluations at Alaska Airlines and Virgin America.Our concept proposes a more capable architecture that can take full advantage of emerging communications technologies to integrate AOC and flight deck capabilities. This approach offers a more robust, extensible architecture that can be tailored to an individual airline's operational model while simultaneously offering an upgrade path for adding more capability over time. Our solution aims to combine the best features of DWR and TASAR and adds more capability via enhanced data communications. Our solution fully integrates with the AOC but retains full access to the superior information from the flight deck. This enables our architecture to use the best available data, allocate data processing and analytical functions to where they can be performed most efficiently, and allows the airline to choose where it wants decision making to occur.","Our concept offers NASA two applications with significant value both near term and in the ATM+2 environment. In the near term, our architecture will identify improvements to existing NASA technologies such as DWR and TASAR. Our concept shows how to add benefits with the potential for improved communications technologies and increased cockpit access to low cost, reliable wireless. Strategically, our concept offers an early success for the Networked ATM subproject under the SMART NAS project. By developing an architecture that includes AOCs, our team offers NASA an alternate pathway to deployment of its ATM technology, without the delays and constraints of the FAA's Acquisition Management System and associated institutional barriers.In the longer term, our architecture offers the potential to add more functionality by providing a networked ATM solution that integrates communications, data collection, and optimized analysis that will support advanced concepts, including TBO and real time system wide safety assurance. Our architecture would support more extensive trajectory negotiation during a flight, which is a necessary complement to pre-departure trajectory negotiations. We offer an evolutionary pathway that generates near-term airline benefits at low cost. That success will encourage additional investments in advanced ATM concepts such as TBO.","Our concept has immediate application to airlines that want to improve operating efficiency and reduce costs and fuel consumption. A recent benefit study of DWR conducted by LMI estimated that a lower bound estimate of benefits from DWR alone would be at least $800 per aircraft, or over $3 million annually (Stouffer, et. al.). Our concept offers the potential for greater benefits by identifying more opportunities and increases the probability of successfully executing the improved route.Our approach also increases the number of airlines that would be interested as it offers a flexible solution that can be tailored to the airline preferred operating mode. Our concept provides a convenient mechanism for deploying the solution in the AOC using existing software services provided by our Sabre partner, or another provider of similar services. For some airlines, an EFB solution might be preferred and our concepts supports that implementation at low cost.",Air Transportation & Safety,Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Lidar offers the vertical resolution and can make measurements in daytime and nighttime conditions to complement passive optical spectroscopic measurement being made by the NASA OCO mission.?? The Thulium MOPA amplifier can also operate on water vapor lines for IPDA lidar for Earth, Mars and Planetary bodies. Strong water vapor lines exist in the same general 2050-2070 nm region for earth science lidar and can all be reached with this TDFA approach where the absorption lines are strong and isolated from other species and the spectroscopy is well characterized with acceptable thermal broadening. For planetary or asteroid-type missions, where very low or trace concentrations of various species are expected, the TDFA can reach the 1.8-2.1 ?m range where very strong absorption lines are available.The 2um thulium amplifier also supports lidar technology that can measure Mars atmospheric density, winds needed to understand the planets evolution and data needed for EDL aero capture landing.","The core technology developed as part of this SBIR can address a large market for eye-safe lasers and lidars particularly with Fibertek's DoD customers.

Box 131460, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 - 1570",(734) 786-1434,3,4,"The innovation proposed is a hollow cathode that integrates mitigation methods to suppress wear to the keeper.   Recent advances in the magnetic topology in Hall thrusters has eliminated erosion of the thruster walls. As such the life limiting component of Hall thrusters has shifted to the cathode lifetime.Under a previous investigation aimed at understanding the impact of high energy ions in high current hollow cathodes, we mapped the energy spectra of cathode derived ions for both a barium oxide hollow cathode and a LaB6 hollow cathode. Energetic ions were clearly present and their intensity and peak energy tended to increase with increasing discharge current. Preliminary mitigations experiments showed promise in the use of an externally applied magnetic field as a way to reduce the peak energy of the emitted ion flux. The overall goal of this proposal is to produce a hollow cathode with integrated energetic ion mitigation technology.  This cathode will be tested in magnetic field environments characteristic of Hall and gridded ion engines.  It will provide a good body of experimental evidence of how to successfully mitigate cathode erosion for the high powered thrusters currently under development. Additionally, an energetic ion mitigation method could be directly integrated into the cathode design for the recently proposed Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM) which is currently baselined to use 4-5 10 kW class magnetically shielded Hall thrusters.","The direct application of long life, high current hollow cathodes is that of supporting NASA missions involving high power electric propulsion. This includes those high power missions, which are envisioned to support human operations in space as well as aggressive space science mission.   For example, an energetic ion mitigation method could be directly integrated into the cathode design for the  recently proposed Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM) which is currently baselined to use 4-5 10 kW Hall thrusters. It should be pointed out that the presence of energetic ions is not germane to high current cathodes though as was observed in the NSTAR long duration test.  In this regard, the technology developed from this effort would also eliminate this failure mechanism for cathodes presumably over essentially all operating ranges.","The cathode mitigation technology is generally applicable to Hall and ion thrusters used for both government and commercial satellite orbit raising, orbit transfer, and station keeping. In particular, the mitigation technology supports Air Force and other DoD onboard electric propulsion interests.  The technology would also be a life extender for commercial sector satellite makers. Commercial GSO market expects to launch of order 21 satellites per year and commercial NGSO of order 13 launches per year over the next 10 years. Electric propulsion is an onboard propulsion option for these vehicles and in this regard there is a stable market for this cathode life extension technology. The approach investigated here does not constitute a significant modification to the cathode rather it's essentially a retrofit featuring a novel, adaptable technology. This would in turn save costs to satellite venders by reducing development time of long life cathodes based on this technology proposed.","Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine",High Power Electric Propulsion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

A Transported Turbulence Product (TTP) is proposed which follows the forensic analysis procedures used to evaluate potential causes for such encounters during CAT incident investigations.  Should our proposed method prove viable, dispatchers will be able to warn pilots prior to entry into high probability areas for such Transported Turbulence.  The timely warnings will allow material and personnel in the cabin to be secured during transit.","The methods developed will be useful to aviation and scientific personnel for NASA Flight Operations during Field Experiments, especially for topics involving the tracking and detection of atmospheric trace constituents. Since we are focusing on advection of hazard tracers with warning times on the order of hours, the approach may extend the value of dated NASA observations (hours since collection) without the requirement for real time data delivery. The TTP is delivered in Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) formats which allow immediate import into NASA geobrowser open source technologies.

Virtually all software components necessary to achieve this goal are available within the CRAFT Tech suite of simulation tools which have a range of modern day capabilities and features.  Many of the capabilities have already been directly applied to reentry flows, such as ablation and regression modeling, transition to turbulence modeling, advanced chemistry and ionization modeling, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium modeling, and a hybrid coupled continuum-rarefied simulation framework for steady and unsteady flows.  Other features, such as aero/thermo/structural coupling, also exist but have not been directly applied to reentry type flows so the Phase I effort will demonstrate them in both the rarefied and continuum regimes.  Our hybrid continuum-rarefied framework presently contains only information exchange from continuum to rarefied regions.  For reentry applications, especially for non-traditionally shaped vehicles, this assumption is no longer valid, so a proposed developmental task will implement a rarefied to continuum information exchange within our existing hybrid continuum-rarefied solver framework.  Finally, a plan of action for the Phase II effort will be elaborated to define a common Application Program Interface to couple the various existing components, including software packages outside the CRAFT Tech toolset, into a single unified framework.","Potential NASA applications include the design and analysis of any reentry vehicle technology.  The generalized nature of the proposed toolset means it is not restricted to Earth based reentry but can include any other planetary systems for which atmospheric characteristics can be defined.  Although a significant amount of toolsets exist for reentry prediction, what our method will provide is a unified framework based on high-fidelity, first-principle numerical analysis.  Our current high-fidelity numerical tools for reentry will be integrated in an uncompromising manner using an Executive Controller to allow for the analysis of more generalized conditions, whether they be flowfield related, such as mixed continuum-rarefied flows, or geometry related, such as non-traditionally shaped reentry vehicles.  Since each component is already based on a parallelized framework, the final unified toolset will also be highly parallelized and can take advantage of the new parallel hardware paradigms, such as Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) usage for which some of our tools have been ported.  In addition, since the final toolset will be based on an Executive Controller utilizing an Application Program Interfaces (API) approach, the ability to link any existing software package is also possible.  So either existing or future NASA tools could potentially be used in-lieu of those already proposed.","CRAFT Tech currently licenses its commercial software CRUNCH CFD to various organizations outside of NASA including the commercial pump community and liquid rocket propulsion entities.  We also support design optimization efforts of large scale industrial systems.  We have a partnership with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, with approval from the U.S. State Dept via a Technical Assistance Agreement, to develop software tools to support critical design analysis, especially for cryogenic pump systems and reentry analysis.  Related to the present effort, we are developing tools to predict HTV reentry trajectories and vehicle integrity using our hybrid methodologies in order to reduce the safety zone for splashdown and thus reduce costs associated with securing a large safety zone.  Our hybrid continuum-rarefied simulation tools are also utilized by International Launch Systems to perform critical component integration analysis during payload separation maneuvers.  Our tools are also being used for design at Blue Origin while interest in many of our programs has come from SpaceX.  Through the proposed effort, we foresee a tremendous potential in our simulations products to further strengthen these ties and make new ones, especially considering the current proposed efforts by SpaceX to recover as many components for re-use as possible requiring reentry analysis of non-traditionally shaped vehicles.","Aerobraking/Aerocapture; Aerodynamics; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Verification/Validation Tools",Thermal Control Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To develop such next-generation systems, multiple design variables must be assessed and optimized efficiently within a conceptual design software environment.   A blend of physics-based, low- and mid-fidelity tools featuring rapid turnaround time and ease of setup can provide this capability; implementation represents a serious technical challenge, though, and there is a high premium on developing tools that are both sufficiently accurate to capture current technology performance metrics while permitting the rapid re-calculations necessary for design trades.  The proposed approach centers on a blend of enhanced features and novel departures for two complementary aeroanalysis methods: an evolved version of an established subsonic lifting surface free wake mdoel for propellers as a fast,'low-fidelity' tool; and a more computationally intensive, fully compressible Cartesian Grid Euler model as a 'mid-fidelity' tool.   The projected Phase I will implement and test key modeling and formulation improvements for these methods to enable them to support the design of multi-stage open rotor configurations to meet current and projected performance targets.","The proposed effort directly responds to NASA's SBIR solicitation goal of investigating the potential of advanced, innovative propulsion concepts to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of future commercial transports.

Helium is a scarce, strategic and non-renewable natural resource.NASA is a major user of helium and significant future cost savings in operations can be realized with improved monitoring of purge activities.  Without real time measurement of species being purged from systems, extended purge cycles and excess helium is used to ensure completely purged lines.  The proposed sensor system will incorporate individual microsensor elements for key species.  The sensors will be designed to be permanently installed in purge and vent lines at cryogenic propellant storage, transfer, test stand and launch facilities.The instrument package to be developed in the program will adapt low cost and low power chemical microsensor technology which was originally developed for leak detection applications and recently been demonstrated in proof of concept cryogenic vent tests at NASA.  This program will develop a low cost, robust integrated sensor probe and electronics with data interfaces suitable for real time monitoring and control helium purge sequences to minimize overall helium usage.","The primary NASA application of the technology will be at propulsion test stands at NASA SSC and NASA Launch facilities at NASA KSC.  The proposed sensor product would be used in systems for propellant storage, transfer and fueling operations.  The use of these sensors would be part of an overall operation and maintenance strategy to reduce helium purge gas usage and reduce facility operating costs.",Commercial space transportation and spaceports will require operations to be highly automated and efficient to achieve the desired levels of cost effectiveness.  The proposed MCMI will be immediately applicable to new facilities being planned and existing facilities undergoing modernization and upgrades. There is also a large opportunity for variations of the MCMI for monitoring a wide range of industrial processes such as gas-to-liquid plants using natural gas.  Chemical processing and refining operations use purge gas systems with nitrogen during change over operations and maintenance cycles.  Currently many industrial operations rely on personnel to do manual sampling and monitoring at various points in the system with portable analyzers during purge operations.,"Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fuels/Propellants; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport)",Cryogenic Purge Gas Recovery and Reclamation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The three wavelength source is being developed to facilitate on-board validation measurements of airborne remote backscatter lidar.  Currently, commercial nephelometers utilized for in-situ validation measurements employ wavelengths that are both not matched to the operational wavelengths and not at the 1800 angle used in near nadir remote sensing backscatter lidar systems. Uncertainties in the wavelength and angle dependence of the return signal make in-situ validation of the remote measurement difficult. The performance of remotely operated lidar systems will be greatly improved by the successful demonstration of an in-situ backscatter measurement with the proposed collinear three wavelength source.","The primary beneficiary of the proposed module development is NASA's in-situ and remote sensing programs. Periodically poled materials offer a wider array of functionality including robust, multi-element platforms for combining tasks like frequency conversion and modulation without adding insertion loss due to additional components.  Several other missions like NASA's 3D WINDS that require seed derived, fiber coupled, frequency tripled lasers for calibration and locking will also benefit.

Such predicted trajectories are fundamental inputs to a wide variety of planning, monitoring and control tasks, including airline seasonal fleet planning, pre-departure flight planning, real-time airspace and airport load forecasting, traffic sequencing and spacing, separation assurance, weather routing, runway assignment, etc. Clearly trajectory simulators are core components of many air traffic applications; it is important that they be as accurate, as efficient and as manageable as possible. We propose an innovative trajectory constraint modeling utility that leads to improvements in all three areas. Regarding trajectory simulator accuracy, there are several categories of error sources that contribute to trajectory prediction uncertainty. One key, and overlooked, source is flight plan nonconformance. Flights often fail to follow their flight plan due to various constraints that are encountered, such as altitude holding, speed control, path stretching and reroutes. It is important to model these constraints both for flight time forecasting as well as load forecasting. Such constraints are not deterministic and their variance is a major contributor to trajectory prediction error. Therefore our constraint modeler produces probabilistic constraint forecasts which, in turn, support probabilistic trajectory prediction. Advanced air traffic applications not only require trajectory predictions that (i) are as accurate as possible, but also that (ii) provide an indication of their error as well, which can vary substantially. Traditionally, predictors have produced deterministic trajectories and their uncertainty is often ignored. We also discuss in our proposal how our trajectory constraint modeler supports significant improvements in efficiency and manageability of trajectory predictors.","Our 4D Probabilistic Trajectory Constraint Modeler has several valuable applications for NASA. First, it will be an important addition to existing trajectory predictors. No modifications are required as our Probabilistic Trajectory Constraint Modeler will be used to enhance the accuracy of the input flight plan data. The result will be more accurate trajectory forecasting which will improve the efficiency, benefits and acceptance of NASA air traffic control and air traffic management tools. Also, because our modeler provides the probabilistic information about the constraints, it support probabilistic trajectory prediction which will be important in the next generation decision support tools. Finally, our Probabilistic Trajectory Constraint Modeler supports extremely fast trajectory prediction. Such a trajectory predictor will enable entirely new optimization approaches for traffic planning tools.","Beyond NASA, potential applications for this work lie with operators ranging from major airlines to charters and air taxi services, the Federal Aviation Administration and international Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs). In fact we already have provided an initial version of an empirical trajectory predictor to an operator with great success. This product is useful for operators both for seasonal fleet planning, predeparture flight planning and real-time flight following. With more accurate flight times, operators can make more efficient use of their fleet and provide more accurate arrival times to their customers. More accurate flight times also improves the operator flight planning process. For instance, operators can compute more accurately the required fuel loading for their flights. This can reduce their takeoff weight, thus reducing their overall fuel burn and environmental impact. For their dispatch and flight following tasks, operators will have more accurate predictions of the future progress of a flight as it progresses along its route. In addition to operators, our Probabilistic Trajectory Constraint Modeler will be a valuable component for the Federal Aviation Administration and international Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) for improved traffic flow planning.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling,Autonomy of the National Airspace System (NAS)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Electrical conductors are key components for just about every power device or system. Copper is presently the conductor of choice, based on high performance, low cost, and ease of use. However, increasing demands for power and data push the need for more capacity, and the total contribution of electrical conductor weight to the system has become significant in aircraft, ships, rail, and automobiles.

Cell phones, tablets, computers and remote mounted cameras all use axially symmetric free forms in the optical designs.  The imaging quality of these systems is limited by the lens metrology, limiting the pixel density found in cell phone cameras to ~8 MegaPixels.  Improved metrology will mean improved consumer electronics performance and higher manufacturing yields, and potentially lower costs to manufacture.Beyond consumer imaging systems, machine vision, security and defense related imaging and industrial instrumentation all could benefit from free form optics. Non-axially symmetric free forms are needed for projection systems and illumination systems.  Again metrology is lacking to produce these optics in the surface accuracy, data density and speed required to be commercially viable.  Again, improved metrology means improved performance and higher manufacturing yields, and potentially lower costs to manufacture. The PROBE and Phase II hybrid profiler will meet these commercial market needs for high density data across the whole surface.

The aerospike features a well-known altitude compensation capability, but the MAV operates in near-vacuum conditions so cannot take advantage of that aspect.  Instead, the aerospike nozzle, at a comparable ~200:1 area ratio as is currently baselined for MAV, will be considerably shorter than a traditional bell nozzle.  Thus, for a fixed motor length, a shorter aerospike nozzle will allow us to lengthen the motor case itself, thereby enabling us to load a substantial amount of additional propellant than the baseline.  The resultant improvement in propellant fraction will provide significantly higher payload performance compared to the baseline--our preliminary calculations show that up to 40% additional propellant can be added to the each motor.","The MAV is our primary technology insertion opportunity, but an aerospike nozzle, particular on solid rocket motors, is applicable to a wide variety of NASA propulsion systems.

When complete, the device will exceed FastCAP's current world record as the highest temperature ultracap in the world. The proposed ultracap will enable significant strides forward in design paradigms utilized in deep space high temperature environments– enabling reduction in the weight, volume and complexity of energy storage systems, while relaxing design constraints on scarce candidate high temperature battery technologies. Importantly, the device will not exhibit the typical volatility and toxicity associated with traditional electrolytes present in current aerospace battery technologies. During Phase I, we will demonstrate an ultracap comprising a high temperature ionic liquid-doped polymer electrolyte paired with binder-free carbon nanotube electrodes capable of operating at 0°C-300°C. At the end of Phase II, this device will exhibit a high power density (1kW/kg and 1.4kW/L), 10-15X the power density of Sodium Sulfur batteries, and a high energy density (0.7Wh/kg and 1Wh/L), 10,000X higher than ceramic capacitors. The prototype will have a cycle life of more than 1,000,000 cycles at room temperature and below, and more than 100,000 cycles at 300°C. We will leverage our experience in the development of extreme environment ultracaps for oil & gas industry applications to engineer a device able to withstand high shock (up to a 1000Gpeak) and vibration (up to 60Grms) conditions, as well as high pressure differentials (up to 100atm).","FastCAP has identified a variety of applications where this disruptive technology will have a significant impact in energy storage weight/volume reduction, complexity reduction and life extension. They include: Energy Storage for deep space exploration missions with extreme temperature requirements (i.e. Venus Missions, Sun Missions, Lunar Quest Missions), Electric Propulsion Systems; GPS/Guidance; Deep Space Transponders and Radars; Satellites; Cube-Sats; Payload Operations; Exploration Vehicles (landers, rovers); Pyro Initiators for the stage separation of the rockets; Flight Termination Systems (FTS); Emergency Detection Systems (EDS); Peak Power harvesters from power sources such as PVs.In addition, there are specific applications suggested by FastCAP's aerospace industry partners for the proposed technology: Power optimization for Launch Vehicle (LV) applications for pyro initiators; Hydraulics power augmentation for the Next Generation Launch System (NGLS) program; Power optimization for Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF) system for the Common Upper Stage program; Power optimization for Lite and Heavy Electric Propulsion Upper Stages utilizing Hall Effect Thrusters to enable heavy USG spacecraft to GSO and NASA Interplanetary Missions.","FastCAP is currently developing a breakthrough geothermal drilling tool under an EERE Geothermal Technologies Program grant, incorporating its world record breaking 250?C ultracap technology.

By cooperatively allocating unmanned resources, vehicle tasking, and planning the subsequent vehicle paths, the efficiency of UAS operations can be maximized. Heron Systems proposes the Multi-Agent Cooperative Engagement (MACE) framework that enables collaborative resource allocation, task allocation, and path planning for unmanned systems operating in dynamic environments subject to diverse communication conditions. This Phase 1 work will focus on the path planning portion of MACE, as path planning is an integral part of collaborative efforts in nearly every real world application. The path planning architecture will define key modules to plan paths to a global objective, assess potential obstacles, and avoid collisions while maintaining progress towards the global objective. The framework will be constructed in a modular fashion to allow a plug-and-play capability for the resource/task allocation as well as the various components of the path planning pipeline, giving end users the flexibility to explore other methods for UAS collaboration. At the conclusion of Phase 1, the MACE path planning capability will be demonstrated using Heron Systems' previously developed flexible UAS simulation suite and ISAAC software, promoting high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop simulation/stimulation testing with COTS hardware components.","Heron Systems identifies the UAS National Air Space (NAS) integration project as the principle NASA mission to benefit from MACE.  Collaborative UAS capabilities can support several ongoing initiatives either directly or by offering capabilities that empower further opportunities.  MACE is well suited to benefit the ongoing effort to integrate UAS into the NAS.  Methods for determining suitable paths in the presence of both cooperating and non-cooperating aircraft are vital for safe integration.  Additionally, MACE can provide NASA with a framework for enabling safe terminal area operations where collaborative control can be used to guide entering and exiting UAS into safe, predictable flight patterns while in the terminal area.","Commercially, MACE promises to dramatically improve the efficiency of operations of many envisioned UAS applications.  Of particular interest are those in the areas of precision agriculture and pipeline/electrical grid inspection.  Heron Systems will build a service delivery model tailored for precision agriculture supporting rapid surveying of fields and follow-on tasking based on real-time findings.  Similarly, a second product line will tailor to the needs of long distance pipeline and electrical grid operators, supporting inspection requirements.  Heron Systems is principally targeting the commercial market. Collaborative UAS capabilities can enable game changing opportunities for the government market broadly.  For example, the US military would benefit from collaborative small UAS packages where size, weight, power and cost are scaled down to support high capability in a near disposable package. This could enable front-line ISR missions or even kinetic events in support of squad level operations, amongst many other possibilities.  Ongoing persistent surveillance missions could be enhanced by allowing for teams of heterogeneously equipped assets to work together to increase the amount and/or quality of the surveillance data captured. The Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency could benefit from collaborative teams performing agricultural surveys and environmental inspections/monitoring.

Area-I has continued this tradition in its development of the Resource allocation for Multi-Agent Planning, or ReMAP, guidance and navigation system for unmanned aircraft. The ReMAP system, whose core function is to significantly reduce operator workload by providing mission-driven autonomy to unmanned aircraft in single- and multi-agent scenarios, has already undergone extensive hardware-in-the-loop simulation-based evaluations and the work proposed herein will further mature the ReMAP technology through actual flight-based evaluations on Area-I aircraft.   Core capabilities provided by the ReMAP system include:1) A small, lightweight, inexpensive avionics package that provides real-time mission-driven guidance capabilities to unmanned air vehicles2) A system architecture that is platform and autopilot agnostic and can therefore be utilized by a wide array of aircraft with varying performance levels3) A multi-agent planning and control algorithm to allow multiple aircraft to coordinate and thereby maximize mission capabilities and results4) Aircraft and obstacle avoidance capabilities, including ADS-B In integration, providing autonomous avoidance maneuvers or operator warnings5) A mission planning toolbox to provide situational awareness and mission management to operators, usable as  a stand-alone system or integrated with existing mission planning tools such as NASA's Airborne Science Mission Tools Suite","The ReMAP system provides a unique ability to enhance two of NASA's mission directorates: the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) and the Science Mission Directorate (SMD). The system improves the goals of the ARMD through the development of a system that promotes the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System (NAS) and is in line with the goals of the NextGen system. The majority of others'work performed in multi-agent systems has been largely academic and often solves very specific or theoretical problems. The goal of the ReMAP development, however, has been to provide a successful and operationally relevant product that may be used in a wide variety of applications. The result is a system that has a significant potential impact on the SMD to support a variety of missions, both present and future.","The ReMAP system has a large number of end-use applications, including multiple aircraft platforms and mission types. Our strong industry support, shows the significant impact the ReMAP system may have on UAS applications and provides a clear path to commercialization. The system may be commercialized as a stand-alone system, or coupled as an add-on to COTS autopilot systems. Area-I may also commercialize turn-key, ReMAP enabled aircraft as well as multi-agent mission support.","Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Today, these behaviors are largely detected after an incident has occurred. In July 2013, an Asiana Boeing 777 flew too low approaching San Francisco International Airport (SFO), its tail hitting a seawall and crashing into the runway. Three people died and 180 were injured. Since the weather was clear and visibility unimpeded, part of the instrument landing system (the glideslope transmitter) was offline for service, thus requiring pilots to land visually. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the Asiana pilots' reliance on the automated flight systems was a key factor in that crash. Further analysis by the Wall Street Journal revealed that foreign pilots required more ""go-arounds"" at SFO than U.S. pilots in the six weeks prior to the Asiana Airlines crash (i.e., when the glideslope transmitter was down), indicating a greater difficulty in executing the landing via visual approach. This type of anomalous behavior could have been detected prior to the crash. All of the data was available, but no one was looking at it to see these consistent, yet anomalous behaviors. Metron proposes to develop a semi-autonomous background monitoring system to apply this type of data mining and data discovery to recent historical track repositories in order to identify opportunities for improvements to safety and efficiency in airspace operations. Metron proposes a statistical approach that uses historical flight data to develop models of normal behavior, and then apply statistical methods to identify outliers under one or more indicators. Metron has used similar approaches for anomaly detection systems developed and delivered to operational customers in the land and maritime domains.","The long-term goal of this A3 Airspace Operations and Safety work is facilitating the development of autonomy in the future National Airspace System (NAS) through the modeling of how human behavior influences the details of flight path selection.  The short-term goal is to improve the current NAS by identifying flights deemed ""anomalous"" by a suite of indicators designed to assess flight efficiency and safety.  The transition path for NASA priorities begins with ATAC's flight repository, the source of the data for this project.  ATAC's mission is to consolidate, to cleanse, and to otherwise add value to NAS data—the indicators we propose to develop for this project are designed to aid that mission.  In preparation for a Phase II, we will work with ATAC to transition our short-term technology to an FAA NextGen program (e.g., Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT)), and leverage these in-roads to begin transitioning our deeper human-behavior modeling effort.","For Non-NASA commercial applications, we plan to use the proposed work to extend our technical base of kinematic modeling and anomaly detection (which is land- and sea-oriented) to include air operations.  This will allow us to break into new areas within agencies such as NGA that are already using our technology for land and sea.  Much of our technical base was developed as a kinematic component of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for the Navy, where it is important to understand the behavior of commercial shipping.  We would use the extension of this work into the air domain to develop a similar capability for the Air Force, providing capabilities for them to interact more safely and effectively within the context of civilian airspace.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Fusion; Data Processing; Intelligence; Process Monitoring & Control; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Autonomy of the National Airspace System (NAS)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The low-cost, low-weight, and small size of the CCS caters specifically to CubeSat applications. A key objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate cryogenic cooling technologies that allow science measurement capabilities with smaller, more affordable spacecraft while concurrently reducing system risk, cost, size, and development time, consistent with NASA SBIR Science Subtopic S1.10. During the Phase I effort, a paper study will be conducted for the thermodynamic and mechanical design optimization of a two-stage pulse tube cryocooler configuration.  Also during the Phase I effort, a Cryocooler Control Electronics (CCE) brassboard will be designed, fabricated, tested, and delivered in a proof-of-concept and risk reduction effort for a follow-on Phase II which would involve developing a space qualified system.","The CubeSat Cryocooler System can be applied to any NASA Commercial mission that requires cryogenic cooling for a detector, sensor, or similar instruments to fit within a CubeSat platform. More specifically, the CCS equipped with a two-stage pulse-tube coldhead would be the natural candidate for infrared detectors and focal plane electronics.","The current potential commercial applications for the CCS range from supporting imagery and surveillance capabilities, with a strong outlook for additional applications.  Skybox Imaging and Planet Labs are two companies marketing optical and near-infrared imagery as well as full-frame video collected by microsats to capture Earth imagery.In November 2013, Skybox Imaging launched its first satellite and began offering submeter resolution for visible-wavelength imagery and 30 hertz optical video at slightly lower resolution. Planet Labs has also launched over 30 Cubesats with intent to launch 100 more in 2015. These private initiatives to capture Earth imagery utilizing CubeSats highlight the opportunity to provide CubeSat Cryocooler Systems to enable the detectors and sensors that are being implemented.  CubeSats can also be utilized for weather monitoring purposes, which require microwave imaging capabilities that the CCS would be an ideal candidate to support.   Surveillance Cubesats to track geostationary objects has also been demonstrated, which shows the feasibility of using a microsat to host an optical payload capable of sensing small objects in geosynchronous orbit from LEO.  These capabilities can be improved and promoted with supporting infrastructure that the CCS would provide.  Thus, small satellites satisfy a growing range of data gathering missions, requiring high-accuracy sensors, indicating the number of CCS commercial applications could increase in the future.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)",Cryogenic Systems for Sensors and Detectors   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed modeling is sufficiently flexible and capable of zooming in and out to a different level of granularity necessary to capture the relevant dynamics at both component levels and interfaces.  Particular emphasis is on ensuring fast transiently stable responses to major changes in aircraft system conditions, both nominal and off-nominal. At present such models do not exist, and are essential for designing control for provable performance. This approach promises to overcome today's disconnect between the aircraft dynamics and electric power system dynamics which we view to be the key roadblock to cleaner and efficient power production, delivery and consumption in future aircraft electric power systems. An Aircraft-Dynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems (A-DyMonDS) framework will be introduced and simulated for several candidate aircraft electric power systems architectures. A higher-level coordinating optimization software will be used to coordinate set points of controllers within the electric power system, and embedded nonlinear digital control for power electronics will be proposed to ensure flexible and reliable power provision over the wide range of aircraft operating conditions, both nominal and off-nominal.","The proposed framework is potentially a game changer for the digital control of energy storage and, more broadly, energy system management in aircraft electric power systems. The objective is to introduce a multi-layered interactive approach to nonlinear power-electronically-switched digital control of AC-DC and DC-AC converters so the desired power is provided in transiently stable ways in response to varying aircraft control requirements. The approach can be further extended to controlling electric power systems for single vehicle and future multi-vehicle manned deep-space missions. Presently much is known about the design and power-electronic control of individual energy system components (loads, batteries, flywheels), but there is very little systems thinking about integrating these different modules to operate in adaptive condition-driven ways to ensure fault tolerance, stability and efficiency. This project will demonstrate a possible approach in Phase I using simulations, while Phase II will use test beds agreed on with the NASA Glenn team.","These are primarily for terrestrial ""smart"" grids, micro-grids in particular, and for ultimate new ways of operating electric utility systems in general. The proposed DYMONDS framework provides a paradigm change for future grids since these too require a systematic integration of diverse energy storage and intermittent resources. Notably, in parts of the Texas power grid doubly-fed-induction-generator-controlled wind power plants connected via a weak power-electronically-controlled transmission line has experienced oscillations; adequate digital control is needed to prevent this from happening. Our basic premise is that pursuing similar operating paradigms for complex NASA energy systems may go a long way toward gaining understanding and confidence, and ultimately changing today's operating paradigm. This way the proposed project has the potential for major non-NASA economic regional impact as well.  This is one of the reasons for our excitement to pursue this venture with NASA Glenn.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Distribution/Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)",Low Emissions Propulsion and Power   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Insights gained by these experiments in the virtual world will help the community understand the benefits—and potential limits—of future autonomous operations in the NAS.Some of the research questions that can be answered by such a tool include the following.  To what extent does the noise footprint of an automated separation assurance algorithm hinder its acceptance by the public?  To what extent is fuel burn reduced by using automated separation assurance?  How great a flight density can an automated separation assurance function allow?  Under what conditions might an automated separation assurance algorithm require manual intervention?","Aviation consultants, the FAA itself, and other professionals can use this tool to gain a better understanding of the role of autonomous operations in the NAS.  Suppose, for example, a UAS manufacturer is considering a particular autonomous algorithm that they want to include in their design.  Using this tool, the manufacturer can determine whether the vehicle will fly correctly in the presence of a future autonomous NAS, and therefore whether the investment in building the aircraft will yield a positive net return.The FAA can use this tool to become acquainted with a partially or fully autonomous NAS operation, to determine to what extent autonomy should be introduced, and on what timetable and what the expected benefits will be.  This information is important for producing an autonomy roadmap that will allow FAA program managers to specify the steps, and timetable, needed to further transform the NAS.","Air Transportation and Safety, Analytical Methods, Algorithms/Control Software and Systems, Simulation and Modeling",Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Simulation & Modeling,Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The most significant opportunity for efficiency improvement is the reduction of turbulent skin friction drag. NASA research into the microblowing technique (MBT) has been shown to reduce skin friction drag by 50 to 70 percent in subsonic flow and 80 to 90 percent in supersonic flow, which can translate into significant fuel savings. While small-scale wind tunnel testing has been performed to prove the potential benefits of the MBT, additional research is required to develop a complete understanding of boundary layer dynamics, conduct large-scale experiments, and estimate system weight, efficiency, and cost impacts of implementing the MBT on an actual aircraft. Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) will address these challenges and mature the MBT with the goal of significantly reducing skin friction drag for aircraft at both high subsonic (0.7 < M < 0.9) and low supersonic speeds (M <  3).","Supporting NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) and the Fundamental Aeronautics Program, this project's technologies directly address requirements for materials and structures technologies contributing towards aircraft aerodynamic efficiency. These requirements fall within NASA's strategic goals to reduce the impact of aircraft on the environment.  The MBT offers the potential for significant fuel savings and reduced emissions for commercial and DoD aircraft operating in both subsonic and supersonic flight regimes.","This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises.Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include aircraft operated by the Air Force. Initially, implementation into transport aircraft such as the C-17 Globemaster III and tanker aircraft will provide the Air Force with the greatest opportunity for fuel savings, as these systems consume the majority of the fuel used by the Air Force. In addition, implementation would be the most similar on these aircraft as integration on commercial aircraft.  The technology could also be used on future tactical, bomber, and reconnaissance platforms to extend range or increase payload weight fraction.This technology's attributes for reduced aircraft fuel consumption through turbulent skin friction drag reduction should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for passenger and cargo aircraft.

During this program, United Silicon Carbide will extend the capability of its SiC JFET integrated circuit fabrication technology to produce electronics compatible with such extreme environments. Silicon Carbide (SiC) junction field effect transistor (JFET) based electronics are ideal for these environments due to their excellent radiation tolerance and high performance and reliability over an extremely wide operating temperature range. SiC electronics can be used in applications ranging from low power, low noise mixed signal electronics for precision actuator control, sensor interfaces, and guidance and navigation electronics to power electronics for power management and distribution and power processing units. Systems built with SiC based electronics will have longer storage and operating lifetimes when compared to systems built with existing silicon electronics. Use of SiC integrated circuits will also lower system mass, volume, and power by reducing or eliminating the need for cooling and radiation shielding.In Phase I, we will perform measurements and modeling to show the feasibility of extending the capability of our SiC integrated circuit (IC) technology to meet NASA's extreme environment needs. In Phase II, we will fully develop the extreme environment capable SiC IC technology and demonstrate it through test and delivery of a high temperature, radiation hard, mixed signal sensor and control circuit.

Earth based applications include distributed engine control systems. These systems have been the subject of research and development for several decades but their implementation has been prevented by the lack of available extreme temperature electronics technology.

Most free-piston Stirling (FPS) convertors are piston-displacer machines that use complex gas bearing/ flexure strategies to manage the wear of reciprocating and close-fitting internal components.  The reliability of these mechanisms is critical to overall system performance and longevity.  Converter Source, LLC has developed a double-acting free-piston Stirling arrangement that eliminates displacers and the problem of displacer seal wear while at the same time reducing the number of distinct parts required for the machine. The key design features of the new convertor most relevant to the space power application include: integrated alternator functionality within the piston assembly, eliminating connecting structures and buffer volumes with associated pressure walls, thereby reducing system mass compared to conventional technology, compatibility with simple lightweight hydrodynamic gas bearings to eliminate piston seal wear, dynamically-balanced radial layout that surrounds the heat source at the center, and heat rejection to ambient at the outer perimeter.","Space Power Generation - The proposed innovation has the potential to support space power generation applications in the 10's – 100's We power range using radioisotope heat sources.  Multiple units could be stacked to provide increased power.  Aided by its internal geometric simplicity, the ring-configuration double-acting free-piston Stirling convertor has the potential to enable more reliable and long-life convertor operation via less complicated and more robust hydrodynamic bearing approaches than are presently used by the other Stirling convertors.Space-based Cryocooling – The convertor could also be optimized to serve as a cryocooler for NASA applications that would benefit from a cooled central-bore and long-life operation.  Possible examples might include: cryocooling of superconducting magnetic bearings in support of flywheel energy storage systems, flow-through fluid cooling, re-condensation of cryogenic gases for zero-boiloff fluid storage, sensor cooling, etc.","Power Generation - The FPS convertor has been proposed for solar thermal power generation applications in conjunction with thermal energy storage to provide fully-dispatchable power generation any time of day.  The convertor has the potential to be a lower cost alternative to other Stirling machines and might find application as a generator using natural gas or renewable biofuels.Cryocooling – As a cryocooler, the proposed device might be optimized to cool high-temperature superconducting magnetic bearings (SMB) in industrial spindles and motors.  The associated reduced frictional losses and reduced maintenance of these SMB systems combined with the lower cost of this cryocooler have the potential to enable the first economical widespread deployment of flywheel energy storage systems for portable and stationary applications – including grid stabilization, renewable energy firming, and uninterruptible power supplies.  The cryocooler will also have potential to be applied for zero-boiloff re-condensation of volatile fuels and other substances.","Coatings/Surface Treatments; Conversion; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Generation; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Quality/Reliability; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Storage; Tribology",Power Generation and Conversion   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The research addresses the following deficiencies: most FMSs have limited advanced features; are specific to a single aircraft type; expensive and protected by FMS manufacturers. The proposed FMS platform will enable users to deploy a wide array of autonomy enabling FMS features by the click of a button. Some of the proposed features include: (i) air-ground & inter-aircraft trajectory negotiation, (ii) 4D Trajectory-Based Operations (4DTBO), (iii) high-fidelity wind modeling for improved predictability, (iii) trajectory planning options based on environmental and efficiency considerations, and (iv) advanced guidance modes such as Required Time of Arrival (RTA) and 4DFMS.

Such robots will need to be able to follow procedures that were originally authored for human agents.  Unfortunately, subtasks that are trivial for a human can be incredibly complex for a robot to execute, and many assumptions about the capabilities and state of the agent can be hidden in the procedure.  If humanoids are to become truly useful in this context, we need to develop a methodology – a language – for interpreting procedure steps into goals and skills that are relevant to the deliberative layer of a robot's control system.  In this project, we propose to analyze representative procedures for routine activities on ISS and develop an interpretation of them that can be understood by a prototype executive software layer connected to the API for R2.  We will demonstrate the execution of these translated procedures on the Simulation of R2 on ISS.  R2 on ISS is an ideal testbed for such studies. This work has immediate application to the humanoids being developed at NASA/JSC, such as R2 and Valkyrie, and should have broad applicability in the DoD and industry.","NASA has a vast corpus of procedures for activities on-board spacecraft, and the list will only grow as new, longer, and more complex missions are pursued.  This work will be of immediate benefit when examining the potential roles humanoids, such as R2 and Valkyrie, might play on such a mission.  R2 on ISS is an obvious testbed for examining how a humanoid robot might relieve the workload of crewmembers on a long mission.","Many companies and government agencies are developing humanoid robots for possible use in dangerous or difficult jobs.  For many of these jobs, procedures exist that describe how the job is to be performed. Not surprisingly, most of these procedures were written with the expectation that humans would execute them.  Thus, there is a huge corpus of procedures in all areas of human endeavor that will require products like the one being proposed here in order for humanoid robots to participate. We anticipate strong interest from humanoid manufacturers, which will only increase as the dexterity of their robots improves and they become practical for more tasks.NASA is not the only government entity that uses procedures and checklists to standardize human activity.  As humanoid robots become practical in DoD or industrial settings, we expect this work to be applicable there as well.

However, spectrum agility alone is not enough to achieve reliable communications for space networks. Mission success often requires network agility across the protocol layers for environmental awareness and autonomous reconfiguration. This is still an unsolved problem. Specifically, multi-hop wireless/satellite networks with dynamic radio spectrum calls for the development of novel spectrum-aware routing and scheduling algorithms. Most recent work has focused on traditional wireless networks. The effort is still at an early stage and their results cannot be directly applied to the space networks due to the unique characteristics such as large propagation delay, intermittent and asymmetric links, and limited storage space. Thus, further investigation is needed to understand how and where to apply cognitive and automation technologies to enable the network agility in space networks. To address this critical need, Intelligent Automation Inc. proposes a self-learning and adaptive communication system (s-LEAD) architecture for advanced space networks. The proposed technology builds on the cross-layer optimization framework to enable adaptive and self-optimizing cognitive radio networks capable of responding to environmental changes through joint control of spectrum management, physical-layer cooperation, and traditional networking functionalities. The key innovation of s-LEAD is to develop a reliable and adaptive decision making system with dynamic spectrum access (DSA) capability for hybrid satellite and ground networks with diverse traffic characteristics and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Our special focus is on how to enable situational awareness and self-adaptation with multiple objectives of throughput, spectrum utilization, and latency.","s-LEAD has great potential to reduce operation costs and enhance the reliability for the NASA missions. Due to the heterogeneous nature of network assets and the lack of autonomy, the developed solution can be applied to the NASA's efforts on the integration of its current agency networks. The potential customers of our solution include robotic and human missions at locations ranging from the near Earth (e.g., EO-1) to deep space (e.g., Mars exploration).","The proposed solution also has great potential in dynamic military applications. Some example applications include Air Force Airborne Networks, and Joint Tactical Radio System Ground Mobile Radio. It can also be applied into a variety of commercial applications. The proposed system provides new design guidelines for SDR system development and opens new market opportunities regarding spectrum awareness and cyber security in wireless networks.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Intelligence; Network Integration,Intelligent Communication Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Inc. proposes to advance the maturity of an innovative Spacecraft on Umbilical Line (SOUL) System suitable for a wide variety of applications of interest to NASA, DoD and commercial missions.  SOUL is a small (<10kg) robotic, self-propelled, self-navigating, autonomous vehicle equipped with a tool (e.g. gripper, light, camera etc.).  The SOUL vehicle/robot is attached via the umbilical line to a larger host spacecraft that stows it in a marsupial-like manner and communicates with ground. The umbilical delivers power and commands to SOUL from the host spacecraft.  Conceptually, the SOUL is a tool on the end of  tens of meters long robotic arm with infinite degrees of freedom (flexible umbilical) that can access locations unreachable by conventional robotic arms. The initial purpose of the USAF and Navy funded SOUL development was removal of large space debris (1000kg class).  SOUL has broad applicability including visual inspection and servicing of the host vehicle or other spacecraft and asteroid sample pickup.  Under this program, the development of the SOUL vehicle was extremely successful exceeding all goals.  The SOUL autonomously recognized simulated debris, estimated its pose relative to the target (fusing visible, IR images and IMU information), planned a path to the debris and executed the path and the touched the target with minimal momentum transfer.  The demonstrations were performed on large, low friction air table.  In the proposed effort Busek will focus on the development of the deployment/retrieval subsystem which is the least mature technology of the SOUL system.  Demonstration of the integrated system will be performed on the air table.  The ultimate goal is to make a flight worthy system and demonstrate it on the ISS.  The specific objective of the Phase 1 is to design, build and test the umbilical line winch and its control system designed on the basis of numerical model that predicts the umbilical line dynamic behavior.","Possible NASA applications include: 1) Inspection of ISS external systems reducing requirement for costly and dangerous manned EVAs.  2) Inspection of heat shield on reentry vehicles to prevent disasters such as Columbia.  Integrating SOUL into such vehicles for routine use prior to re-entry would greatly increase the crew safety; 3) Collect small samples from asteroid/comet surface without landing the larger mother ship/host.  If Philae was on an umbilical line or if the harpoons were on an umbilical, the Rosetta mission would have been greater success; 4) Create large deployable space system such as large antennas/apertures by coupling multiple satellites using the umbilical line (e.g. rotating formation for stability or artificial gravity); 5) Enhance manned the EVA capability: a) The SOUL robot could carry lights, bring tools, spare consumables (e.g. air tank) to the EVA astronaut working on the ISS or any other future ship; b) The SOUL robot could provide real time video of EVA activity from vantage points unreachable by either other astronauts or conventional robotic arms; c) The SOUL robot could provide auxiliary heat management system or even water vapor capture system reducing weight and power requirements for the EVA suit; d) The SOUL-like umbilical line could carry power and fiber optics comm link reducing reliance on EVA suit batteries while the fiber optics can relay high resolution video from the EVA suit camera.","Many of the NASA and non-NASA applications overlap and some were listed above.  Purely commercial applications are also numerous centering on the commercial GEO sat.  Examples include: 1) Self-inspection leading to on-orbit servicing/repair of host spacecraft.   This of particular interest to GEO Com sat owners/primes during deployment of appendages, anomaly diagnostic and aging assessment; 2) Inspection of other spacecraft with development proceeding to on-orbit servicing/repair and even refueling (when the umbilical contains a propellant transfer tube); 3) Autonomous operations enabling on-orbit assembly and repurposing as envisioned by DARPA's Phoenix Program; 4) Capture of large debris which could then be towed to disposal orbit by the larger host vehicle,  Small SOUL mass decreases the danger of additional debris produced by inadvertent collisions due to SOUL low momentum; 5) Function as a long boom with sensors on the end, (e.g. Langmuir probes, magnetometers etc.) enabling better measurements via greater distance from the large host vehicle causing less disturbance to local plasma/environment; 6) Assist in space situational awareness by sensing RF, presence of effluent molecules some distance away from the host etc; 7) Calibrate RF/radar antennas by measuring near-field pattern by flying the SOUL vehicle with the appropriate sensors in front of the antenna/aperture.","Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Deployment; Image Processing; Perception/Vision; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Teleoperation; Tethers","Human Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystem, Manipulation Subsystem, and Human System Interaction   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This performance gain is achieved through the use of computational imaging technology. Because the technology can be used from the deep UV to the IR, applications of the spectrometers include sensing modalities such as Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy(LIBS), Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The market advantages of the concept are its higher performance than current compact spectrometers, and lowercost, lighter weight, and smaller size as compared to high performance spectrometer systems.

Spectrometers for mineralogy that are compact, lightweight, and low power are listed as a priority for the long term time frame of 2023 and beyond, demonstrating the long term relevance of the proposed technology. The wide wavelength range over which the technology can be used, from the deep UV to the IR, further increases the wide range of current and future NASA programs to which the technology can be applied.","Users of spectrometers include academic, government, and industrial laboratories and research organizations.  Manufacturers of process control equipment and environmental sensors, among others, incorporate spectrometers into their products.

Optical mining is an approach to simultaneously excavating carbonaceous chondrite asteroid surfaces and driving water and other volatiles out of the excavated material and into an enclosing inflatable bag without the need for complex or impractical robotics.  In optical mining, highly concentrated sunlight is delivered to the surface of the asteroid through a mechanically simple but optically sophisticated system of reflective non-imaging optics. The highly concentrated optical energy ablates the surface in a controlled way analogous to how intense lasers can ablate surfaces  constantly exposing new material and forcing water out of the ablated material.  Optical mining is part of a mission concept that ICS Associates has developed called Apis (Asteroid Provided In-Situ Systems). Apis is a commercially viable approach to the extraction, processing, and delivery of water from asteroids to in-space assets. Mission system studies show that Apis can extract up to 100MT of water from an accessible near Earth asteroid and deliver it to Lunar Distant Retrograde Orbit (LDRO) based on the launch of just one modest sized spacecraft from a single Falcon 9 rocket. The Apis mission concept depends on the completion of the proposed SBIR work. In this Phase-1 SBIR we will develop a facility to simulate and demonstrate key aspects of optical mining to show the mission system feasibility of Apis and provide a breakthrough in ISRU and space transportation for NASA. We will do this by upgrading an existing xenon arc lamp and vacuum system and using the optical energy from the lamp to simulate optical mining on asteroid materials in vacuum.  We will perform experiments to validate the process by optically ablating the surfaces of meteorite samples and asteroid simulations under carefully controlled and observed conditions.","The proposed work will support NASA's plans for human exploration by providing mission consumables and propellant for all missions of the Evolvable Mars Campaign including: human exploration missions to Lunar Distant Retrograde Orbit (LDRO), human exploration missions to near Earth asteroids in their native orbits, exploration of the Moon, and exploration of Mars.  Completion of the proposed work demonstrating the physics and chemistry of optical mining will enable NASA to fly the extremely exciting ""Apis"" mission. Requiring only a modest-sized spacecraft launched to a low positive C3 compatible with a single Falcon 9 rocket, Apis is capable of providing NASA with propellant and mission consumables in cis-lunar space.  The proposed SBIR work will demonstrate a key aspect of the Apis mission, namely the process of ""Optical Mining"" to excavate asteroid surfaces by ablation, drive water from the ablated materials, collect the evolved water as ice in cold storage bags, and return up to 100MT (metric tonnes) of water to LDRO or other depot location.  Optical mining could also be used to extract the volatile materials from the target of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) and convert that material to consumables and propellant in cis-lunar space to support human exploration.","The proposed work is designed to create an industrial revolution in space in which propellant and other consumables for commercial processes in space are supplied from near Earth asteroids instead of from the surface of the Earth.  Our mission system studies show that such propellant, if minded from highly-accessible Near Earth Objects (NEOs) can be used to supply propellant for reusable solar thermal orbit transfer vehicles that fly on recirculating routes between LEO, GEO, and a propellant depot in LDRO.  These reusable solar thermal OTVs, which we call Worker Bees, more than double the effective throw capability of launch vehicles by eliminating the need for high energy upper stages and allowing rockets to launch their payloads to LEO instead of to high-energy transfer orbits.  The proposed Phase 1 SBIR will perform a critical proof of concept that enables this vision, creates a commercial market in space for asteroid mining products, and allows the development of commercial OTVs supplied from asteroid ISRU.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Conversion; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Distribution/Management; In Situ Manufacturing; Mirrors; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Space Transportation & Safety",Regolith ISRU for Mission Consumable Production   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Our team truly believes that the three zone method will allow NASA to focus more on the ""nearfield"" nature of the CFD flowfield (i.e. propulsion plumes with shocks and expansions) and less on requiring grid convergence studies for 2 to 20 body lengths in order to achieve proper ground signature predictions. Potential other NASA applications include the accurate prediction of a focused boom of an accelerating launch vehicle of a supersonic fighter jet. With commercial launches becoming more safe and commonplace (i.e. SpaceX and Orbital Sciences), one may expect closer proximity to inhabited zones in the future and therefore more accurate focused boom prediction. Finally, capsule reentry booms (i.e. Orion) will eventually need to be more accurately predicted as manned spaceflight becomes commonplace.","Ultimately, the primary non-NASA application will involve more accurate prediction of ""boom"" footprints of supersonic fighters being operated by Air-Forces around the world. Moreover, AFRL could use this technology for the design of its next generation fighters and bombers. Needless to say, when approved for export control (obviously only certain aspects of this technology could be), we will be able to commercialize the capability to numerous companies, including the prime airframers, and allied governments and their respective space agencies.","Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Quiet Performance   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

While the multiple CPU cores boost performance by operating in parallel, they also can operate redundantly in order to maximize tolerance to SEUs.  This approach requires a software framework to configure and operate the redundant system.  In this proposed effort, Innoflight will develop a Software Redundancy Framework (SRF) for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Multi-core System-on-Chip (SoC) Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  The SRF is an IP core on an FPGA and associated software modules offering an elegant suite of targeted mitigations for SEUs, thus enabling COTS hardware to bring its superior SWaP to demanding radiation environments for the first time.  We will examine the SRF: (a) initially with single-threaded user applications; (b) then with multithreaded applications; (c) testing with prototype hardware including under proton single event effects (SEE) testing; and (d) finally a potential flight demonstration on the ICE-Cap mission slated for launch in 2015.  At the end of Phase II, Innoflight will have a complete framework that is ready for implementation on operational space computing platforms","SRF enables the application of high-performance processors, when embedded in COTS FPGAs, in NASA missions that traditionally demanded radiation hard by design (RHBD) processors with their associated performance, power and cost.  A lower-cost compact flight computer, based on a multi-core SoC FPGA, and utilizing SRF provides Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) benefits, especially for deep space missions needing moderate radiation tolerance.These applications span the entire range of space missions from Deep Space all the way down to LEO environments where operational reliability requirements demand improved SEU tolerance.  There are currently a significant number of missions contemplating GTO, MEO and HEO orbits with small spacecraft for scientific, military and commercial applications that could benefit from the SRF.","Commercial ventures in deep space for asteroid mining and other potentially lucrative opportunities are highly motivated to leverage COTS electronics in their spacecraft designs and will be equally interested as NASA in SRF for enabling COTS FPGA utilization.  Commercial satellite communications (SATCOM) spacecraft traditionally use pedigree electronics but with the recent interest in constellations of hundreds of communication satellite in 5+ year LEO missions they will be interested in technologies that enable the COTS for SWaP-C benefits.  With ongoing Congressional budget pressures and interests in disaggregated and fractionated architectures the DoD and Intelligence Community will find interest and potential application of SRF to enable COTS FPGAs for longer LEO, GEO and possibly MEO missions as well.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Command & Control; Development Environments; Quality/Reliability; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)","Command, Data Handling, and Electronics   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

IFOS proposes to develop a compact, highly innovative Inertial Reference Measurement Unit (IRU) that pushes the state of the art in high accuracy performance from a FOG with drastically reduced optical and electronic package volumes. The proposed IRU is envisioned as a critical part of an Inertial Measurement System (IMU) to be prototyped in future phases of the project. The basic design features a novel, small volume, high performance FOG configuration, capable of providing high-end tactical grade and navigational grade performance from much smaller size units as compared with IMUs currently available. The proposed gyroscope is based on an innovative approach using a Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) coils that can be extended to shorter wavelength (SW) operation for even more drastic size and weight reductions while maintaining accuracy and low noise attributes at kHz bandwidths. While the optic unit is inherently radiation resistant, the project also aims to apply cutting-edge electronics packaging approaches that are compatible with radiation hard (RH) components. Phase I will focus on feasibility study of the PCF FOG concept, demonstration of critical components, performance/size tradeoffs and preliminary designs of FOG-based packages, leading to a prototype IRU to be designed and built in Phase II, where advanced designs for an IMU will also be developed.","Advancement of rate sensor components is essential to support navigation and attitude control systems for advanced NASA exploratory and satellite missions. The proposed high accuracy IFOS FOGs will have significantly reduced size and weight with ruggedized components designed to meet stringent radiation, vibration and thermal specifications. Anticipated benefits include the ability to perform high-end, challenging navigational functions using an IMU package that is smaller than anything currently available from even the most advanced state-of-the-art instruments. A robust, high performance, cost-effective gyroscope suitable for space-based operations will also have significant impact on demanding line-of-sight (LOS) stabilization for NASA applications that require spacecraft stabilized instrumentation platforms for long term space applications. As well as providing weight reduction, the miniaturization enabled by our optical fiber technology is key to diverse spin-off applications such as for sensor matrices in NASA's extra-vehicular and planetary exploration robots for manned and unmanned missions.","Applications range from rate sensors and gyros used in commercial avionics to navigational inertial reference and measurement units needed for commercial small satellites and landing spacecraft, to gas and oil applications such as measurement-while-drilling (MWD) deployed in horizontal directional drilling.  The proposed work will significantly benefit the commercial aviation industry as well as sensor arrays for medical applications and homeland security robotic disarming of bombs. Reducing the size, weight, power (and cost of these sensors and improving robustness against harsh environmental risk factors – all without loss of performance - is also critical for many advanced interceptor and satellite platforms that are of interest to DOD and advanced aerospace applications.","Attitude Determination & Control; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Inertial (see also Sensors); Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)","Guidance, Navigation and Control   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Current passive heat shields utilize boiloff vapors from liquid hydrogen (LH2) tanks to refrigerate and eliminate boiloff from liquid oxygen (LOX) tanks. Catalyzing the endothermic parahydrogen-orthohydrogen conversion is estimated to increase the refrigeration capacity of the hydrogen as much as 50% and effectively reduces the amount of hydrogen required to maintain zero boiloff of LOX. In this project, Ultramet will partner with the HYPER laboratory at WSU to synthesize, characterize, and compare ruthenium- and iron-based catalysts for optimal thermal properties and processing when applied to lightweight fiber blanket material for bulk application in passive heat shielding. In Phase I, a design matrix of catalysts will be characterized over a range of porosities and activities. Ultramet will perform surface area analysis of the catalyst granules prior to single-blind heat shielding tests in CHEF at the HYPER laboratory. In Phase II, the properties of the leading catalysts will be optimized for phase and porosity, the properties of the leading blanket material will be applied to a COMSOL modeling program already developed by the HYPER lab to design a prototype blanket, and a manufacturing plan will be developed. Potential Phase II and III teaming partners are United Launch Alliance (ULA) and Boeing, both of which have expressed interest in the technology.","The proposed catalytic heat exchanger can be used for passive heat shielding and catalytic pressurization on NASA spacecraft and propellant depots. Any vehicle employing LH2 in either space or terrestrial applications can benefit. Specifically, vapor-shielded stages such as Centaur, used on Delta IV, Atlas V, and potentially SLS, stand to benefit. Rocket engines incorporating regeneratively cooled combustion chambers, such as the RL-10, can incorporate this technology for decreased wall temperature. Promising near-term applications are parahydrogen-orthohydrogen conversion beds in hydrogen liquefiers and cryocoolers. The microstructure coupled with electromagnetic field varying will provide optimal thermal advantage to weight comparisons.

For some planned entry trajectories, the woven TPS is subjected to short duration, but extremely high heat flux levels.

These modules will be enabled by Vescent's proprietary and unprecedented electro-optic (EO), non-mechanical laser beamsteerers (up to a 120o x 120o field-of-view possible).  Eliminating all moving parts will dramatically reduce SWaP and cost, increase lifetime and reliability, and simplify the system design of lasercom modules.  High bandwidth communication links are needed between satellites and ground stations, inter-satellite, and from ground based rovers to satellites.  One possible lasercom module will fit within a few cubic inch volume, require less than 1 watt of power and be able to provide ground station tracking (including orbital motion over wide angles and jitter correction) with no moving parts. As advanced scientific instruments burden data loads and spacecraft payloads become increasingly valuable, to keep the information flowing becomes even more challenging.  Providing a solution to this problem is the focus of this effort.","This effort is relevant to numerous upcoming NASA missions.  For example, as an add-on to the laser communications relay demonstration (LCRD) mission MiLC could be used for demonstrating a LEO-T (ISS) direct-to-ground capability that would fly in 2019.  A MiLC mission aboard the ISS could collect data from a GEO satellite and then relay the data to a ground station.  Wide angle EO beamsteering would enable longer tracking and therefore longer link times.  In phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of LEO-to-ground data-rates > 4 Gbps with a path to 10 Gbps.  MiLC is also relevant to NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) office.  For example, MiLC could be incorporated into an Integrated Radio and Optical Communications (iROC) demonstration flight circa 2020.  Furthermore, the low SWaP and cost of MiLC could dramatically increase the downlink data rates from miniature satellites such as cube-sats.  Lasercom on cube-sats or other miniature satellites could enable ""on-demand"" distributed networks of numerous down-link points, which would mitigate weather obscurants. This would be a new way of imagining the lasercom ""network-in-the-sky"".Finally, MiLC could be used as a surface communications asset such as the 2020 rover application wherein it could provide a high bandwidth optical uplink from the rover to the Mars orbiter.","The ultra-compact, low power, and ultimately low cost optical communication systems proposed here have numerous commercial applications.

When deployed, the flexible composite reflector snaps back into the precision parabolic shape to provide communication.Decades of research have made GATR Technologies expert in the engineering of large membrane concentrator systems.  Its ground-based antennas are already revolutionizing portability in satellite communications.  Innovation is required only to leverage this reflector expertise into a unique concentrator system adapted for CubeSat platforms and the orbiting space environment.The work of this SBIR will specifically address solutions to the stowing, deployment, and environmental design challenges of producing an antenna module for CubeSats.  To that end, GATR will be teaming with the COSMIAC Research Center at the University of New Mexico.  COSMIAC has extensive spaceflight research and design experience.  Its flight heritage includes successful missions currently in orbit.GATR's designs yield flexible parabolic reflectors that perform equivalently to rigid parabolic reflectors.  The CubeSats equipped with large aperture antennas will transmit highly focused signal with increased link gain without drawing additional power from the spacecraft bus. This gain is especially noteworthy compared to the performance of the small patch antennas currently employed on CubeSats.  A large aperture parabolic dish will significantly improve transmission data rates for communication applications or improve spatial resolution for radiometry applications.This SBIR will conclude with a demonstration of both the flexible antenna and a prototype deployment mechanism.  The demonstration will be planned to highlight the function and performance that will eventually come to define a common CubeSat high gain antenna module.   The design and testing that constitute the work of this SBIR will be conducted to achieve success in this singular objective.","Already, the future for Earth Observation Satellites in low Earth orbits, especially modular CubeSats, is exploding with opportunities.  As these opportunities become missions, the total cost of launch and maintaining orbiting  assets will continue to decrease.  However, planned exploitations of this CubeSat-filled future are already straining at the data limits imposed by limited ground station access and low transceiver power. The direct applications for a stock CubeSat antenna module with a deployable, high gain dish are as immediately diverse as these exploding CubeSat opportunities. One such opportunity, an Earth Observation adaptation of NASA's iSAT CubeSat for the Army, is already becoming a concrete opportunity. Beyond the immediate applications for RF communication, applications of GATR collapsible antenna technology could include modular and scattered interferometric radar systems.","An Army iSAT application is only one example of an emerging military mission archetype with the goal of providing real time ""over the horizon"" imaging to warfighters in theater.  As a manufacturer of highly portable ground stations, GATR is already frequently working with the stakeholders for the programs reaching for this goal, and is poised to help shape the payload planning for their spacecraft platforms.Growth in commercial exploitation of satellite imagery is no less exciting.

The LoadPath High heat flux Enhanced Acquisition and Transport system for Small spacecraft (HEATS) is an innovative, passive, two-phase thermal transport system that will help realize these missions of tomorrow. Unlike state-of-the-art thermal transport systems (e.g. heat pipes and loop heat pipes), our approach can mitigate higher heat loads and fluxes at a lower cost and mass while adapting to a wider-range of heat source/sink configurations.","The immediate targeted NASA applications are enabling smaller and lower cost spacecraft capable of conducting valuable scientific measurements with reduced mass and costs. Early development will also target exploration missions that are at or near the surface of planets such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus. HEATS will facilitate these applications because of is high heat load and flux mitigation, ability to maintain components within a specified temperature range, adaptability and reconfigurability to new missions or a wide-range of heat source/sink configurations, low system cost, and low mass.  The proposed technology impacts a broad array of NASA missions because it will benefit most, if not all, unmanned NASA missions requiring TCS design. The National Research Council Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board identified NASA's top technical challenges and highest priority technologies across all 14 NASA space technology roadmaps. Based on their study, thermal control systems are a key, enabling technology that contributes to the advancement of many of the top technical challenges and the highest priority technologies.","Similarly to NASA unmanned missions, HEATS will be of interest to other Government spacecraft procuring agencies such as the Air Force, Navy, National Reconnaissance Office, and Operationally Responsive Space Office; as well as, prime contractor spacecraft developers such as ATK, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Raytheon. In addition to satellite applications, HEATS will be valuable to thermal management applications where performance, size, and weight are important concerns.","Active Systems; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Distribution/Management; Heat Exchange; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Passive Systems; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",Thermal Control Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Box 757, Dublin, VA 24084 - 0757",(540) 633-1424,3,5,"NASA has identified a need in Sub-topic H11.01 for advanced radiation-shielding technologies using in situ resources, such as regolith, to protect humans from the hazards of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) during extra-terrestrial missions.  The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons.  International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with The College of William and Mary, proposes the use of regolith combined with hydrogenous polymers to develop radiation-shielding structural materials for habitats.  The program Technical Objectives include selection of hydrogenous polymer binders for use in regolith radiation-shielding materials, fabrication of polymer-regolith specimens designed to shield against galactic cosmic radiation species and to act as structural components in habitats, and acquisition of test data to determine key parameters for the development of optimal radiation-shielding regolith-composite materials.  The innovation is the development of polymer-regolith composites for structural radiation-shielding materials to protect humans on deep-space missions.  The anticipated result is the creation of composite materials that combines in situ resource utilization (ISRU), i.e. regolith, with a hydrogenous polymeric matrix.  Additives, such as boron, could be included to enhance absorption of neutrons generated by interactions of GCR and SPE particles with shielding materials.  The proposed composites have multifunctional properties of radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, and structural integrity to permit use in habitats.","The proposed multifunctional high-performance polymers will find application in NASA missions in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from space hazards, including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing structural components for habitats.  It is expected that these polymer-regolith composite systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used for human habitats.","Multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial sector in reducing collateral damage from heavy charged particles emerging as a therapeutic approach in nuclear medicine.  The Departments of Defense and of Homeland Security will find applications that include protection of soldiers, first responders and emergency medical personnel against high energy gamma radiation and neutrons resulting from so-called dirty bombs as well as from hazards brought about through accidental release of radiological materials.",Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nanomaterials; Polymers; Processing Methods; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Structures,Radiation Shielding Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

On manned aircraft, recovery from an upset condition relies on the skill and training of an expert pilot. Due to reduced situational awareness and delays introduced by the command and control link, it is unlikely that a remote UAS operator will be able to serve this function. An advanced system capable of perception, cognition, and decision making is necessary to replace the need for an operator with upset recovery expertise and to mitigate the LOC risk on UAS. Barron Associates has recently developed a two-stage architecture that generates safe and effective recovery maneuvers for a large set of upset conditions including full stall and fully-developed spin modes.  The proposed research will design an upset detection system and integrate the system with the existing two-stage recovery architecture to yield a comprehensive autonomous upset recovery system. The decision about when to activate each stage of a recovery is difficult to make at design-time due to insufficient aerodynamic data and the inability to model all of the off-nominal precipitating factors that cause upsets. The proposed upset detection system does not rely on design-time characterization; instead, a rigorous statistical testing framework combines numerous pieces of information including vehicle attitude, rotational rate, and controller performance to answer the question: Has an upset occurred? Key Phase I goals include: upset detection algorithm development, integration of upset detection with existing recovery architecture, evaluation of system performance in simulation, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop demonstration using a commercially available autopilot.","NASA research programs with a focus on achieving multi-vehicle operation and autonomous operation with less human oversight are application areas that directly benefit from the proposed system.The system directly addresses the Integrated Aviation Systems Program's focus area of ""high level machine perception, cognition, and decision making"" while also supporting the focus area of enabling ""humans to operate multiple UAS with minimal oversight.""  Specifically, the system will enable UASs to make intelligent decisions about the safety of their current flight condition and what, if any, corrective action should be taken. This approach imparts high level perception, cognition, and decision making capabilities to the UAS reducing the need for close supervision by a human operator. In addition, considering its potential role in ""reducing flight risk in areas of attitude and energy aircraft state awareness"", the system also addresses the interests of the Real-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance (RSSA) research area of the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP).","In order to safely fulfill their rolls in government and commercial sectors, UAS will need to meet performance expectations for mission completion, reliable operation, and safe coexistence with other aircraft in the national airspace. The proposed system will address this need and increase the reliability, safety and autonomy of a UAS. Government agency UAS applications include: (1) Department of Defense military and intelligence-gathering operations, (2) FBI and local law-enforcement operations in urban areas, and (3) Department of the Interior land management oversight. In the commercial sector, applications include the use of UAS for delivery, remote inspection, and photography. The proposed system will interface with a popular open-source auto-pilot software suite providing direct access to a significant market of current SUAS users. Following successful completion of the research plan, the proposed system can be licensed to manufacturers of UAS airframes and autopilots.

Newer and more complex integrated electronics add to mission capability but also produce more waste heat.  Traditional methods of metal heat pipes or structures have issues when scaling to accommodate higher thermal loads, especially in the vacuum and extreme conditions of space.  Eotron has developed a 3D silicon front end to a fluid pump loop cooling system that offers improved performance in a compact light-weight form factor.  The proposed Silicon Cold Plate makes direct contact with high thermal flux devices and removes waste heat through a series of fluid channels internal to the silicon.  The Silicon Plate is bonded to the system PCB at thermal Via points to remove additional heat and provide electrical and system connection to other electronic components.  Fluid, moving through silicon's internal channels is then moved to another area for thermal radiation by a system pump.In this proposal, the company outlines its plans to design, fabricate and test a prototype to prove its capability to remove a typical high thermal load from a compact system along with basic reliability testing on the fluid system.  Silicon's advantages of light-weight, high thermal conductivity and non-reactive nature to liquids make it ideal for this application.","Potential NASA Commercial Applications (?)In addition to CubeSat/SmallSat applications, this technology is suitable for removal of waste heat in advanced electronic systems where high system performance is required in a compact format or where environmental conditions prohibit the use of larger conventional thermal management systems.

Phase 1 feasibility criteria for proposed novel inoculum are removal of 85% of organic carbon and 85% conversion of ammonium (50% oxidized to nitrogen gas and remaining 50% converted to nitrite/nitrate) with a startup time of less than 45 days.PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY: Properly configured biological wastewater systems can treat wastewater containing high organic carbon and nitrogen and produce a high quality effluent using minimal consumables.  However, such systems can be difficult to startup rapidly and reliably.  Developing a reliable inoculum to permit rapid startup of biological wastewater systems that treat high levels of organics and nitrogen would make such treatment viable.PLAN/PROCESS OUTLINE: Two types of new, novel inocula will be developed, tailored to treat wastewater with high organic carbon and nitrogen.  One inoculum will use live cultures stored dormant for 45 days before being used to start the reactor.  The second inoculum will use lyophilized cultures stored for 45 days before being used to start the reactor.  Two reactors will be used to test each inoculum; with one of the two reactors receiving inoculum added to the wastewater and the other reactor receiving inoculum embedded in a biofilm scaffold designed to promote growth and attachment of the organisms.BENEFITS: Phase 2 target criteria are development of an inoculum capable of removing 95% of organic carbon, and 95% conversion of ammonium (75% removed as nitrogen gas and remaining 25% converted to nitrite/nitrate) when treating ersatz EPB wastewater with a startup time of less than 15 days.","The primary NASA application for the proposed inoculum is the capability of rapidly and reliably starting up a biological wastewater system.  This innovative inoculum will ultimately be capable of shortening the start up time of a wastewater treatment system to 15 days while enabling the to plant to remove high levels of organic carbon and nitrogen.  It may be possible to use the inoculum to remotely start a wastewater treatment system, thus permitting the system to be operational at the time of occupancy of the station.A secondary application of the inoculum is for use as a backup in the event of failure of the wastewater system.  This capability would be useful in cases of toxic shock, equipment failure, operator error, etc.Another application of the inoculum is its use as a standardized base to ensure reliable, uniform treatment.  Use of a standard inoculum would lessen variability during treatment and simplify process control.A standard inoculum would permit different researchers to better compare research results.  It would also simplify testing potential new wastewater constituents to determine how they may affect treatment","Currently the wastewater treatment industry is being revolutionized by a new type of treatment that can remove nitrogen from wastewater at less than half the present cost. The combination of simultaneous nitrification/denitrification (SND) coupled with deammonification has moved out of the research phase and is being implemented in plants throughout the world with the Blue Plains WWTP in Washington, DC being one of the early adopters.  Although this technology is starting to be used, it is still in its infancy with less than 50 full-scale installations worldwide. Unfortunately, one of the primary organisms, anammox, necessary for this type of treatment has an extremely slow growth rate and it can take up to a year to start up a plant unless it receives seed from another plant.  Even with seeding, plants generally take 50 days or more to start.  Developing an inoculum to rapidly and reliably start up a mixed SND/deammonification system has great commercial possibilities.  The Chesapeake Bay watershed is an excellent example of the possible economic potential of this new technology.  The Bay's watershed has 539 treatment plants that are under or are coming under mandate to remove nitrogen.  The estimated cost for nitrogen removal in 2002 was $8.2 billion for these plants. Development of a process to rapidly and reliably start up mixed SND/deammonification plants has the potential to be extremely profitable and be the source of significant environmental improvement.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Waste Storage/Treatment",Bioregenerative Technologies for Life Support   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

MON-25, with 25% of nitric oxide (NO) and 75% nitrogen tetroxide (NTO, N2O4), allows lowering the oxidizer freezing point to -55 C, which is a close match to that of the fuel, MMH (which is around -51 C). While toxic, this propellant combination is hypergolic and allows operations over a wide range of temperatures, particularly in extremely cold environments as those envisioned for many future missions. The introduction of a micropump in the propulsion system provides many benefits, including the elimination of the pressurization systems; lighter, cheaper, and conformal tanks; improved system packaging; removal of propellant cross-contamination in the pressurization system; and long term storage for extended duration missions (since the loss of helium is no longer a concern). Under a Phase I SBIR, Flight Works Inc. is prepared to develop and characterize a micropump suitable for both MMH and MON-25, initially sized for 22-30 N (5-7 lbf) class thrusters with approximately 2.5 MPa (365 psi) inlet pressure, with the goal of demonstrating the technology with pump-fed MMH/MON-25 hot fire tests by the end of Phase II.","The technology offers the means of drastically reducing the mass, complexity and cost of space propulsion systems to be used in over a wider range of temperatures than what is currently available. The propellant combination MMH/MON-25 allows for an increased operational temperature range, decreasing it to close to -50 C. With the addition of a micropump also able to operate at these temperatures, the technology allows eliminating the propulsion pressurization system altogether and transform it into a low-pressure, low cost, more compact and lighter system while allowing compact, high performance thrusters. As such it has applications in any missions, manned or unmanned, with propulsion needs, particularly where it is desired to operate the propulsion system over a wider range of temperatures. These include cargo and crew capsules as well as most other spacecraft. The technology, while developed for MON-25 and MMH, could equivalently be applied to NTO which broadens even more the range of potential applications.Flight Work's strategy is to work closely with other component manufacturers and system integrators during the development phases so as to seamlessly transfer the technology into operational products, at NASA or elsewhere.","The technology is applicable to propulsion systems in general, such as those on commercial spacecraft (e.g. telecommunications market), for DoD spacecraft and missiles including in Divert Attitude Control Systems, and to on-orbit propellant management.","Attitude Determination & Control; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine",Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In the current state of the art in industrial practice, there is no integration of the NDE data into design data, NDE models, and structural integrity models for a holistic structural capability assessment. Our proposal responds to these issues described in the subtopic H13.01, Advanced NDE Modeling and Analysis.TRI/Austin, Iowa State University's Center for Nondestructive Evaluation (CNDE), and Computational Tools are teaming to develop a coherent set of tools for NDE and SHM data: the NDEToolbox™. The significance of the innovations are that these sets of tools enable ""big data"" methods to be applied to NDE, and to integrate NDE within the digital thread of design, manufacturing, and operation of large composite structures for space and aerospace applications.","The two main categories of NASA applications are in support of in house R&D, and in the inspection of structures for NASA applications by NASA or its suppliers. Simple file management does not support contextual searching or Big Data tools, and the Databrowse component of the NDEToolbox™ will answer that problem. HDF5 formatting will enable storage of data that outlasts proprietary vendor formats, while supporting advanced tools like Databrowse and optimized routines for reading, writing, and searching in Python, the language of NDEToolbox™. Existing databases or network storage facilities can be accommodated without changes.The implementation of NDEToolbox™ in Python is by definition and by our choice an open source implementation. The plug-in architecture provides a simple path for many customizations. The basic, everyday needs of opening, viewing, processing NDE data will be at hand and will be open for the researcher to understand and extend as needed.","We envision three main categories of users for the NDEToolbox™ outside of NASA. The first category is universities. University laboratories like those at CNDE suffer from the same issues of data management and the need to have access to their data for research purposes. By making NDEToolbox™ open source and easily extended, we hope to gain traction in the university community and to benefit from contributions of additional technology back to the NDEToolbox™. Other commercial laboratories and government R&D laboratories share many of the same needs as NASA and can similarly benefit. Finally, we do see the possibility for commercial implementations of specialized sets of algorithms, such as those being developed by Computational Tools and TRI/Austin for suppliers to the F-35 program.","Air Transportation & Safety; Composites; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",Advanced NDE Modeling and Analysis   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

(SSI), in collaboration with Busek Co. Inc., proposes the development of an Electrospray Propulsion Engineering Toolkit (ESPET).  The innovation is a  multi-scale model that extends experimental and detailed high-level physics characterization of microfluidic components to full-scale ESP microfluidic network performance through an engineering tool with a central database of critical microfluidic properties.  The tool is designed to allow ESP system engineers to efficiently narrow down the system component trade space and thereby substantially reduce the development time of advanced ESP systems.  The physics underlying a microfluidic network of an ESP system covers multiple scale lengths that render the application of high-level CFD or atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over the entire system impractical.  ESPET takes an engineering model approach that breaks the ESP system down into multiple microfluidic components or domains that can be described by analytical microfluidic solutions and specific parameters of the domain.  The Phase I effort consists of a proof-of-principle of ESPET on the microfluidics of the Busek 100 micro Newton class ionic liquid ESP system.  In Phase II, full development of ESPET for arbitrary designs will occur, including construction of the microfluidics properties database.","For NASA to gain high-value science from SmallSat technology requires lightweight, miniaturized, precision impulse bit, fuel efficient propulsion systems that extend mission time and greatly enhance SmallSat utility.  While a broad range of chemical and EP systems are under consideration for SmallSat thrusters, micro-fabricated electrospray (ESP) arrays have been clearly identified as an emerging technology for thruster attitude control as well as delta-v maneuvers, with scalability that also makes them attractive for applications on larger spacecraft.   ESPET will accelerate the development of ESP systems that meet NASA requirements.  ESPET will provide NASA with a tool for quick comparison of various fuels and thruster configurations.  It will provide designers with estimates of thruster fuel and power efficiency, stability of output thrust, and potential for contamination effects.  It will also enable them to develop accurate thruster control systems.","SmallSat technology is bringing the space vehicle deployment cost within reach of a much larger market including small commercial enterprises like Cosmogia Inc.'s Dove-2 remote sensing mission for NOAA, research and educational initiatives like University of Florida's SwampSat demonstrator, and developing countries without a major space program, such as Poland's BRITE-PL for celestial observations.  As the ESP technology becomes more generally available and new applications are envisioned, engineering software tools like ESPET will be essential to tailoring the thruster design to mission requirements.

The module, called TOMO (Toolkit for Optimization Metrics Overlay) is a large-scale optimization model that computes trajectories of aircraft under Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) that optimize system performance under various objectives such as delays, fuel burn, and environmental impacts.  The toolkit is designed to be used either in shadow mode or in post-operations analysis.  This capability within SMART NAS would allow a scenario's performance to be normalized against an achievable best case and will facilitate a meaningful comparison of the performance of scenarios with different types of demand, weather, and operating constraints.  TOMO will also feature a ""simultaneous playback"" mode, in which a user can simultaneously compare the simulated scenario with an optimized version for each potential objective.TOMO is based on a new class of algorithms for solving large-scale TFM problems by separating TFM optimization into two problems---a master problem that checks for capacity violations and allocates resources to competing aircraft, and a sub-problem solved by each individual aircraft that generates 4-d trajectories for each flight. The master problem exchanges dual prices that signal congestion across ATC resources to guide the sub-problems to an optimal solution.  This ""agent-based"" optimization approach is well-suited to be used within a large-scale agent-based simulation framework.","The core application of the work in this project will be to further NASA's goals to enable the testing of advanced concepts within SMART NAS prior to deployment.  If successful, it is envisioned that TOMO will provide SMART NAS users metrics that would allow cleaner comparisons across scenarios, speeding up the process of evaluating different concepts.In the short term, TOMO could be deployed within a system such as FACET to provide optimization-based metrics for existing scenario simulations.","TOMO could directly be applicable within EUROCONTROL's simulation environment ESCAPE or to assist with near-term metrics calculation within the FAA.

This platform will facilitate safe experimentation in space with colloidal samples at high voltages. E-GRID will be comprised of three components: the experiment module, which houses the colloidal sample and electrodes; the high voltage safety tether, which provides three levels of safety interlocks; and the high voltage amplifier/function generator. Techshot has been involved in the development of numerous Advanced Colloidal Experiment modules designed to perform mixing and temperature control tasks. In the development of these modules, discussions with researchers revealed a common need: a high voltage source and platform to perform colloid assembly and dielectrophoresis experiments. The majority of experimentation has been performed in ground based laboratories, with the exception of a few microgravity experiments aboard parabolic-flight vehicles. This has substantially limited achievable science.E-GRID is a direct response to this need. To perform these experiments, a high voltage amplifier and function generator capable of producing sinusoids and square waves with amplitudes as high as 10kV and frequencies ranging between DC and 100kHz are required. Achieving this in space is a substantial engineering task. Fortunately, Techshot has exceptional experience with high voltage safety, which can be applied to this project. Our Bone Densitometer safely operates aboard ISS using an 80kV Crockcroft-Walton Generator.We propose to space-qualify a commercial off-the-shelf amplifier/generator and pair it with a previously-developed Techshot experiment module. The experiment module is designed to work with the Techshot Dynamic Microscope Stage, which provides power, illumination, and communication to the experiment module when it is installed in Techshot's Mic-E (Microscope-EXPRESS) or the Light Microscopy Module.","The E-GRID platform is being developed as an enabling device for conducting microgravity research aboard the ISS.  Beginning first as an application for NASA mission programs, Techshot will have developed a unique device capable of safely performing high-voltage investigator-initiated experimentation on colloidal samples in space. Therefore, the initial targeted application of the proposed innovation is an offering of both the equipment and services associated with flight hardware and integration activities, which are highly desired by NASA-funded scientists. Last year, Techshot began negotiating, and expects to soon execute, an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with NASA to enable the Government to lease (as needed) a wide variety of our ""professional grade"" flight hardware. Techshot will invest in the E-GRID platform by building a technology demonstrator with internal funds. This new business model is expected be very attractive to NASA since it eliminates the Agency's upfront risk for flight hardware development, and more importantly, it reduces NASA's cost of ongoing maintenance and upkeep of the flight hardware - for the life of the equipment. Under this new entrepreneurial venture, Techshot will investing even more to develop a full complement of enabling flight research equipment and integrate and qualify them for ISS. Overall, this should result in a profitable model for Techshot and significant cost savings for NASA.","There are three potential levels of targeted applications:  (1) serving the needs of commercial ISS scientists, (2) assisting these scientists in producing data for novel microstructured materials, and (3) low-gravity manufacturing of high-value finished goods. The application of the results of colloid research in space – to important terrestrial uses of novel nanostructured and microstructered materials in manufacturing, electronics and biomedicine – is the target of the commercial materials developers. Techshot expects to support the needs of private sector customers desiring to conduct cutting edge research with the proposed E-GRID technology.  Recently, we met with researchers from Procter & Gamble, who previously have conducted flight experiments with colloids and have a keen interest in advancing several of their consumer products by learning more about how colloidal materials behave in microgravity. This could give rise to improvements in the composition and manufacture of their products, and prove to be valuable financially to the company. We also talked about the potential need for mass producing relatively small quantities of some unique materials that can be produced only in space, more than likely under a scenario where both the raw and high-value finished goods are transported by commercially contracted space transportation vehicles.","Active Systems; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Cables/Fittings; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Conversion; Fluids; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Medical; Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids",International Space Station (ISS) Utilization   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To achieve this high Isp, NTP reactors must operate at extremely high temperatures (i.e., >2400K) for long periods of time.  However, many of the best materials for some reactor components (i.e., support rods, control drums, and the reflector) cannot operate at these high temperatures.  Therefore, high temperature insulators that are chemically inert, neutronically acceptable, and structurally stable are desired.   The Rover and Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) program identified zirconium carbide (ZrC) as a leading candidate for NTP insulator materials.  However, the inherent brittleness and high melting temperature of ZrC make fabrication of complex components such as long, hexagonal tie-tubes extremely difficult.  Recently, advanced Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) forming techniques have been developed for producing near-net-shape components from Ultra High Temperature Ceramic (UHTC) materials such as tantalum carbide (TaC) and hafnium carbide (HfC).  Building on this success, advanced VPS processing techniques will be developed for producing long, hexagonal ZrC based tie-tube support rods for NTP.","NASA applications that would directly benefit from this technology include Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP).  Initial NTP systems will have specific impulses roughly twice that of the best chemical systems, i.e., reduced propellant requirements and/or reduced trip time.  The proposed Phase I and Phase II efforts would greatly assist NASA with achieving the promise of NTP and NEP.  Potential NASA missions include rapid robotic exploration missions throughout the solar system and piloted missions to Mars and other destinations such as near earth asteroids.","Commercial sectors that will benefit from this technology include medical, power generation, electronics, defense, aerospace, chemicals, and corrosion protection.

While not the only weather factor, one of the more important factors is wind, specifically wind shifts. Every morning the runway configuration for an airport is set based on the expected dominant wind flow across the area in order to maximize the efficiency of the terminal area. If the wind does not change direction over the course of the day, the airport is able operate at its optimum level, barring any other impactful weather event. If the wind does shift its direction, a change in the airport's runway configuration is required. This decision of when to change the runway configuration, however, is not always easy, and often times it can be a difficult and sometimes costly one. If the configuration of the runway is changed too late or too early in relation to the time of the wind shift, the throughput at the airport will decrease. To support this decision, a wind shift detection model is proposed. This model will utilize operational weather products, including the Localized Aviation MOS Product (LAMP) and the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), to produce a probabilistic estimate of when a wind shift is expected to occur. By automating the process of detecting wind shifts, it improves the efficiency of the airport by allowing airport managers to focus on configuring the airport rather than when the wind shift will occur. To determine the accuracy and feasibility of the model for use in real-time operations, it will be tested at number of airports around the NAS, specifically for historical scenarios when an unexpected wind shift negatively impacted operations. Phase II will look at adding a live weather data feed to the, incorporating traffic data, as well as integrating the model within the Airport Runway Configuration Management (ARCM) concept.","Upon successful completion of this Phase I SBIR, the most appropriate application of the Wind Shift Detection Model, will be further research on ATM operational improvements. Specifically, the FAA's Surface Trajectory Based Operations project is currently evaluating the Airport Runway Configuration Management (ARCM) concept, a decision support tool for optimizing runway configuration plans. Though wind is just one aspect of the ARCM concept, it is a significant one. By integrating the wind shift detection model with the ARCM concept, more accurate airport configuration recommendations will be able to be produced. Additionally, with the Wind Shift Detection Model able to provide an automated translation of weather forecasts, it directly supports the Airport Arrival Rate (AAR) Decision Support (AARDS) capability included in the Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATM-T) Work Package 4 (WP4).","The successful development and implementation of the Wind Shift Detection model can provide useful information to airlines and other flight operators about potential airport configuration changes. This will allow dispatchers to proactively file flight plans for aircraft account for the anticipated change in active runways. Additionally, this research will result in innovative techniques and methods to automatically translate weather forecasts into interpretable information.

The required panels are very large, which makes them challenging to launch, deploy, support, and move.

In response, we propose to develop an ultra-compact heat rejection system for use on Mars and other planets and moons with atmospheric gas.  This system will rely on forced convection rather than radiation heat transfer.  It will decrease power system size and mass dramatically, which will make FSP more affordable and practical.  Creare is well suited to succeed because we have a long history developing advanced turbomachines, heat exchangers, and thermal systems for challenging spaceflight applications.

These measurements can be used to validate models and ultimately optimize heat shield design to reduce weight while maintaining sufficient safety margins.  The concept has two components: 1) specially designed heat shield plug(s) and 2) a remote spectral sensor.  First, the custom heat shield plug will have trace amounts of different indicator materials that are released as pyrolysis/ablation progresses into the heat shield.  Using different indicator materials at different depths allows the spectral sensor to detect when each layer is releasing the materials, providing a measure of both total recession depth and ablation rates.  Using multiple plugs (each with different indicator material layers) allows a single spectral sensor to detect when each trace material is released into the flowfield.  In this way, the spectral signature uniquely identifies the level of recession at the different spatial locations. The spectral sensor can either be located on the capsule viewing aft into the wake or located on a remote airborne platform tracking the capsule reentry.  Each sensor location has its benefits and drawbacks.If the proposed concept is proven successful, NASA will have a minimally invasive heat shield recession diagnostic using onboard or remote spectral sensors. The concept will allow NASA to measure heat recession rates during all phases of reentry which will be especially useful for multiple reentry (skip trajectories) and differentiating recession levels for each reentry.Phase-I will utilize existing high fidelity models to predict signature levels and signal to noise ratio (SNR).  Phase-I will also involve limited arc jet tests of doped Avcoat heat shield samples.  During Phase-II, we will conduct more extensive arc jet testing to correlate spectral signatures with actual recession/pyrolysis.","NASA is in the process of improving heat shield design either through the use of new heat shield materials or by reducing the thickness of existing heat shields using conventional materials.  Currently, NASA heat shield predictive models are not reliably consistent with observed measurements.  The proposed concept will provide time-resolved recession measurements that can be used for model validation (both during arc jet test and flight tests).  With validated predictive models, NASA can optimize the heat shield design for expected reentry conditions.Additionally, reliable onboard real-time recession measurements could possibly be used to identify localized excessive recession.  This diagnostic could be integrated with capsule flight control system to orient the vehicle such as to reduce heating loads in the damaged area.  Furthermore, this technology could be used to monitor re-entry events of planetary and lunar landers/probes whose heat shields cannot be physically inspected post-entry.","Commercial and DoD applications also exist.  For instance, SpaceX and Blue Origin are pursuing capsule reentry capabilities.  Currently, SpaceX is focusing on reentries from low earth orbits where heating rates are low.  However, SpaceX is also investigating Mars missions where heat rates will require a much different heat shield design.  SpaceX will likely conduct Mars-like entry conditions using Earth reentry missions.  The use of non-intrusive heat shield recession diagnostics could be utilized to provide time-resolved heat ablation during all phases of reentry.  This will allow SpaceX to validate their heat shield recession models under higher heating rates.","Diagnostics/Prognostics; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Radiometric; Simulation & Modeling; Ultraviolet; Verification/Validation Tools; Visible","Ablative Thermal Protection Systems Technologies, Sensors and NDE Methods   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The environmental volatility of these locations is extreme, yet the fiscal challenges to explore these remote celestial landmarks suggests that traditional support systems and spacecraft architecture are not available and only through the development of more environmentally robust and survivable subsystems can these exploration goals be achieved. Large temperature swings are commonplace in these environments and seeing extreme cold environments of -180 degrees C or beyond can be expected at the surface of asteroids, comets, the moon, and Titan.  While the objective is to gather science, NASA's spacecraft and probes need to have lightweight, compact, smart, radiation tolerant, motion control power electronics that enable scientific discovery and maximize the data returned during what are often very small windows of opportunity.   The Dual Axis Controller for Extreme Environments (DACEE) addresses these challenges for future remote space exploration.  Leveraging almost a decade in the area of architecting low temperature operating electronics and mechanisms for programs like MUSES-CN and MSL's cold actuator electronics technology development program, Greg Levanas will design a dual brushless/stepper, 30V, 3A motor drive system inclusive of a RS-485 communication channel and capable of delivering moderate health status including onboard voltages, current and temperature.  By leveraging primarily 3.3V/5V CMOS 100krad tolerant elements, the DACEE will fit a compact form factor of approximately 2""x3""x0.5"".  This system will be able to start up from cold soak at -180 degrees C and survive operation thru  +100 degrees C.The Phase I activity will conclude with a design, parts list, build documentation and analysis for an article ready to be produced and tested as part of a Phase II activity.","The applications for the DACEE within NASA's exploration roadmap are numerous.  While each investigation has its own unique observation instrumentation needs, the operations contained within those instruments share commonality.  For operations which adjust lenses, open covers, pan and tilt, deploy hinges, etc., a stepper or brushless motion control drive capable of delivering between to 1-3 amps @ ~30V covers a broad spectrum of applications.  Coupled with the benefits of small form factor and low power means the DACEE can be mounted in or near the instrumentation itself simplifying system level interfacing and control needs.  With an expanded operational thermal range the DACEE preserves valuable spacecraft resources by not consuming excess power for heaters or requiring extra mass for protection.The DACEE can operate on weather balloons where temperatures tend to become very cold and challenge typical electronic operational ranges.  The DACEE can also be operated in in-situ operations for instruments that may be deployed by future Mars rovers.  Again the small size is conducive for space station observatories that need to perform scanning and tracking operations.","Outside of NASA's interest, creating a low power, small form factor dual axis controller is very attractive.

The SVFOC is based on proven electrolyzer technology demonstrated at Giner and delivers a continuous stream of dry O2 with a highly controllable oxygen pressure (0-3600 psig) by feeding deionized water and air into the stack.  Generation of pure oxygen at 3,600 psig is particularly applicable for filling tanks used for extravehicular activity (EVA) directly. The water necessary for the electrochemical O2 pump is delivered as vapor by Giner's water management membrane (WaMM).  The system operates quietly with quick start up/shutdown and the output stream O2 pressure and rate are easily controllable.  The demonstrated SVFOC concept used a modified Giner lightweight single-cell static vapor feed electrolyzer. The preliminary results established steady operation of the stack up to 500 mA/cm2 with a stack temperature < 30C.  The completion of this Phase I program proposed will result in the development of a 5-cell SVFOC stack capable of producing 0.9 kg/day of pure oxygen at 3,600 psig.","The proposed technology will take ambient air, and using only a low-power blower and power supply deliver concentrated high pressure oxygen of controlled pressure.  The device has no technical pressure limit, and we have tested prototypes to 1000 psi.  The high pressures achievable allow for both oxygen concentration and direct filling of oxygen life-support tanks.  There are no other sub-systems necessary for this device and, any NASA manned space mission could use this technology.",Giner is developing oxygen concentrators for organ preservation through persufflation.

The system consist of an outer inflated shroud that surrounds nested, concentric integrated ballistic/radiation shields separated by a series of loops via tension that are deployed by gas released between the perforated layers causing gentle inflation upon reaching the vacuum of space.  Battens within the shroud maintain its form even when unpressurized, and the frustum is protected with soft-goods thermal protection; the shroud is not jettisoned but rather carried into space to act as the outer micro-meteoroid orbital debris (MMOD) bumper and insulation layer.  The tension based loop system allows tailored separation of the layers for optimal MMOD and thermal protection.  The loops support small tensile loads and have a high length-to-cross-sectional-area ratio reducing conduction between layers for performance near idealized MLI; improving on foam spacers, scrim, or other compression standoffs.  Tank supports and plumbing pass through cutouts in the deployed system with little effect to thermal or ballistic protection. The architecture can encapsulate a tank or support deep space radiation cooled conical or complex geometry shields.  Paragon and TRLA are confident this unique multifunctional system concept will lead to a higher performance, lower cost, and lower mass solution than is currently possible with existing shrouds, MMOD, and insulation systems.","The proposed system will allow less that 0.5 W/m^2 of heat penetration to a cryogen enhancing the prospect of passive zero-boil-off cryogenic propellant tanks while providing launch tolerance and integrated MMOD protection.  Successful development results in a low risk, low mass, shroud solution that can be applied to nearly any mission and is especially useful in support of soft or hard sided habitation modules or propellant tanks, including cryogens, to protect them from the thermal and MMOD environments of space. Compared to existing systems, this technology reduces the cost, schedule, and risk associated with the MMOD and thermal aspects of space operations. The system will be mature enough to be considered for future propellant depots, on-orbit storage of upper stages, space stations, and manned habitats both in space and in near-vacuum planetary missions such as a return to the Moon, Mars orbit, Phobos/Deimos or asteroid missions.","The United Launch Alliance has already expressed interest in this concept both as a stand alone inflated payload shroud and as an enabling technology for on-orbit assembly or propellant storage for large cryogenic systems for exploration class missions. Additionally, the proposed system would be ideal for inflatable on orbit tourist habitats, as protection of interstage propellant tanks and commercial satellites and for storage of collected insitu resources in commercial lunar or asteroid resource gathering operations.  It also may have applicability to provide self rigidized structures with integrated ballistic protection for the Department of Defense (DoD).","Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Deployment; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Passive Systems; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Structures",Cryogenic Fluid Management for In-Space Transportation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) team proposes an inflatable airlock structure that employs unique fabric architecture capable of delivering the lowest mass and greatest versatility of any competing design. The proposed fabric inflatable airlock design features a completely integrated air beam inter-wall to passively generate the wall stiffness required for airlock depressurization—without the mass and bulk of aluminum pressure hulls or complexity of multi-structure adaptations of competing inflatable habitat architectures. The design is a modification of Thin Red Line Aerospace's (TRLA) patented Ultra High Performance Pressure Vessel (UHPV), the only fabric pressure vessel design with fully determinate load paths which allows for true mass optimization. This unique architecture utilizes a matrix of braided fiber tendons to contain the structure's global pressure loads. The underlying woven fabric and gas barrier envelopes are thereby only exposed to minimal local shell loads where they bulge outwards between adjacent tendons. Working in pure tension in the absence of load coupling, the tendon array architecture has been shown to be statically determinate and auto-stabilizing under extreme deflection. The proposed fabric inflatable airlock stows compactly for transport to the habitat further reducing logistic costs.","The proposed inflatable airlock design will have immediate application in expanding the utility of any human space exploration architecture while benefiting from system cost and payload volume reduction. The proposed technology will find direct application within NASA and industry in ongoing inflatable structures programs such as lunar surface habitation architecture and rover vehicles. Other NASA applications include habitats, large-scale space hangars for on-orbit assembly, design and analysis of space-based inflatable structures such as telescopes, inflatable aerodynamic decelerators, antenna reflectors, cryogenic propellant tanks, debris shields, rescue vehicles, and barometric chambers","Non-NASA commercial applications include many potential venues including underwater habitats, deep sea emergency escape systems (submarine), portable storage tanks for oil transport, high altitude air ships, aerostats, compressed air energy storage, remote fuel depot stations, remote water storage tanks for forest fire control, deep space antenna reflectors for ground stations, antenna radomes, emergency shelters, and troop shelters with integrated ballistic protection.","Deployment; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures; Tools/EVA Tools",Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

These instruments obtain ion mass in part by measuring the ion speed. Ions create secondary elections, first as they enter the instrument window, then as they ht a target. The flight time across the distance in between provides the speed. The time is measured by detecting secondary electrons from the window and then the target. Curved MCPs simplify the detection because: they have a cylindrical symmetry which is compatible with instrument fields of view; the MCP channels always have the same orientation to electron flight paths, and so create uniform azimuthal detection efficiency; and they may be placed close to the window and target, thereby improving time of flight and mass resolution. Curved MCPs will be developed starting with the successful Incom approach for flat MCPs. A glass capillary array is first formed with 20 micron pores. Using Atomic Layer Deposition, the array is then coated with thin films that create the desired resistance and gain.","Mass spectrometers for upcoming missions IMAP, GDC and MEDICI will all benefit from curved MCPs, either for particle detection, or for UV detection. Prototyping efforts within research groups for upcoming proposals will also benefit from curved MCPs. Curved MCPs simplify secondary electron steering design for particle instruments, and allow more efficient use of interior detector volume. This improves performance, reduces design time and reduces instrument volume.","Terrestrial mass spectrometers often use magnetic fields to cause mass-dependent deflections of incoming particles. Some of these instruments use a linear array of detectors at a focal plane to measure the deflection. They can perform spectrometry simultaneously over a wide range of masses, without changing magnetic field strength. Instead of using an array of channeltron detectors, these instruments could use long, continuous, curved MCPs with a position-sensitive anode for maximum mass resolution.Positron emission tomography (PET) will benefit from curved MCPs in curved microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes. Curved MCP-PMTs will improve detection uniformity in the circular detection array surrounding the test subject.

Large, scalable solar arrays are critical to enabling SEP missions, and could also serve many other sub-sections of the civil, commercial, and defense space markets.  A recently published paper by NIA and NASA shows the Compact Telescoping Array (CTA) concept, which possesses the potential for 60 kW/m3 at 1 MW of power with an elegantly simple design concept derived in part from the international space station (ISS) solar array. The potential performance of CTA, including packing density, scalability and structural efficiency, is excellent.  This array technology appears to be an excellent path forward for many current mission needs. Since the vast majority of CTA's subsystems can be implemented with elements that possess significant flight heritage, it is expected that significant progress can be made under SBIR funding to prepare CTA for infusion in the market.

The instrumentation will also be suitable for atmospheric dust transport measurements. Atmospheric dust plays a significant role in climate modeling; unlike volcanic ash that reflects the solar heating back into the upper atmosphere, dust absorbs the heat locally and causes heating of the troposphere. eVADE will be designed to operate from an airborne platform (manned or unmanned), and as such, will be compact and light weight.","An airborne volcanic ash detection/characterization system, such as eVADE, will have wide applications in the study of the threat volcanic ash poses to aircraft and for other scientific study of volcanic plumes. Studies carried out with eVADE will allow NASA to refine their models of volcanic ash dispersion based on more data than is available at present. There is potential to combine such a system with MAC's optical air data system and icing and turbulence-detection systems into a unified system that would sense volcanic, turbulence and icing hazards ahead and report airspeed along with air temperature and density routinely.","eVADE will have similar utility for non-NASA civil organizations (NOAA, FAA, etc.) and military services (US Air Force, etc.) in conducting scientific studies of volcanic ash characteristics and dispersal. A next generation of eVADE, more compact, would be mountable aboard UAVs to ""scout"" the airways during major eruptions in order to confirm that commercial and military aircraft cannot fly or give clearance for flights if the concentrations are not judged high enough to be a threat. With enough data, this will allow commercial and military aviation to continue safely during eruptions without widespread disruptions. Future systems could potentially be mounted aboard commercial and military aircraft as a warning system and/or as part of a unified system gathering data on ash concentrations from wherever the eVADE-equipped aircraft are flying, providing even more data for entry into models and for warning purposes. Combined with MAC's optical air data system along with its turbulence-detection and icing hazard warning technologies, a single sensor system may be devised that would detect these three hazards to aviation ahead and report airspeed along with air, temperature and density routinely, providing commercial aircraft with a valuable new optically-based multi-function warning/air data system. This would increase commercial aviation safety and enhance pilot awareness of the air situation ahead of the aircraft.",Air Transportation & Safety; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ultraviolet; Visible,Airborne Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The worldwide aviation industry is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases; the International Civil Aviation Organization puts it at 2% of the global anthropogenic total.  The impact of these emissions is amplified even more, however, because they go directly into the upper troposphere.  We propose an efficient plasma-based method for drag reduction which, when fully developed will directly translate to reduced fuel consumption and reduced emissions.  The proposed Phase I effort will involve a combined experimental and numerical investigation aimed at a proof-of-concept implementation of the drag-reducing technology.  In follow-on Phase II work, the ITAC-led team will work to expand the flight envelope over which the plasma-based method can be applied.","When fully developed, a plasma-based drag reduction technology would be widely applicable within NASA.  Any system with significant contributions to drag from attached turbulent boundary layers could potentially benefit from this approach.  This would include not only flight vehicles, but also test facilities, which could take advantage of the reduced power required to maintain test conditions.","Since fuel costs have historically been the largest single cost of airline operations, any technology which offers significant drag reduction (and thus fuel savings) will be of great interest to aircraft manufacturers.

This in-space water will be used for human habitation, radiation protection, and to produce in-space rocket propellant.  Utilization of In-space resources will save the high launch costs and higher costs to deliver payloads to other planetary surfaces.  To greatly reduce Earth launch mass, propellant to return from the Martian surface will be manufactured with in-situ resources (i.e. water, CO2) on the surface of Mars for manned exploration missions.   A microwave probe can penetrate deep below the surface and extract water (vapor) below water depleted layers near the surface and where water ice is more concentration.  We will test the efficiency of water extraction radiating microwave energy with our microwave probes in simulated Martian permafrost simulant under vacuum (i.e. 5 torr). We have shown that microwaves will penetrate regolith, heating in-situ.  As the regolith heats, water ice sublimes to water vapor that will flow out of the regolith and can be funneled through a conduit in the probe to a remote cold trap.  Microwave water extraction has been demonstrated in our lab by beaming microwaves with a microwave horn.  We will validate that the process works with microwave probes and water extraction rates will be measured. It is a simple vapor transport process, efficient, less complex, and a lower mass method for volatiles prospecting and water mining. The process will eliminate the need for excavation and associated mining equipment, it can save the mass/costs to deliver excavation, mining and regolith handling equipment to Mars as well as the Moon.  This method would reduce the cost/mass that has to be delivered to the moon ($1M/kg) and Mars ($10M/kg).",NASA has plans to prospect and to demonstrate mining of in-situ water from the lunar poles.  The water will be used for human habitation and for rocket propellant (oxygen) to ascent from the moon.  Use of in-space resources will greatly reduce launch mass as well as the cost/mass that has to be delivered to the surface of the moon ($1M/kg) and Mars ($10M/kg.   Any manned mission to Mars will require the use of Martian water for habitation (water and oxygen) and to produce the propellant for ascent from Mars.

This is especially important for the state of California.  Many people do not have an abundant, reliable, and affordable sources of potabe drinking water.  As the human population surpasses 6 billion, water is becoming a precious commodity.  Also military or expeditionary missions on Earth where water is scarce could utilize our technology to recover water providing potable water.

This new process seeks to more efficiently combine the current functions of standard water electrolysis for breathing O2 production and the Sabatier process for removal of cabin CO2. It represents a major innovation and paradigm shift, rather than a minor enhancement of existing processes. The process will be accomplished using a novel electrochemical CO2 reduction electrocatalyst in conjunction with a proton-exchange membrane electrochemical cell. This technology is expected to have direct applications for Human Exploration and Development of Space missions as a means for the management and removal of excess respired carbon dioxide space cabins and enhanced closed-loop operations on long duration missions. The proposed process will enhance the closed-loop by recycling considerable amounts of water and will provide launch-mass saving.  The proposed process not only will reduce CO2, but will also produce water and organic fuel; the water will be electrolyzed to O2 and the liquid fuel of will be captured and stored for use.  The Phase I technical objectives are to demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel specialty cathode catalyst for carbon dioxide reduction that results in the production of water and methanol, develop an efficient cathode electrode structure,  fabricate a complete electrochemical reactor, and to operate the reactor under a wide variety of conditions. The Phase I concludes with a design for a complete, integrated system for oxygen generation and carbon dioxide and water recycling.","The directly relevant NASA application includes a compact module, which can be integrated into the Orbiter's Environmental Control and Life Support System water reclamation systems to manage the respired carbon dioxide inside the spaceship and recycle water. Possible additional NASA applications include the production of fuels from indigenous materials (carbon dioxide) available on the surfaces of planets such as Mars.  This will help, as future missions are required to utilize resources on Mars and will result in cost savings, as these materials will not have to be transported from earth.","Carbon dioxide is a product of combustion, and has been identified as one of the principal factors behind global warming. Removal of CO2 from stack emissions by means of adsorption processes, followed by conversion into a useful organic product such as methanol, would have a large economic potential. The specific commercial product to be developed under the proposed program would be an electrochemical reactor that produces methanol. The methanol could be used as an industrial chemical, as a fuel for automobiles, or as a fuel for fuel cells.

The method, being applicable to produce high-performance deformable mirrors with a large variety of pixel densities and actuator counts, is also proposed to seamlessly integrate the DM manufacturing process with a novel low-power HVA-based driver ASIC, hence an enhancement of the proposed batch manufacturing process by reliably packaging DMs with high yield, zero failure pixel, and with high optical qualities, and on top of these offering ultra low crosstalk among DM pixels which is demanded for high-resolution mirror surface control. Low pay load, high performances, low cost, and low power, are the four keys that can lead a DM to successful implementation into NASA's high-performance systems. For lab testing, concept inspiration, and concept validation, the AO communities need high-performance but low-cost DMs to study wide variety of AO concepts on a tight budget and in a timely fashion; on the other hand, once an AO concept is approved, a space-based adaptive optics system will additionally demand low payload and low power dissipation for space-based deployment. The proposed DM manufacturing and ASIC integration technique aims to develop DMs to meet the two staged needs through one joint DM development program.","In general, future high-performance systems for: (1) correction of aberrations in large-aperture, space-deployed optical interferometers and telescopes, (2) high-resolution imaging and communication through atmospheric turbulence, (3) laser beam steering, and (4) optical path alignment, (5) propagation of directed laser energy through atmospheric turbulence, will require deformable mirror (DM) wavefront correctors with several hundred to millions of elements.

One such barrier is the lack of tools enabling operators to team with automation to operate multiple UAS with minimal human oversight.  This, in turn, requires a flexible testbed enabling research into key human automation teaming (HAT) areas (e.g., seamless sharing/trading of control between human and automation, trust calibration with highly autonomous systems, transparency, and understanding limitations of automation as a teammate).  We propose to develop a ground station that serves as a Human Automation Teaming Testbed for management of Multiple UAS (M-HATT).  M-HATT will facilitate R&D into HAT requirements by providing a testbed with:  a) an architecture interoperable with NASA's Live Virtual Constructive – Distributed Environment (LVC-DE) and international standards (e.g., 4586), and designed with sound properties (modular, flexible, extensible, and scalable); b) tools to configure new experiments without requiring substantial code changes; and c) human-centered interfaces and tools for tuning properties of automation. These capabilities will enable human systems integration (HSI) researchers to rapidly gain insights into challenging HAT research questions.  In Phase I, we will define M-HATT requirements and create a proof of concept demonstration.  In Phase II, we will implement M-HATT software components, and collaborate with NASA HSI researchers to use M-HATT to perform simulation studies and flight tests, and develop a commercialization plan.","M-HATT is designed to play a key role in all future NASA projects that involve UAS research.  In the near term (~1-5 years), M-HATT will provide NASA's UAS HSI researchers the capability to develop MOPS for SAA performance, HSI design guidelines for ground control stations, and HAT concepts with the existing LVC-DE.  In near- and mid- terms (~1-10 years), M-HATT will assist the development of the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) infrastructure throughout NASA's envisioned four UTM Builds.  Other NASA programs that can leverage M-HATT for UAS simulation and flight tests, and to accelerate the investigation of research issues, include: 1) Trusted Autonomous Systems Program, which seeks methods for calibrating trust using a test case involving autonomous UAS operations; 2) Reduced Crew/Single Pilot Operations (RC/SPO), which seeks ways to team a ground dispatcher/pilot, and automation while engendering appropriate trust between them; and 3) AutoMax, an initiative researching automated management of future airspace operations including autonomous operations and autonomy technologies for unmanned vehicles.","M-HATT is a design and evaluation tool for new technologies developed by manufacturers of: 1) Small and large UASs (e.g., Aerovironment, General Atomics, Boeing, and Lockheed), and UAS avionics systems (e.g., communications and navigation) such as Honeywell and General Dynamics;  2) Organizations that have public oriented research interests in studies of regulatory, liability, and socio-policy-economic implications of autonomous UAS operations, such as the FAA, MITRE, and academic institutions; 3) Companies intending to use UAS technologies for package delivery or emergency response applications, such as Google, Amazon, and UPS.  These companies will need to develop and test UAS ground control stations tailored to their operations; and 4) Organizations that have made large investment in UAS technologies and deployed them in military missions (e.g., DoD and CIA).  These organizations are leading R&D efforts for using autonomy to increase the number of UASs controlled by a single operator.   Their labs are actively researching resulting HAT issues, and will need for a testbed such as M-HATT to conduct simulations for training or evaluations.","Air Transportation & Safety; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Perception/Vision; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Teleoperation",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

However the number of similarities between CubeSat designs is greater than between any two larger spacecraft. Leveraging these similarities and by applying a modular design approach we can develop a small family of motherboards that can fulfill the needs of any CubeSat mission.  The computing elements of a 1-3U motherboard and a 6U motherboard are the same.  The differences between these CubeSat bus architectures exist outside the computing element.  Thus, we can move the computing elements off of the motherboard and into a self-contained Compute Module (CM).  The CM contains all the elements needed for a self-contained computer.  The CM is attached to an Application Specific Daughter Card (ASDC).  Together the CM and ASDC provide the capabilities needed for a specific task.  This standard module will consist of a physical form factor, electrical connections and design specifications for the ASDC.  The initial Compute Module (CM) design specifications will utilize SST' modified ARM® Cortex®-M0 microcontroller, motherboard for the 1-3U and a 6U CubeSat bus configuration.","As the CubeSat markets and their applications increase the need for similar components will continue to increase to keep these projects affordable. This proposal leverages the similarities in most CubeSats by applying a modular approach to the spacecraft main electronics, the motherboard. By designing this Compute Module (CM) approach NASA can fulfill the needs of any CubeSat mission.  The real power of this modular design concept is in giving the engineer as many design options as possible with a single development environment.  By providing a CM that is self-contained and has a standard interface, the engineer can add a radiation hardened, secure, and robust computation element to any subsystem or payload.  This modular approach shall significantly reduce development time and increase reliability.  Future deep space missions such as NASA's SIMPLEx or Biosentinal will not be capable without radiation hardened electronics such as these.","SST's extreme environment technology and products are suitable for most space and mil-aero applications owing to the generic, unmet need for simultaneously hardened components to radiation and temperature without onerous SWaP penalties or trade-offs.

Integrating a robotic manipulator with an appropriate end-effector to an AFF provides the capability to perform several autonomous functions such as material handling, fetching and handling tools, procedural support to astronauts during their experiments, etc. Additionally, it can help the AFF to dock into battery charging stations and perch by grabbing on to rails or other features on the ISS. Some of the technical challenges posed by incorporating a traditional multi-degree of freedom manipulator on an object of small inertia such as the AFF include complexity in attitude control and rapid depletion of battery (or propellant) due to (a) reaction disturbances caused by a joint motion and (b) Variation in the inertia of the AFF-manipulator system caused by manipulator movement. Additionally, mass, volume, and control issues are posed by utilizing a serial multi-DOF manipulator. Development of a parallel kinematic manipulator with a disturbance-free actuation mechanism will improve the performance of the AFF's attitude control system. Additionally, a manipulator-embedded mass property estimation scheme will complement the task of controlling the AFFs position and attitude. The proposed MoDAC manipulator achieves these objectives by using a reaction wheel based actuation method for a modified Canfield mechanism. Additionally, the manipulator electronics are embedded with a manipulator-inertia estimation algorithm that is transmitted to the AFF in real time for superior attitude control. The Phase 1 effort will demonstrate the technical feasibility to perform disturbance-free manipulator operations suited for Assistive Free Flyers such as SPHERES and HET-2 via high-fidelity simulations and proof of concept prototype development and testing.","The MoDAC manipulator provides a means to achieve reaction-free actuation of manipulators. The technique is beneficial primarily for microgravity (on-orbit) applications and very low gravity applications (e.g., asteroids and comet surfaces) where reaction torque on the base body is a concern. The development of the MoDAC manipulator is therefore targeted only towards space based applications. The applications mainly include NASA and the Department of Defense's (DoD) space missions.The MoDAC manipulator will be designed specifically for integration on to AFFs being developed by NASA. Millennium will work closely with NASA to assure compliance with AFF specifications and to perform the developmental activities consistent with NASA's goals. However, the concept and the design can be applied to any of NASA's on-orbit robotic applications.  As NASA pushes forward on the path to exploration of the Solar System and beyond, the necessity for manually controlled or automated robots is increasing. Example of such applications include sample retrieval from asteroids and planets, asteroid capture, proximity operations, docking, etc. Scaled versions of the MoDAC manipulator can be used for any and all of these applications.","The Department of Defense, specifically, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has goals of protecting, servicing, and extending the life of national space assets using on-orbit robotic servicing missions.

(PSI) proposes to develop an advanced ocular imaging platform for comprehensive examination of the eye posterior segment (retina/choroid) based on non-invasive multimodal optical imaging techniques including Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and PSI's proprietary confocal line-scanning ophthalmoscopy (LSO). Software control of scan patterns and data processing and display/segmentation algorithms will accommodate a variety of novel approaches within a single optical platform, and enhance diagnostic capabilities to standard OCT and LSO-based techniques. In addition to structural information such as retina and choroid thickness maps and volume, quantitative and scalable tools for wide dynamic range blood flow metrics will be designed in Phase I and demonstrated in human volunteers and animal models in Phase II.Examining the retina and the choroid from a bulk perspective could provide important insights for elucidating short and long term effects of microgravity and fluid shifts specific to long duration space flights. Degenerative diseases of the eye often have either hemodynamic consequences or causes, though many mechanisms remain unknown. Microgravity-induced ocular functional and structural alterations have been experienced by several astronauts involved in long-duration space travels. Consequently, there is a clear need for advanced imaging modalities to monitor these effects. Improved blood flow imaging diagnostics will aid the detection and management of many eye conditions, and foster research on retinal function.The team assembled at PSI for the proposed research has extensive experience in developing ophthalmic instrumentation based on OCT and line-scanning techniques. Our skills cover all aspects of OCT imaging, image segmentation, layer thickness maps, visualization of retinal and choroidal vasculature, Doppler OCT, large-area line-scanning retinal imaging and Doppler flowmetry.","The auto-regulation of blood flow and fluid transport in the eye is exquisitely sensitive to many neurovascular and metabolic signaling systems. Though the effects of glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide (fuel, oxidizer, and waste) are the most commonly studied, there is also evidence that the fluid shifts and intraocular /intracranial pressures changes observed or inferred in the microgravity environment likewise produce responses with potential long-term consequences for ocular health. An advanced multimodal diagnostic imaging platform which can accurately track multiple anatomical and physiological changes in the eye over time is therefore fundamental to understanding and mitigating these effects. Such a flexible device may offer significant advantages to NASA research facilities which would otherwise need to adapt multiple single-purpose commercial clinical devices to NASA applications.","PSI has a long and successful history in developing advanced ophthalmic imaging instrumentation. The main objective of the proposed research is development of multimodal platform that can non-invasively and non-mydriatically characterize the posterior segment of the eye both structurally (thickness maps and volume of retina and choroid) and hemodynamically (blood flow in the retina and choroid). A novel imaging system combining Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with PSI's proprietary Line-scanning Doppler Flowmetry (LSDF) near 1050nm will provide 3D structural information and local flow parameters while semi-quantitative LSDF flow visualizations will aid in characterizing global blood flow patterns. Such a unique platform capable of generating structural and functional maps of the eye will have immediate clinical applications for a broad range of eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma age-related, macular degeneration, and other conditions.",Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors),Measurements of Net Ocular Blood Flow   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The modulus of Titanium is lower than legacy spacesuit bearing materials (Stainless Steel). Due to this, Titanium bearings are more susceptible to deflection under man and plug load scenarios. Bearing deflection causes a limited number of balls to absorb the full load and results in higher, localized, contact stresses. Localized contact stress is believed to be the main contributor to the bearing race degradation observed during NASA's 2014 oxygen compatibility testing.   In Phase 1, we will correlate analytical contact stress data with sample bearing test data. This correlation will characterize bearing wear and degradation relative to ball contact stress. Multiple test iterations will be performed to clearly identify the contact stress that degrades a titanium race. We will also determine if there are commercial surface treatments (coatings) that may enhance Titanium wear resistance. At the conclusion of Phase 1, we shall have identified the maximum allowable bearing contact stress. This data point will serve as a valuable design guideline for future bearing designs and should yield reduced certification and development costs.","The Phase 1 deliverable is the definition of the maximum allowable contact pressure/stress for Titanium Bearings and what influence coatings, materials and lubricants may have on that stress. This definition and the process to arrive at the definition will help reduce development and certification cycle time associate to spacesuit and pressure suit bearings as well as disconnects that employ ball locking retention mechanisms.  These savings can reduce risk and cost by making it feasible for bearings to go into the Preliminary Design Review process at a very high TRL. Relative to present and future NASA applications, we believe the EMU Program, advanced EVA spacesuits (Z-Series) and the Orion Ascent Entry Pressure Suits can benefit from this work.","Air-Lock's core business focuses on providing life support hardware to enhance human performance in hazardous environments. Along with servicing the space industry, Air-Lock provides this life support hardware to the aerospace, military and fire fighter industries. Similar to our spacesuit products, weight reduction and low profiles are design drivers for aerospace, military and fire fighter life support hardware. A key staple of core products for those industries are quick disconnects (QDs) that utilize bearing ball locking mechanisms. Understanding the role ball contact stresses play relative to component wear and degradation can be implemented across these QD product lines; yielding lighter weight, improved wear resistant assemblies.",Analytical Methods; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Destructive Testing; Lifetime Testing; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Processing Methods; Prototyping; Tribology,EVA Space Suit Pressure Garment Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

(PSI), in collaboration with Vencore Services and Solutions, Inc. (Vencore) and Utah State University (USU), proposes to develop a Solar Plant Growth System for Food Production in Space Exploration Missions.  In the proposed system solar light is collected by the reflector optics and only the photosynthetically active radiation spectra (PAR: 400 nm < λ < 700 nm) are transmitted to the plant growth chamber.  The PAR spectra transmitted to the plant growth chamber are distributed over the plant growth area at optimum intensities for plant growth.  The non-plant growing spectra (non-PAR) are not reflected by the dichroic PAR reflector and transmitted to energy conversion devices such as low-bandgap photovoltaic (PV) cells for electric power generation.  The electric power generated can be used for supplemental lighting and/or facility operation.In the proposed program we will develop a ground-based prototype plant growth system by integrating (i) the solar plant lighting technology developed by Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) with (ii) state of the art plant growth technologies for food production in space.  In Phase I, a laboratory prototype plant growth system consisting of: solar concentrator; optical fiber cable; lighting panel; plant growth chamber; and plant watering module will be developed, and functionality tests and performance evaluation will be conducted.  Based on the results of Phase I an engineering prototype solar plant growth system will be developed and tested in a ground based facility.","The proposed Solar Plant Growth System for Food Production is for application to: 1) onboard a crewed spacecraft such as the Deep Space Habitat or ISS where compact and efficient solar photosynthetic life support is required; and 2) a Lunar, NEO or Mars base where large scale food production and life support are implemented. The conventional concept for plant lighting is to employ electric lamps such as fluorescent, or high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps or light emitting diodes (LED).  With this conventional system concept, it is difficult to achieve high photosynthetic food production without causing unmanageable parasitic heat loading.  For the proposed system, only the PAR spectra are delivered to the plant growth chamber by a compact flat lighting panel, thereby reducing most of the parasitic heat generation in the habitat.  The proposed solar lighting system can also be utilized to supply solar thermal power to the habitat by changing the PAR mirror to the full spectral reflective mirror.  Thermal power delivered to the habitat can be used for: habitat thermal control; manufacturing; and material processing.  PSI has demonstrated such applications of the solar power system in our previous NASA program related to ISRU.  The system concept discussed in this proposal has many other NASA applications such as material recycling such as nutrient re-use, and pollution removal from water (rhizofiltration) in human habitat.","The solar lighting system discussed in this proposal can be used for household, commercial or industrial lighting.  In addition, industry and educational institutions that are currently using electric lamps for plant lighting will likely deploy the proposed system.  In 2009, PSI developed a prototype solar lighting system for agricultural transplants with USDA SBIR funding. In this program we provided solar lighting within the protected transplant growing chamber.  This technique can be applied to controlled production of pharmaceuticals using transgenic plants or specialized native plants.An interesting application of the optical fiber based (Optical Waveguide) solar lighting system is for ""Vertical Farming.""  Vertical Farming' could provide fresh vegetables in urban areas in the off season, if an efficient light delivery system is available.  To date, Vertical Farming with electric lighting has been limited by the inefficiency of solar photovoltaic cells and the associated low conversion efficiency of electric lights.  By using the solar lighting system based on Optical Waveguide lighting, the deficiency of Vertical Farming can be eliminated.  A solar based light delivery system would eliminate the need for the greenhouse and make all parts of the growth system highly productive.  The work described in this proposal has the potential to fundamentally change our ability to produce fresh food from local suppliers on a year round basis.","Biomass Growth; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation)",Bioregenerative Technologies for Life Support   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Technology developments are needed that result in expanded measurement capabilities and a reduction in size, mass, power, and cost.  To that end, NASA has become increasingly interested in the use of small spacecraft platforms such as CubeSats.   Many of the sensors required for measurement of an electric field are extremely sensitive to fields created by the spacecraft electronics and therefore must be positioned on orbit at a significant distance from the spacecraft.  This presents major challenges for the accommodation of this type of instrument on a CubeSat platform.  In particular, several miniaturized booms must be stowed in a very small volume for launch and must have sufficient deployed properties to allow for high pointing accuracy, adequate deployed stiffness and thermal stability on orbit.  In the proposed effort, Composite Technology Development, Inc. (CTD) and the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) will collaborate to provide an electric field instrument containing miniaturized sensor electronics and thermally stable, compactly stowed and structurally rigid graphite composite booms to measure electric fields effectively on a low-cost CubeSat platform.","Our present understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is limited, partly due to the lack of broad statistical observations of the 3-dimensional (3D) electric field in the altitude region between 300 and 1000km.  The proposed CubeSat E-field instrument will enable measurements to be made economically in this region.  This is relevant to the scientific goals outlined in the 2013-2022 decadal survey in solar and space physics, as stated: ""Determine the dynamics and coupling of the earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere and atmosphere and their response to solar and terrestrial inputs."" It is also relevant to the NASA 2009 Heliophysics Roadmap, as outlined in the living with a star science queue: ""Dynamic Geospace Coupling: Understand how magnetospheric dynamics provide energy into the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system."" In addition, the proposed boom technology can be used for magnetometers, particle sensors, gravity gradient stabilization for small spacecraft, or for deploying solar sails, solar arrays and phased array antennas.","The U.S. military has increasing interest in utilizing low-cost spacecraft platforms that can be rapidly launched for the purposes of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and space weather monitoring.  The proposed instrument would have applicability for missions similar to the Air Force's Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) , which allows the U.S. military to predict the effects of ionospheric activity on signals from communication and navigation satellites, outages of which could potentially cause problems in battlefield situations.  In addition, both military and commercial satellites could use gravity gradient booms, instrument booms, optical and antenna reflectors, sunshades, deorbiting systems, solar arrays, phased arrays, and solar sails based on this deployment technology.  Commercial demand is expected to increase as well.

The HPEG increases astronaut comfort and reduces fatigue by allowing for a large Range of Motion with low joint torque throughout.  In its current configuration, the glove has shown no signs of hand or fingernail trauma, representing a lower injury risk than current technology.  Further, mass reductions from new materials and processes ensure that the HPEG will weigh significantly less than current technology.  Sizing capabilities of the HPEG are also a technical improvement over current methods.

The new instrument will pair ruggedized, miniature photomultiplier tubes with silicon photodetectors to create so-called hybridnamic detectors for use in both radiance and irradiance radiometers, featuring 14 decades of linear dynamic range. The new radiometers will be suitable for making airborne optical measurements of the atmosphere and ocean in low-light regimes wherein high-quality optical data are rarely available. Anticipated uses include improved calibration and validation data collection for next-generation NASA satellite missions emphasizing turbid atmospheres and waters.  Basic research uses include nighttime diurnal or polar winter studies (e.g. aerosol optical depth from shadow band irradiance instruments), and other moon-lit measurements including airborne ocean color missions. Phase 1 will leverage a technology readiness level (TRL) 3 prototype, bringing the work to TRL 4 during six months.  If the Phase 2 work is successful, the activity will advance the TRL of the new instrument from a value of 3 (based on the IRAD prototype instrument) to a value of 6 over the period of the SBIR Phase 1 and 2.  During Phase 1, necessary new fixturing and testing software and protocols will be developed, and a parallel engineering characterization of the IRAD prototype will confirm the instrument architecture. The resulting recommendations from the engineering tests will be used to establish the specifications for a Phase 2 sensor suite, to be proposed at the end of the project as a follow-on activity.","This SBIR Phase I and II would result specifically in a cornerstone product for BSI's airborne instrument line. We see this development being used wherever an airborne radiometer has been used in the past and where extended dynamic range or nighttime activities were desired. By coupling NASA-funded microradiometer detectors with the appropriate COTS PMTs, the 14-DeCADES project captures the best features of both technologies: high-speed and wide dynamic range, for both radiance and irradiance sensors. The work proposed here may be incorporated into a variety of configurations appropriate to addressing aspects of the Carbon cycle and Ecosystems Roadmap, where the wide dynamic range configurations, which is not possible with existing technology, can be applied.

We design the architecture for a system that simultaneously maintains the efficiency and success of a multi-vehicle mission while also detecting and resolving potential loss of separation and conflicts within the NAS. The challenge is that for a variety of missions, teams of unmanned vehicles can perform the mission efficiently in particular configurations, but simultaneously the team of vehicles must be aware of and accommodate themselves, external traffic, potential intruders, environmental constraints, terrain, and so forth. Our software based system, UA-Teamer, provides the architecture and solutions to achieve mission success and the efficiency promised that multi-vehicle teams can accomplish while maintaining system safety. Our primary technical objectives are: i) Demonstrate a common set of flight path planning parameters built using PBN and other constraints enabling UA to interoperate and cooperate as a team; ii) Produce an algorithmic software approach that selects a best fit flight path set for a UA team mission that involves heterogeneous UAs; and iii) Show that the planners can response to conformance monitoring needs for re-planning and contingencies.

The SPR includes a receptacle to hold materials to be recycled, a grinding system to cut materials into small pieces, an auger system to transport the shredded material to a heated nozzle and a tension controller to precisely control the diameter of the filament produced.  An automatic spooling system will wind the processed filament neatly onto a spool.The SPR includes a method to categorize and label spaceflight packaging materials making them easily identifiable as ""print recyclables"".  The recycler will use the material label barcodes to automatically configure internal settings to process the material without the need for manual adjustments by the user.  We propose operating and controlling the SPR inside the modular Techshot Multi-purpose Variable-G Platform (MVP). Now in Phase III development, MVP has been designed to house, control and provide environmental control for a wide variety of ISS experiments, including hardware such as the SPR.  Operating the SPR inside the MVP offers several advantages, such as temperature and humidity control and the ability to monitor and capture vapors.  The MVP also provides an extra layer of containment for noise and EMI.  But the primary advantage of operating the SPR inside of the MVP is the reduction of development time and cost by eliminating the need to develop separate housing, control and data acquisition systems.  The MVP already includes all of the power, data, control and mounting interfaces needed to operate the SPR. The SPR filtering system will ensure that gases and ultrafine particles are maintained below safe limits.  The MVP software will monitor the system and shut it down, should any of the air quality measurements exceed safe limits.","In support of the travel supply chain model for crewed exploration missions, SPR is being developed as an essential element of a self-sustaining, closed-loop, on-orbit manufacturing process. The ability to repair essential equipment in deep space may be dependent on the ability of the crew to manufacture those components from available materials. And if materials come from packaging, failed or damaged components, and other no longer necessary onboard subsystems, the logistics supply chain will require far less upmass.Refining and selecting the materials that can be used for their original purpose and still be recycled for re-purposing is the other crucial step in developing the travel supply chain. Understanding the entire inventory of available recyclable materials is the most important first step, which is why Techshot has proposed that task as its initial objective of this Phase I project. However, we also recognize that this material selection process will be an iterative and evolving process as new space-worthy materials for packaging, components, and subsystems are selected.  Techshot is eager to be an integral part of the travel supply chain development team in providing guidance as to what materials will work effectively with SPR.Initial operations on ISS will validate the performance of SPR and serve as a test bed in advance of exploration missions. Techshot will work closely with NASA to ensure it is compatible with all 3D printers selected for flight.","Industrial customers who want their materials tested and validated for use in components to be employed on deep space missions, may also be interested in preliminary testing of their product in SPR and 3D printers in the ISS test bed. Therefore, these industrial-based suppliers are likely to become second tier customers for Techshot.   In addition to marketing ISS test bed services to our own customers, we also anticipate referrals to industrial customers from the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS). Techshot is an implementation partner of CASIS and has a long standing relationship with them. We anticipate continuing to work with CASIS to identify and facilitate industry users of ISS and our spaceflight hardware technologies. In addition, Techshot sees a strong potential for the SPR to help in advancing innovation in manufacturing – particularly as it relates to extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Since manufacturing advancements have been encouraged by Presidential Executive Order 13329, which states to give ""high priority"" to advanced manufacturing-related research within the SBIR program, this proposal qualifies as an important manufacturing improvement initiative. Furthermore, Techshot foresees the potential to improve industrial energy efficiency by developing more efficient equipment and processes used in industry.

Specifically, this effort will demonstrate technical feasibility and test proof of concept for:1. 3D printing of dissimilar high temperature metals such as Inconel and steel in novel designs2. Creation of gradient materials for multipurpose structures3. 3D printing of metal matrix composites for selective reinforcement and lightweightingThe UAM process has been refined to achieve high technology readiness levels in aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and titanium, and combinations of these materials. The extension of the UAM process to dissimilar combinations with Inconel, gradient materials, and metal matrix composites is challenging. Successful proof of concept of these innovations and elevation of one specific application to TRL 4, validated by third party testing, will be accomplished in Phase I. With NASA guidance, the project team Phase II plan is to select and develop functional prototypes of Space Launch System structures with the most successful Phase I results to illustrate efficient space vehicle concepts. A demonstration unit will be delivered to NASA for testing at the completion of the Phase II contract.","The project team intends to develop Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) manufacturing processes supporting the Space Launch System to create structures with superior mechanical properties and increased reliability. UAM-enabled structures are an important enabler for minimized touch labor and final assembly steps, increased reliability and reduced cost. UAM, by its nature, enables improved lead times by directly printing parts in one machine at one time, eliminating part movements from process to process (and vendor to vendor).The solid state UAM bond in conjunction with an additive / subtractive system allow for custom structures (eg - metal matrix composites) to be manufactured with reinforcing members in any three-dimensional configuration. These composites can be created directly on existing structures manufactured through other processes, resulting in launch structures with lower mass and improved process lead time.The solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for combining any metal combination without formation of brittle intermetallics. This enables layer by layer material changes for complex graded metal structures. This can directly lead to lighter structures with increased structural efficiency by combining multiple functions in one component.","The initial application of high performance UAM-enabled structures will likely be in NASA, defense and commercial space structure programs, in that order. This estimate recognizes the high performance technology leading nature of the organizations and their missions. The project team already services aerospace customers.

In particular, due to growing interest in significant cost-reduction using the technology of Selective Laser Melting (SLM), this proposal will attempt to develop a state-of-the-art and low-cost method of polishing and coating a sub-scale thruster nozzle modeled after the ALCOT Thruster and built using SLM. SLM has shown the potential to reduce production costs by 70% or more. By combining SLM with the process of electro-polishing and application of uniform thin-film coatings using ALD, we believe that we can develop a complete manufacturing process by-which high-precision, complex and here-to-fore costly components can be produced at a fraction of their current cost. We intend to demonstrate a method of coating stainless steel, Tungsten and ultimately a Tungsten/Titanium Carbide (W/TiC) matrix created via SLM with Iridium Oxide (IrO2 or IrO3) in Phase I and Yittria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ: Y2O3-ZrO2) and Yittria (Y2O3) in Phase II. This proposal will be a demonstration of smoothing and coating several different substrate materials with a variety of oxides in Phase I which appear to offer significant benefits to the low-cost manufacture of material components of great interest to NASA.","The development of the combination of AM/SLM and ALD technology for larger components and materials required in the aerospace industry is revolutionary.  The highly complex combustion devices and propulsion components necessary to support the US launch industry need technology advancement to reduce the cost of fabrication and assembly of these components.  With the effective development and implementation of AM incorporated into the build process along with complimentary ALD technology for uniform thin-film material coatings, we can help provide more assurance that cost reduction is realized and maintained.  Summit is collaborating with ASTS with ways to cost effectively provide post-SLM finishing and coatings additive manufactured parts using ALD.We believe that Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) will offer a superior technology needed for a low-cost, state-of-the-art method applicable to the manufacture of complex, high-precision components (particularly built using 3-D printing technology) built for spaceflight and other scientific purposes for NASA. In particular, we believe that ALD technology is sufficiently mature to provide a method that is well-tested and used increasingly in the electronics/semiconductor industry and is beginning to be utilized in other areas as well.","Future military and commercial applications of ALD nano-laminates as applied to metals, glass, plastics, carbon fiber and other materials are numerous and perhaps unlimited. Our imaginations are hard-pressed to think of where SLM and future material film applications and designs may take us. As the complexity of manufactured parts and machines increases due to the capability of SLM to build external and internal detailed components (beyond the capabilities of current machining techniques), and the availability of SLM technology proliferates, so will the need for smoothing and coating  of these components increase. The research for additional precursor chemistry to create additional coating alternatives tailored to required environments and functionality is progressing rapidly. At the same time the capability of sophisticated ALD machines capable of supporting high-rates of assembly-line manufacturing is also progressing at a rapid pace. In the future, big box stores may not need to store inventories of parts, machines or wares. Instead, they will store the digital description of their wares and produce them on demand under contract to the IP holder. As part of our efforts to develop a commercialized market for ALD, we have entered into discussion with several ALD manufacturers to form a business partnership and locate a research ALD reactor at SIS in Huntsville.","Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Lasers (Machining/Materials Processing); Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Metallics; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Nanomaterials; Processing Methods",Advanced Metallic Materials and Processes Innovation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Target areas that are critically loaded and/or include features such as embedded sensors and de-icing mechanisms, will be used to evaluate improvements in weight, lifecycle costs, performance, and reliability that CNTs can provide as a result of their multifunctionality. The analysis will be extended during Phase II to study the effect of hybrid composite utility on commercial aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737) using codes such as TASOPT that redesigns aircraft to optimize parameters including fuel efficiency and emissions. Phase II will also involve the design, build, and testing of hybrid composite specimens to prove out the benefits identified during Phase I. Relevant CNT data will be provided by N12 to ensure the greatest amount of accuracy in the benefit analysis. N12 is a spin-off from MIT Professor Brian Wardle's laboratory, that is capable of directly integrating vertically aligned CNTs with common aerospace-grade carbon prepreg materials and conventional processes used to manufacture primary aerospace structures (e.g. hand layup, automated fiber placement (AFP), automated tape layup (ATL)). N12 grows CNTs with controlled morphology and top-to-bottom alignment using an IP-protected continuous, high throughput process that is 1,000 times faster than common batch processes. These CNTs can similarly be transferred onto the surface of carbon prepreg materials in a continuous process that enables a seamless, low cost integration of CNT-reinforced CFRP prepreg with common manufacturing processes to enable future lightweight, multifunctional composite aircraft structures.","The proposed system analysis in this Phase I SBIR effort will quantify the benefits of hybrid CNT/CFRP composite materials that will enable future aircraft designs with improved performance, safety, and environmental impact. These outcomes will directly support NASA's Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP), which includes various projects that seek to optimize materials, aircraft designs, and manufacturing processes for next generation aircraft. Some of these projects, which involve players such as Aurora and Boeing, include investigations of high aspect-ratio wings for improved fuel efficiency and tailored aeroelastic properties. In addition to aircraft, there are various other NASA applications that can benefit from hybrid CNT/CFRP designs. These applications include vehicle and habitat module structures that support NASA's Space Exploration program. Structures such as the Orion crew module and large cryogenic pressure vessels are mass and cost constrained and will benefit from a lightweight, damage tolerant, multifunctional material system.","Aurora and other manufacturers, including Boeing, are working on next generation aircraft for commercial transport. One such aircraft is the D8 ""double-bubble"" concept that Aurora and MIT have studied as part of NASA's N+3 program. The D8 configuration, which assumes a mostly-CFRP composite structure, can provide significant improvements in fuel burn, noise levels, and NOx emissions relative to a best-in-class Boeing 737-800 narrow-body aircraft. Integrating a hybrid composite design can improve the strength of certain areas of the D8 with a reduction of CFRP plies, thus reducing weight and improving fuel efficiency. CNTs can also strengthen joints to improve safety while simultaneously reducing weight through minimized number of CFRP plies and mechanical fasteners. Furthermore, large wind turbine blades can also benefit from a hybrid CNT/CFRP material system capable of being laid down by AFP in a low-cost, reliable manner. As wind turbine blades increase in size to produce more energy, a larger quantity of CFRP is being used. The performance of these large wind turbine blades can be improved by CNT reinforcement and conductivity that helps to reduce weight through fewer plies, and minimize downtime of the overall wind turbine that might occur due to cracking, severe icing, and/or lightning strike damage. Minimizing wind turbine downtime will help to keep the cost of an environmentally energy source down.",Air Transportation & Safety; Characterization; Composites; Distribution/Management; Generation; Nanomaterials; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Processing Methods; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation),Structural Efficiency-Hybrid Nanocomposites   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The primary benefit this approach will be to reduce the time and cost to deploy new space-based capabilities by leveraging power efficient, pervasive mobile computing processors. These processors, however, are not explicitly hardened against radiation (rad-hard) and, consequently, can accumulate uncorrected faults which violate time and space partitioning requirements and lead to mission failure. Current rad-hard space-based processors are custom components, predominantly used only by the aerospace community. They are costly and have limited capabilities and longer product refresh cycles compared to COTS processors. These factors contribute to a high barrier for entry for organizations who can contribute to and participate in Science Mission Directorate (SMD) missions, further impacting innovation. We will define requirements for, and establish the technical feasibility of Non Invasive Instrumentation For Single Event Effects (NIISEE), a cross-checking architecture that leverages built-in debug features in mobile COTS processors. NIISEE will detect transient and permanent SEEs in a space-based environment, while providing high availability and mission critical functionality. Our key innovation is to provide run-time, low-level, non-intrusive fault detection by repurposing a debug capability that already exists in fielded devices.

The abstraction is performed by rechability computation. While traditional reachability computation has been limited to low-dimensional systems, the abstraction approach developed by Purduer University approximates the hybrid system and exhibit significant improvement in computational efficiency. This forms the basis for onboard model-checking for safety. The proof of concept is planned to be demonstrated in the Phase I using simulation studies, and ensuring hardware-in-the-loop simulation and flight demonstration are planned in the Phase II research.","The V&V technology is a key component in many NASA programs.

As specific programs, the V&V tool supports the UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) in the Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP) by reducing the barriers associated with the safety assurance and certification for UAS operations in the NAS. The real-time V&V features of the developed tool also support the Flight Demonstration and Capabilities Project (FDC).

We believe these methods can be reconfigured to use for spaceflight operations.  These completely unobtrusive measures of cognitive load can be part of an overall workload assessment assay and are compatible with both team and individually performed tasks.  Within Phase I, we will conduct an extensive literature review of the current state of the art in automated detectors, focusing on unobtrusive methods that can detect dimensions proven scientifically to predict workload.  This review will reveal evidence-based features that show the most promise as both behavioral indicators of workload and as objective measurements that are amendable to machine learning and statistical techniques. The results of this review will serve as a risk reduction exercise to evaluate and down-select a set of workload detection methods that warrant further investigation.  We will then use the set of candidate metrics, along with our own prior work with semantic analysis and keystroke dynamics to design machine learning algorithms, ultimately producing a workload sensor tailored for use with long duration mission relevant tasks.  Phase I will include an exploratory investigation of a candidate measures, initial sensor designs, and produce experimental plans and IRB protocols for the overall system validation using a combination of data gathered from laboratory settings and ground-based analogs such as the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) at JSC, the UTMB Bedrest facility, and the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog Simulation (HISEAS). Phase II will focus on engineering efforts to implement the sensor algorithms, the support tools for the experiment, conducting the validation study, and data analysis.","ATHENA is a software-based completely unobtrusive cognitive load sensor. It will provide astronauts, mission planners, and system designers with a rapid, automatic, and systematic way to assess the demands of tasks, allowing them to schedule modifications or adapt interfaces in order to optimize the use of the crew's cognitive resources and reduce the risks associated with prolonged over-work or under-work conditions that can threaten mission success and crew performance and behavioral health.  This directly addresses the HRP's identified risk of ""Performance Errors Due to Fatigue Resulting from Sleep Loss, Circadian Desynchronization, Extended Wakefulness, and Work Overload"".  ATHENA will produce empirical evidence and the underlying technologies to help close the knowledge gaps ""Sleep1: ...identify a set of validated and minimally obtrusive tools to monitor and measure sleep-wake activity and associated performance changes for spaceflight"", and ""Sleep2: We need to understand the contribution of [...] work overload, on individual and team behavioral health and performance, including operational performance, for spaceflight.""  The successful deployment of the ATHENA sensor can be used with NASA's current mission planning tool, playbook, for missions onboard ISS or future long duration missions. ATHENA can also be used by NASA's Flight Analogs Project team, where its evidence based workload measures can be used to facilitate the manipulation of experimental conditions.","While some aspects of the spaceflight work environment are extremely unique, the need for reliable and unobtrusive workload detection exists in a number of domains that contain high tempo high criticality tasks.  For example, the US Air Force Research Laboratory is interested in sensors that do not require wearable devices.  Methods for near real-time assessments of cognitive load of UAV operators can be used in concert with automation aides to inform and execute the re-routing of tasks.  If successful, ATHENA represents the first step in the process of automatically optimizing human cognitive capacity, enhancing performance in the human-automation ecology.  We believe a validated cognitive load sensor will be useful in any domain where humans often switch between tasks that require different levels of cognitive processing.  The ability to accurately describe and characterize cognitive load requirements will impact human-automation interaction designs in wide ranging applications from military to industrial uses.  Where possible, we will leverage existing relationships with collaborators to seek opportunities for ATHENA use such oil refinery and power plant control and management.","Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Support",Unobtrusive Workload Measurement   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Ideally, such information has to be based on the metrology data obtained from existing optics fabricated by the same vendor and technology, but, generally, with different sizes and slope and height rms variations. It has been demonstrated that an optical surface can be thought of as a stationary uniform random process. It was further shown that an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling of one-dimensional (1D) slope measurements allows highly confident fitting of the metrology x-ray mirrors data with a limited number of parameters. With the parameters of the ARMA model, the surface slope profile of an optic with the newly desired specification can be forecast reliably. However, ARMA models are causal and do not allow for generalization from one dimension to two. We propose to generalize the method from processing of one dimensional profile data to two dimensional surface data with invertible time-invariant linear filter (InTILF). This approach will also allow to parameterize surface metrology of high quality x-ray optics optimally. Our preliminary studies indicate that the InTILF approximation has all advantages of one-sided AR and ARMA modeling, but it additionally gains in terms of fewer filter parameters and better spectral accuracy. The envisioned software can also be used to analyze a polishing process and as a feedback for polishing tools.",The envisioned analytic software will facilitate development of new x-ray optics of unprecedented quality with surface slope precision of less than 0.1-0.2 μrad and surface height error of less than 1 nm.1-5 generation. This optics is essential for new generation of beamlines and free electron lasers (FELs). The uniqueness of this expensive optics fabrication creates a requirement to provide the compact characterization for it based on existing metrology data. We will develop theoretical base and software tools to characterize the surface morphology. The Software will capture statistical properties of the surface and enable the user to generate thousands of random statistically equivalent surfaces to use for system performance prediction. Statistical equivalence will be defined in terms of fidelity to spectral properties of initial surface under characterization.,"The envisioned analytic software will facilitate development of surface analysis and modeling for a variety of applications. Any application involving an interpolation of spectal analysis of a sparsely sampled surface would benefit.

One such tool, NASA GSFC's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT), offers advanced mission design and optimization capabilities with a flexible GUI. However, its current 3D graphics are lacking in both the quantity and quality of graphical components as well as the maturity of its visualization architecture. Fortunately, GMAT's underlying flexible and Open Source software architecture was designed to facilitate modular improvements. We propose to provide GMAT with world-class visualization capabilities and a graphics architecture that can adapt to future visualization technologies by replacing the existing basic graphics code with the OpenFrames visualization software. OpenFrames is an Open Source API that allows simulations to incorporate high-performance interactive 3D visualizations without requiring significant architecture changes. In this research, we develop comprehensive requirements for GMAT's visualization needs, create a plan to integrate OpenFrames into GMAT, demonstrate a prototype of OpenFrames in GMAT, and compare the performance of OpenFrames to the existing basic visualizations in GMAT. This research will not only bring GMAT visualizations up to par with other mission design tools, such as AGI's STK/Astrogator and NASA JSC's Copernicus, but will also allow GMAT to support cutting-edge technologies such as interactive visual trajectory design and virtual reality environments such as the GSFC CAVE. In turn, this will increase GMAT's user base and increase its utility for future NASA missions, such as Decadal Survey and Discovery class missions that require high-fidelity simulations paired with truly interactive 3D visualizations.","The visualization enhancements provided through this SBIR will make GMAT easier and more enticing to use by mission designers and easier to enhance for software developers. These benefits will expand the GMAT user base and improve Goddard's position as a provider of cutting-edge mission design software. Having robust and high-performance visualizations is especially important during trajectory optimization. In these situations, having an accurate initial guess is so critical to successful optimization that entire research papers are written just on the topic of generating initial guesses. For GMAT, having the ability to visually analyze both initial guesses and iterative trajectory improvements in real time would allow for faster time-to-solution. This would, in turn, make GMAT more desirable as a primary mission design tool for GSFC's (and indeed all NASA centers') upcoming Decadal Earth and Space Science missions in which complex trajectories must be designed to meet increasingly complex science requirements.Furthermore, this SBIR will result in improvements to OpenFrames itself, namely to increase the number of specific graphics elements that can be visualized. Since OpenFrames is Open Source, these improvements can be contributed back to the main OpenFrames project. This will allow other NASA projects that use OpenFrames, currently Copernicus, to potentially benefit from these improvements.","Potential Non-NASA Commercialization Apps: 1500 characters / ~150 words maxBecause GMAT is Open Source, its use by non-NASA entities will also increase due to our SBIR enhancements. Research organizations such as the Air Force Research Laboratory and universities will find GMAT, with its advanced visualization capabilities, a tool of choice for mission design, research, education, and outreach.Emergent will also benefit from GMAT's improved visibility as a result of our SBIR work. We will provide installation and support services for GMAT at external locations, as well as provide on-demand enhancement and integration services for OpenFrames itself.","Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Outreach; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

When actuator quantities are in thousands, the electrical driver poses a fascinating challenge for space-based applications, where power and mass are limited, and reliability is extremely important for the mission life-time in space.  What proposed is a 64x64 channels of monolithic multiplexed driver, which can deliver voltages up to 300 V to all the actuators at different time slots. Thus the required operation power is greatly reduced. By vertically integrating the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) driver with a DM, the potential wiring failure will be eliminated.  Furthermore, radiation resistance will be emphasized during ASIC design.","The proposed ASIC driver is specifically designed to drive the stacked DMs that NASA has been qualified in ground. It will provide a reliable, low power, monolithic DM driver that can be used by an exoplanet-imaging coronagraph. Thus it will be found valuable in applications on those missions, such as WFIRST and ATLAST, where coronagraphic instruments are required.","The first beneficiaries of the ASIC driver are the DM manufacturers. With a vertically integrated ASIC driver, the fabrication of a DM will be dramatically simplified since thousands of wiring  will no longer be required. Thus, the yield and reliability will be greatly improved. Furthermore, with a simplified architecture, DMs with tens of thousands of actuators will become possible at affordable prices, which could attract more AO applications such as retinal imaging, fidelity microscopy imaging and laser drilling.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors)",Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

A key aspect of our approach is to place a highly dispersive (slow-light) material into one arm of a two-path, Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI).  Theoretical analysis shows that the spectral resolution under these circumstances can be enhanced by a factor as large as the group index of the slow-light material being used.  Slow-light interferometers can produce dramatic increases in the resolution or a spectrometer or they can permit much smaller physical dimensions than standard spectrometers without any degradation of resolution.  In the present program, we will undertake to develop spectrometers that can be employed under practical conditions and especially those of interest to NASA.  We propose three related approaches to the design of enhanced spectrometers and will perform conceptual to quantify the relative merits of these approaches.  This will allow future work to further develop the most promising design(s).  The three approaches: 1.)  A hybrid interferometer: a Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer will be placed within a MZ interferometer.  The transfer characteristics of the FP mimic those of a slow-light material.  This design can achieve the same sort of enhancement of sensitivity as that of a true slow-light medium placed inside the MZI. 2.) Our second approach makes use of a similar analogy, but on a much smaller distance scale.  This approach entails the fabrication of wavelength-scale defect resonators in an otherwise perfect photonic crystal (PhC).  The design employs a sequence of such resonators each with a slightly different resonance wavelength.  3.) Our third approach is to fabricate mm-scale interferometers using nano fabrication on silicon.  The slow light medium is a PhC waveguide formed by a line defect in a silicon PhC structure.  We will couple these structures to waveguides in an interferometer configuration.",The compact and robust enhanced spectral interferometers developed in this program will enable expansion of NASA's astrophysical and Earth science observation capability.  The dramatic reduction is size without a reduction in sensitivity can allow spectral sensing technology to expanded platforms such as autonomous vehicles that can more rapidly collect data on species such as green house gases.,The compact sensors enabled by this program could enhance military detection of toxic or explosive chemicals on autonomous aerial platforms or on ground based measurements.

Transducer and instrumentation wiring is intrusive and labor intensive, often requires vehicle modifications to support, is subject to reliability concerns, and adds a significant amount of weight when hundreds of transducers are required. Invocon proposes a Wireless Sensor Network system that will significantly reduce or eliminate the wiring used today to transmit transducer data. Wireless sensor nodes will make the same measurements acquired today with wired transducers, and in some cases will use exactly the same transducer. The key difference is that transceiver units will collect data via RF communication from the wireless sensor nodes, eliminating the need for wired interconnectivity to relay data, and provide the opportunity to collect data from large numbers of sensors. An interface module collects the sensor data and converts the data into a format that facilitates data recording and/or transmission to a ground station via telemetry.","The ease of integration, system flexibility, and scalability makes the wireless sensor system an attractive tool for the NASA flight test organizations, regardless of whether hundreds of channels of measurements are needed or only a few channels. These benefits can also be realized by the other NASA test organizations, such as wind tunnels, propulsion test facilities, and spacecraft and launch vehicle testing, where similar test and measurement challenges exist.","Perhaps the two most exciting aspects of this project from the commercialization point of view are the ability to produce a wireless sensor platform that can be used throughout the flight test community, and to produce a wireless network that can support hundreds of different measurement channels in a single platform. Beyond NASA, the flight test community in the USA also includes DoD organizations and commercial aircraft companies.

The primary objectives of this Phase I proposal are to develop and demonstrate solutions to the two main problems that BMC has encountered in scaling up its DM design and manufacturing processes to array sizes of 4000 actuators or more: (1) keyhole voids occurring during manufacturing (reducing manufacturing yield) and (2) dielectric breakdown occurring during device operation (causing irreversible damage to the device). The technical approach will involve changes in DM processing technology and actuator geometry, and these will be validated in an abbreviated fabrication run at a MEMS foundry. The project goals are responsive to NASA Solicitation Topic S2.01, Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronography, which calls for research on process technology needed to improve repeatability, yield, and performance precision of high precision DMs. Boston Micromachines Corporation (BMC) is currently a leading supplier of such DMs worldwide.  If successful, this project will result in a modified process technology for DM production that eliminates manufacturing yield losses due to keyhole voids while improving DM surface quality. It will also result in a modified DM actuator design that is far less susceptible to operational damage due to dielectric breakdown, improving both reliability and lifetime.","The main potential NASA commercial applications which are in need of deformable mirrors with improved yield, performance and reliability over the current state-of-the-art are space-based astronomical imaging systems, such as direct imaging of exoplanets with coronagraphic telescopes. As more, larger telescopes are constructed, they will require control of light using adaptive optics over a large aperture. By improving yield, they will be able to better compensate for optical aberrations, increase overall though-put resulting from reduced diffractive losses, and simplify instrument design by eliminating the need for spatial filters in the optical path to mitigate diffractive effects. This will enhance the ability to create clear images. Also, by improving actuator yield, MEMS deformable mirrors will be able to be better serve long term missions. Finally, deformable mirrors with lower operating voltage will also enable diffraction-limited performance for many space-based optical systems such as space-based observatories, interferometric telescopes and coronagraphic instruments. The development of this deformable mirror technology will ultimately increase the capabilities of NASA missions, directly coinciding with the 2011 NASA Strategic Plan.","Small stroke, high precision deformable mirrors have commercial applications. The following applications apply to high resolution devices as well as other products produced by Boston Micromachines that benefit from new manufacturing processes developed which increase yield, performance and reliability.Space surveillance:BMC has success developing arrays up to 4096 elements for astronomy which can be used for space-based systems. These programs are funded by Department of Defense administrations with classified agendas.Optical communication:Lasercomm systems would benefit from this new architecture for long-range secure communication.  Also, fiber optic communications can take advantage of our devices in an optical switching capacity.Microscopy:The capabilities of non-adaptive optics-enabled Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) and Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy(SLO) devices have reached their limits. By increasing reliability, performance and yield, the component cost for deformable mirrors will enable users to purchase high-resolution equipment for use in detecting disease. Other modalities affected include two-photon excitation fluorescence (2PEF) and coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS).Pulse-Shaping:Laser science strives to create a better shaped pulse for applications such as laser marking and machining, and material ablation and characterization.

The InGaAsN alloy material will be lattice matched to Ge, which is a clear improvement over existing inverted metamorphic (IMM) technology, specifically, the existing lattice-mismatched InGaAs 1.0 eV bottom cell is replaced with a lattice-matched InGaAsN 1.18 eV bottom cell.  This eliminates the need to grow a thick graded buffer layer.

To this end, NASA has several airborne Doppler lidar platforms (e.g., DAWN, MACAWS) that are capable of mapping 3D wind vectors. These systems are large, heavy, and costly, requiring full-sized crewed aircraft (e.g., DC-8) to operate them and provide 3D wind measurements only along a single direction, thus limiting their utility. To address this barrier, Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) proposes a 3D wind sensor system with low size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements that can be deployed on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wider coverage and cheaper operation. The proposed system is built around exclusive electro-optic beam scanner technology and many commercial off-the-shelf components from the telecom industry. Current mechanical beam scanning solutions are heavy, power hungry, and slow, and constitute a significant portion of the mass of 3D wind sensors and other optical sensor platforms. In contrast, BNS' non-mechanical beam scanner can reduce scanner mass by an order of magnitude and power consumption by three orders of magnitude, while simultaneously providing new mission capabilities such as fast random-access scanning and hemispherical sensor coverage.Phase I will fully characterize the impact of the beam scanner on Doppler lidar measurements and demonstrate recovery of 3D velocity vectors using an existing low-SWaP short-range Doppler lidar prototype developed for long-range rifle ballistics. In Phase II, BNS will partner with an existing lidar wind sensor contractor for development of the full UAV wind sensor prototype using either BNS' existing lidar prototype or integrating BNS' low-SWaP beam scanner onto the partner's wind sensing platform, as desired by NASA.","The full UAV-deployable 3D wind sensor platform that is to be developed in this two-phase effort is anticipated to have multiple applications relevant to current or upcoming NASA missions. Specific recent and ongoing relevant NASA missions include:   - Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3)  - Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS)  - Development and Evaluation of Satellite Validation Tools by Experimenters (DEVOTE),  - Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP). In more general terms, the proposed wind sensor will have applications in any airborne NASA mission seeking to better understand tropospheric wind patterns, weather dynamics, and climate processes while aiding calibration and validation of satellite-bound technologies for global wind measurement and extraterrestrial wind sensing missions (e.g., Venus).The technology developed in this project, especially the versatile lidar beam scanning system in Phase I, can be tailored for a number of other NASA sensor platforms as well, such as for differential absorption lidar (DIAL) or other absorption-based optical sensing techniques.","The 3D wind sensor and non-mechanical beam steering technology have numerous commercial applications outside of NASA as well. With the ability to incorporate forward looking wind sensing, the platform can provide a low-SWaP package for hazard prediction for commercial and private aviation. Additionally, the sensor would be well suited to deployment on wind farms for guiding and controlling power-generating wind turbines. The sensor is particularly well suited for this application because the low-SWaP package is ideal for mounting directly to a turbine or even packaging in an ocean-going buoy for sea-based wind farms. Such a buoy network would also have weather warning and prediction applications.The fundamental innovation of the non-mechanical beam steering technology has an even wider array of potential commercial applications. Within the Department of Defense, BNS plans to continue pursuing development of this technology for applications such as munitions seeker tracking, passive imaging, and conventional hard-target lidar. For civilian applications, lidar technology is being employed in a variety of applications such as automobile collision avoidance, autonomous robotics, noncontact structure analysis, topographical mapping and target identification.

The design and implementation of a coherent Lidar (for wind measurement) for airborne and particularly for spaced-based measurements is a balance between several opposing factors if it is to operate affectively on small, unmanned platforms, whether they are space-based or not. The system must be: Compact – in order to meet restrictive size and weight requirementsEfficient – limited power will be available for operationReliable – missions are expensive and time-consuming on a graduated  level from manned airborne, to unmanned terrestrial, to space-based   platforms.Powerful – high-energy performance will be required for long range   measurements.Eye-safe – for many Earth observation missionsIn order to meet these criteria Sibelloptics proposes a Phase 1 SBIR to perform a conceptual design of an adaptation of the Windimager ground-based system to a compact Lidar system for initial deployment on airborne platforms and eventual deployment on satellite systems and planetary rovers for future NASA missions.

The effort will begin with an interagency collaborative ""Brainernet"" brainstorming session to identify and assess technology and concept drivers and opportunities. Detailed configuration, aerodynamics, performance, and mission analysis will complement the effort, culminating in three flagship TeDP or hybrid electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) concepts which embody the propulsion-airframe-thermal integration (PATI) paradigm. A 2D and 3D CFD evaluation of the integrated propulsor will validate the physics-based aerodynamics and propulsor analysis tools.

Solid-state lasers fail to provide the necessary E-O requirements due to low quantum efficiency and excess heat generation. MHz-speed modulation formats are not supported by fiber lasers at very high average powers due to nonlinearities. These nonlinearities cause instabilities in the output power, and also cause the optical spectrum to exceed the system requirements. A very high power, short pulse fiber laser is proposed which can operate in two modes of operation; a targeting/beacon mode, and a data transmit mode. The very high average powers are achieved by filling the time-slot of a PPM format scheme with a high-duty-cycle sequence of much shorter pulses. This allows the nonlinearities in the fiber laser to be mitigated and allow very high average powers within the required bandwidth spectrum. A seed laser which emits picosecond pulses will be driven by electronics to provide a very high duty cycle modulated by a slower modulation envelope to allow for PPM data transmission. The very high duty cycle will allow the average power to increase while keeping the peak powers low through a series of Yb-doped fiber amplifiers. A factor of two is targeted between the peak and average powers. The fiber amplifiers will used highly doped Yb-doped fibers in order to keep the fiber lengths to a minimum, which minimizes nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and self-phase modulation (SPM). The modulation format to support the targeting/beacon mode will be accomplished by turning the final fiber amplifier(s) on/off. This is possible due to the upper state lifetime of the Yb ions in the fiber amplifiers.","The Jet Propulsion Lab (NASA JPL) facility is pursuing technology to enable a long range optical telecommunication system involving a communications laser, telescope, satellite, and receiver. A very high average power, PPM format communications laser can be used to form a high speed data link with satellites orbiting the Earth and potentially to satellites or stationary targets on other celestial bodies. Long range optical telecommunication systems based on optical technology can help negate the expense of large, cumbersome transmitter and receiver systems based on other technologies, such as radio frequencies, due to the diffraction properties of the transmitted frequency.","Laser-based manufacturing and the directed energy communities can benefit from kW-class, pulsed fiber laser technology. Precise drilling and cutting of various materials with ns-pulse lasers is currently a reality for up to 100 Watts of output. The increased average powers and shorter pulses offered by this technology can increase throughput for laser-based manufacturing, and/or allow thicker materials to be more precisely cut and drilled. The directed energy community has been engaged in high average power laser technology for several years now. These sources are currently operated in continuous wave (CW) mode with a narrow bandwidth in order to combine multiple sources to further increase the average powers. High average power, pulsed laser technology, especially with an arbitrary waveform format, may offer distinct advantages for not only depositing energy on the target, but aid in sensor-defeat methods as well.","Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lasers (Communication); Transmitters/Receivers; Waveguides/Optical Fiber (see also Optics)",Long Range Optical Telecommunications   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Spectabit's digital focusing schlieren approach has greatly improved a widely used aerodynamics tool and rendered it so robust, user friendly, and productive that it can be used in test facilities and environments that have been prohibitive before. We have identified several key adaptations to this technology which can make it applicable to the submicrosecond time resolutions often required in hypervelocity testing environments. Some of these adaptations may be useful in other high-speed imaging techniques by enabling the suppression of laser speckle. The digital schlieren concept represents the first major improvement in schlieren imaging in over 150 years, a true quantum jump in the technology. Conversion to digital obviates many of the long-standing problems with focusing schlieren systems that are associated with precisely matching the cutoff grid to the background light pattern. Because the system is digital, the control software can perform real-time image enhancement as well. Consequently, the most severe hardware production and alignment restrictions are now software problems that are solvable continuously, quickly, and inexpensively in real time.

We propose a method using aircraft transponder activation and data science modeling to estimate earliest takeoff time and runway.  Fast-time simulations of IADS concepts require models of how ramp controllers manage near-gate aircraft movements; and how flight operators will interact with collaborative departure scheduling concepts.  We propose to develop a model, with defined interfaces to be usable in any NASA simulation platform, for conflict/congestion-free aircraft movements in alleyways, coordinated to allow efficient, simultaneous movements.  We will also offer a model for flight operator's swapping gate delays to free needed gates and prioritize their schedules.  These models are also relevant to NASA's SARDA and SMART NAS projects.  We will document the model designs, deliver all source code, and, in Phase 2, publish models under and Open Source license.","The proposed SBIR will complete work that is highly beneficial to NASA, work that can directly benefit NASA's IADS research, ATD-2 project, SARDA research, and SMART NAS goals.  The method for estimating departure times and runways at secondary airports could be used at airports near DFW to support NASA's IADS research.  It could also be used as part of the ATD-2 project, wherever NASA chooses to focus that research.  The modeling of ramp operations and flight operator behaviors can be used to improve fast-time simulation capabilities that are used to study ATD-2 and other IADS concepts and by NASA's SARDA research.  Furthermore, these models can be included in NASA's SMART NAS model repository, to benefit any SMART NAS users that require high fidelity models of these aspects of NAS operations.","The primary potential application for this work outside of NASA is with the FAA.  The method for providing departure status information from secondary airports could be deployed NAS-wide.  Every large airport is surrounded by smaller airports that increasingly are placing demand on shared departure resources.  Whatever IADS technologies the FAA deploys beyond IDAC, they will benefit from having the information provided by this concept.  Like NASA, the FAA must study and evaluate IADS technologies.  The models of ramp operations and flight operator participation in airport collaborative surface/departure concepts will enable higher-fidelity simulation studies, reducing concept risk and providing more accurate benefits estimates.  Other research organizations conducting IADS research will also benefit from these modes, which we intend to offer under an Open Source license in Phase 2.  The models of flight operator behavior could lead to commercial products to aid flight operators in interacting with surface CDM systems.",Air Transportation & Safety; Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling,Autonomy of the National Airspace System (NAS)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This new photonic integration platform is based on our existing low-loss SiN/SiO2 PLC photonic integration technology and incorporates a doped Aluminum Oxide layer for gain. One key resonant waveguide optical gyro design constraint is the relationship between the waveguide length, which can increase the Sagnac effect, and waveguide loss, which decreases the gyro resolution. Freedom Photonics'  low loss SiN PLC platform is clearly an adequate path forward for record-breaking Gyro performance.  With introduction of gain into the PLC, new possibilities arise for enhanced sensitivity, simplified control electronics, and ultra compact and robust designs.","The primary focus of this program is to provide high-performance low c-SWaP optical gyroscopes to NASA for evaluation on the ISS.

Therefore air cabin filtration technologies should be improved for future spacecrafts to efficiently remove the range of particulate matter sizes (nano to micron size). It is also desirable to have the new particulate air filters that can be efficiently remove volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and self-regenerated. This will reduce the logistics burden of carrying additional replacement filters on-board. In the proposed Phase I effort, smart fibrous filters with both particle and VOC removal capacities will be developed. The new particulate filters will be much more efficient than the current HEPA filters and also capable of self-regenerating. The Phase I effort will focus on demonstration of the 'proof of concept' that fibrous filters can filter and remove the ultrafine (<0.5 μm) particulates and destructively adsorb organic chemicals such as acetone. The technical approach will also involve regeneration of filters using a low-energy process. In the Phase II project, selective filtration membranes will be designed and modified to fit the NASA's current cabin air filtration systems.","Air-borne particulates and toxic organic chemicals pose a threat to the crew members' lungs and can also damage sensitive equipment.

The LIDAR provides both Raman Spectra for determination of the surface chemical content for leak detection and HD6D imaging consisting of ultra high range accuracy 3D LIDAR and RGB camera images fused to give an HD resolution image.  Range accuracy for the HD6D is 15 microns to a range of 3 meters with a maximum range of 300m.  This capability draws on SPEC part inspection LIDAR.  The chemical detection capability can detect one molecule thick layers adsorbed on surfaces determining chemical content, allowing detection of leaks in pressurized or vacuum conditions with a range of 30m.  The 3D imaging allows surface imperfections like micro meteor or debris holes to be highlighted, and the chemical content map to be draped on the 3D display. The 3D imaging rate is from 3.2Mpps.  The laser transmits an FMCW modulated signal allowing the extreme range accuracy.  The 3D imaging uses a 1550nm 2 stage EDFA, while Raman Spectral uses a unit diode, wafer laminate laser at 532nm, induced to operate in a Q-switch mode by modulating the pump.","The Raman Spectra, high range resolution LIDAR can be used for chemical detection, structural defect mapping and navigation for free flight inspection robots.

This is the driving spirit behind NASA's increasing interest in the CubeSat platform, and the vision that is guiding development and demonstration of higher-risk technologies that can eventually lead to low-cost atmospheric science from CubeSats.  For example, a tantalizing next-generation CubeSat system would combine a high-gain deployable antenna with a high-frequency Ka-band transponder to support very high bandwidth communications on the order of 10s of Mbps and/or very high-resolution radiometric remote sensing of atmospheric phenomenon.To address this need, Roccor proposes to develop a Ka-band deployable mesh antenna that can package within a 2U-3U CubeSat volume and deploy to diameters of 0.8-1.5m.  The so-called ""ROC-Rib"" antenna employs a backing structure that is a hybrid wrap-rib/perimeter-truss design.  A net supports a reflective mesh while the entire assembly provides the structural depth and surface accuracy needed for Ka-band operation.","The primary NASA target application for the proposed ROC-Rib deployable antenna technology is future NASA CubeSat and SmallSat spacecraft for which communications up/downlink or passive RF remote sensing measurement resolution is a major bottleneck in the system design.  In particular, the proposed technology will enable very high bandwidth communications on the order of 10s of Mbps and/or very high-resolution radiometric remote sensing of atmospheric phenomenon.","Beyond NASA applications, the proposed ROC-Rib deployable antenna technology could see use in other military and commercial applications where data up/downlink or passive RF sensing is also a considerable need.

The EMOS is based on use of novel materials for high-temperature operation and uniquely designed fiber optic microsensors. The EMOS system is capable of simultaneously measuring multiple TPS response parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, and heat flux) using a suite of miniature (diameter <400 micron) fiber optic Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometric sensors. EMOS will tolerate operating temperatures >1500 degrees C and measurement errors within 0.4% for temperature sensors, 0.2% for pressure sensors, and 20% for heat flux measurement. In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of EMOS for in-situ measurement of TPS responses in an aerothermal environment by fabricating and testing a technology readiness level (TRL)-4 prototype, with the goal of achieving TRL-6 by the end of Phase II.","The proposed EMOS will provide for NASA a distributed and embedded in situ system for measurement of TPS responses in aerothermal and aerodynamic environments. The proposed EMOS sensor system will provide better traceability from the modeling and design tools to actual performance, because the resultant EMOS sensor data can lead to higher-fidelity design tools, improved risk quantification, decreased heat shield mass, and increases in direct payload. For specific NASA applications, EMOS microsensors can be applied to different types of ablative materials used for TPS including, but not limited to PICA, PICA-X, SIRCA, Superlight Ablator (SLA), and Avcoat, and those under development for planetary aerocapture and entry as well as return to Earth.","Military applications of the EMOS system will include health monitoring of military aircraft components. The military will benefit from this technology by incorporating EMOS into the engine and drivetrain components of rotorcraft to monitor, in situ and in real time, potential component failure, to reduce the amount of inspection and testing required, and increase reliability and mission availability. Commercial applications include industrial control and heavy equipment used in construction and mining operations, health monitoring of commercial aircraft engines, drivetrain systems, and utility systems. An immediate application of the EMOS system will be monitoring coal-fired power plants, natural-gas-based power plants, geothermal plants, as well as other power-generation facilities throughout the nation.

However, the hurdle of operation safety in the form of avoiding airborne collisions must first be overcome.  Radar is ideally suited for this purpose due to their all weather capability to provide accurate position and velocity data.  UAVradars LLC is proposing a small, lightweight, and low-power radar system designed specifically to give small UAS (UAS < 50 lbs) airborne situation awareness capability.  The proposed radar is based on previous R&D funded by NASA LEARN at the University of Kansas from 2012 – 2014.  This effort resulted in a brassboard proof-of-concept radar system that was successfully flight tested onboard a Cessna 172.  The brassboard system was then miniaturized demonstrating the feasibility of reducing its size, weight and power consumption.  The proposed SBIR objectives focuses on three technical objectives needed to commercialize this radar.  Objective 1 is to develop a FPGA controller/processor that can replace the user laptop allowing UAS flight testing in phase II. Objective 2 is to move the radar operation to the ISM band to avoid FCC complications (supporting NASA's goal to simplify certification needs) and to adaptively allocate the radar operating frequency to maximize detection performance.  Objective 3 is to encode each radar's transmit with a random phase allowing multiple radar carrying UASs to operate within the same area without cross-jamming one another.  By performing these tasks, the resulting phase I radar system will meet NASA's need for UAS technology that would allow humans to safely operate multiple UAS with minimal oversight, and provide the foundation for UAS external perception/cognition and multi-vehicle cooperation.  Phase I will result in simulation, hardware in the loop testing, and analysis of all three objectives leveraging the existing prototype miniature radar system.","NASA currently has multiple UAS applications/technology development programs which could benefit from the proposed situation awareness radar system.  NASA's Autonomous Robust Avionics (AuRA) would benefit from the radar's ability to reduce operator workload.  In Phase II & III the radar will be integrated with an adaptive flight controller such as the one being developed at the University of Kansas from which the proposed radars obtains its detection range requirements.  Either as a stand-alone sensor or integrated with other devices, the situation awareness provided by the radar could greatly affect the rules and regulations for remotely operated aircraft in the national airspace (ROA in the NAS) which NASA, the FAA, and other agencies are collaborating on.  NASA Earth Science Capability Demonstration (ESCD) could utilize the radar to allow UAS to carry out dangerous missions such as remote sensing in hostile environments.  Finally, since radars are capable of operating in outer space and the proposed situation awareness radar has strict limitations on size, weight, and power, there could be a potential space mission application.","The commercial UAS market worldwide is already a multibillion dollar industry in which the U.S. is lagging.  Some commercial uses include agriculture, film/photography, academia, package delivery, law enforcement, and by hobbyists for recreation.  The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) has predicted a multibillion dollar U.S. economy for commercial UAS in the next ten years.  However, to achieve this possibility, UAS operation must first be made safe.  The proposed radar system will be a critical sensor in achieving the necessary safety level due to its all weather, stand-alone (not reliant on a wireless data link), detection capability.  Therefore, any commercial application for UAS is essentially a commercial application of the radar system.  This could include precision agriculture, the movie industry, pipeline monitoring, search and rescue, border patrol, package delivery, and many more.  By phase III, UAVradars will work towards developing sensor and autopilot integration with the radar system providing a complete airborne collision-avoidance package to make these applications even more commercially viable.  In the meantime, a marketing strategy for promoting the radar system during each technical development stage is being formulated so that the product can be commercialized as soon as possible and allows for multiple revenue streams.","Air Transportation & Safety; Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Perception/Vision; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Prototyping; Radio; Simulation & Modeling",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

NASA customers include active structures like complex space-based deployable telescopes. Phases I/II advance MFC actuator materials to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or better for space.Implications of the innovationWhile piezocomposites needed for active structure control have flown and are space qualified their performance under actuation and sensing has not been quantified under minimal thermal protection to enable large deployable precision structures like 10–30 m class space telescope observatories. Data is needed on the viability of piezocomposites as control actuators for space missions. MFCs also enable active structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques that expand the potential commercial market.Technical objectivesCVS uses a CubeSat to conduct LEO tests. CubeSats provide low-cost rapid access to space-based testing. CVS leverages our previous NASA research and builds on our TRL 5 prototype, which is defined as a CubeSat payload. Our preliminary work found an unexpected deviation in the behavior of composite actuators reacting to thermal cycles like those experienced in LEO. Without suitable compensation, this atypical behavior could cause imprecise mechanical performance in active space structures.

Phase II delivers a fully operational and certified CVS CubeSat.","CVS is the first extensive spaceflight validation for piezocomposite actuator materials. CVS will establish operational limits, determine long-duration space environmental exposure trends, and evaluate thermal compensation options for the piezocomposite materials needed to control large-scale precision space structures. Piezocomposite material applications include active control of composite reflectors, large sunshields, external occulters, large solar arrays for solar electric propulsion and other active structures. Examples include structures like the OCT Lightweight Materials and Structures long-duration deployables. Maintaining the shape of large, high-precision reflectors will be quite difficult; active reflectors that adjust their shape in situ will be cheaper and lighter. Other structures of interest include lightweight deployable hatches for manned inflatable structures. Additionally, an active, mission-capable SHM system has applications like crew safety, ISS utilization, deep-space missions, vehicle mass reduction, and Mars exploration. CVS is directly responsive to Topic S2.02, which calls for technologies that enable deploying large aperture telescopes at low cost.","Commercial space companies need SHM to reduce time to launch and operation costs and improve safety. These needs are particularly important for re-useable vehicles, where information on structural integrity during all stages of flight is important for flight recertification, validation of vehicle operation models, and prediction of remaining service life.

Land/marine structures include automobiles, trains, submarines, ships, and offshore structures. Military structures include helicopters, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and others. SHM is an emerging industry driven by an aging infrastructure, malicious humans, and the introduction of advanced materials and structures. SHM applications are also driven by a desire to lower costs by moving from schedule-based to condition-based maintenance.

To achieve this, NASA has proposed such projects as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE), and Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS).  In support of these programs, and in particular ASCENDS, Luminit, LLC, proposes to develop the innovative Multiwavelength Greenhouse Gas Lidar (MUGGLE).  The MUGGLE is a high-resolution spectroscopic measurement system that can detect and measure CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O (vapor) with great accuracy and speed.  The MUGGLE will be fully automated, using only eye-safe laser wavelengths and powers, with tunability and real-time calibration.  Through the use of cavity dumping, the MUGGLE will achieve laser linewidth <50 MHz for the best resolution, and significantly improves on existing greenhouse gas measurement technology.  During Phase I we will begin this research by studying the methods of measurement, designing a system, and fabricating a laboratory breadboard prototype, ending at TRL-4.  In Phase II we plan to further develop the MUGGLE, resulting in a TRL-6 engineering prototype that can be commercialized into both the specified device for NASA and an accurate system for measuring methane leakage.","NASA is seeking methods of measuring greenhouse gases at or below the surface of the Earth.  Luminit proposes to change the paradigm with a new technology and strong existing position on the manufacturing aspect of the equation with our >$12M annual commercial sales.  Our new technology leverages our manufacturing experience to develop inexpensive methods of manufacturing the MUGGLE.Systems like ASCENDS, OCO-2, GPM, GEO-CAPE, etc. will immediately benefit from MUGGLE technology. Other fielded projects will follow, e.g., ocean biology and biogeochemistry. NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers in these fields routinely measure in-water IOPs and the target market for sensors is extremely broad. The NASA Glenn Chemical Species Gas Sensors Team is developing gas sensing technology for aeronautic and space applications which can be addressed by the MUGGLE, especially if we consider that the laser rods can be changed to other materials in order to reach different spectral regions.  NASA is presently developing an Advanced EMU (AEMU) for exploration missions. These missions will require a robust, lightweight, and maintainable Portable Life Support System (PLSS). The PLSS attaches to the space suit pressure garment and provides approximately an 8 hour supply of oxygen for breathing, suit pressurization, ventilation; humidity, trace-contaminant, carbon dioxide (CO2) removal; this is an ideal application of MUGGLE technology, which can be miniaturized for this lower-power need.","Gas detection has a vital role in reducing the global effects of climate change (greenhouse gas measurement). Gas sensing technology has also become more significant because of its widespread and common applications in areas like industrial production (methane detection in mines); automotive industry (detection of polluting gases from vehicles); medical applications (simulating the human olfactory system); indoor air quality supervision (detection of carbon monoxide); environmental studies (greenhouse gas monitoring), etc. Multiple examples are found in carbon monoxide detection applications (gas detection equipment in enclosed parking structures, ambulance bays, fire halls, warehouses, loading docks, ice arenas, maintenance facilities and municipal works garages); and in detection of other gases such as ammonia and sulfur dioxide. Gas sensing is also important in industries like brewing and bottling and food aroma detection. Other Governmental Agencies are already and will become bigger actors in this market with the incorporation of gas sensors in unmanned aircraft systems (NSF, NRL, ONR, NOAA, DOD, as well as state environmental agencies), e.g., in ocean science and coastal monitoring.  There is also a large market for methane detection, to enable leak location from natural gas pipes and to probe output of oil refineries and other fossil fuel processing plants.  All these are direct applications of the MUGGLE.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)",Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Successful development of this technology will result in a device that effectively dries a hot, moist airstream to a dew point of no more than 10 degrees Celsius with no entrained water droplets in the dry air effluent.  Non-mechanical inertial forces are employed to collect liquid water condensate via centripetal action along a spiral flow path.  A continuously varying groove shape along the outer edge of the spiral geometry uses capillary forces to assist liquid transfer to a collection region near the device center.  The proposed technology is an integration of conventional finned condenser operation combined with static phase separation and capillary transport phenomena.  Droplet entrainment is prevented via surface adhesion and reduced exit gas velocities. Condensate and dry air exit along separate pathways, each orthogonal to the spiral flow plane.","The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future manned missions.  Separation and recovery of the valuable water resource from Environmental Control and Life Support process air streams is required to extend mission durations and help make feasible crewed space exploration beyond low Earth orbit.  Low power, microgravity compatibility of the NCCC technology is of fundamental importance in various manned exploration mission phases including Mars transit.",Condensate collection from saturated gas streams is a unit process widely employed throughout various industries and laboratory environments.

The system will provide onboard off-nominal state detection and isolation capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness.  The ability to autonomously isolate spacecraft failures to component levels will enable faster recovery thereby reducing down time. Model-based systems can provide better fault coverage than traditional limit-checking systems. The proposed system in particular will result in a relatively compact software package because it relies only on modeling nominal behavior; fault models are not needed. Thus this approach has the capability to detect any off-nominal behavior including un-modeled faults. Health information produced by the FM system can be used to make resource allocation and planning and scheduling decisions by ground operations or by other on-board autonomy agents. The system can be built and tested standalone potentially reducing FM developmental and testing costs. The FM system provides an evolutionary approach to full onboard autonomy as it can first be implemented and tested in ground-based systems and then migrated onboard spacecraft. Onboard fault management will be crucial to NASA mission success particularly during critical times where the situation changes rapidly and unpredictably with no opportunity for operator support.,"The need for the proposed capabilities is emerging as NASA seeks to provide higher quality fault management systems for its missions. The model-based fault detection and isolation system could support current and future programs with applications on the ground, in support of recovery operations, and in space, providing onboard autonomous fault detection and isolation. The fault management core diagnostic algorithms are general in nature and do not need tailoring to specific programs. User-supplied models allow customization to a particular target. Thus the developed system will be applicable to a very broad range of NASA mission classes from small to large, near-Earth to interplanetary, risk-adverse, and experimental. Ultimately, NASA and industry partner fault management products will enjoy a larger customer base. The potential market includes a wide range of customers from systems engineering, mission planning, and operations groups in all NASA centers especially ARC, JPL, and MSFC.","The need for robust and reliable onboard fault management will increase dramatically as spacecraft systems become more autonomous. The DoD's drive to increase situational awareness has already pushed it into exploration of autonomy-enabling architectures, including improved fault detection and isolation techniques, which will only increase as spacecraft autonomy moves into the broader spacecraft industry. The solution consists of diagnostic algorithms that utilize models provided by the users. The system can thereby be targeted for virtually any mission class. The proposed model-based FM solution is particularly well suited for spacecraft with modular HW/SW architectures. These new architectures will require updated approaches to FM and tools to support them.

There are two modes of operation of such a cavity.  In the active mode, the system is a superluminal ring laser (SRL) that experiences an anomalous dispersion caused by the gain medium.  In the passive mode, the system is a white light cavity (WLC) that experiences an anomalous dispersion caused by an intra-cavity medium or via coupling to another cavity or another mode in the same cavity.   We will investigation the development several closely related technologies based on the fast light effect:  gyroscopes, accelerometers and general purpose fiber-optic sensors.   For each technology, we will primarily pursue the active approach.  The gyroscope will be based on using a pair of spatially overlapping  SRLs realized via Raman gains, with Raman depletion used for anomalous dispersion.   The accelerometer will be realized by using a similar system, but with two lasers that are spatially shifted with respect to each other.  The fiber-optic sensor will be based on using a pair of Brillouin gain based SRLs, where the anomalous dispersion is produced via coupling to a cavity.   In addition, for each device, we will investigate theoretically some passive techniques in order to determine relative advantages and tradeoffs between the two approaches.   Specifically, for the gyroscope and the accelerometer, we will investigate the use of couple cavity based WLCs;  for the fiber-optic sensor, we will investigate the use of a WLC realized by dual-peaked Brillouin gain.  The particular mode of operation to be pursued for developing a practical version of each of these devices under Phase II will be established in accordance with the findings of the Phase I effort, and potential feedback and guidance received from the NASA program manager.   Northwestern University, with Prof. Shahriar as the PI, will be a subcontractor.","The gyroscopes and accelerometers developed in this program will have substantially improved sensitivity and reduced SWaP compared to conventional technology. These will find use for navigation of NASA space vehicles of all sorts, where SWaP concerns and precise navigation are critical. These technologies may also enable an array of new scientific missions, such as gravitational mapping of subsurface geologic features and gravity wave detection. An ultrasensitive gyroscope may also enable a critical test of general relativity via measurement of the gravitational frame dragging effect to an unprecedented accuracy.  An ultra-sensitive fiber-optic sensor may be enable precise measurement of strain, temperature, magnetic field and other effects under conditions relevant to NASA missions.","The gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sensors developed in this program will enable improved navigation accuracy at reduced SWaP cost, much as they do in NASA space vehicles. In addition, they can be used in atmospheric and terrestrial vehicles and ordnance for positioning and navigation in GPS-denied environments, a critical need for many military applications. The improved SWaP performance of these systems would be particularly useful in UAV navigation. High-sensitivity accelerometers can also be used in improved vibration sensors, with an array of applications in seismometry and subsurface explosion detection for nuclear non-proliferation applications.

The resulting input device should provide mouse-like functionality and need minimal hand use. Cybernet proposes a solution that does not require any hand or glove control. Instead, we propose an input device that uses purposes eye-blinks, eye motions, and limited vocal commands for display menu navigation.Our reasoning is that the astronaut, especially on EVA, needs a method of accessing display menus in a minimally intrusive way. Their hands are usually occupied, and so using them for mouse-like gestures is impractical. Taking a cue from Google Glass, and based on our previously developed eye tracking system and voice interaction system developed separately for NASA, we are confident we can create a system that takes purposes eye blinks and motions that allows the astronaut to navigate display menus without interfering with other work. Specifically, during the Phase I we will create a feasibility demonstration that does the following: eye gaze, purposive eye blinks, and limited vocabulary voice commands. The combination of the above three input methods should be relatively easy to learn and use (i.e. minimal practice) and should not interfere with normal EVA operations. What is needed, though, is a small camera/microphone that is located within the astronaut's helmet that continually has a view of one or both of the astronaut's eyes. During the Phase I we will implement a feasibility proof of the above input methods and research appropriate hardware. During the Phase II we will acquire hardware similar for a full prototype system that will enable us to demonstrate low SWAP, as well as measure accuracy and utility.","The major goal of this project is to research and develop an input device that provides astronauts performing EVAs  mouse-like functionality to navigate display menus.  The concept demonstrated to the sponsor in this Phase I is intended to show the sponsor that we have shown feasibility through use of eye gaze detection, eye blink detection, voice recognition and speech understanding. This technology will then be refined and integrated into a complete prototype system in Phase II that is sensitive to size, weight, and power limitations.  Some of the main tasks include the plan for integration into an astronaut's helmet, updated interface controls, and mechanical/hardware integration design.  These development tasks will guide us toward a solution that is both practical and useful.

Deployment ground testing of these structures is a uniquely difficult task as the intent is to validate 0g performance and integrity in a 1g testing environment. Existing gravity offloading test support equipment use passive offloading in which offloader tracking is driven by the deployment of the array itself. This approach introduces strong coupling between the test article and the offloader equipment, which affects deployment dynamics and hence accuracy of the simulated 0g response. ATA Engineering proposes to improve existing gravity offloader equipment through the development of an actively controlled system that minimizes the mechanical coupling between the test array and the offloader system. This active system will make use of position sensors to provide data for necessary corrective action as well as analytical models of the offloader and test article to provide predictive capabilities. When paired with actuators on the offloader system, the combined predictor-corrector system will substantially improve ground test 0g simulations. Phase I of this SBIR project will demonstrate increased realism of 0g test conditions by producing demonstration hardware that incorporates the suite of sensors and actuators with an analytical model of the offloader system. In Phase II, an active offloader system will be designed, built, and used to test a state-of-the-art solar array system.","Envisioned NASA missions over the coming decades involve ambitious destinations such as near-earth asteroids, the Moon, and Mars, and activities such as sample return and deep space exploration. These missions will require a new paradigm of very large, yet lightweight, structural systems for deployable components such as solar arrays, antennas, instrument booms, solar sails, trusses, and inflatable habitats. Qualifying these unprecedented structures will require new testing approaches, such as the proposed gravity offloading system which could be used in deployment, structural dynamics, and durability testing. The need for this technology is imminent as NASA has recently selected SEP spacecraft concepts for further study in adapting them to the agency's Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM). The NASA Technology Demonstration Missions SEP Project is currently seeking information from potential vendors regarding the development of 25 kW advanced, flexible-blanket solar array systems for SEP flight demonstration missions. The envisioned technology demonstrator, which will first be evaluated aboard the International Space Station (ISS), must also be extensible to power levels greater than 100 kW. Examples of planned NASA missions and activities that could also benefit from the technology include Starshade, Sunjammer, activity simulation in sub-g extraterrestrial environments, and astronaut training as a potential replacement for underwater training.","A significant commercial market exists for the proposed gravity offloading technology in the qualification of non-NASA spacecraft. Most notably, U.S. military reconnaissance satellites (SIGINT/COMINT) are believed to require extremely large antenna arrays to conduct their missions. We believe that, as with NASA's future lightweight deployable structures, Department of Defense and commercial spacecraft will also push the limits of current ground test capabilities and stand to benefit from a capability to simulate 0-g conditions during qualification testing. ATA has significant experience in the analysis and testing of these components and has experienced the challenges associated with dynamic testing using conventional gravity offloading technology first hand.","Deployment; Lifetime Testing; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

As detailed in NASA's Phase I solicitation subtopic ""S1.02  Microwave Technologies for Remote Sensing"", the needed power amplifier should exhibit greater than 32W of saturated output power (Psat) with a power-added efficiency (PAE) over 20%. The amplifier should maintain over 35dB gain within the frequency range of 35.5 GHz to 35.9GHz, and be implemented in a single-package solution with small form factor of less than 1cm3. To enable versatility and scalability to future scientific space applications, as well as radar and satellite communications applications that may operate in slightly modified frequency bands, the proposed amplifier will be designed to exceed the NASA requirements detailed above.

To date we've been using this method to embed wiring harnesses and heaters into structures.

The resulting innovation yields CFRP structures with multiple functionalities:1) transmitting electrical power2) transmitting electrical signals3) heating4) sensing strain due to loading5) sensing residual strain due to manufacturing6) sensing crack propagation7) sensing temperatureThe innovation is enabled by a novel combination of materials within a shared manufacturing process.  The material combination makes use of common carbon fibers that are conductive and demonstrate peizoresitive properties.  By layering and arranging these materials in a novel manner, the functionalities listed above can be realized.  Given that these sensing materials are in-situ (i.e. the materials are all fiber based and share a common matrix material) structural integrity is not compromised and the sensors are more likely to survive a lifetime of cyclic loading.  Additionally, because the sensory materials and conductors are all fiber-based, automated manufacturing techniques (e.g. automated fiber placement) can be utilized to reduce manufacturing costs.The embedded technologies, in combination with Aurora's self- aware aircraft tools, promise to reduce weight, increase performance, and life expectancy of aircraft.","Space Launch System (SLS).

Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and yield benchtop technology ready for transition to a UAS-compatible prototype in Phase II.","The proposed DMS technology will meet the NASA's need to add in situ cloud measurement capabilities to small research UAS's. Deployment of the DMS implemented as a compact and lightweight economic package on small UAS's will result in reduced costs and improved coverage of the NASA's UAS-based atmospheric measurement campaigns. Precise and extensive cloud characterization data will lead to better understanding of the contribution of atmospheric clouds to Earth's radiative budget and climate change. Other potential applications include characterization of atmospheric aerosols, particulate matter in volcanic ash plumes and fuel sprays.","The proposed DMS will be of interest to research institutions and government agencies involved in atmospheric measurements. Flexibility and low cost of the proposed technology will make it compatible with a variety of airborne- and ground-based platforms and suitable for other applications such as characterization of atmospheric aerosols, volcanic ash plumes and industrial/agricultural sprays.",Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Image Processing; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics),Unmanned Aircraft and Sounding Rocket Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To address (c), substantial enhancement has been predicted through large intracavity (normal) dispersion dn/df. The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate experimentally this enhancement, in combination with demonstrating the absence of dead band (d) in a solid state laser. A key element is the realization that it is possible to engineer a mode-locked laser where the pulse envelope velocity is controlled by other parameters than the dispersion. We have demonstrated this property in a mode-locked laser with intracavity Fabry-Perot and with  intracavity resonant atomic vapor. This property will be exploited in Phase I by inserting in a ring mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser a Fabry-Perot and a Rubidium cell, to demonstrate simultaneously the enhancement of the gyro sensitivity, the use of a solid state gain medium in a gyro, and the  absence of dead band. In Phase II, these results will be implemented in a mode-locked fiber laser gyro, to demonstrate the light and efficient instrument required for space applications.","The result of phase II will be a laser gyro extremely light weight (a laser ring cavity made of a fiber) that can be expanded over a very large perimeter, thus have a very large scale factor, enhanced by resonant interaction (""fast light""). As opposed to the actual He-Ne gyro that has to be dithered by giving it a periodic motion, there will be no mechanical part  in this gyro. Further development can transform this device into a linear accelerometer.","A light weight expandable gyro has application in commercial navigation. Because the fiber laser can be made of very large perimeter, it has applications in monitoring the motion of tectonic plates.",Navigation & Guidance,Slow and Fast Light   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The PHP technology takes advantage of the large latent heat associated with phase change of a working fluid that is confined to small capillaries to carry heat efficiently from evaporator regions to a condenser that is attached to the cold head of the cryocooler.  This system will have an advantage over other distributed cooling approaches because it will be modular and can interface with any cooler that provides the required cooling power at the load temperature.  The cooler may be a Stirling cooler, Pulse Tube cooler, reverse-Brayton cooler, Joule Thompson cooler, or some hybrid combination of these.  Because the fluid flow is driven by fluid phase change caused by a temperature difference between the evaporators and the condenser, the loop is self-regulating.  Flow is induced only when there is a thermal load.  Also, because surface tension forces are dominant in the small capillaries of the PHP, this technology is suited for use in microgravity.","The PHP has many possible applications within NASA. These include distributed cooling systems for zero boil off cryogenic storage tanks, in particular for actively cooled shields that may be used to eliminate the need for internal mixing with spray bars. The PHP could also be used to provide distributed cooling for radiation shields and large optical elements used in infrared space science missions.","There are also Missile Defense Agency applications, such as surveillance systems incorporating LWIR focal planes that require cooling of focal planes and optics to temperatures less than 40K. In addition, there are many commercial applications such as cooling superconducting power lines, superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage and MRI magnets for medical applications.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Heat Exchange; Passive Systems,Cryogenic Fluid Management for In-Space Transportation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Aviation loss of control (LOC) accidents often results from stalls and uncertain weather/flow conditions, often at low altitudes e.g., take-off/landing. We propose to develop a robust sensor system to assess stall conditions and surface boundary layer phenomena through the use of a low-weight system consisting of surface flow sensors that: (1) use a robust transduction mechanism, (2) is operable under adverse weather conditions, e.g., rain, (3) has a one-time lifetime calibration with a minimal maintenance schedule, (4) provides monotonic output with speed and flow angle, and (5) relatively insensitive to environmental parameters such as flight altitude, pressure, temperature, and density. This technology increases sensor robustness as output for control feedback for a wide range of flight regimes and flow conditions.","The proposed innovation has commercial applications for the airline industry whose current focus is on safety and efficiency. All-weather air data systems are beneficial for aircraft health monitoring & warning systems. Faults related to aircraft air data systems have been a  cause of loss-of-control accidents and incidents. For example, an airspeed sensing system fault is suspected of triggering a chain of events that resulted in the loss of Air France flight 447; faulty angle- of-attack sensing is suspected of causing uncommanded motion in the crash of Qantas Flight 72; and faulty air data calibration due to moisture was suspected of causing uncommanded motion resulting in a stall and subsequent crash of the B-2A bomber in Guam. Sensor redundancy is necessary but may not be sufficient to ensure safety and reliability of the flight systems, e.g., common mode failures across redundant sensors such as Pitot tube icing in all airspeed sensors. Therefore, all-weather air data systems with transduction mechanisms different from pressure-based Pitot tubes mitigates the common mode failure to ensure sufficient redundancy through independent air data measurements.","The ability to cruise efficiently at a range of altitude, enabled by a substantial increase in cruise lift-to-drag (L/D) ratios over today's high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, is vital, providing sustained presence and long range. Aerodynamic load/moment sensors would enable the efficient, robust active control of adaptive, lightweight wings to optimize lift distribution to maximize L/D. Cost-effectively improving the energy capture and reliability of wind turbines would help national renewable energy initiatives. A standalone aerodynamic load/moment sensor could provide output for control feedback to mitigate the turbine blade lifetime-limiting time varying loads generated by the ambient wind, irrespective of rain and icing conditions.",Acoustic/Vibration; Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Characterization; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Thermal,Flight Test and Measurements Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

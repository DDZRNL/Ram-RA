Additionally, the increased use of composite structures in the civilian fleet, such as in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A380, make the understanding and/or improvement of composite durability, particularly durability of repairs, even more critical.  Several areas have been identified as targets for improvement in composite aircraft repair.  These include the development of rapid, low temperature repair methods and associated materials as well as development of the quality of repairs when they are made.  Adhesion of bonded repairs is one area that needs to be addressed. Adherent Technologies, Inc. is proposing a novel moisture-resistant primer system for use in repairs of standard carbon/epoxy composites used in many subsonic aircraft.  Our proprietary chemistry comprised of a reactive coupling agent and a carrier resin compatible with standard aerospace epoxy resins bonds directly to the prepared aircraft composite surface while retaining residual functionality that can be cured directly into the matrix of the repair leading to a covalently bound repair, thereby strengthening the repair interface.  Proper selection of the coupling agent structure and carrier resin can serve to further enhance the moisture resistance and thereby durability of the composite repair.",This system is being designed to support the need for improvements in durability of repairs for subsonic aircraft.,"The proposed primer technology, which will improve the quality of composite bonded repairs as well as composite bonding in general, will used throughout the aerospace composite materials market as well as having potential applications in civilian infrastructure (e.g. CFRP bridge decks and the like).  The civilian aircraft market is projected to be a particularly significant consumer.",Airframe; Composites

To improve aviation safety further we need new paradigms to balance between exploiting increasingly powerful technologies and retaining and promoting aeronautical decision making (ADM) by the crew.This proposal explores integrating H-mode, a flight control system developed by researchers at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) that shares workload with pilots to leverage the unique capabilities of human pilots and automated control systems, with OZ, a primary flight display system under development at eSky. OZ provides a single-screen display for IMC flight, mapping external objects such as airports, waypoints, air traffic, weather etc. onto the primary flight display.  The hybrid system (H/OZ) will allow the pilot both to retain situational awareness and to monitor the flight and select alternative actions at critical points.  H/OZ will marry the superior situational awareness capability of OZ with the superior cooperative flight control of H-mode.  In phase 1, eSky will develop a design for H/OZ and explore the feasibility of key new design elements.  eSky will map the user interface of H-mode into the OZ display and add functionality to both.  In collaboration with LaRC, the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition and the University of Maryland, eSky will identify specific areas critical to the performance of H/OZ and use rapid prototyping to evaluate the usability of the new design elements.  New OZ functionality will be evaluated using an eSky OZ laptop simulator.  H-mode prototyping will be done in the NASA LaRC H-mode simulator. Feasibility will be tested by demonstrating that the OZ display metaphor supports full H-mode functionality without compromising the usability of the H-mode user interface.   Phase 2 will focus on creating an H/OZ simulator and on usability and performance testing.",H/OZ will be suitable as an integrated avionics suite for any aircraft or winged spacecraft.  All aircraft operated by NASA will find the innovative OZ display and the cooperative flight control of H-mode useful in flight in both Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).,"H/OZ is being developed as an integrated avionics suite primarily general aviation.  OZ has already been demonstrated to be superior to conventional instrumentation and the new ""glass cockpit"" technology such as the Garmin G1000 currently being supplied with general aviation aircraft.  The hybrid H/OZ system will add cooperative flight control to maintain superior situational awareness on the part of pilots.  This will be of primary importance during single pilot IFR flight when high workload and stress induced by external factors can compromise situational awareness and thus flight safety.H/OZ can also be successfully applied to air transport and military aircraft.  In these aircraft types electronic displays are well-established but continue to rely on images of 1920's aircraft instruments and high levels of conventional flight control automation.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Intelligence; Pilot Support Systems"

Currently aircrafts with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid AE/ASE interactions. However, if changes in the aircraft configuration are significant, the frequencies of the flexible modes of the aircraft may be shifted and the notch filters could become totally ineffective. With the proposed approach, the flexible modes can be consistently estimated in real-time via system identification algorithm. The identified flexible modes information is sought to be injected to the adaptive control algorithm to update a set of pre-chosen basis functions, These are the key elements for the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a result, undesirable effects of elastic modes will be suppressed while the whole system stability being maintained. Two case/analysis scenarios will be considered. First, the feedforward filter topology will be mainly used to reduce any atmospheric induced structural vibration of the aircraft. Second, the adaptive feedback control is triggered to suppress any AE/ASE interactions, and prevent any possible Flutter/Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) of the actual flexible aircraft.","Being capable of on-line estimation/monitoring of the elastic modes of the aircraft, the proposed adaptive control technology can be automatically adjusted to attenuate any potential adverse aeroelastic/aeroseroelastic effects of an aircraft before a sustained limit cycle and vehicle damage are encountered. Hence, the proposed project will assist NASA in its goal to achieve an integrated flight control system resilient to failures, damage, and upset conditions unforeseen during the development of the aircraft's original control law.","The proposed adaptive feedforward/feedback control framework will have extensive application in non-NASA commercial applications. Firstly, due to the potential Flight Control System (FCS) benefits from avoiding notch filters, the proposed methodology can be used by military and commercial aircraft manufacturers for new aircraft designs, modifications and upgrades. Secondly, it brings a variety of applications in other industries. Among others it can be mentioned: (1) Acoustic noise cancellation in headphone devices; (2) Reduction of the noise level for rotating fans in computer servers; (3) Suppression and/or attenuation of vibrations in large satellite structures; (4) Cabin noise reduction for the next generation executive transport aircraft, such as the Marcel Dassualt's Falcon 7X.

Numerous recent research efforts have produced a variety of diagnostic algorithms that show significant promise, but to date advanced diagnostic approaches have seen rather limited use in operational air vehicle systems.  One of the major hurdles to transitioning such systems to fleet vehicles is the lack of adequate verification and validation (V&V) approaches.  Barron Associates and MUSYN propose a Phase I research effort to develop a V&V framework for diagnostic systems that combines novel analysis approaches with experimental techniques to provide high confidence in the performance of diagnostic techniques.  Performance evaluation of diagnostic systems is currently based primarily on numerical testing approaches, which may be applied to both simulation results and actual experimental data.  While such testing is extremely important and should form a key component of the overall V&V strategy, it is not adequate alone.  This is because it is impossible to collect sufficient test data or even sufficient Monte Carlo simulation data to exhaustively cover the space of potential test conditions.  To achieve reasonable confidence in the coverage of the V&V procedures, it is necessary to intelligently select Monte Carlo or experimental test points to target the regions of the test space that are most likely to reveal problems.   The team will work to develop analysis approaches that can help to identify combinations of conditions (flight conditions, uncertainties, external disturbances, vehicle configuration, etc.) that are most likely to lead to inadequate performance of diagnostic algorithms.  The team will also extend the existing CAESAR software tool for control law V&V to automate V&V of diagnostic systems.","The proposed V&V approaches will be applicable to diagnostic algorithms applied to a wide variety of systems developed and operated by NASA.  Many future air vehicles can be expected to employ diagnostic algorithms to monitor systems including actuators, sensors, engines, gearboxes, and structural components.  Examples of such vehicles include commercial transports, unmanned observation and communications platforms, and research aircraft.  Diagnostic algorithms will be particularly important in commercial transport aircraft, where safety is of the utmost importance, and in long endurance unmanned vehicles, which lack human operators to recognize and respond to failure conditions.  In the unforgiving environment of space travel, diagnostic algorithms will also offer significant benefits.  Even in orbital flight, providing assistance to a damaged vehicle is extremely difficult and the problem will only be compounded on journeys to the moon and mars.  Diagnostic algorithms will be critical to timely identification and isolation of fault conditions so the appropriate corrective actions can be initiated promptly.","The proposed V&V approaches will be applicable to diagnostic algorithms applied to a wide variety of systems developed and operated by NASA.

The FAA has responded by implementing two ground surveillance technologies at major U.S. airports to reduce the risk of runway incursions. However, both technologies route information through air traffic control (rather than directly to pilots), which significantly delays safe responses. Several flight deck technologies that communicate information directly to pilots are currently in development. However, there is a need for tools to rapidly test the technologies early in the design process and measure their impact on pilot performance prior to implementation. The Aptima/George Mason University team proposes to develop two technologies that can be used together or independently to evaluate performance of flight deck technologies aimed at improving runway safety.

Currently available thermal protection system (TPS) designs and materials are not capable of providing the level of protection required by NASA without a significant increase in TPS weight and volume.

We have developed a new class of TiAl-based alloys, called beta gamma, which would remove such barriers.   Unlike existing gamma alloys, beta gamma alloys are designed such that the ductile â phase is adequate at elevated temperatures (for processing) but negligible at the anticipated use temperatures (for performance).  The alloys also feature significant grain refinement and compositional homogeneity.  This program is aimed to utilize such beneficial beta-phase distribution and microstructure features observed in small (0.7kg) samples into forged disks from medium size (25kg) ingots.  The process-ability will be validated by employing a conventional forging process, and refined lamellar microstructures will be generated through usual alpha treatments.  The significance of this innovation is that beta gamma alloy disks can not only be produced by conventional forging, but also show improvements in RT strength and ductility and may retain other attributes (density, creep and oxidation) of conventional gamma alloys.","Due to their low density (only 50% of those of superalloys), high temperature capability (up to 800oC for long-term use), and expected damage tolerance improvements, once the premised process-ability and engineering microstructures achieved, beta gamma alloys will eventually find their potential applications for rotational components, such as compressor rotors and disks, and other hot structures in future NASA advanced engines.  With some adjustments of processing parameters and conditions, these alloys can be rolled into thin sheets relatively readily, which then can be used for thin-section hot structures such TPS and nozzle components.","For the same reasons described above, there exist near future application opportunities for beta gamma in LPT components (blades and others) in future commercial aero engines and for high-pressure compressor (HPC) blades and vanes in advanced engines.  These blades made of conventional gamma alloys are on the verge of being implemented in spite of their inferiority in processing and microstructure to those of beta gamma alloys.

Higher operating temperatures result in improved performance, fuel savings (higher efficiency) and reduced pollution.  Silicon melt infiltrated ceramic composites have been identified as having a 2400F maximum use temperature, which does not take advantage of the highest temperature capability of the newest generation of near stoichiometric SiC fibers.  Conversely ceramic composites containing a SiC matrix derived from chemical vapor infiltration have sufficient stability to take full advantage of the creep resistance of the fibers.  For many applications, no existing matrix system for SiC-reinforced composites has sufficient through-thickness thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures to result in low thermally induced stresses; such that longer service life at higher temperatures can be achieved.

Accurate chemistry models for hydrocarbon fuels are particularly problematic since the detailed kinetic mechanisms can be highly complex, essentially prohibiting obtaining a timely solution.  Simpler global chemistry models, while tractable, are notoriously inaccurate except over narrow ranges of conditions.  Reactions Systems therefore proposes to explore a new approach to capturing the detailed chemistry in a reduced multi-dimensional format that could combine the advantages of ISAT with recent RSLLC proprietary innovations in species reduction.","Increased accuracy and productivity of reacting flow CFD codes using realistic RP-1 type fuels would materially enhance the efficiency of the design process and ultimate performance of new hydrocarbon-fueled airbreathing engines and rocket engines for space access.  If successful, the proposed innovation could also be applicable to modeling many other reacting flow situations such as rocket plumes or chemically-reacting endothermic fuels used for cooling of hypersonic vehicles.","Detailed chemical kinetic models are applicable to a wide range of gas phase chemical processes such as fuel autoignition, formation of toxics and air pollutants in combustion processes, modeling of catalytic processes, tailoring of industrial chemical processes, and in jet and rocket propulsion systems.  Furthermore, these chemistry models are often run as subsets of models that describe flow and/or time dependent processes.  While a number of problems in chemical kinetic modeling can be solved using global kinetics and simple thermodynamics, many require the use of detailed chemical kinetic models involving a large network of elementary reaction steps.  These large networks of simultaneous elementary reactions are computationally expensive, and follow-on codes such as CFD codes are even more burdened by having large numbers of species to consider.  Dramatically reducing the time and cost required to obtain accurate reacting flow simulations could allow much better optimization of the design and operation of many types of commercial equipment.",Aircraft Engines; Chemical; Combustion; Database Development and Interfacing; High Energy Propellants (Recombinant Energy & Metallic Hydrogen); Monopropellants; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

Performing the experimental work in unison with LES studies ensures that the two sets of data will be fully compatible, and may be used to support SFM model validation. Work to date indicates some deficiencies in the present SFM model for high speed mixing problems where the two streams have very different densities, which we will attempt to resolve in this program. PIV data for the transverse injection of hot air and helium/nitrogen mixtures into a Mach 3.5 stream will be obtained in unison with LES studies to yield scalar fluctuation data not readily obtained in experiments.  SFM upgrades will be performed using this unified data. Experiments will be performed by Dr. Seiner and coworkers at U.

Having a more reliable SFM will lead to better designs since the fuel/air mixing will be predicted more accurately. We are also involved in interceptor missile design activities supported by the Missile Defense Agency, where plume heating effects are problematic and are requiring the use of ablative shields. We require accurate estimates of plume afterburning which is directly related to plume/air entrainment rates and thus to turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers.

The air-brake concept is applicable to 1) next-generation, conventional tube and wing aircraft (current generation +1) and 2) advanced integrated airframe/propulsion system configurations (current generation +2), and could enable system level noise reductions of several decibels at the ground observer during approach by quietly generating drag equivalent to up to three turbofan-sized bluff bodies per powerplant.  Such drag generation could enable slower, steeper approach trajectories with reduced need for drag generators such as flaps, slats and undercarriage.  Proposed research tasks build upon a rigorous understanding developed by the investigating team on the aero-acoustics of drag generating, swirling exhaust flows.  The objectives are to 1) create an engine air-brake design specification to constrain the design and identify and address issues and challenges associated with implementation, 2) perform trade studies on two aircraft/powerplant combinations in current generation +1 and +2 configurations to identify the attributes of suitable devices installed on such aircraft and 3) develop a candidate design for model scale aerodynamic and aeroacoustic validation in an experimental facility.

A quiet air-brake device will allow noise reduction by creating drag without the associated unsteady flow structures of devices such as flaps, slats, and undercarriage. In addition these devices will enable steep approaches, thereby locating the noise source further from the affected communities. An additional application for swirling exhaust flows is in the area of wake vortex avoidance and induced drag management. For example, swirling outflow devices placed on wing tips could be used to swirl in the opposite or same direction to the bound vortex that is shed by a finite wing, resulting in potential induced drag reduction or increase (possibly of value in a quiet drag sense).","The commercial potential for this system extends beyond NASA's development programs related to next-generation quiet aircraft. The larger, shorter term market potential relates to engines which are currently being developed for commercial deployment in the next five to ten years by large-engine manufacturers where there is potentially still an opportunity to incorporate features of this concept into the final design.

These actuators are based on a compact design of low mass-flow fluidic oscillators that produce high frequency (1-5 kHz) oscillating or pulsing jets. Our preliminary experiments on separation control over trailing edge flaps, cavity tones and jet thrust vectoring show great promise for these actuators, the main advantage being that these have no moving parts and hence mechanically robust with a high degree of reliability.  The control authority of these actuators is also high as measured from the velocity amplitude of the exiting jets.  In Phase I of the proposal, we will determine the geometric and dynamic scaling parameters of the fluidic actuators and explore the system integration issues for embedding them into airfoil shapes.  Based on the results from this phase, in Phase II, we will design and develop integrated fluidic actuator systems for 1/10 scale to full-scale testing.",The proposed work on flow control can be implemented in the next generation of the Crew Exploration Vehicle designs being developed by NASA.  Such arrays can also be used for de-icing systems using either hot air or de-icing liquids since the fluidic jets work with both liquids and gases.,"Aerodynamic flow control has a large number of applications in the commercial and military aerospace industry.  We foresee applications of our technology to separation control over leading and trailing edge of airfoils for high lift and minimum drag configurations for aircraft wings, control of jet exhaust noise in aircraft engines, intake flow control, and internal flows in gas turbines.

Schlieren methods are widely used to visualize turbulence and shock phenomena. Focusing schlieren systems are ideal for applications requiring a large field of view, and are the preferred methods for outdoor schlieren systems. One schlieren technique for large field studies is the use of focusing schlieren with background grids. Recently, schlieren systems that use the sun as a background source have been developed for studying shock waves for aircraft in flight. The application of both schlieren techniques is restricted by the capabilities of fixed schlieren cut-off masks. Liquid crystal spatial light modulators afford greater flexibility, as the correct cut-off mask can be programmed and updated electronically. Since the spatial light modulators can be updated at video rates or faster, there is also the possibility of using the SLMs to correct for changes in the background. In addition, we will incorporate state of the art electronic cameras.","Flight testing is often used as a final critical check of the aerodynamic designs developed by computational and wind tunnel methods because the amount of reliable information obtainable in wind tunnels is somewhat limited and subject to interference.

In practice, this has necessitated the use of external hydraulic dampers which suffer from a high maintenance cost. This high operational cost has prompted the rotorcraft industry to use elastomeric lead-lag dampers that result in ``dry'' rotors. However, complex behavior of elastomers provides challenges for the modeling of such devices, as has been noted by rotorcraft airframers. Analytical models have tended to oversimplify the complexity of the operational environment and make radical assumptions about operating parameters that, at best, lead to simple, and often unreal, device models. In spite of costly and time consuming experiments to construct them, these first order device models do not directly relate to neither material characteristics nor geometric configuration. Example: the device model approach leads to the erroneous identification of ""physical phenomena"" such as dual frequency effect. We propose a fundamentally radical approach wherein elastomeric dampers are derived from first-principle-based modeling rather than device model based analysis. First we propose to develop a finite element based simulation tool for modeling the response of complex components made of elastomeric materials.

Therefore, the ability to dynamically change airfoil camber is a significant technology advancement leading to improved overall rotorcraft performance. Research efforts in recent years have led to the application of active material actuation for rotorcraft blades in order to dynamically change blade camber.  Small-scale bench top system validations have been successful.  However, when scaled-up to full-scale aircraft, the performance of current actuation systems in a demanding rotor blade environment gets significantly degraded by operational factors including friction, free play, and, aerodynamic and inertial loads. We propose a unique three dimensional concept wherein the typically closed section blade is cut open to create a torsionally compliant mechanism that acts as its own amplification device; the deformation of the blade is dynamically controlled by out-of-plane warping. Our innovative approach for camber control is a radical departure from the current techniques. The proposed development and engineering effort will lead to a new camber control technology suitable for full-scale aircraft that would result in improved operational efficiencies at lower costs.

The need for flights to make incremental steps in the queue significantly increases the engine emissions produced because of the number of times aircraft must apply 'break-away' power, only to stop again after moving just a short distance.

Implementing the concept across the entire NAS has not been possible due to the requirement to coordinate departure metering amongst multiple airport users.  We propose to further demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the COTM concept at large hub airports.","Potential applications for the research results beyond Phase 2 include uses by NASA for continued research and by the FAA and airports/air carriers.  Moreover, research results may guide other airportal management projects by providing valuable understanding of environmental issues and how surface management decisions effects them.  The proposed SBIR is focused primarily towards answering a research question of interest to NASA.  The problem being studied is an example of the basic research needed into the interaction of airportal management and environmental metrics.  The project will leave NASA with a new capability to study airportal environmental issues within the SODAA tool which NASA already uses for other airportal research.  With environmental considerations becoming increasingly important to the FAA, airports, air carriers, and internationally, this capability will allow NASA to remain at the forefront of airportal research and provide relevant and valuable research results to guide NextGen development.","FAA, university, and airport authorities may be equally interested in the developed airportal environmental analysis capability.  Other potential Non-NASA applications are centered on the evolution of the research into a NAS-wide (or NextGen) system.  The FAA is the most likely customer to continue this work beyond Phase 2.  Commercialization and Phase 3 activities involve further development of the COTM implementation begun in Phases 1 and 2 and the conduct of field trials at one or more airports where the operational concept and procedures may be refined and actual benefits may be measured.  Mosaic ATM has conducted field trials of this type previously with other automation tools and concepts.

In this proposal, an air corridor is a three-dimensional region of space that is intended to safely isolate a stream of aircraft from other aircraft outside the corridor.  Air corridors/routes effectively exist today in two forms: static and dynamic.  Static air corridors exist in the form of published standard arrival routes (STAR) and standard instrument departures (SID).  Dynamic air corridors are effectively created when air traffic control (ATC) issues vector and speed instructions to aircraft.  The proposed testbed would identify dynamic air corridors that provide ATC with more options that are optimized to provide greater throughput than is currently available with today's static air corridors.  The testbed would continuously identify dynamic air corridors in order to adapt to changing hazards, changing queues of arriving and departing aircraft, and changing runway configurations.  We further propose integrating the simulation testbed with NASA's Airspace Concept Evaluation Software (ACES) in order to assess the impact of dynamic air corridors on the entire U.S. national airspace.","Our initial target for the product developed in this effort is the modeling and simulation community within NASA that is focusing on the Joint Planning and Development Office's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).

(RSI) proposes to develop the Friction-Sensing Retroreflector Array Patches (FRAP), a technology that will measure the shear stress distribution on aerodynamic surfaces in ground test facilities with high resolution, sensitivity, and bandwidth.  Unlike the oil-film interference method, FRAP patches will not be thinned as a function of time during a test.  No knowledge of the streamlines of the flow will be needed in order to calculate the local stress distribution; this will avoid the tracers needed with the oil-film interference approach.  Flexible patches of FRAP arrays, inexpensive due to simple, mass-production-compatible microfabrication techniques, will be interrogated using a light source and camera. FRAP will be independent of the flow species and applied as a very thin, flexible, adhesive material.  The Phase I goals will be to design sensors, develop a microfabrication technique and use it to fabricate prototype units, demonstrate feasibility, and select the most promising design for Phase II development.  In Phase II, the prototype units will be field-demonstrated at NASA facilities, with manufacturing issues and realistic operating conditions addressed.  The result will be a product that will address a critical NASA instrumentation need.","RSI will use its experience in microfabricated structures and sensors to employ a highly innovative technology  a sheer-stress-sensing retroreflector array  in order to non-intrusively measure skin friction in NASA ground test facilities.  The concept can even be extended to flight tests: the arrays could be interrogated by the airdrop craft or a chase plane, with all the benefits of a retroreflected signal.  The FRAP technology will avoid the use of a depleted fluid and tracer elements that are inherent to the existing oil film interferometry method, and will address a key NASA need for non-instrusive diagnostics as well as flight test diagnostics and vehicle monitoring.","Several non-Government applications are possible.  Flow sensors have a lucrative commercial market in manufacturing (for process monitoring) and medical diagnostics, as well a healthy market in scientific applications.  Commercialized flow sensors are used in applications ranging from industrial processing and medical diagnostics to high-speed shock testing in chemical explosions.  It is expected that the newly developed FRAP arrays will compete aggressively in these existing markets.  In addition to NASA, target U.S. government customers will be the Air Force (for ground testing, flight tests, and vehicle monitoring) and the Navy (for similar applications).",Control Instrumentation; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Optical; Testing Facilities

In order to obtain 3-D attitude measurements (roll, pitch, and yaw) conventional GPS/A systems require three or more antennas with relatively large baselines (~0.5 m). In sharp contrast, Toyon's GPS/A system can obtain 3-D attitude measurements with one or more single-aperture antennas. Toyon's GPS/A sensor is dubbed the Miniature Integrated Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam System (MIDAAS(TM)) and employs an innovative single-aperture antenna to compute full 3-D attitude using only two RF channels, leading to a smaller, simpler, lower-cost receiver system. A single (gyro-less) MIDAAS unit can be used to provide attitude information on very small launch platforms. In addition, multiple (gyro-less) MIDAAS units can be employed over larger baselines for increased attitude accuracy. A single (< 6.5-cm diameter) MIDAAS system also provides tactical-grade attitude performance when coupled with commercial-grade gyros at a significantly lower cost. Furthermore, MIDAAS provides active anti-jam protection and multipath mitigation thereby improving the integrity and robustness of the navigation system.","MIDAAS provides drift-free and temperature-insensitive GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) measurements for small expendable launch vehicles and micro-satellites in a small package and at a lower cost than array-based GPS attitude systems. Furthermore, a multi-antenna MIDAAS system will provide improved accuracy when compared to traditional GPS/A systems with equivalent baselines.

These systems use either deployable mesh reflectors, which are limited in their operating frequency by the facets and RF reflectivity of the mesh itself, or rigid surface reflectors, which are limited in their aperture by the size of the launch vehicle fairing.  Deployable solid-surface reflectors have the potential to enable both a large aperture and high frequency operation but are compliant and inherently difficult to fabricate to a precise surface contour.  The proposed innovation is to develop methods for optimizing the surface contour of solid-surface deployable reflector systems using built-in adjustors.  This allows for antenna systems with high data rate and high gain for interplanetary communications and other missions.  Technical feasibility of this approach will be demonstrated in Phase 1 with the design, structural analysis, assembly, and demonstration of a tunable solid surface reflector thereby advancing the innovation to a TRL 5.  The Phase 1 demonstration unit will incorporate tuning adjustors, an existing reflector shell, and a simplified backing structure.  This will provide the methodology for a flight-ready demonstration unit to be completed as part of the Phase 2 contract.","Achieving the vision of NASA's bold Exploration Initiative will require the development of communication system technologies that extend the Internet into space, enable anytime-anywhere intelligent-autonomous operations, and provide end-to-end information delivery from space directly to users. For interplanetary communications links, high-frequency, high-gain spacecraft antennas are required, and this combination creates a need for large aperture, precise reflector systems that exceed the capability of current reflector designs.  The required surface accuracy of a reflector is directly proportional to the wavelength of the RF signal, therefore higher frequency communication require more accurate reflector shells. The ideal reflector is large in aperture, packages within existing launch vehicles, and deploys to a precise shape using a thermally stable solid membrane to provide high frequency reflectivity at Ka band or higher.CTD's solid surface reflector technology currently provides a low cost deployable antenna reflector for increasing the aperture of a small satellite antenna beyond the constraints of the payload fairing at lower microwave frequencies. The technology developed in this SBIR will extend the operating frequency range of CTD's solid-surface deployable reflectors to Ka band, enabling deployable reflector systems for high data-rate lunar communications and Mars communication links.","Current generation antenna systems for military satellites have typically used fixed-aperture, deep-parabolic reflectors with high accuracy reflective surfaces. Examples of these reflectors include the MCP, SSP, and MilSTAR reflectors manufactured by Boeing. These reflectors range in aperture from 2m to 3m. Deployable solid surface reflectors could improve the satellite system design by drastically reducing the volume required for the antenna reflector, provided the reflective surface can be adjusted to meet the surface accuracy requirement. The deployable solid surface reflector design could also be adapted to shaped reflector surfaces for commercial satellite applications.

These materials also display reduced discharge response times compared to state of the art materials; this is advantageous for pulsed power applications such as burst communications and flash LIDAR. Eltron's carbon nanostructures are highly conductive and offer an ordered mesopore network. These attributes will provide more complete electrolyte wetting, and faster release of stored charge compared to activated carbon.Preliminary studies have shown that Eltron's materials meet or exceed the performance of major EC manufacturers. The Phase I objectives will be to further increase performance with regards to high power/short duration demands.

In Phase II studies we will optimize the materials' performance and scale up prototype cells and validate performance in critical test environments.","NASA is interested in electrochemical capacitors for transient power demands that are capable of rapid discharges, typically less than one second. Such demands shorten battery and fuel cell lifetime. ECs will be used to complement an energy storage system (load leveling), dramatically lengthening battery/fuel cell lifetimes while reducing the required sizes of the batteries/fuel cells. Specifically ECs can be used in burst communications systems that require high power transients on the order of millisecond durations with a short number of total pulses to avoid detection. Other NASA applications would be flash LIDAR for Object Detection and Avoidance (ODA) systems (for avoiding rocks when landing) and autonomous rover guidance on a planet surface. Finally, NASA is looking to replace hydraulic systems with electromechanical actuators that require high transient power delivery. These requirements can be fulfilled by ECs which store charge that can be quickly discharged without burdening batteries or fuel cells.","Other applications include maintenance-free power sources for microcomputer memories, backup power for actuator and solenoid valves, and power supplements for consumer electronic devices. The biggest potential market of ECs will be the automotive sector for launch assist and regenerative braking in electric vehicles.EC's with improved performance (greater relative energy and power, improved charge/discharge capacities) would generate increased interest among producers of battery operated equipment. ECs may have a prominent impact on hybrid electric vehicles, where their implementation would mature the development of this technology. Successful development of this technology would potentially improve the fuel efficiency of these HEV's significantly since the need for large batteries could be reduced.

Unlike low energetic techniques (such as MBE or CVD), PLD's energetic range of pulsed plasma can be controlled with process parameters, resulting in a wide range of plasma energetic for film deposition. Recently, Neocera fabricated high quality epitaxial GaN films using the plasma-energy-controlled PLD process, resulting in strong photoluminescent emission at room temperature. This approach is further extended in this Phase I, with an in-situ ""Pulsed"" Energy Annealing, to greatly improve the film crystallinity. The pulsed laser or pulsed electron beam, with 20-50 ns pulse width and high power density (~10^8W/cm^2), induces melting and a rapid epitaxial formation in ~100 nanoseconds, anneling out dislocations. This unique combination of two pulsed energy technologies is expected to provide the most advanced deposition process for epitaxial GaN films with low dislocation density.","High quality GaN films have been deposited on Al2O3 or Si substrates via chemical vapor deposition process.  However, large lattice mismatch between GaN and these substrates causes significant structural imperfections in GaN layers, resulting in the dislocation density of about 10^10 cm-2 that limits the current GaN film technology from applications in RF communications.

IFDAS will also be able to interface with current sensing systems and integrate their data to provide a comprehensive overview of the situation using all available data.

As the system will be integrated with current systems and be based on smart video technologies, IFDAS could also provide an additional layer of security monitoring and be expanded to monitor other safety-related events and actions as well. Any installation which uses other flammables which burn with colorless, difficult-to-detect flames (such as many alcohols, and natural gas in daylight) could also make use of IFDAS.","Interest in hydrogen as an energy carrier/fuel is increasing and expected to create a growing hydrogen infrastructure in the private/military sector. IFDAS would also be of considerable value to virtually any industrial or commercial concern that involves itself with large quantities of flammable materials, especially alcohols or natural gas which  like hydrogen  can burn with nearly invisible flames. Accordingly, IEM sees a considerable market for IFDAS in the industrial and commercial sector, which means many hundreds to thousands of sites with multiple unit installations, for tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in potential sales. Spinoffs or derivatives from IFDAS  handheld systems or miniature systems integrated into helmets  would be extremely valuable to first responders, especially firefighters, who are required by their jobs to approach areas where fires are highly probable; in daylight conditions, this means that natural gas or alcohol fires may pose an invisible and lethal threat;  standard infrared cameras can detect such flames, but are far too expensive for many department's budgets. These are large niche markets; in 2000, there were approximately 258,000 paid career firefighters in the USA, meaning that even a very small penetration in this market would be worth several million dollars.",Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Expert Systems; Optical; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Testing Facilities

ISHM capability is achieved by integrating data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) that might be distributed throughout the system elements (which inherently implies capability to manage DIaK associated with distributed sub-systems). DIaK must be available to any element of a system at the right time and within the proper context. ISHM capability is measured by how well a system performs the following functions: Detect anomalies; Diagnose causes; Predict future anomalies/failures; and Provide the user with an integrated awareness about the condition of every element in the system and guide user decisions. Mobitrum proposes to develop a Sensor Area Network (SAN) for ISHM to bring the distributed intelligences together across all elements within ISHM system with effective communication mechanisms using distributed and/or hierarchical architectures to deliver intelligence across all elements.","Ground testing of propulsion systems is a critical requirement to enable NASA's New Vision for space exploration.

Our comprehensive system approach to launch site surveillance and security provides support for heterogeneous assets involved in security functions with a focus on the Aerostat platform.  An Aerostat platform will be outfitted with GMTI radar to provide wide area coverage and an EO/IR sensor pod for high resolution video detection and tracking.  Phase I will result in a detailed set of design reference scenarios tailored to the surveillance and security problem, identification of system level elements necessary to address the needs of launch site security, a system architecture design based on the Autonomous Collaborative Operations autonomy architecture, and a feasibility demonstration of key technology components that would be installed on an Aerostat platform.  Phase II will result in a fieldable prototype surveillance and security system utilizing an outfitted Aerostat platform.  At the completion of the Phase I activities, component technologies with be at a TRL-4 level.",Almost all other NASA facilities contain sensitive areas requiring persistent surveillance and security response capabilities. The proposed system is readily tailored to adapt surveillance assets as a function of specific site needs. This is accomplished by conducting a brief site survey of the facility to identify specific configurations that may be applied. The plug and play nature of the architecture then makes any expansion of the system to include additional sensor types straightforward.,"The military have long used surveillance devices in the form of optical, thermal, magnetic, acoustic, seismic, radio, and radar technology to obtain information and to provide security.  However, to date a person is required to be in the surveillance loop since robust, automated detection, tracking, and activity recognition of humans with visual sensors has not yet been achieved. This is particularly unacceptable in military scenarios where the only people available to interact with the surveillance system are often occupied with other critical tasks. As a result, there is a clear need for the truly automated, robust surveillance system proposed by PercepTek.

If a standard format changes, a reference to that format is updated. The electronic procedures can be re-converted in a single batch process, and the entire body of procedures will have the new format. Changes to hardware can be made in a similar manner, where changing a piece of hardware in a procedure will change all references to it in that procedure. Switching to this new representation offers many short and long-term benefits, which we describe herein.

The proposed technologies will provide significant new functionality to the medical operations at a reasonable cost in time and manpower.  Electronic procedures will enable the programs to improve the comprehension and delivery of medical procedures to the flight medical officers and the crew, and will enable a greater degree of coordination with the flight surgeons and biomedical engineers on the ground. Finally, electronic procedures will open the door to potentially groundbreaking applications in the future, leading eventually to a complete automated medical decision support system.","Electronic Procedures for Medical Operations provide a long-term potential that is enormous. Currently health care accounts for a significant fraction of the gross domestic product of the USA.

Furthermore, some of the technology that is being proposed here is very advanced and requires significant innovation and development before it will be ready for market.

When properly architected, such systems offer advantages over their traditional counterparts, such as improved upgradeability and extensibility.   They can also be more easily automated and can provide better fault tolerance.  These characteristics are important for all NASA spacecraft, from Exploration to Science.  However, plug-and-play systems also pose some interesting challenges that can undermine their effectiveness.  For example, they can be more complex in terms of information management and system administration.  This is especially true when automation is used to reduce the workload of the operators.  In fact, as the number of components increases, as much ""situational awareness"" of the ground system is needed the spacecraft.  A software framework that supports plug-and-play integration, while also providing information management and system coordination, is required.  Emergent Space Technologies Inc. therefore proposes to research and develop an Enterprise Management System for spacecraft ground systems.  Called GEMS, it will provide spacecraft controllers and crew members with ""situational awareness"" of the current state of the ground system as well as understanding of how events and automated actions are affecting the system in real-time.  The innovation lies in the development of algorithms and software adapters that gather data from the various components of the ground system to construct a data model that captures the system state and displays it to the controllers.","GEMS could support any NASA plug-and-play ground system.  Some of these projects could include earth-orbiting satellites, lunar, deep-space, or interplanetary missions.  The key technologies to supporting the ground systems for these different classes of missions are inherently the same.  Some of the particular projects that Emergent already has some involvement with include the SSMO Multi-Mission Operations Center at GSFC, GMSEC, and TRMM.

Results of the SBIR Phase 1 task could be applied directly to the work being done at Intelsat.  Emergent is also providing navigation system support to Lockheed Martin for the NOAA GOES-R satellite mission.

However, future missions will carry crews far from Earth, so they will need to operate with much greater independence and assume many system management functions currently carried out by flight controllers.  Intelligent automation of telemetry data monitoring and system control can provide much of the autonomy needed. However, automation alone will not be enough.  To handle tasks and situations that cannot be fully delegated to automation software, future flight controllers and crew must be able to monitor, review and interpret voluminous and complex telemetry data quickly to maintain necessary levels of situations awareness and make critical decisions rapidly and accurately.We propose to develop Intelliviz, an intelligent telemetry data visualization assistant that will create data visualizations automatically to reduce the effort and difficulty of specifying and constructing effective telemetry data visualizations.  To infer the user's analysis goals from user actions, events, and state conditions, Intelliviz will encode and apply systems management expertise comprised of model-based knowledge of the spacecraft in combination with heuristic knowledge that relates symptoms to possible causes and diagnostic strategies. To select display methods and configure effective displays, Intelliviz will use case-based reasoning to encode and apply data visualization design expertise. Each case will encode a solution to a prototypical data visualization design problem described by data characteristics, user analysis goals, and user preferences. During this Phase I project, we will specify user interface and functional requirements, create representative use cases, design the Phase II system, and develop and evaluate a proof-of-concept prototype to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its utility and feasibility.","Intelliviz can be used during missions to create data displays on the fly to support the user's current tasks and analysis goals that are inferred or stated explicitly.  In addition, Intelliviz can be used to help users create and extend libraries of parameterized data displays ahead of time that each handle anticipated mission tasks and situations.  Intelliviz can also be used to support scenario-based training by generating graphical data displays that help trainees develop mental models of spacecraft systems to support diagnostic reasoning.","We will market Intelliviz to support the management of other types of complex real-time situations and systems where rapid interpretation, diagnosis and recovery are needed.

During the second phase of the program, internal gratings will be added to the diodes to narrow the emission line width providing better absorption in the Er:YAG system and a Er:YAG laser meeting the requirements set forth in the solicitation, pumped by the source developed over the course of the program's two phases, will be demonstrated.","Any LIDAR application may be addressed by the deliverable of this program.  While the design is targeted toward an eye-safe fiber coupled 1470-nm high-power source pumping an Er:YAG solid state laser, the system is, by design, wavelength agnostic.  Hence, the fiber coupled source laser may be populated with any wavelength diode laser in nLight's inventory (from 635-nm to >2 microns) with only suitable changes to the optical coatings.  Further, the process development of the AuSn bond line necessary to achieve the high power from the source is also applicable across nLight's diode wavelength range.  The development under this program is therefore applicable to the pumping of all solid-state lasers or in direct-diode applications.","The technology developed under this program has broad application to non-NASA markets.  Particularly in the defense and security community, the need for ever more powerful, compact, efficient end reliable LIDAR sources appears to be growing without bound, with eye-safe sources being of considerable emphasis.

The third innovation is made possible by the high gain available from our fiber-laser-pumped Ho:YLF amplifiers. In contrast to seeded oscillators, our laser system has enough gain to amplify a cw, externally-modulated, single-frequency laser, allowing control of the pulsewidth and wavelength while preserving the frequency stability of the source.

Integration of these fibers into real systems for deployment either in space or terrestrial systems is hindered by the very structure which brings the advantage in effective area and nonlinearity mitigation. The problem is related to the air holes which provide guidance for both pump and signal.

The proposed mesh will be thinner than known comparable supports and will be produced freestanding such that it can be readily combined with filter foils of all types. The polyimide mesh will demonstrate at least 10% higher transmission than nickel at all energies, and will become essentially transparent above 3 keV. Mesh structures will be fabricated using three different photolithographic processes and compared both freestanding and in combination with filter foils to determine feasibility. The proposed innovation along with thinner materials will improve mission throughput and effective area significantly for microcalorimeter payloads on proposed Small Explorer missions, NeXT, and Spectrum-X-Gamma in the near term as well as Constellation X.","Enhanced filter throughput is needed technology to meet NASA's Universe and Sun-Earth Connection program goals.

This will lead to enhanced secondary electron emission (SEE) and, thus, improve MCP gain for UV /X-ray detectors. The ZnO/ALN(GaN) hetrostructure using nano ZnO needles as templates has been demonstrated to exhibit significantly higher SEE yield for electrons, ions and X-ray beams. The coatings will be carrid out by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The key advantages of ALD include 1)super conformity of coatings and nearly 100% step coverage on very high aspect ratio substrates, which is well suited for coating highly porous MCP wafers with a aspect ration ~100; 2)super thickness and composition control; 3)continuous and pin hole free quality films; and 4) easy to scale up for large area deposition at low cost. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time the advanced ALD process has been proposed as a way of improving UV detector performance of MCPS. If successful, this technology will provide an effective  method of modifing the MCP surfaces by coating  them with high SEE yield films that will dramatically improve the gain of conventional MCPs. This will enhance the performance of UV detectors required for various NASA missions.","Future experiments and NASA astrophysics missions can benefit from the development of the proposed technology by using these modified MCPs to improve UV detector performance.  In addition to astrophysics applications, in situ planetary instruments (fluorescence and Raman) can benefit greatly from a stable, high efficiency solar blind UV detector for detecting minerals and organics.  Longer-term missions will continue to benefit from the combination of high efficiency, solar blindness, and photon-counting capability of novel and upcoming silicon MCP designs that could incorporate this technology.","This advanced process has potential not only for many NASA missions requiring improved detector performance in the UV, X-ray to gamma ray ranges, but  also for military and civil industry applications where MCPs are already broadly used for things such as imaging, mass spectrometry and night vision detectors.

Given this importance, and despite existing technologies, there is still need for X-ray detection with increased system performance. The solid-state detector array is the primary technology to implement the current generation of space borne high-energy astronomy missions that are managed by NASA in partnership with the international community. Readout integrated circuitry (ROIC) specifically designed for photon resolving X-ray detection with solid-state detectors will create a new generation of high-performance X-ray imaging sensors.

One specific application is the Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST); however, the design approach is applicable to a wide range of X-ray imaging systems and future systems such as Constellation-X. The readout approach is compatible with a wide variety of X-ray detectors for maximum utility. Power requirements are low to support space-based applications.

There is a great potential to be explored with more elaborate methods of processing single photon signals. The image sensor can use two thresholds to select an energy band out of a continuous spectrum or perform image subtraction with one X-ray illumination. While single photon imaging with X-ray sensors will not displace conventional film and continuous integration imager approaches (such as charge coupled devices), the ability to work over a wide X-ray energy range and to process those images using signal energy level discrimination methods, will improve image quality of many existing X-ray systems and create new imaging applications.",Large Antennas and Telescopes; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Ultra-High Density/Low Power

It is based on a solar-blind, highly efficient GaN photocathode and POC's silicon microchannel plates (Si-MCPs). The high-quantum-efficiency, negative electron affinity GaN photocathodes will be fabricated directly on the entrance surface of the Si-MCP. This is possible because of the substrate's ability to withstand high temperatures and its compatibility with GaN application.

In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the UV-Si-MCP by fabricating and testing a preliminary prototype, exhibiting TRL-4. In Phase II POC will develop a fully functional (TRL-6) prototype with up to 10^9 readout channels and quantum efficiency up to 50%.

As an example cryocoolers, including redundant coolers are incorporated on select missions. The redundant coolers operate when deteriorating or defunct coolers are deactivated. However, integration of redundant coolers may cause substantial parasitic heat loads unless the cold regions are thermally  connected to the active cryocooler only. The overall system efficiency will depend in part on the efficacy of the intervening thermal switches. We propose to develop a highly effective, innovative prototype thermal switch that combines two recently developed technologies. First, it employs a highly conductive thermal contact at a low applied force. Secondly, the heat switch employs an innovative bi-stable actuator. The actuator requires little energy to switch between states and can achieve motion on the order of millimeters. This available motion exceeds the tens to hundreds of microns needed to engage the contact, enabling complete separation, and thus, excellent thermal isolation in the off state. Combining the inherently high on- and low off-conductance of the contacts with the bi-stable actuator positioning  provides for a highly effective, innovative thermal switch, potentially enabling significant performance enhancement of NASA missions.",The proposed thermal switch development is directed in particular at enabling cryocooler redundancy in space. NASA missions that require cryogenic propulsion or astronomical missions that require cooling of  detectors and optics to cryogenic temperatures will benefit from this technology. Lunar missions that will require active thermal control can also benefit from the application of this thermal switch.,"The thermal switch, as well as the underlying novel contact technology, is believed to be applicable to many uses in cryogenics and beyond as well. Thermal switches are routinely used in magnetic refrigerators, an application area where the proposed switch would be highly suitable. For each use in which components serve only a temporary function the thermal switch could be used to disconnect unnecessary heat  loads once the need for their operation has vanished. For instance, the thermal efficiency of many applications that use heavy thermal bus bars could be greatly improved by thermally disconnecting these  items once they no longer serve a purpose, thereby, ending the otherwise persisting heat leak. Being thermally conductive the novel therrmal interface material may be used to attach thermometry, heaters etc. Being electrically conductive, it could also be used to form electrical connections. Thus, the switch could very well be reconfigured as a thermally conductive electrical switch. Further, the thermal interface material could be used to quickly attach items without the use of adhesives and to attach items in locations  that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to achieve. Avoiding adhesives also eliminates the outgassing of various vapors over time.",Control Instrumentation; Cooling; Fluid Storage and Handling; Instrumentation; Production; Propellant Storage

The proposed solar cells also would function across a very broad range of temperatures. Thus, the proposed solar cells would be potentially appropriate for powering all off-Earth NASA observation platforms: Earth orbiting spacecraft, planetary spacecraft, balloons, aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They also would be appropriate for powering ground and marine based observation platforms because of their ultra-high efficiencies, but they would face competition from other high-efficiency solar cell technologies not appropriate for off-Earth use.","The proposed solar cells have obvious potential applications for powering both military and intelligence-gathering satellites and commercial communication satellites because of their expected high efficiencies and mass specific power. They also have a broad potential application for powering off-Earth sensors and focal plane arrays for the MDA and for various Air Force applications, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as on-Earth applications requiring ultra-high efficiency solar cells. The proposed down-conversion technology using divalent Sm and trivalent Yb and Tb halides embedded in the protective coatings of the solar cells will have even a much larger potential application. It could be applied with fluorozirconate glass coverings or other coverings for improving the efficiency of any on-Earth solar cell.",Photovoltaic Conversion

The system combines these innovative propulsion technologies with proven sounding rocket operations concepts to minimize cost.  Our two stage nanosat launch system uses rail launch and static stability in early flight phases and a deliberate non-optimum stage sizing to eliminate the requirement for an expensive flight termination system and associated ground infrastructure.  Our focus on inherent system safety and maximum vehicle simplicity benefits the responsiveness, reliability, and cost of space launch.  The propellants chosen are inexpensive, easy to handle, and inherently safe.  These room temperature storable propellants allow use of common, low cost vehicle materials and construction techniques.  The system is scalable, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of space launch systems.  The design simplicity of the configuration promises to reduce costs and improve responsiveness of space launch systems.","Our proposed nanosat launch system directly satisfies many of the needs of subtopic S4.01. The integrated stage concept is a low-cost propulsion system using low-cost materials and low-cost manufacturing processes.  This propulsion technology will help mature a low-cost propulsion system using storable non-toxic propellants.  The upper stage provides an innovative propulsion system solution for small spacecraft as the bipropellant mix provides spacecraft primary propulsion and the oxidizer alone can be used as either a monopropellant or cold gas for attitude control.

The concept of the wireless spacecraft bus is something most technical people are at least half familiar with - the half which includes wireless data transfer, something available on every computer laptop today. But wireless is not really wireless if the power is delivered through wires. Both power and data need to be delivered wirelessly for the true potential impact of wireless to be made on spacecraft design, build, integration, and test.Integrating today's commonplace wireless data systems into spacecraft would seem to be a logical step in spacecraft development, but to date has not been implemented widely if at all. AeroAstro proposes an innovative solution to design and build micro-spacecraft (and spacecraft components) harnessing the true promise of wireless systems. The overall objective of the proposal is to develop and demonstrate a truly wireless spacecraft bus - exhibiting not only wireless data, but also wireless power distribution. By definition, this wireless approach is inherently modular, and alleviates the need for wire harnesses of any type while simultaneously making staged built-in-test possible concurrently during spacecraft assembly.","The ability to eliminate long wires - along with the failure mechanisms of chafing, sparking, ageing, and connector issues with which all spacecraft and payload manufacturers struggle - has the potential to revolutionize spacecraft and payload design. Removing the constraints of placement of components on a spacecraft due to the wiring routing frees the designer to concentrate on the best placement of the subsystem, and not limit the design simply to where power and data access points are located. Further, reliability is enhanced be removing failure mechanisms long understood but tolerated because previously there was no way to perform what wires could - efficient, directed flow of energy. The expectation is that NASA spacecraft, aircraft, and sensor networks in particular would benefit from this concept.","Wireless sensors based on energy harvesting are already making their first appearance in the marketplace, but actually beaming energy directly to sensors is in its infancy. The ability to emplace sensors in places best suited for the sensor - and not for either the power or data connections - will open new uses for low power, data hungry sensor networks. Wireless power transfer can be used for all kinds of small devices - cell phones, hand-held computers, laptops, flashlights, radios, etc. - anything that needs a charge and would benefit from the removal of the ""power brick"".

Additionally, component suppliers will use web access or supplier focused applications to view and maintain their component data in the system.

The spacecraft system that is a cost driver throughout the program life cycle is the Command and Data Handling System (C&DH), along with the associated algorithms and software.  Advanced Solutions Inc (ASI) plans to develop C&DH software which can be targeted and adapted to a wide variety of C&DH hardware architectures and mission requirements.  We also recognize the need to streamline the entire spacecraft development lifecycle and provide a product that not only provides highly autonomous core flight software that is adaptable to any mission, but also has the ability to replace traditional development, integration and test elements.  This will be accomplished by expanding upon our revolutionary On-board Dynamic Simulation System (ODySSy) to allow the C&DH system to support all phases of the spacecraft lifecycle.  Additionally, the traditional test control room is now unnecessary and is replaced by the mission control architecture to provide a true test-like-you-fly environment.  The test team, mission control team, and data analyst's can be in remote locations through use of the Web-Based Data Distribution Network (WebDDN).","The proposed Modular Autonomous C&DH Software with Built-In Simulation/Test has application to a broad range of NASA spacecraft programs because: (1) the system is designed for re-use through modularity; (2) significant cost savings and risk reduction are realized through standardization of this critical spacecraft system; (3) increased levels of autonomy lead to more fault tolerant spacecraft and lower mission operations costs; and (4) reduced time to orbit is achieved via a streamlined Assembly, Integration and Test approach.  Therefore the technology has the potential to become a standard for certain types of NASA missions including communication satellites, remote sensing platforms, planetary science spacecraft and GIS imagers.","The proposed Modular Autonomous C&DH Software with Built-In Simulation/Test has significant application to the Department of Defense (DoD) spacecraft due to the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) initiative.  The ORS goals are to make space assets available to DoD users on-demand within very short time frames.  The technology proposed in this SBIR supports those goals by providing a standardized approach to flight software that is also highly adaptable through modularity.  In addition, the built-in simulation/test capabilities significantly reduce the Assembly, Integration and Test timeline.  The commercial spacecraft market will likewise become a potential customer via the desire to reduce cost, risk and time to orbit.

Majority of previous lunar lander concepts with the precision/pinpoint landing capability required expensive and risky development of new GNC and landing sensors (scanning lidars, multi-beam mm-ww radar, etc.).  Our proposed alternative consists solely of existing and low-cost sensors that synergistically leverage each capability and compensate for individual sensor weaknesses.  For example, we can use a simple single-beam low-frequency radar altimeter (available at low-cost off-the-shelf, and proven on several Mars lander missions).  The low-frequency radar can meet the maximum slant range requirements much easier than the mm-wave sensor but it does not have the adequate multiple narrow beam capability of the Apollo LM or Viking lander radar.  However, the optical descent imaging measurement (using DSMAC-type sensor) can supplement the single beam radar measurement and obtain the same information about the complete state vector.  There are several similar concepts implemented in this sensor suite of complementing strengths and weakness of individual sensors.","The successful integration of low-cost GNC suite would open wide area for sales of that system for several other applications besides the lunar lander (Mars and asteroids mission, and proximity and rendezvous operations in LEO).The preliminary cost estimate for such integrated sensor suite is between $450K and $800K (depending on the software complexity and level of testing required).  We anticipate that the first sale of the integrated sensor suite module would occur realistically within 24 months after the completion of Phase 2.  Eventually, we estimate that flight rate of these integrated modules could approach 2-3 units per year (mostly in the US market, with minor potential in an international market).

All three companies are well experienced in developing PnP systems for the U. S. Air Force during the past 6 years.  On an existing Phase II Air Force SBIR program, Microcosm built a prototype star sensor called MicroMak.  The sensor proposed here will focus on PnP compatibility for NASA missions of interest.   The PnP star sensor recurring cost target is $150 K to $200 K, with a  mass between 0.5 and 1 kg.  Expected NASA mission applications necessitate a modified version of the baseline MicroMak sensor, including:  1) Interfaces compatible with a new PnP avionics architecture, 2) radiation-hardened focal plane arrays (FPAs) and processing electronics to enable longer mission life.  The baseline MicroMak sensor was designed with inherent radiation-tolerant features: complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) FPAs with no direct space view, and all-reflective optical elements.  The new PnP star sensor will build on MicroMak heritage and provide a modular, PnP-compatible, long-life star sensor for NASA missions, at low cost compared with traditional star sensors.  A cost and mass reduction of a factor of 2 or more over traditional sensors is expected.","The proposed star sensor will directly support NASA rapid spacecraft development efforts involving PnP architectures.  Also, the proposed sensor can support various classes of NASA missions, including: longer-life missions, such as outer planets missions; long life libration point astronomy missions; and lunar and Mars exploration missions.  This sensor can also support multiple applications, such as single-spacecraft attitude determination, formation flying, and rendezvous and docking.  The expected PnP compatibility, low mass, low power, and low cost will fill the near term need for improved attitude sensing technology with lower cost, complexity, mass and power than with traditional solutions.When combined with other sensors, such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), the new star sensor will have additional capabilities.  Microcosm's precision navigation with integrated attitude determination effort is directly applicable, providing an opportunity to enhance the new star sensor by adding a low-cost microelectromechanical IMU and/or software GPS receiver.  This device can provide higher attitude output rates, up to 100 Hz, supporting additional applications.","In addition to NASA applications, the sensor will also have applications in other government systems with similar accuracy, longer lifetime, and increased radiation tolerance requirements.  Other programs seeking rapid spacecraft integration cycles, employing PnP architectures will also benefit from this new sensor. Microcosm is currently selling into the satellite attitude determination and control system market, and the basic low cost MicroMak star sensor should be ready for market in the next two to three years.  The proposed new star sensor could also be ready for operational flight status in this same time frame, if its development is pursued aggressively in parallel with the baseline MicroMak sensor.Communications satellites for both geosynchronous and low Earth orbit systems could take advantage of such a low cost PnP star sensor as well.  It would facilitate rapid integration, and possible new applications, such as mounting directly to a communications antenna to get significantly improved determination of antenna pointing.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

In this thruster, propellant gas is introduced into the thrust nozzle through a fast acting gas valve.  When the propellant gas partially fills the thruster nozzle in 100~200 microsecond, a short, high voltage pulse is applied to break down and heat the propellant gas.  The typical duration of the pulsed discharge is 10 microsecond.  The heated propellant gas expands through the nozzle generating a high impulse (~mN-s per pulse) at a high specific thrust (120 micro N-s/joule).  The specific impulse (Isp) will be in the range of 1000~1400 sec.  This process can be repeated at a frequency which satisfies the spacecraft thrust requirement.  The thrust generating mechanism of the proposed thruster is gasdynamic expansion, not magnetohydrodynamic interaction.  The proposed thruster is different from the conventional pulsed electrothermal thruster in that the joule heating of the propellant takes place as the propellant gas expands through the divergent nozzle, thereby eliminating the heat and momentum losses at the nozzle throat.  Our objectives are: (i) establish proof of concept; (ii) develop an engineering model; and (iii) develop a proto-flight model of the proposed thruster system.","The Pulsed Electrogasdynamic (PEG) thruster, when developed to technical maturity, will be used for satellite mobility, such as rapidly changing position for rendezvous, attitude control, orbital maneuver and control satellite constellation formation. These maneuvers require a relatively high thrust (mN ~ N) at a moderately high specific impulse (Isp almost equal to 1000 sec) and a high electric efficiency (~60%).  The PEG thruster will meet this requirement in a broad thrust range.  For example, when operated at 1 Hz, the PEG thruster will generate a thrust of 1 mN with 10 W of electric power input.  At higher pulse rates, 100 Hz for example, 100 mN of thrust will be generated with 1 kW of electric power.  Higher thrust can be obtained by scaling up the thruster size.  The PEG thruster in a low power mode will also be used for station keeping applications.  To this end, a PEG thruster suite can be added to any spacecraft equipped with a N2H4/NTO Monopropellant/Bipropellant propulsion system without incurring a mass penalty for high precision ""digital"" attitude corrections at a higher Isp than is obtained with the conventional monopropellant solution.   Furthermore storable ""Green"" propellants such as N2O and NH3 are very suitable as PEG thruster propellants.  The PEG thruster will serve NASA's Science Mission Directorate needs in earth orbit, near-earth and in deep space.","The Pulsed Electrogasdynamic (PEG) thruster will be very useful for military applications that require: (i) wide dynamic range in thrust; (ii) high Isp; and (iii) high electrical efficiency.  For purely commercial applications, the PEG thruster will be useful for satellite station keeping, orbit raising, and attitude control.  For such applications the following advantages of the PEG thruster can be fully exploited: (i) various kinds of propellant gas can be used; (ii) thrust level can be adjusted by changing pulse frequency over 2~3 orders of magnitude; (iii) the life time of the thruster hardware will be much longer than the other thrusters; and (iv) construction of the thruster is simple and can be scaled easily.",Micro Thrusters

Verifying proper harness and connector signal interfaces is key to ensuring component health and overall system functionality.  Break-Out Boxes (BOB) are used to give test personnel access to electrical signals for probing, voltage injection, isolation checks, safe-to-mate checks, and voltage/current measurements.  Currently this involves manually attaching multimeters and oscilloscopes to banana jacks on the BOB, taking measurements and comparing to expected results.   Tiger Innovations proposes designing an automated break-out box to make electrical integration activities more efficient, repeatable, and safe by introducing software controlled test sequences and reducing human errors.  Additionally, significant schedule and cost reductions are realized by improving the speed and reliability of integration operations.  Our software controlled BOB would allow isolation and safe-to-mate checks to be accomplished in a fraction of the time required for a human operator.  Voltage and current measurements would be analyzed in the software for pass/fail criteria and reported to the user for inclusion in the test log.  Automating test sequences through the use of an automated BOB has the potential to significantly streamline spacecraft, payload and launch site electrical integration and test activities.","In the current spacecraft industry, break-out boxes are commonly made in-house and are often specific to each spacecraft mission.  In addition to the performance and schedule benefits an Auto-BOB can provide, we believe a market exists for a company to provide automated test equipment to a wide range of customers across government agencies and in the private sector.  The growing micro satellite market and the desire for responsive space applications is pushing more aggressive integration and test schedules and would benefit significantly by reducing electrical integration efforts through the use of the Auto-BOB.  Initial primary customers for an automated break-out box include NASA and associated contractors involved in the integration and test of small satellites.","Commercial extensions outside of NASA would focus on the micro satellite industry as the companies involved are often smaller, less resistant to change, and often face aggressive testing schedules with a limited integration team.  Once the benefits and reliability of the Auto-BOB have been demonstrated on flight programs in the micro satellite industry, sales could expand into larger satellite programs and the aerospace industry as a whole.  With a product successfully demonstrated in the aerospace industry, it should be feasible to market the Auto-BOB to a wide range of companies that perform electronics fabrication and testing.",Operations Concepts and Requirements; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures

The VSIE introduces into NASA Mission Design Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools and processes, which haven proven themselves in the industrial manufacturing world.  In addition to COTS PLM tools, the VSIE hinges on two key concepts: An enhanced Digital Mock-Up (termed DMU++) and the so-called Common Geometry Strategy. DMU typically addresses mechanical form, fit and function of a component or sub-assembly in the assembly context. We propose to go one step further and address electrical power, data, and other similar interfaces in the DMU to automatically detect compatibility issues beyond mere mechanical fit. This will be an enabling functionality for rapid mission design and integration of components from a database of existing off-the-shelf hardware such as the database currently under development at the NASA Ames Mission Design Center. The Common Geometry Strategy was introduced in the late 1990s in both the commercial aircraft engine and automotive industries, however, it has so far not found its way into satellite design or satellite mission design. The fundamental idea is that the same Master Model geometric information is readily available to all disciplines and individuals that need geometric information to perform their job. Since a particular disciplinary specialist may require only an abstraction of the detailed 3D-geometry, the idea of a ""Context Model"" is introduced. The Context Model is a simplified representation of the detailed 3D CAD model, which is simplified precisely to the level of detail required by the specialist, while maintaining full associativity to the Master Model geometry, so that it either automatically updates when the Master Model geometry changes, or at least notifies the specialist that it is out of date.","The results of this research directly benefit the NASA Ames Mission Design Center in their activity of assembling Small Satellite missions. Currently, the Missions Design Center does not employ an integrated, PLM-based approach in their design activities. The Mission Design Center receives geometric information from component suppliers in a variety of formats. The current in-house CAD package is Solidworks. Analysis tools such as STK and disciplines such as structural and thermal analysis need subsets of the detailed CAD geometry in particular formats that they can process. Currently, much time is spent converting geometry from one format to another, and critical information can be lost in the process. The proposed work will directly address these issues.In addition, there are a number of additional potential applications of this technology. For example, JPL could use our tools in the design of exploratory space probes. The tools could also play a role in the development of micro and nano satellites all the way to manned space missions.","The proposed VSIE is directly applicable to the Plug&Play space vehicle design approach currently being investigated by the US Air Force at AFRL Kirtland AFB. The goal of the plug and play space vehicle design approach is to apply the proven capability of computer peripherals to integrate themselves with computers to space vehicle components. This will enable space vehicles to be assembled quickly enough to meet rapidly developing operational needs where time is the critical factor.  Advatech Pacific is currently working with AFRL Kirtland AFB to develop the ISET tool which enables pre-conceptual/conceptual level design of space vehicles by both traditional approaches and utilizing standardized plug and play space vehicle components.  The DMU++ concept suggested in the present proposal will be directly applicable to support this Plug&Play scenario.

This proposal responds to NASA SBIR topic S4.09 ""Autonomous Multi-Mission Virtual Ground and Spacecraft Operations"". The significance of our SDGS work is that the monolithic, stovepipe, and hardware centric nature of ground stations will be reduced.  Major system components will be moved to software, thereby promoting remote, network-based maintenance, upgrades, and new technology development.  Off the shelf software modules will be available, but also mechanism for low-level ground station customization for mission specifics; all done remotely over the Internet.  Costly hardware upgrades will be reduced or eliminated. Our innovation is in the intelligent combination of software-defined radio techniques and virtual machines.  This enables a near complete software solution to primary ground station functions. It simplifies ground station hardware and enables flexible application support. In Phase 1 we propose to architect an SDGS system for support of expected small satellite missions.  We will prototype basic elements with an on orbit or engineering model satellite system from our partners. Commercial applications include communication support for satellites and high altitude balloon systems.  Our customers will include NASA, NSF, DoD, and private satellite builders such as universities and venture space. The PI, Dr. James Cutler, has extensive small satellite and ground station experience.  He has prototype a global ground station network to operate satellites as if they were nodes on the Internet. Our facilities located in Northern California have tools for computer and radio development, and access to small satellite systems and ground station resources.","We have identified several initial NASA customers for our ground station technology. We are partnering with the small satellite office at NASA Ames Research Center.  They have launched the Genesat nanosatellite and considering a program that launches one satellite per month.  Current NASA ground networks will not be able to support communication requirements for these missions.  We are also working with NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to support nanosatellite solar sail mission, CubeSail.  They will require networked ground station support for their 2009 mission.  Additionally, NASA's Living With A Star (LWS) Program is developing the Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) space mission that will benefit from global, 24/7 reception of space weather beacons.  NASA also intends to broadcast space weather parameters via a real-time beacon from both of the RBSP spacecraft. Space weather beacon data availability will be limited by availability of space weather ground stations and antenna coverage.  The availability of an array of geographically-dispersed ground stations capable of providing autonomous 24/7 downlink of the RBSP space weather beacon data at low cost, such as that proposed here, will be critically important the space weather community.  The RBSP mission will be an excellent customer for our ground station systems.","NSF is a potential near term costumer.  They have recently announced at the Small Satellite Conference in 2007 that they will be sponsoring several CubeSat launches per year starting roughly in 2009.  We anticipate 3  10 satellites launched per year in this program.  Our multiple mission support technology combined with our FGN concepts will be a crucial enabler for a low-cost operations concept for these NSF missions.  We are also just beginning to explore DoD related opportunities.  Our ability to quickly reconfigure and upgrade ground stations through virtual machines updates is key element to responsive space.  Not only will launchers and satellites be responsive, but also so must ground stations to respond to changing communication environments.  FEMA may be a potential customer as well.  In our high altitude balloon work, we are working with the AeroStar Aerospace Corporation on disaster recovery applications.  The balloon will act as a high-speed communication relay for recovery teams.  Our multiple mission technology will be useful for both the balloon relay and ground nodes.",Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; RF

From the throughput perspective, there has been an increased need in higher uplink and downlink rates for on-orbit operations.  On the hardware side, long lead, single channel radios have been a programmatic nightmare to acquire and more and more problematic to operate given the frequency crowding.This study proposes a modern architecture based transceiver that comes to provide one integrated solution to all these issues.  This proposal will design demonstrate a transceiver which can operate on both SGLS and USB uplinks and be fully frequency and mode programmable both during integration, and on the fly.  In addition it will offer selectable channels for various mission profiles.  Last but most important, it will use spectrally efficient modulation formats to enable high speed uplinks and support advanced communications protocols.","Many spacecraft applications will be able to take advantage of the high performance IP transceiver.  The applications apply to NASA, DoD, and commercial sectors as one.  Applications include responsive space missions that receive frequency assignment shortly before launch.  Commercial missions will find this solution attractive when they need to provide service in different ITU regions (different frequencies).  It will also support many research missions (and even more, tactical missions) that need to upload new code for processors and embedded devices.  Any mission that suffers from unintentional harmful interference can take advantage of the frequency agility and mutual interference issues can be resolved without having to compromise services.  This same functionality can be used in NASA research missions in which there are several distinct phases and switching between different services is needed.","With the onset of net-centric communication systems in space especially with the DoD, the technology found in the high performance IP transceiver will be a must have to maintain efficient and reliable links.  Innoflight's current research and network test results suggest that straight IP communication protocols and applications can work well beyond LEO.",Architectures and Networks; Highly-Reconfigurable; RF

This technology has terrestrial applications for the exploration of the deep earth crust including volcano research, deep fissure research, and deep oil exploration.  However, the much larger market is in the industrial sector, where this technology allows for cooling of sensors in harsh environments, such as combustion stacks and blast furnaces, but also for efficient emissions-free industrial high-temperature heating.  While this high-temperature heat pump technology can be used to raise the temperature of  energy to be rejected for cooling (like the proposed Venus electronics cooling application), this technology can also be used to supply 500oC energy for more efficient electrical process heating without the exhaust and related environmental issues associated with combustion heaters and with energy efficiency advantages over straight electrical resistance heating.

The boost converters will increase the low voltage supply (~ 0.7 to 3V) of an advanced CMOS integrated circuit to the higher values (3-10V) required for integrated command/control/drive electronics for sensors, actuators and instrumentation. The high voltage capability is a result of our patented, CMOS compatible transistor technology that is radiation tolerant (TID>1 MRad), SEL immune and capable of wide temperature range operation (-196C to +150C). This new transistor technology has been demonstrated at multiple foundries and advanced device models are available for circuit design and simulation. The DC-DC boost converters will be integrated directly with the CMOS components to provide a single chip solution, greatly reducing the number of active and passive components that would otherwise be required. By allowing enhanced voltage operation in future CMOS technology nodes we will be avoiding many of the obsolescence problems facing NASA missions that are dependent upon commercial electronics. The circuits will be designed to operate in low temperature environments that experience wide temperature swings such as those found on the moon, Mars, Titan, Europa and comets.","Wide temperature range DC-DC boost converters that are compatible with advanced CMOS technologies will be widely applicable to NASA science and exploration missions scheduled for the next decade and beyond. It is expected that sensors and actuators based on micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) will feature heavily in future NASA missions. Often these MEMS components use operating voltages that exceed the anticipated CMOS values. The current solution requires additional interface and control electronics and associated point-of-load power sources, with a corresponding increase in mass, volume and system complexity. By integrating a low-input-voltage/high-output-voltage capability directly on an advanced CMOS component we are providing an elegant solution to the potential obsolescence problem facing MEMS-based sensors, actuators and other instrumentation components. By developing components for wide temperature range applications (-180C to +150C) we are enabling missions that will benefit from components to be mounted directly in the Lunar and Martian environments i.e. outside of any thermally controlled warm box. These components will also be of use in missions to Venus that employ environmental chambers with temperatures controlled to < 150C.","The MESFET technology we are developing will have widespread applications in commercial electronics, wherever low-power, mixed-signal circuits are required. SOI MESFETs offer significant 'added-value' to existing SOI product lines because of their high voltage capability that greatly exceeds the maximum operating voltage of the SOI MOSFETs. This will allow new SOI products to be developed, without additional manufacturing costs. Examples include the DC-DC boost converters described in this proposal as well as multiplexers, voltage and current regulators, and precision voltage references. Circuits that are required to drive inductive loads such as certain types of power amplifiers (Class E and F) will also benefit from the high breakdown voltage of the SOI MESFETsWe expect the non-NASA commercial applications of SOI MESFETs to be significant.

The one-to-three meter range has been identified as a critical regime for planetary exploration; e.g., for potentially identifying subsurface organic material on Mars or polar resource deposits on the Moon. While there has been some technology development in planetary subsurface access, there is currently no surefire flight-like approach to robotically getting to this depth through layers of material like rock (most challenging being basalt), regolith, and icy mixtures. In Phase 1, we will experimentally identify the relative utility of rotary vs. rotary percussive drilling in the most challenging target materials under a variety of operational parameters, and extrapolate these results to three meters. Thus far there has been no apples-to-apples comparison of rotary vs. rotary-percussive drilling in this depth regime, though it is believed that rotary-percussive drilling has many advantages over rotary drilling including better penetration in hard targets. This will be a very test-heavy program. We will minimize costs by using an already available test rig - our one-of-a-kind one-meter class lunar drilling platform with rotary and rotary-percussive capability. This is an instrumented rig so we can measure system health and reactions back into the platform and we have the ability to vary drilling operational parameters to test the limits of the system. We will perform tests in Mars and lunar simulant, also readily available in our extensive library of planetary analog materials.

Subsurface access on Mars is key to the search for life and understanding conditions favorable to life including the presence and morphology of forms of water, as well as for geological investigations. Potentially relevant missions may include Astrobiology Field Laboratory, Mid-Size Rovers, Scout, and Mars Sample Return. A lunar subsurface access tool would not only be of scientific interest, but is also necessary for resource mapping and geotechnical properties assessment during a lunar robotic precursor mission. A drill, combined with sample acquisition and analysis, could identify regolith composition for determining the presence and quantities of lunar resources for future ISRU. Regolith geotechnical properties may also be inferred from drill telemetry as well. This information is important for understanding excavability, load-bearing capacity and trafficability of lunar regolith for ISRU and lunar infrastructure development. Future missions could be augmented with human operation or utilize human-robot interaction for long traverses reducing unnecessary Extra-Vehicular Activity risks to human safety. Once developed, a one-meter class drill could also be modified for research on Venus, comets, Europa and Near Earth Objects.

Mission architectures are being pursued where robots are assisted or controlled completely by tethers.Tethers are or will be used in many areas within the Science Mission Directorate's domain, as well as within Exploration Systems. Missions may eventually penetrate ices & explore subsurface seas on Europa & Enceladus, using tethers throughout. Aerobots could employ tethers on Mars & Titan, as well as non-landed spacecraft observing Phobos, Deimos, asteroids and comets. Subsurface access missions for science and resource utilization on terrestrial planets could require wire-line drilling & borehole instrumentation.

From communications with colleagues at MBARI, the field would seem to benefit from developments in ruggedized tethers, increased power & communication capabilities with decreased weight, and increased state knowledge of the tether system, including tension and position. Much can be learned from this community as well.The primary design case for supporting tethered vehicles on Mars applies well to ground terrestrial vehicles in rough terrain. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in tethered configurations could apply both the intelligent sensing & management attributes and the transmission of power & data. Areas of application also include supporting inspection robots in mines, infrastructure as pipes, and Homeland Security scenarios such as rubble pile sites. As mentioned above, deep drilling and borehole sensing on land could also employ these technologies.",Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Mobility; Tethers

The current design philosophy of MER, Beagle 2, Phoenix & MSL, sees select tools and instruments permanently affixed to the arm end-effector.  Future missions will be size & mass constrained and will need to be more capable than their predecessors. One technical solution that would enable deployment of multiple tools and instruments from a compact, lightweight manipulator is an electromechanical coupler or tool changing mechanism which can reliably take a tool or instrument out of a magazine and couple it, form-locking and force-locking, to the end-effector.The program's ultimate goal is to develop and demonstrate a highly reliable and scalable robotic tool-change system in a relevant environment from a relevant robotic platform. In Phase I, we will perform a detailed investigation of robotic tool-changer requirements, design strategies and tall poles for robotic systems exploring Mars and the Moon, including first order experiments to verify feasibility of specific enabling design features. Requirements such as cycles, stiffness, strength, repeatability, misalignment-tolerance and electrical characteristics will be derived by considering MER and Phoenix as models for instrument type and operational patterns, robotic arm capability and environment and by deriving future mission requirements.  There are a few terrestrial applications (ROVs in the off-shore oil industry) and space applications (Shuttle and ISS RMS Latching End-Effector system) for which a subset of design strategies may be applicable. We will consider these and leverage lessons learned from our experience with (1) electromechanical systems for MER, Phoenix and MSL which perform reliably in dusty environments and (2) our high TRL designs for electrical and mechanical robotic connections both for Mars and on-orbit.","Proposed future missions to Mars and the Moon will require spacecraft equipped with compact and lightweight robotic manipulators that are flexible and universally usable.  Such manipulators will need to be capable of handling different types of tools and instruments without increasing the weight of the robot arm. End-of-arm mass, cabling and packaging constraints inevitably limit the type and number of tools that may be carried by the arm. In addition to current tasks such as placement of sensing instruments, digging, grinding and drilling tools, some of the tasks potentially facing future smaller robotic arms include manipulation and transfer of sample storage containers, remote sensor emplacement and spacecraft inspection and repair.Dust tolerant Tool-Changer and Gripper systems will be key components to future exploration missions and would find extensive applications in systems designed to operate on Mars, the Moon and other dusty environments. Future mission scenarios featuring flexible, universal architectures for robotic end-of-arm sensing and sampling and other in-situ assembly or interconnection activities, will all call for such connections.  These might include the Astrobiology Field Lab, Dual Mid-size Rovers, Mars Sample Return and next-decade landed lunar missions.","Coupling methods developed in this effort will have robotic, construction and device interconnection applications in terrestrial harsh environments, such as deserts and dry climates, down-hole geothermal and oil machines, and mining operations.  Within the military and homeland security worlds, the current emphasis with respect to robotics is on IED detection and defeat, Explosive Ordnance Disposal and resolution of other situations that may be hazardous to humans (e.g., battlefield extraction).  As operator adeptness and general familiarity with robotic systems grows, robotic platforms are increasingly being called into dangerous situations in the harsh desert environments of Iraq and Afghanistan.  In addition, local municipal Bomb Squads use robotic platforms every day to interrogate and neutralize suspicious situations.  Anything that makes these robots more flexible and robust is highly sought after.  Even with the most widely used unmanned ground vehicles, operators must drive the robot back into a safe zone to change end-effectors.  A Tool-Changer system developed by Honeybee to sell to American UGV platform providers would be a commercial success.There is also a strong demand for ultra-reliable and flexible robotic platforms with tool-exchange capability in the fields of Nuclear Facility Decommissioning, Hazard Emergency Response, as well as robotic mining systems.",Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Manipulation; Modular Interconnects; Perception/Sensing; Tools

The proposed technology will interoperate with common existing scientific visualization software and provide equivalent core functionality optimized for very large data sets. Existing scientific visualization tools have specific limitations for large scale scientific data sets.  Of these four limitations can be seen as paramount: (a) Memory Management, (b) Remote Visualization, (c) Interactivity, and (d) Specificity.  SciViz overcomes these four issues and uses stack oriented approach in order to produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments. SciViz  will be an open source implementation.","Our initial target markets are NASA supercomputing centers and heliophysics community where we already have an established contact base.  The situation within the heliosciences is representative of many other fields where there is no dominant visualization software in use and there exists considerable duplication of effort as each group tries to develop similar customization on their favorite visualization platform.  Often the limitation of the particular visualization software becomes evident after the individual or the group has spent a great deal of effort in building the particular customized features.   As the attached letters of support attest, there remains a strong need for visualization software for analysis of large data sets.  This select group of scientists who have agreed to serve as our beta testers are users of NASA's supercomputing systems.   By addressing the specific needs of this group, we hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution and enhancing user productivity and in so doing pave the way for infusion of SciViz into NASA's supercomputing system.  Through our connection with San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), we also plan to test and deploy our product at SDSC.","The amount of data collected and stored electronically is doubling every three years.  In the face of this unprecedented growth in the amount of data from simulations and instruments/spacecraft, our capability to manipulate, explore, and understand large datasets is growing only slowly. Scientific visualization which transforms raw data into vivid 2D or 3D images has been recognized as an effective way to understand large-scale datasets. However, most existing visualization methods do not scale well with the growing data size and other parts of a data analysis pipeline.  This is a problem affecting science, engineering, medicine and business.  According to Microsoft Partner Capacity Research Group, data visualization represents a US$2 billion worldwide market.  SciViz provides a solution that enables interactive visualization of large data sets.  As such, we expect strong marketing opportunities for SciViz within the federal government, scientific organizations, and commercial sector.  A critical business decision is open source vs. commercial approaches.   We plan to have SciViz as open source software. Our stack oriented approach rather than a framework driven method should produce tools that can be more easily and widely adopted with minimal interruption within existing visualization environments.

A popular data analysis tool in the NASA research community is IDL (Interactive Data Language).  A main limitation presently on performing data analysis with IDL for NASA researchers is that often the data to analyze is located remotely from the scientist, and also, often the data is too  large to transfer for local analysis.Researchers have developed a  protocol for accessing remote data, the Data Access Protocol (DAP), and one can use DAP from within IDL, but presently using the DAP-IDL interface is both limited and cumbersome.  We propose to develop a more powerful, user-friendly interface to DAP for IDL.  At the completion of this work, users will be able to browse remote data sets from an IDL GUI, have an interactive IDL command line session simultaneous with the remote visualization and write custom IDL functions that will act on the remote data with results displayed locally.  We will make all of these IDL-DAP tools usable seamlessly for any IDL user.","The problem of remote data that must be analyzed and visualized locally exists in all branches of NASA. Increasing the data access capabilities of the data analysis software is therefore of interest to all NASA branches. The widespread use of IDL throughout NASA makes the tools developed in this project applicable within the entire agency. In addition, the continued development of GDL, a low-cost alternative to the commercial IDL software, is a cost reduction factor beneficial to all NASA branches. Currently, DAP is used to serve remote data for GSFC, PODAAC, and OceanESIP.","IDL is widely used at National Laboratories, universities and private industry.

The building blocks themselves, such as distributed arrays, parallel linear algebra, parallel Fourier transforms and parallel statistical algorithms, will be implemented by leveraging existing high-performance libraries and creating high-level Python objects that completely hide the details of the underlying libraries and parallelism from users. The building blocks will be developed as part of the open source IPython project, which will enable users to develop, debug and run parallel simulations in a completely interactive manner, similar to Matlab or IDL.The anticipated Phase I result will be the demonstration of an interactive parallel simulation utilizing prototype building blocks on a commodity Linux cluster.

Users of existing tools such as Matlab, IDL and Mathematica, will find the development environment and interfaces developed in this project familiar and easy to use.Particular industries that will benefit from these tools include quantitative finance, data-mining and oil and gas.

This fundamental restriction greatly limits the capability of human being in perceiving and visualizing the complexity of real world objects. The primary objective of this Phase 1 SBIR is to develop a novel high-resolution volumetric 3D display system that has a static solid crystal screen. In contrast to conventional 3D visualization based on 2D flat screen, the ""volumetric 3D display"" we proposed herein possesses a true 3D display volume, has a 360 degree look-around group viewing capability, and allows a group of viewers to simultaneously view and analyze 3D data without wearing any special viewing goggle.  It provides both physiological and psychological depth cues to human visual system to perceive 3D objects and is considered as the Holy Grail solution to 3D visualization of many NASA datasets that inherently are extremely large, complicated, and multi-dimensional.  Although we successfully developed various volumetric 3D display systems in the past, most these previously developed systems generate their 3D display volume by a large size moving screen that rotates constantly at a speed of 600~1800 RPM. The structure of a moving screen dramatically complicates the design, production, use, and maintenance of the display system, making it very delicate and fragile for daily uses for NASA visualization work on earth.  Due to the existence of a large moving parts, such volumetric 3D display technology is certainly not suitable for on-board uses in space missions.  This SBIR program will investigate the feasibility of a technology breakthrough recently made by Xigen LLC and developed a revolutionary new concept of volumetric 3D display, which totally eliminates any moving screen.","A true 3D volumetric display device would literally add a new dimension to the advanced human/computer interface, and provides visualizations of many NASA datasets that are extremely large, complicated, and multi-dimensional.  Examples include multi-spectrum image dataset acquired by satellites, simulation results of man-rated space flight vehicle entry, visualizations of distant planet topography, and 3D visualizations of coupled ocean and weather systems.   The proposed volumetric 3D display technique would provide 3D virtual reality environments for scientific data visualization that eliminate the need for special user devices like goggles or helmets.  Due to the complexity of NASA data analysis and visualization requirements, the ability to provide sharable three-dimensional visualization and measurement would significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of decision making, validation, and collaborative development environment. The proposed volumetric 3D display system provide a novel tool for data viewing, real-time data browse, and general purpose rendering of multivariate geospatial scientific data sets that use geo-rectification, data overlays, data reduction, and data encoding across widely differing data types and formats.","The volumetric 3D display is a fundamental technological breakthrough that could change the way human being viewing complex information, thus has profound impact on the society advancement. The unique advantages of the proposed static screen volumetric 3D display technology include: * No moving screen; * Inherent parallel mechanism for 3D voxel addressing;  * High spatial resolution; * Full color display is easy to implement  * Fine voxel size (at a sub-millimeter level);  * No blind spot on the display volume and the display volume can be of arbitrary shape.  * Simple and elegant system structure design; * No special viewing glasses or any special eyewear is needed to view the 3D images; * No image jitter affect that is associated with moving screen; * Low-cost and low-maintenance.

The NASA Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) has been developing a procedure representation language (PRL) that both captures the form of traditional procedures and allows for automatic translation into code that can be executed by NASA-developed autonomous executives.  However, PRL is in a relative infancy with regard to supporting many of the autonomous software components being developed by NASA, specifically automated planners and schedulers.  In this proposal we will design and test additional representations to PRL for resources, inter-procedure constraints and subprocedures so that automated planners can take better advantage of the PRL-generated procedures.  The work plan includes developing scenarios and use cases, developing requirements for planning -- both manual and automated -- from the scenarios, developing XML tags for the PRL changes, testing the PRL enhancements in the use cases with robotic and life support simulations, and translating the changes into planning languages with proven semantics.","Procedures are at the core of all NASA missions.  Mission planning is also at the core of all space missions due to the high cost of space assets such as astronauts, equipment and communication links.  Our technologies will have applications from Mission Control to on-board NASA vehicles and outposts.  We expect applications of our technology to immediately impact NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP). Two areas of ETDP will be immediate beneficiaries of this technology.  First, the Centaur robot at NASA JSC is already using a preliminary version of PRL and a simple user interface to allow a remote supervisor to command the Centaur over a communication link.  Our work will provide connection to automated planning technologies.  Second, the Automation for Operations (A4O) project run out of NASA ARC is using PRL to enhance spacecraft operations.  Our PRL extensions and planning technology would also be immediately applicable to spacecraft operations.","The military is currently a large customer for unmanned vehicle operations. Unmanned vehicles, both air and ground, are becoming more and more common in battlefield  situations.  Future Combat Systems (FCS) envision manned and unmanned vehicles of all sizes working side-by-side.  In addition, Congress has mandated that one-third of all military vehicles must be unmanned by 2015.  As these unmanned vehicles are increasingly deployed in tandem with dismounted forces coordinating software will be necessary to ensure successful operations.  Procedures and mission planning play a large role in these kinds of operations. TRACLabs Inc. has an existing relationship with the Army's unmanned ground vehicle center at the TARDEC (Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center) facility in Warren Michigan.

Effective software testing is especially important in mission-critical software, where erroneous behavior poses a risk to safety or mission success.  Automated test case generation can make testing more efficient and effective, saving resources and reducing risk.  Safeware Engineering Corporation proposes to develop the algorithms necessary to streamline software testing by automatically generating test cases directly from SpecTRM-RL models.  SpecTRM-RL (Specification Tools and Requirements Methodology - Requirements Language) is a requirements language that was designed to be highly readable, allowing even non-specialists to understand them, but also completely formal.  A SpecTRM-RL model specifies the black-box behavior of the system; test cases based on these requirements will focus on the intended behavior of the system.  A smaller set of test cases will allow for more rapid error identification, while a larger set will provide more comprehensive coverage.  The algorithms will have varying levels of completeness, allowing for a trade-off between test coverage and testing resources.  Safeware provides a tool, SpecTRM, which assists analysts with editing, analyzing, and executing formal requirements models.  A phase II effort would implement these algorithms, adding test-case generation to SpecTRM.","NASA is involved in the development of complex systems that are highly reliant on software, such as human-rated space vehicles.  These systems must be reliable and safe, but also affordable to develop and maintain.  NASA has recognized the need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools; the basic SpecTRM toolset was developed under a NASA SBIR.  The addition of automated test case generation to the SpecTRM toolset will provide testers with valuable assistance, streamlining software testing.  The algorithms developed by the proposed research, as well as the tool to be developed in Phase II could potentially apply to any NASA  project with a need for reliable, safe and cost-effective mission-critical software.","The need for innovative requirements analysis methods and automated tools has been recognized across industries as varied as aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical device, providing an ample market for such a tool.

Next, robust diagnostic techniques will be developed to achieve quantifiable damage location and size estimation that account for the uncertainties induced by the environments or the system itself continuously during flight or at scheduled maintenance intervals. Finally, efficient probabilistic prognostic methods will be integrated with diagnostic outputs to provide real time estimation of residual strength and remaining life of the damaged structure.

The incumbent CEV heatshield TPS for Orion's Block II lunar return is PICA, a low-density carbon fiber infiltrated with phenolic resin. Variants of PICA with improved thermomechanical properties would benefit future missions. This effort will create a series of ""mid-density"" ablative materials to fill the gap between low-density PICA and high-density Carbon-Carbon.  Touchstone's carbon foam (CFOAMREG) has excellent thermomechanical properties, can be tailored to a range of densities (12 to 95 lbs/cu-ft), and has an open-cell structure allowing infiltration of high-temperature materials.  Aspen Aerogels recently completed a Phase II subcontract with Touchstone demonstrating the capability of fully infiltrating CFOAMREG with phloroglucinol-furfuraldehyde carbon aerogels with chemistry similar to PICA's.  Phase I will use carbon aerogel infiltration in CFOAMREG samples of 3 densities from 17 to 35 lb/cu-ft to be calcined at Touchstone to carbonize the aerogel, creating a mass of amorphous carbon within the pore structure. Filling CFOAMREG pores with pure carbon yields an inherent reduction in the TPS radiant heat transfer.  Fully carbonized samples will be re-infiltrated with PICA phenolic resin, and sample characterization will be conducted via SEM to demonstrate the capability of producing small-scale Carbon Foam-Aerogel/Phenolic composites at various densities. At the end of Phase I, the TRL will be 3-4 and then 4-5 by the conclusion of Phase II.","Larger vehicle size and entry conditions of future NASA missions demand TPS materials beyond the PICA ablator in use since the 1976 Viking mission. This proposed effort will provide significant benefit to NASA by introducing a new class of TPS materials critical to upcoming explorations.  With tailoring capability, the material has potential to create a suite of ablative TPS materials that can be chosen based on aerothermal conditions and density requirements of particular missions. The Astrobiology Mission to Mars is a new robotic sample return initiative where larger vehicles and higher re-entry speeds produce more severe combined environments (turbulent flow, combined convective and radiative heating rates) than previous missions. The ESMD Orion Block III crew exploration vehicle (Mars return) is a future NASA mission with the heatshield's TPS material to be determined.  The TPS material challenge is that the heating rates will be five times greater than for lunar return.","The benefits of this effort stand to be of enormous value not only to NASA but also to the Department of Defense.

These materials will be made from new nano-composites, using fabrication techniques developed at Eltron. The proposed thermoelectric composite's matrix has already demonstrated exceptional ability for functioning in the environment of space.  Used in a cooling system, these materials will provide an effective means for controlling the temperature of surfaces subject to the rapidly changing temperatures encountered in space.  They can be used to prevent development of large temperature gradients and thereby prevent the mechanical stresses that accompany them.  Used for power-generation, these new materials will be very efficient both because of the properties that the nano-phase materials and its matrix bring to the thermoelectric material.  Because of the difficulties presented in the harsh environment of space, thermal management and power generation is most easily provided through devices that do not have any moving parts, are very durable, do not require maintenance, and operate efficiently over a wide range of temperatures.  The proposed materials meet all these requirements.","In the past, NASA's interest in thermoelectric systems has stemmed both from the need for an effective means of temperature control via the Peltier effect for surfaces exposed to the rapidly changing temperatures that occur in space, and for use in generating electrical power via the Seebeck effect for space vehicles too distant from the sun for effective use of solar panels.  The new materials being developed here will be capable of withstanding both high and low temperatures and so they can be used to prevent development of large temperature gradients and the mechanical stresses that accompany them on missions such as the upcoming Mars and Venus trips.  This is particularly true of the Venus landing, where materials will need to withstand up to 500 C temperatures.  The improvement in efficiency possible from these materials could make them competitive with solar cells as a power source for space missions.","Successful development of this technology could result in considerable improvement in efficiency over currently used evaporative systems used in consumer and industrial refrigeration.

The Lunar thermal environment typically includes long periods in extremely cold thermal environments.  A variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) radiator will be developed that passively accommodates the changing thermal load and environment.  In a VCHP, a non-condensable gas is added that blocks a portion of the condenser.  The gas charge blocks more of the condenser as the heat pipe evaporator temperature changes.  This allows the heat pipe evaporators (and any attached heat exchanger) to remain at an almost constant temperature. In addition to passively controlling the thermal load, the gas allows the fluid in the heat pipe to freeze in a controlled fashion as the heat pipe is shut down, avoiding damage.  In addition, the gas in the VCHP will help with start-up from a frozen condition.","The immediate NASA application is for Lunar and Martian radiators that can passively accommodate the large swings in environmental conditions between Lunar (or Martian) day and night, including long periods at very low temperatures.  In addition, the VCHP can passively accommodate large changes in thermal load, and avoid damage during periods of low thermal load.  In addition, the non-condensable gas in the VCHP will help with the heat pipe start-up from cold conditions.","A commercial application is VCHP heat exchangers in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  A typical system must maintain inlet and outlet temperatures within ±30oC despite a turndown ratio of 5:1 in reactant flow rate.  The current scheme uses a bypass valve, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control, requires power, and has a large pressure drop.

Currently, NASA is developing nuclear electric propulsion systems for long-duration space missions like the Jupiter Icy Moon Orbital mission.  Heat pipes are proposed for the transfer of waste heat from the power generation systems and for use in the radiator systems used for the dissipation of the waste heat. Heat pipe thermal control technology has also been proposed for electric power generation for a lunar habitat, for the Space Solar Power Project, and spacecraft thermal control. Improved capillary pumping capabilities in zero gravity and under acceleration in nanowire heat pipes could prove valuable in space applications where gravity assisted systems are not functional.","The thermal characteristics of high-power-density CPUs in today's high-end computing applications are rapidly outpacing the cooling capabilities of commercially available strategies. The primary devices driving the market for nanowire heat pipes are high performance microprocessors.  Technological advances in thermal control are needed to accommodate rising power densities in new electronic and optical devices and a steady replacement of traditional heat sinks by hybrid heat sinks with embedded heat pipes. The initial market for the nanowire array wick heat pipes will be the niche market of high end specialty heat pipes designed for military and aerospace applications including laser, radar and antenna systems. The next anticipated specialty market is thermal management in high end servers, followed by portable computers and other electronic consumer goods. Illuminex has partnered with Thermacore Inc., the largest North American manufacturer and distributor of heat pipes to bring the advanced nanowire heat pipe technology to the market.",Cooling

AM will enhance the current clinical gold standard immunoassay methodology by using its proprietary bead-based aptamer selection process to select dithiophosphate backbone-modified (PS2) ""thio"" aptamers (PS2-thioaptamers) as replacements for antibodies in immunoassays.  The PS2-thioaptamers are binding agents with functionality comparable to antibodies but with very long shelf-life under ambient environment storage.  The PS2-thioaptamers bind much more tightly to their targets than regular aptamers without sacrificing specificity, and are much more nuclease resistant.  AM's bead-based process allows selection and identification of PS2-thioaptamers, which cannot be directly selected using older aptamer technologies such as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX).  AM will also demonstrate PS2-thioaptamer integration into a state-of-the-art microfluidics instrument from Sandia National Laboratory that meets NASA's form factor needs for space flight.  The Phase I Project will demonstrate detection and quantification of osteocalcin (OC) using a PS2-thioaptamer in a prototype microfluidics device (TRL-4).  Phase II will entail completing the panel of biomarkers for bone demineralization and delivering a prototype of the system to NASA.  In Phase III, AM and Sandia will deliver a flight test system to NASA and begin FDA validation of the system for potential use in clinical diagnostics of osteoporosis as well as other conditions.","The combination of AM's proprietary PS2-thioaptamers with the microfluidics technology from Sandia National Laboratory will result in a biomarker detection and quantification system that is compatible with long duration spaceflight.  The PS2-thioaptamers offer performance comparable to antibodies but have a very long shelf life and can be stored in ambient conditions.  The Sandia microfluidics instrument is small, low mass, easy to operate and draws little power.  The combination of these two technologies would result in a flight system that would enable NASA to detect and quantify bone demineralization biomarkers during long duration missions and would also enable NASA to develop other clinical diagnostic assays for many other conditions of interest.  The stage of development of these technologies as well as the use of proven clinical diagnostic immunoassay methodologies enables AM to develop and deliver a flight test system quickly for near-term NASA flight research into bone loss as well as other conditions of interest.","A PS2-thioaptamer assay for potentially any condition that has FDA-approved biomarkers could be developed and integrated into the microfluidics instrument, which provides significant clinical diagnostic market commercialization potential.  The PS2-thioaptamer binding agents could also be used in almost any detection/quantification technology thus opening the possibility of faster diagnostic market commercialization using current clinical devices.  Prior to FDA-approved diagnostic applications, the PS2-thioaptamers could readily be used in a manner similar to antibodies for life science research. Additionally, since the PS2-thioaptamers are very nuclease resistant, it is possible that the same binding agents selected for diagnostic/research use could also be used effectively as therapeutics.",Biomolecular Sensors

The wearable physiological monitor proposed by Linea Research Corporation can be used to continuously observe the beat to beat blood pressure. The monitor can be used to observe the physiological effect of various countermeasures against prolonged exposures to reduced gravitational environments. The proposed device will allow the monitoring of the pharmacological effect on blood pressure over prolonged periods. Currently, beat to beat monitoring of blood pressure is done primarily in hospital settings through invasive procedures involving percutaneous insertion of catheters into the radial or brachial arteries. While non-invasive beat to beat blood pressures based on either the Penaz method or arterial applanation tonometry are currently available, they each have limitations. In addition, all monitors are based on large stationary equipment that requires the subject to be immobile. Successful implementation of the proposed program will result in an accurate wearable beat to beat blood pressure measurement.",Autonomous medical care for the crew during human exploration missions is critical in preventing degradation in health due to adverse physiological responses to space flight environments. A wearable multi-parameter physiological monitor that includes continuous blood pressure measurements will be crucial in providing proper medical support for both normal activities and medical emergencies. The device can be used to monitor the long term physiological effects of hypogravity and the effects of the countermeasures against hypogravitational environments. The device can also be used to monitor the health status of crew during extravehicular activities (EVA). The system will be developed with the goal of implementing the monitor as a wearable device which necessitates low power consumption and compact and lightweight form factor. The size criterion is a key factor for space applications as launch costs are directly determined by mass and volume.,"The proposed device can fundamentally change the way beat to beat blood pressure is measured in clinical settings. Currently, an accurate measurement of the beat to beat blood pressure requires an insertion of a pressure transducer into the blood vessel. While non-invasive methods that use the Panaz method or applanation tonometry exist, they do not provide the accuracy and repeatability provided by the invasive method. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an accurate beat to beat blood pressure monitoring device that will eventually eliminate the need for cannulation. The wearable nature of the device also provides significant market opportunities. There is a strong need for devices that can provide ambulatory monitoring of physiological parameters for the elderly or for individuals with chronic illness. There is also a market need for devices that can track the physiological status of individuals whose health is at risk from environmental hazards in their working environment (e.g. soldiers, first responders, mountain climbers, etc.).",Biomedical and Life Support; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Pilot Support Systems; Portable Life Support; Ultra-High Density/Low Power

Although, no effective treatments or prophylactic regimens have yet been defined, it is important to monitor the bone loss process in space.  As such, the sensor must be compact and facile to operate. Therefore, OpTech proposes to extend its already successful and patent-pending competitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-aptamer assay technology to the detection of bone loss and formation markers such as osteocalcin fragments, hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, C-terminal and N-terminal telopeptides.  In Phase I, OpTech will develop, clone and sequence aptamers to each of these markers.  OpTech will also incorporate fluorophore-labeled dUTP into the sequenced aptamers by asymmetric PCR and complex them to their quencher-labeled bone markers for testing in buffer, animal sera, and urine.  Finally, in Phase I OpTech will dry and reconstitute the assays that will be tested using a commercially available handheld, battery-operated fluorometer and validated using OpTech's spectrofluorometer. In Phase II, the FRET-aptamer assays will be optimized and packaged in special leak-proof sealed plastic cuvettes and delivered to NASA along with the handheld fluorometer for testing on the ISS or other space missions.","NASA would use this technology as a portable means for astronauts to self-monitor their bone loss with one-touch ease from urine or serum samples.  Monitoring of other non-bone-related analytes by NASA would also be possible, if appropriate FRET-assays were developed.","Women and the elderly could use this system as a rapid and facile point-of-care diagnostic system to monitor osteoporosis and the efficacy of therapeutic regimens.  The system might also be used to monitor bone repair following severe fractures or skeletal procedures related to plastic or reconstructive surgeries.

Due to restricted volume and mass capabilities within the newly-developing Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), there is a need for a multi-functional, compact exercise machine that can incorporate both resistive and aerobic exercise capabilities during lunar sortie missions.   The proposed innovation is an exercise device, the multi-functional Constant Force Resistive Exercise Unit (CFREU), that can provide a whole-body workout for aerobic exercise and resistive exercise.  The device provides constant force eccentrically and concentrically during multiple exercise configurations, allows resistance selection in 2.5kg increments, requires no power to operate, requires no on-orbit maintenance, and can be stowed in an area of 1 cubic foot. During the Phase I performance period, we propose to develop a prototype of this device and a feasibility assessment of the design for spaceflight and commercial use.","Valeo's competitive advantage lies within the CFREU design.  The unit is compact, easy to use, requires no power to operate, and requires no on-orbit maintenance or calibration.   There is an evident need for a gravity-independent exercise unit that can provide a constant force for resistive exercise with integrated aerobic capability fashioned in a compact and lightweight design that offers familiarity, safety, and comfort during exercise.","Rehabilitation institutions would benefit from the multi-functional CFREU design.  A portable exercise machine that can provide aerobic and constant force resistive capabilities in such a small volume is essential in clinical settings, and would prove especially beneficial in treating patients confined to bed rest.  Physiologically, the constant force resistance provided by the CFREU is comparable to a traditional weight stack machine, but without the bulkiness and mass of weight plates.  The personal home exercise equipment industry would also benefit from the multi-functional CFREU device.  The compact force packs of the CFREU allow the overall unit to be small enough for easy use as a home gym.  For the home gym design, future force packs can be designed such that they may be purchased individually by a consumer, and used as portable exercise devices when not in use with the full CFREU.  Thus, the force packs replace the need for expensive, heavy, and bulky traditional weight plates, and allow portability.",Biomedical and Life Support

The game will be built using an iterative usability driven approach where emphasis will be placed on building an engaging relevant game that builds from contextual task analysis and user profiling.  The specific technical challenges foreseen are integrating two approaches of cognitive workload modeling, and using learning curves to model game learning, then using algorithms to determine a user's workload as soon as they complete a timed interaction with the game.

In essence, they are 'laboratory' measures that appear unrelated to the real-world environment.  This leads to user non-compliance or rejection.  The present proposal describes a technique for integrating traditional cognitive performance measures with assessment of the system and mission in which the individual must operate. This yields quantified measures of the person's cognitive ability to perform specific jobs in space. Specifically, an entertaining and scientifically rigorous assessment tool is integrated with a sleep/fatigue model and a quantified workload estimate for each task. This is accomplished by selecting tests based on task analyses of what the astronaut actually has to do, using the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST) to predict performance capacity as a function of sleep/rest, and integrating a mathematical vector to quantify the  workload of specific tasks. The resulting ""Person-System-Mission (PSM) index"" provides a totally new and unique way not only to assess present cognitive capability, but to diagnose specific causes of decrement, and to suggest remedial actions.","As noted in the SBIR solicitation ""Due to high intensity workload, disturbed sleep conditions, and other stresses of spaceflight, some astronauts have reported experiences of disturbed cognitive processes and fatigue.""  In any complex system, such disturbances can be catastrophic, and cannot be tolerated.  Predicting the effects of such disturbances on specific tasks required of the astronaut, however, is essential since not all tasks require the same degree of cognitive capacity. The existence of a valid metric that is expressed in terms of the individual's ability to carry out specific tasks, rather than in terms of esoteric cognitive skills, will dramatically increase the value of the assessment tool to the individual, the commander, and the flight surgeon. This will lead to incorporation of such a metric on all spaceflights, especially those of long duration.","The principal non-NASA Government applications for the technology developed here will be in the Department of Defense and the Homeland Security Department.  This is true for exactly the same reasons that the technology is of interest to NASA. Mission- and safety-critical jobs frequently involve stressful conditions such as fatigue and high workload in both of these agencies.  In DoD, for instance, the need to assess the combat readiness of the dismounted warrior has led to the establishment of the ""Cog-Fit"" program, which is attempting to model the effects of combat stresses on the person's ability to perform their job.  The Air Force has similar programs.  Non-NASA commercial applications will involve marketing the technology to educational, industrial, and self-help organizations that will recognize the value of a scientifically well-grounded, entertaining system.

New packaging must satisfy NASA's 3-year storage mandate.  Foil laminate containers meet NASA's oxygen, moisture and general shelf life demands; however, their weight, processing and disposal characteristic are not ideal.  A previous NASA SBIR examined nanobarrier-containing packages; but these did not perform to NASA's needs.   The current SBIR proposes to remove oxygen electrochemically, control moisture independent of the packaging, and also carefully selecting packaging materials to perform some second generation function.  Using non-packaging-related control of oxygen and moisture allows versatile selection of primary packaging to permit packaging concepts unacceptable under NASA's existing packaging paradigm.  These include edible packaging, soluble pre-weighed reconstitutable  cartridges for beverages, and packages designed for compatibility with mission-grown foods.  Primary food packs would be bundled in an overpack designed to remove oxygen and to manage moisture. The overpack would itself serve a secondary mission function.   Overpack materials might include photovoltaic polymer sheets, light emitting plastics, or might simply serve a a waste or food storage function.  Shifting oxygen and moisture control away from packaging allows package construction from much lighter material with reduced weight, processing and disposal limitations.  A dialog on extravehicular food storage is proposed","Only imagination limits the advantages of the overpack concept to NASA.  At the most apparent level, the concept addresses NASA's desire for lightweight, waste-reduced, long shelf life, processing-compatible and food-preparation friendly packaging materials.  At the secondary level, the concept provides reuses for obvious needs for foods grown shipboard, such as disposal, storage, repacking and perhaps waste processing.  However, the strategy can also play a role at a level not as yet fully envisioned by providing innovative secondary polymer/plastic uses including: Fresnel lens to increase photovoltaic power, an illumination source from light emitting polymers, electricity from photovoltaic polymer overwraps, polymers which can be dissolved with or without heat to be recast, extruded, or spun into a veritable department store of novel items.   Activation of packages with antimicrobials, antioxidants, enzymes, cell free extracts, bacteriophages, or other chemical, biological or biochemical surfaces would provide protection, production and other useful innovations to packaging.  Whatever has value on earth will have incomprehensible value in space.  Packaging will be designed for infinite reuse and not disposal.","The concept of non-packaging control of oxygen and moisture has value in any bulk packaging or storage application.  The principles have relevance to Army rations which have shelf life demands similar to space rations.  Electrochemical removal of oxygen could prolong the quality of bulk aseptic foods.

Theoretically organelles and cell-free extracts could be attached to package surfaces to produce nutrients directly from carbon dioxide in the air.  A package could be virtually converted into a single cell organism which carriers out many useful functions.   Secondary uses for packaging could reduce disposal, add value to the container, and produce interest in the product.

Neutrons contribute a significant component to the total radiation dose during solar events. We propose to develop a rugged, compact, lightweight, non-hazardous CMOS-based detector technology for an existing neutron spectroscopic dosimeter system.  The existing system utilizes a unique gelled scintillation material, which enables the discrimination of neutron signals from gamma background using time profile of the scintillation signal.  We will demonstrate that the ultra-compact CMOS-SSPM integrated with its readout electronics can replace photomultiplier tubes and its discrete readout components used in the existing neutron spectroscopic dosimeter system.  When coupled to the existing system, the proposed technology will demonstrate a technology readiness level of 4.  This provides the necessary basis for a flight-ready neutron spectrometer system able to efficiently detect neutrons with energies up to 150MeV, and capable of rejecting gamma-ray and charged particle backgrounds using, respectively, the pulse shape discrimination characteristic of the gel scintillation detector and the of anti-coincidence scintillation detectors.","During space flight, both the immediate rate and neutron exposure information can be recorded simultaneously by the proposed high-efficiency spectroscopic dosimeter.  The lightweight, compact size and inexpensive nature of the CMOS SSPM sensors also opens the possibility of creating a radiation monitoring network for comparison of radiation exposure, including individual monitors for each crewmember with online data for the whole mission and ground-based research for comparison. The CMOS environment used to fabricate the SSPM with its integrated electronics enables low-cost and lightweight space-radiation dosimeters and solar particle monitors for NASA satellites, whose size and weight is limited only by the active neutron-sensitive scintillation material.","The development of a compact fast neutron dosimeter will be very useful for non-NASA applications such as: 1. Measuring the neutron dose for the radiological workers in National Labs such as the LANSCE\WNR facility at LANL where 70% of the neutron dose equivalent is due to neutrons with energies > 10 MeV.2. Fast neutron spectrometry in spallation sources, where the neutron energy range covers a large region up to few hundred MeV. It can be also used for neutron monitoring of the ADS (accelerator driven system) for transmutation purposes. 3. For the employees of the Department of Homeland Security at the U.S. points of entry.4. For environmental monitoring (such as during the management of nuclear waste).5. In medical applications such as fast neutron therapy.6. Protecting satellites and ground-based equipment from solar flares.7.

Q-Peak is in a unique position to develop this technique specifically for Nd:YLF owing to the extensive work that we have done over the past decade in developing our patented MPS systems, which employ Nd:YLF as the gain medium.

Lunar dust presents an important challenge to Lunar exploration and habitation, nonetheless it has some unique properties that can be taken advantage of in designing specialized filtration media capable of achieving efficient removal from air.  The rough surface shape combined with the electrically and magnetically charged nature of the dust means that rough, electrically activated filtration media will be effective tools for filtration.

The unique physical properties of the carbon nanotubes will be capitalized upon to create a filtration media with high efficiency and low pressure drop that can be electrically powered to enhance filtration of charged lunar dust particles.","There are important applications for this product throughout NASA's operations from protecting human life on lunar explorations, to cleaning the air of clean rooms, to reducing emissions from its vehicle fleet. The potential health and environmental impacts of airborne ultrafine particles are now known to be significant. Typical filtration solutions struggle to remove these very small contaminants. As a result, energy is wasted and, because of cost, some filtration applications are just not pursued. Products based on this technology will protect astronauts and sensitive equipment from lunar dust in the air handling systems of spacecraft and even in personal breathing apparatus. They will efficiently remove very small particulates from the air in NASA's clean rooms. Finally, filters will help to clean the emissions from the many earthbound diesel and other engines NASA operates to help reduce NASA's carbon footprint and improve the health of its employees and communities.","The estimated global market size for air purification equipment is estimated by some observers to be about $2.5 billion. As the public awareness of the health and environmental consequences of very fine particles increases, the demand for improved filtration will continue to increase. Protecting humans, animals, and delicate machinery from these tiny contaminants will continue to be a growing opportunity. The care that has been given to filtration in clean rooms will likely be more common in other spaces such as offices and vehicles.

The application of spray drying to brine is a first step in the development of a space-based system but spray drying is likely to be applicable to the  dewatering and stabilization of solid wastes.  Spray drying is a one step continuous process where a solution, slurry, sludge or paste is transformed from a fluid state to dried masses by spraying the feed into a hot drying medium.  The resulting dry products are granules or agglomerates and the drying medium bearing the removed moisture.  Using one of several methods the drying medium yields the recovered water.  The exact nature of the dried solid and recovered moisture depends on the physical and chemical properties of the feed and the design and operation of the drier.At the end of Phase II the technology will be at a TRL = 6.","Hypo and microgravity spray drying technology will largely close the water recycle loop for long interplanetary missions, and lunar and mars surface missions.

The proposed shoulder joint will allow historically fixed Hard Upper Torsos to be sized in-situ by crewmembers of varying anthropometries.  The Shoulders will also increase CM range of motion in a pressurized spacesuit and incorporate must mitigating strategies geared towards lunar exploration.  Throughout Phase One, Air-Lock will exhibit the following innovations: Design pressure sealed ESMJA that optimizes mobility and sizing characteristics of Hard Upper Torso Advanced Planetary Spacesuits. Utilize 3D CAD software to design, develop and integrate the ESMJA with the MK-III HUT. Perform a materials evaluation in order to determine the lightest, most robust material to be use in the manufacture of the ESMJA. Create a matrix highlighting sizing potential and added mobility (i.e., range of motion). Perform a comparative analysis of the sizing and mobility matrix to historic NASA anthropometry data to determine the optimum HUT sizes required to outfit current NASA astronaut corp.","Due to the highly specialized nature of the proposed design effort, extending the application of the Enhanced Shoulder Mobility Joint Assembly outside of pressure suits is unlikely.  More feasible applications can be realized through the improved manufacturing techniques developed during Phase II.  Reducing mass of historically metallic structures via composite, structural plastics or urethanes have been achieved in the past but proved to be very costly.  Air-Lock plans to develop manufacturing techniques that would allow the molding of complicated geometries to ""near net shape"" to realize cost reduction of lightweight, robust structures.","The recent increase in commercial space business ventures (Virgin Galactic, Commercial Orbital Transportation Services, (i.e., COTS), Bigelow Aerospace, etc.) would present excellent opportunities to implement the ESMJA with any suit design that requires enhanced mobility and/or suit sizing.

This is most readily achieved by reduction in space suit weight and volume, and increased hardware reliability, durability, and operating lifetime.  Considerable progress has been made with each successive generation of space suit design; from the Apollo A7L suit, to the current Shuttle Extravehicular Mobile Unit (EMU) suit, and the developmental I-Suit and Mark III suits.  However, one area of space suit design which has continued to lag is the fluid pump used to drive the water cooling loop of the Primary Life Support System (PLSS).  Conventional electric motor-driven fluid pumps are heavy, bulky, inefficient, and prone to wear.  A new pump type is needed.  Lynntech proposes to further reduce the size, weight and power consumption of its long-life, low-power,  compact, lightweight, efficient electrochemically-driven pumps, which will allow their use in the next generation space suit.","A rugged, long life, compact, light weight, efficient pump will have applications in the next generation of advanced Primary Life Support Systems (PLSS) for NASA's space suits.  By replacing the existing electric motor-driven pump in the water cooling loop of the PLSS with Lynntech's electrochemically-driven pump, the size, weight and reliability of the PLSS will be significantly improved.","With the increasing power density of electronics, there is a growing market for miniature, low-power pumps for use in the thermal management of consumer electronics.

Utilizing a novel material choice for both an expansion diaphragm and the PCM case itself, the PCM can accommodate both the expansion of the freezing water-based material and very low temperature of approximately -250F.  The water-based PCM itself would be non-toxic and non-flammable, but additives will be included to preclude deterioration of wither the PCM container or the diaphragm material.  The use of a water-based PCM gives the highest heat capacity for the mass.  This is highly limited due to the needs for portability as required for an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). The total heat capacity of an operational unit would be for full duration EVA use.   Through a logical progression of tasks including concept of operation formulation, requirements formulation, concept design reviews and detail design reviews that include design and thermal analysis using Thermal DesktopTM models, this effort can progress from TRL 2 to TRL 3. The team will confirm the robust choice of diaphragm materials, the choice of casing material and the choice of the additives to the water used for the PCM. The PCM will be tested to confirm heat input/temperature performance and cycling capability.  The test bed will allow for accurate heat input knowledge, temperature monitoring and cycling capability.  The results will be compared to the thermal model to ensure accurate prediction capability for the next phase full-scale unit. The design description and test results would form the basis of the final report.","The purpose of this SBIR is to address the need as identified within the NASA SBIR solicitation under X4.02 ""Space Suite Life Support Systems"" and, to wit, ""..a non-toxic, non-flammable, super cooled below 32oF phase change material that can absorb metabolic heat for an 8 hour duration.  Hence, the primary application will be for the purpose of providing this heat rejecton capability in a compact, reliable form for the utlizaton within a PLSS.  However, the application of this technology may go well beyond this to:1)   PCM utilization within the emerging Orion vehicle design.  2)   PCM utilization within the future Lunar Surface Access Module design3)  PCM ulitization within any lunar surface habitatEach of these potential NASA applications could be augmented, and perhaps greatly enhanced via the use of the high heat capacity and heat of fusion of water.  In the case of the lunar vehicles or habitats, the access to a thermal environment that is very low (Shakelton crater region on the moon) will allow for quick regeneration.","There are multiple industries within the commercial sector that could use a cooling system that is portable and robust.  In Paragon's experience, our Navy work has exposed us to the critical needs of Navy Seals for underwater cooling during vigorous littoral operations.  Other commercial sectors that may be interested in this technology would be the mining industry, the firefighting equipment industry, the commercial warm-water diving industry, and the chemical/biological hazard suit industry.

The basic principal is removal of metabolically-produced CO2 by an adsorbent with regeneration using a temperature swing. The lower temperature is achieved via expansion of liquid CO2 (LCO2). The higher temperature is achieved with metabolic heat from the moist ventilation loop gas through a condensing ice heat exchanger. The condensed water is saved and recycled at the habitat. Both the LCO2 exhaust and the metabolically-produced CO2 are rejected to the surrounding environment.  The effective temperature swing is between the CO2 sublimation temperature (~195 K) and the ventilation loop gas temperature (~300 K).  MTSA has reasonable mass, volume and power with minimal impact on infrastructure and operations. The basic principles of MTSA technology are well-proven, safe, do not rely on cryogenics, do not consume water but conserve it, are regenerable and will not compromise scientific investigations by sublimating water for heat rejection onto the premises. An added benefit of MTSA technology is that the LCO2 coolant can be produced and stored on the surface of Mars, saving launch costs and providing easy emergency access and replenishment.As Paragon has demonstrated adsorbent and LCO2 cooling performance relevant to MTSA operating conditions, Phase 1 will emphasize understanding the condensing ice heat exchanger design through analytical formulations and validation through testing.  Paragon's unique experience will ensure that this Phase 1 effort will be successful, resulting in a strong Phase 2 MTSA development plan to design, build and test in a relevant environment a full-scale MTSA subsystem prototype.","MTSA technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by a Martian PLSS.  These include rejecting metabolically-produced CO2 to a CO2 environment and thermal control without wasting resources and contaminating the Martian surface. MTSA has the potential added benefit in that it recycles water easily with no added mass or infrastructure back at the habitat.  Further, the coolant can be made from Martian resources, reducing the reliance on Earth launches.  The coolant can also be stored on the Martian surface without boil-off, readily accessible during an EVA to enable extended operations or provide extra cooling in emergencies. Another potential NASA application includes using MTSA on the moon.  Liquid oxygen (LOX) could be used as the coolant rather than LCO2.  Warmed LOX exhaust would provide the user with breathing gas rather than be expelled.  If LOX is available, this would be a means for using the moon to test Martian technologies.  Regardless of LOX availability, the LCO2 cooling capacity on the moon could be desirable, particularly in the event of an emergency where an astronaut will require significant heat rejection.","Non-NASA applications include a wide variety of portable life support systems for the Department of Defense and Home Land defense in chemical warfare agent shelters.  We also anticipate interest from the fire fighter community as LCO2 is a powerful means for safe thermal control that exhausts non-flammable, spent coolant.

Most of the sulfur released from lunar soil during higher-temperature thermal treatment is trapped by the LSCS at lower temperatures on iron oxides present in lunar soil. As needed, small amounts of polishing sorbents are used to reduce equilibrium sulfur concentrations to the low ppm level. After sorbents become saturated, sulfur compounds are desorbed and converted to useful sulfur products. Sulfur is present in concentrations of about 0.1 percent in lunar soils and can be recovered by the LSCS as a useful product from in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The LSCS can capture and recover sulfur from lunar soil as a primary product during thermal desorption of volatile compounds or during thermal reduction ISRU processes used for oxygen production. Removal of sulfur compounds is required during ISRU to prevent electrolyzer damage, catalyst poisoning, and equipment corrosion. The LSCS is applicable to thermal ISRU reduction processes in which sulfur is released in forms such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbonyl sulfide (COS), or carbon disulfide (CS2).","The primary initial application of the LSCS is for lunar sulfur capture and recovery. The LSCS has direct use to both protect ISRU hardware and catalysts while producing useful amounts of sulfur for other lunar ISRU applications. Implementation of the LSCS will proceed through the SBIR Phase 1, 2, and 3 programs, with increasing levels of development achieved through each step. During each phase, Pioneer will identify the LSCS requirements and will establish the commercial relationships needed to provide materials, fabrication, and implementation strategies for NASA lunar application.","One non-NASA commercial application of LSCS is the large-market target of integrated gasification combined cycle power generation from coal.

The individual cells of the MCTB contain a thermal storage media that is specifically designed for optimal performance at a given temperature range. Each of these cells is charged with thermal energy from hot regolith that has been used in a lunar ISRU application. Once the MCTB is charged, the heat is transferred from the battery to newly harvested regolith. In this manner over 85% of the heat can be transferred from the expended to the new regolith. This is a large improvement especially considering that this reduces the heating requirement to produce 1000 kg of O2 from lunar regolith from an average of 1 kW to only 0.15 kW (assuming 3% O2 recovery by weight).

Any chemical process that requires high temperatures and operates in batch mode would greatly benefit from using the MCTB to conserve energy. Batch furnaces for hardening and annealing metals, for example, require high temperatures and operate in batch mode. Using the MCTB in this application could greatly reduce the operational cost of such facilities. In such a process the expended product can be used to fill the thermal battery with heat and this heat can then be used to pre-heat the following batch.

The concept is based on established technology and offers a solid, low risk approach to the use of extraterrestrial resources.","The technology for the fabrication of habitat structures from locally available materials using a polymer binder can be extended to terrestrial use in environments where normal building means are not readily available and the delivery of standard components like cement, and of course water, is cost prohibitive.  This includes desert environments, mountainous regions, or the Antarctic.  Since the environment on earth is usually much less severe than the environment described in the project, the binder material could be optimized for performance instead of application.

As such, the development of innovative techniques for mitigating dust affects is warranted. In abrasive environments such as the presence of regolith dust on the moon, mechanism seals must be either designed for robustness to avoid premature damage and leakage, or, the dust particles must be removed. For this SBIR, Starsys proposes an enabling all-metal, knife-edge seal capable of maintaining seal integrity even in the presence of the abrasive, lunar dust. The proposed Knife Edge Seal concept provides for an innovative mechanism by which to seal critical ISRU mechanisms even in the presence of lunar dust contamination. Starsys' knife edge seal approach will utilize a hard metal knife edge and seal gland filled with an Indium alloy. The knife edge geometry is sized to allow for low forces required to penetrate the Indium, while the gland geometry is sized to properly and reliably capture the Indium. The Indium is a phase change material available in a variety of alloys to target specific melting points. The Knife Edge Seal offers two distinct advantages when attempting to mitigate the affects of lunar dust; 1) the knife edge will penetrate any dust layer developed on the seal gland surface and embed itself into the gland material, and 2) the Indium can be heated and re-flowed in between mate and de-mate cycles, allowing the dust particles to mix in with the soft Indium material and most likely eliminating sufficient barrier between the knife edge and Indium to allow for sufficient sealing to occur.","Potential NASA commercial applications include manned and unmanned lunar operations, operations on MARS, and other exploratory missions involving operations in abrasive environments.","Potential Non-NASA commercial applications include commercial space flight tourism, commercial space satellites and instrument/sensor cover systems, and terrestrial applications requiring operation of sealed mechanical systems in abrasive environments.",Airlocks/Environmental Interfaces; Fluid Storage and Handling; In-situ Resource Utilization; Portable Life Support; Suits

The use of inflatable structures for large-volume crew habitation on the lunar surface has proven to be an effective technology to maximize payload volumes and reduce overall launch costs.   NASA is currently seeking cutting edge material technologies that can simplify the construction of these habitats and provide for enhanced performance.  Aspen Aerogels proposes to develop novel hybrid aerogel materials that are able to simultaneously provide for thermal, micrometeoroid and radiation protection in one single layer.  Chemical modifications in the sol-gel preparation of aerogel materials are expected to afford hybrids materials that will combine the durability and thermal performance of a standard silica aerogel with the flexibility, resilience and radiation protection properties of a polymeric material.","The nanostructured, lightweight, flexible aerogel composites will improve thermal, radiation and MMOD impact shielding for inflatable habitat structures.  Multi-layer insulation (MLI) layers in habitats would be replaced with the developed technology.  EVA suits including gloves and footwear, and helmets could also potentially utilize the new insulation materials.  The flexible aerogels are air, water, and vacuum capable and thus could be incorporated into new single suit designs for a broad spectrum of astronaut mission.  The excellent durability and toughness of the flexible aerogel might facilitate use in cryogenic insulation in difficult vibration and acoustic environments.","Other potential applications include use as insulation in commercial and military aircraft, cryogenic tanks, liquefied gas transport, gloves, footwear, systems for warming, storing, and/or transporting food and medicine, sleeping bags and pads, military and recreational tents, etc.",Inflatable; Radiation Shielding Materials; Thermal Insulating Materials

An innovative technology, Double Bag Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (DBARTM), has been developed by Dr. Tan Hou at NASA Langley that deals with this obstacle.  The technology has only been developed for phenolic resins which is a lower temperature curing resin than is required for many high temperature composite component applications.This process has been shown to reduce the amount of volatiles trapped in the laminates.  The key is innovative volatile control during the DBARTM fabrication process.  The process results in low-void to void-free quality laminates and fulfils a critically needed technology gap that will enable insertion of an important class of high performance materials into commercial, military and aerospace market places at an accelerated pace. The primary technical objective of the proposed work is to show the feasibility of the use of the NASA DBARTM technology for high temperature polyimides composite manufacturing.

Long duration surface missions necessitate reliable autonomous operation, and manned missions impose the added requirement of fail-safe reactor protection systems. There is a need to define an advanced instrumentation and control system for space-nuclear reactors that addresses both aspects of autonomous operation and safety.  The constraints and conditions imposed on instrumentation for earth-based reactors are stringent enough to provide an excellent reference for a similar space-based system.  However, these systems are typically analog-digital hybrids, and are not optimized for mass, volume, or power consumption.  As a result, there is currently no earth-based reactor control system that is practical for use in space.  We propose to develop a comprehensive reactor instrumentation and control system based on proven technology used at nuclear research facilities, for operation in the space environment and in particular for nuclear surface power facilities.  The heritage established by these terrestrial 'reference' reactors through years of flawless operation on earth make them ideal candidates on which to base a compact, fully-digital space instrument for the control and protection of nuclear surface power systems.","NASA foresees numerous applications of nuclear power reactors, with anticipated power needs that might range from a few kilowatts to the megawatt level. Illustrative examples of these applications are: deep-space missions, orbiting power stations, weather stations, habitats, surface mobility for robotic & piloted rovers; excavating and mining equipment, and science payloads in general. All of these applications will require autonomous systems for control, safety and monitoring of the reactor. Space-qualified reactor instrumentation and control systems will be a useful COTS product for manufacturers of space-qualified nuclear reactors. The predicted total demand is subject to the development of space-based nuclear reactors but it is not unthinkable to forecast demand in the order of a dozen a year.","The key likely non-NASA customers for space-based reactors will be the DoD, as part of future space-based surveillance or missile defense systems.  At present, we are not aware of a planned system requiring nuclear power.  However, given the energy levels, mission durations, and reliability requirements to support the DoD's mission over the next two decades, it is likely that space-nuclear reactors will be needed at some point.With regards to ground-based applications, the concept of a fully-digital, compact, autonomous control system for reactors is very appealing.

A U.S. Patent application has been submitted and is pending approval.  The annular hybrid motor is an improvement to hybrid rocket motor technology that can be used for a wide range of applications.  The technology will lead to improvements in hybrid payload mass fraction, increased performance during throttling, and reduced costs associated with casting hybrid fuel grains.  The technology is highly scalable and can be used for applications ranging from small thrusters on satellites, to launch vehicle booster applications.","SpaceDev believes that the Annular Hybrid Motor has a wide range of possible applications to both government and commercial customers.  Efficiency gains realized by decreased O/F shift and increased fuel utilization benefit all applications using the Annular Hybrid Motor. Similarly, cost savings associated with simplified fuel grain design and thermal management are beneficial across the board Applications that are currently being explored for the annular hybrid motor include:Compact motors for satellite applicationsSounding RocketsUpper Stage MotorsFull Launch Vehicle","Given that space is at a premium in satellites  particularly in microsatellites and nanosatellites  the Annular Hybrid Motor's increased packing options would be of immediate benefit to satellite designers. Also, many satellite CONOPs call for multiple burns in their nominal missions as well as to be available for additional contingency burns. The improved restart ability of the Annular Hybrid Motor would be helpful in this regard for both satellite motors and upper stages.  Finally, the Annular Hybrid Motor has possible applications in the space tourism market.",Chemical; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Propellant Storage; Tankage

Building on Apollo heritage, the J-2X is a derivative of the J 2 engine.  One unique feature of the J-2X is its planned carbon/carbon (C/C) composite nozzle extension, which will replace the heavy metallic extension and increase engine performance.  Currently, NASA and PWR plan to employ a Noveltex or Naxeco C/C nozzle extension from a foreign supplier on the J-2X.  Plasma Processes Inc., with the support from ATK Launch Systems, proposes a program with the primary goal of demonstrating a domestically produced C/C composite nozzle extension for use on the J-2X.  The specific objectives include evaluation of higher strength C/C materials and manufacturing methods, investigation of oxygen protective coatings and design of nozzle extension subcomponent.  The team of Plasma Processes, Inc. and ATK Launch Systems offers a state of the art skill set that is uniquely suited to the Phase I program.",Leading edges and control surfaces for hypersonic aircraftPropulsion components for space access and space return vehiclesPropulsion components for Moon/Mars landing vehicles Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine (CECE),"Nosetips , rocket nozzles and control vanes for strategic and tactical missilesThermal control components for nuclear power applications.Crucibles","Ceramics; Chemical; Composites; Metallics; Micro Thrusters; Monopropellants; Nuclear (Adv Fission, Fusion, Anti-Matter, Exotic Nuclear); Solar"

With large numbers of leading edge and trailing edge flaps, distributed propulsion, thrust vectoring of multiple thrusters, and other aerodynamic control effectors such as active flow control devices, the growing variety of aerodynamic, aeroservoelastic, and propulsive controllers for new configurations, if integrated into the multidisciplinary design optimization of revolutionary flight vehicles from the start of the design, may lead to major improvements in aircraft performance and to new capabilities not possible with current designs. Simultaneously, advancements in computing power, mathematical modeling of aerospace systems, and in methods of large-scale optimization promise to make it practical to integrate the synthesis of distributed control systems into the multidisciplinary design optimization of aircraft from very early in the design, covering, in addition to optimal control, all other key disciplines. The proposed work will develop methods and create computational tools that would allow integration of automatic control based on large numbers of control effectors of different types into the multidisciplinary design optimization of aircraft. Key elements of the new contribution would focus on the control of aircraft based on large numbers of control effectors from both the control perspective (how to make such control synthesis “design oriented” and practical) and from the physics modeling perspective (how to base the optimization process on mathematical models of the coupled systems that capture, with high-fidelity, their physical behavior well). Design tradeoffs that the new computational capability would lead to will be based on reliable high-fidelity modeling and associated reduced order models in all disciplines, including aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, and control system hardware.","The proposed development will contribute to NASA multidisciplinary design optimization studies of a variety of aircraft configurations of current and future interest controlled by many control effectors, including variable camber continuous trailing edge wings, distributed propulsion, morphing supersonic configurations, etc. NASA will benefit from the new technology by either using the numerical capabilities developed or by integrating selected modules of the new capabilities into NASA’s multidisciplinary optimization environment.",The new technology will create numerical capabilities not yet available for multidisciplinary design of aircraft controlled by many control effectors.

Consequently, aircraft design processes, control design methodologies, and ground/flight-testing procedures need to appropriately trade between passive and actively-controlled structures. Furthermore, the influence of the flight control system on the optimal structural and aerodynamic design needs to be captured in the design process. To address these needs, Systems Technology Inc., in collaboration with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and D.K. Schmidt and Associates, propose to develop a novel control-oriented aircraft Multidisciplinary Analysis & Optimization (MDAO) process and software design tool. This will be achieved by implementing a flight dynamics-oriented model into the MDAO process that can readily provide information about the dynamic behavior (e.g., controllability and observability, bandwidths, modal impulse residues, etc.). This control-oriented information will be used to define performance criteria that will be optimized as part of the MDAO process, thereby resulting in an aircraft that is not only structurally and aerodynamically optimized, but also flight-control optimized. This approach will result in significant cost reduction by avoiding expensive subsequent modifications in both hardware and software to ensure safe, robust behavior.","The principal innovation of enhanced control-oriented MDAO is targeted to flexible aircraft platforms which are relevant to both aircraft currently operated by NASA as well as future aircraft embodying NASA research goals in Air Vehicle Technology, including “overcoming technology barriers and challenges in developing safe, new vehicles that will fly faster, cleaner, and quieter, and use fuel far more efficiently.” The program will be providing “Methods and tools for integrating flight control into aero-structural-propulsion design processes.”",The novel and unique control-oriented MDAO capability is oriented to future air vehicles that are more energy efficient and environmentally safer. Commercial airframers will benefit from this MDAO capability that does not currently exist. Nonconventional airframers will also benefit for the design of unique aircraft such as high-altitude long endurance (HALE) vehicles and air taxis.

Relative to conventional aircraft, these systems have closer coupling between sound generation and propagation, creating challenges for noise prediction but also opportunities for shielding. ATA Engineering, in collaboration with the University of California, Irvine, proposes to develop methods to efficiently characterize and ultimately predict aircraft noise associated with such propulsion airframe aeroacoustics (PAA). The methods will utilize near-field surface source models that are informed by high-spatial-resolution, fixed receiver and continuous-scan array acoustic measurements. In Phase I, the team will apply such measurements to canonical experiments and propulsion simulators (e.g, fan or jet exhaust noise) using fixed and scanning sensors to define stochastic source models. These models will support improved acoustic shielding predictions by directly detecting the mechanisms that propagate sound to the far field and using this information to define surface-based source models to predict noise shielding/scattering of integrated propulsion-airframe configurations using boundary element methods (BEM). Phase II will involve creating a database of surface-based engine source models based on both experiments and CFD to apply the models to an acoustic design and optimization trade study. Additionally, the team will pursue direct measurement of high-resolution source surface models for use in multi-fidelity noise prediction frameworks such as NASA’s ANOPP/ANOPP2. The expected outcome is a novel, efficient means to quantify community noise from integrated airframe-propulsion systems containing significant PAA. This capability will allow NASA and industry to perform acoustic design and optimization of configurations like HWB and QueSST.","The technology enables BEM prediction of far-field acoustics using surface-based sources, enhancing capabilities in two ARMD Strategic Thrusts: Innovations in Commercial Supersonic Aircraft (#2), where a critical theme is “jet and high speed fan/inlet acoustics with airframe interactions,” and Ultra Efficient Commercial Vehicles (#3), where “propulsion noise shielding” is needed for “revolutionary” vehicles. NASA laboratories and wind tunnels could use the tools for studying PAA.","Several commercial and defense applications will benefit from improved PAA prediction. Paramount is certification of commercial supersonic aircraft, which are expected to eventually reach fleets of to 350 business and 1700 civil aircraft. Continued improvement of noise performance for the rapidly growing fleet of subsonic commercial aircraft is also a potential application of the technology."

These improvements will allow for increased usage of phased-array flyover testing, and increased size/resolution arrays. Potential applications for the system include field-deployed noise flyover-measurement tests, and field-deployed engine-stand noise emissions tests.

The second-generation Software Toolkit will feature (i) enhanced predictive accuracy of the primary turbulent flame with real fuels (HyChem conventional/alternative fuels) and NOx by relaxing the dilute NOx assumption, (ii) computational efficiency, and (iii) software portability, e.g., to NASA’s OpenNCC.

Given the competing performance and emission targets to be considered, a large number of design parameters needs to be considered, including both geometric parameters as well as parameters associated with combustor operation, for instance use of alternative fuels as a means to reduce NOx emissions. The significance of the innovation is that it addresses NASA’s core needs for an economically feasible and environmentally acceptable propulsion technology suitable for a supersonic commercial aircraft.

Fifteen minutes of flight time is typical as the payload approaches the mass of the aircraft. Several companies have developed serial hybrid (gas-electric) multirotor aircraft in order to extend flight time.  This approach suffers from several drawbacks including low efficiency (~15%), poor flame-out redundancy, low power-to-weight ratio, and difficult payload integration due to the large on-board range extender. In response to these shortfalls we have developed a new type of multi-rotor which combines parallel and serial hybridization. The result is a much higher conversion efficiency compared to typical range extenders while retaining the ability to distribute propulsion. The system also has a much higher power-to-weight ratio as the powertrain mass is lower. Data from our proof-of-concept parallel hybrid indicate flight-time improvements of over 3X compared to serial hybrids, and 7X compared to all-electric. The unique characteristics of the parallel hybrid enable flight critical systems to be extremely reliable due to intrinsic redundancies.There are many government and commercial applications for parallel hybrid technology. These range from wild-land firefighting, unmanned logistics for military support, ship-to-shore, agriculture, and urban air mobility applications. As UTM evolves and BVLOS UAS missions become commonplace, the need for high efficiency, high payload, long duration platforms will drastically expand. The initial target market for our technology is wild-land firefighting, where critical logistics gaps currently exist.This proposal focuses on enhancing the reliability of our prototype aircraft by enabling seamless failover to electric propulsion and implementing a fuel injection system. These enhancements will prepare our technology for SBIR Phase II where we will optimize powertrain efficiency and bring our product to a beta test stage with our first customers.","Our technology matches well with the UTM project where loiter capability, long duration, and heavy payload mission profiles will be useful as UTM evolves. It is also a good fit for the Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP) which explores fuel efficiency and intrinsic safety, both of which are key to Parallel Hybrid Multi-rotors. Finally, the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP) is also a good fit as our parallel hybridization design will be transformative in terms of power-to-weight ratio, hybrid efficiency, and reliability.","Non-NASA applications include extended flight time and increased carrying capacity of UASs for direct fire suppression, fire suppression support, search and rescue, disaster relief, unmanned logistic for military applications, commercial transport of goods, agriculture, long range inspection, off-shore logistics/inspection, and improved capabilities applicable to UAM such as hybrid air-ambulances."

The proposed methods are in response to the need for new modeling, simulation, and control of aircraft dynamics and the need to support electrification in future aircraft. The proposed innovation consists of three intertwined contributions: (1) a novel energy-based framework for modeling electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) for future aircraft systems in terms of energy and power interaction dynamics; (2) a novel coordinated near-optimal nonlinear control design in energy space with provable performance; and (3) protection logic integrated with such control design. Our most relevant starting concept underlying this project is the idea that a generalized reactive power can be defined for multi-physical complex systems, and it is, therefore, applicable to assessing stability/efficiency trade-offs in candidate EAP systems across any vehicle.  The innovation is a step toward combining systems science and first principles in support of engineering and managing candidate transformative aircraft architectures. At present there is no analytics for such synergic approaches, and, as a result, it is not possible to enable systematic control design of energy generation, distribution, and consumption in aircraft systems.  While the idea of using energy methods is not new, related analytics and algorithms for modeling complex vehicles do not exist.  This project is the first of its kind to demonstrate the feasibility of managing candidate transformative aircraft configurations by means of dynamic management of energy exchanges across its components and subsystems. In this project, the novel energy-based modeling, control and protection design will be demonstrated on an actual Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft architecture.","This project defines a first-of-a-kind management framework for modeling and control of EAP aircraft architectures.

We plan to follow this initial effort with a Phase II effort to identify and prioritize the HeldenDesign development effort required for commercialization of the product in follow-on phases.  For example, one possible enhancement would be to develop a multi-point design capability within HeldenDesign capable of evaluating a design at multiple flight conditions.  This would give HeldenDesign the ability to ensure best performance is achieved over a range of flight conditions.  Future phases could also evaluate the incorporation of NASA’s PREDISC graphical pre/post processor design functionality into the HeldenTool graphical user interface (GUI) currently being developed under a NASA Phase III SBIR.","The successful completion of this Phase I effort supports all NASA programs and projects that use CFD for advanced aircraft concept design, launch vehicle design, and planetary entry vehicles.

A critical barrier to adoption of this technology is ensuring the safety of UAM passengers. This proposed effort seeks to utilize Origami-Inspired Mechanical Metamaterials (O-IMMs) to provide energy absorption, dissipation, and redirection capabilities for hard-landing and impact scenarios involving UAM vehicles. Our advanced materials approach to providing passenger safety focuses on enhancing the mechanical properties of conventional materials without chemical or molecular alterations. Instead, we embed repeating geometric patterns into a base material that augments and supersedes the base material’s original characteristics, leading to materials that are stronger, lighter, more failure-resistant, and multi-functional. This SBIR Phase I R/R&D study utilizes the (base material) + (geometric pattern) = (mechanical metamaterial) approach our team has pioneered over the last 8 years. Our effort will be focused on (1) translating NASA-defined goals into design criteria, and (2) using AI-enhanced software to develop the metamaterial’s geometric pattern. With regard to the first point, our approach directly considers NASA needs; in addition to safety, the design criteria also consider impacts on operational noise, UAM vehicle speed, mobility, payload, efficiency, and environmental costs. With regard to the second point, Multiscale Systems has several key advantages and IP assets – ranging from 15 years of combined experience, to proprietary design software – that increase the likelihood of our success. Our target deliverable for this SBIR Phase I effort is a set of schematics and simulation-based characterization data for an O-IMM-based material that protects UAM vehicles in a range of potential crash scenarios. This deliverable naturally transitions to SBIR Phase II effort focusing on prototype R/R&D.",We anticipate the greatest opportunities for O-IMMs in future NASA applications will arise from the ability to decrease weight while retaining mechanical function: -Crash-landing protection for UAV/drones/rover vehicles (ultra-lightweight protection from impact forces)-Physical protection during planetary exploration (Moon to Mars Campaign)-Deployable materials for protected habitable spaces on manned missions (Moon to Mars Campaign)-Lander systems technologies that absorb/dissipate/redirect energy,Our market research has indicated a variety of applications in the public/private sector: -Advanced materials for defense (USAF/Lockheed Martin/Boeing dual-use)-Body armor for US Soldier protection (US Army dual-use)-Protection of vertical lift devices in the commercial UAVs / drone market-Expandable shelters/buildings-Exterior protection and tactile sensing for soft robots

New materials are required with improved properties, combinations of properties and reliability.  While composite materials have become ubiquitous in aerospace structures over the past decade, they have the major limitation that they are prove to delamination through interlaminar cracking.

Currently, skin friction is measured at discrete locations using different sensors; however, determining the proper measurement locations a priori is a significant challenge. Measurement techniques that provide global distributions of skin friction, such as oil film interferometry, shear sensitive liquid crystals, and surface stress sensitive films, have demonstrated steady state skin friction distributions in specific settings. Unfortunately, deployment of these measurement techniques for use in large scale production wind tunnels has proven difficult. The issue of optimum skin friction sensor placement is even more complicated in regions where the flow is highly unsteady, and therefore, a system that can provide distributed measurements of unsteady skin friction is of significant interest. ISSI and WMU propose utilizing a new variational mathematical approach known as boundary enstrophy flux (BEF) that can be used to extract qualitative skin friction from distributions from Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) data. This approach will be combined with an unsteady PSP (uPSP) system, which has been demonstrated to operate effectively in production wind tunnels. The Phase I program will seek to validate the application of the BEF methodology to uPSP data using surface stress sensitive films data on a stalled airfoil. Efficient data processing approaches for analyzing the large volume of data acquired by uPSP systems using the BEF approach will be evaluated. By applying the BEF analysis to the uPSP data, it is possible to produce high spatial resolution distributions of both quantitative unsteady pressure and qualitative unsteady skin friction using a single system. This data can then be used to evaluate numerical models and select optimum positions for point sensors.","The SFW program has developed a model to assess the capabilities of various computational techniques, FAITH Hill. Fluctuating aerodynamic loads are a significant concern for the SLS program as unsteady aerodynamic pressures can excite the vehicle dynamic modes. Experimental measurements from the proposed sensor would provide each of these programs with unsteady pressure and flow separation/attachment data to validate computational models. Similar testing capability could be demonstrated in other NASA tunnels as part of a Phase II program.","The final product from this program should be a system capable of acquiring high spatial resolution distributions of both unsteady pressure and skin friction on a wind tunnel model.

There are different SiC-SiC CMC fabricating technologies, each of which has its advantages and disadvantages. Melt infiltration approach provides the greatest opportunities for commercialization/mass production, but it suffers with a drawback of residual free silicon, which invariably remains in the matrix, volatilize at high temperatures and form cracks.

AeroMancer’s technique for measuring 3-component spatially and temporally resolved airspeeds is based on the time-lag correlation of aerosol density fluctuations from a 3D map of lidar elastic backscatter signals. Other methods for standoff quantitative flow visualization of complex flow fields have limitations in outdoor testing. The strength of this approach and its advantage over other optical remote sensing techniques is the use of a single-ended system to simultaneously obtain 3D flow fields over a relatively large measurement volume (15m x 27° x 20°), with minimal setup time and to concurrently perform 3D hard-target mapping using an eye-safe optical system, thereby reducing size, complexity and alignment requirements. In a recent NASA SBIR Phase II project, AeroMancer developed a novel prototype scanning lidar for high-resolution 3D global airspeed mapping in wind tunnels, which captures 3D maps of seeding particle density in the airflow using elastic backscatter from an eye-safe, 1550 nm wavelength IR lidar beam that is rapidly scanned using a new interleaved scanning method. A 3D cross-correlation algorithm is used to extract 3D airflow profiles from pairs of 3D images. In this project, AeroMancer proposes to build on this existing design by identifying the measurement requirements for in-flight aerodynamic testing; system improvements to enable daytime operation; requirements for aircraft integration including size, weight power and cooling and eye-safety; and design changes to meet the needs of outdoor testing. Using recommendations from this analysis, AeroMancer will develop a conceptual design of the proposed instrument system.","A remote 3D velocimetry system for in-flight quantitative flow visualization can become an integral part of NASA flight test capabilities.

Lithium-based batteries are increasingly being used in many aerospace applications due to their superior energy and power density. Most of these systems have standardized electric power buses, but batteries are frequently custom made to provide high performance, which incurs in a high cost. On the other hand modularity and distributed control of energy storage systems promise many advantages over these centralized and custom systems, such as reduced cost, increased reliability and fault tolerance, increased supplier availability, improved thermal management, and the possibility to efficiently interconnect heterogeneous, but complimentary, batteries to deliver energy efficiently under dynamic load scenarios. Performance however is a factor that must improve to make modular distributed systems even more attractive. We propose a distributed and modular technology that will allow NASA to create batteries by interconnecting smaller Lithium-based battery pack modules in a flexible and efficient manner while gaining in energy extraction performance. The proposed technology accomplishes this efficiently and regardless of specific chemistry in a master-less distributed way while minimizing size, weight, and using lower power electronic components when compared to conventional approaches. The interconnected battery system combines unique distributed algorithms with a hardware design that utilizes every pack efficiently regardless of specific chemistry. This is accomplished by a joint estimation and prediction approach that considers present battery state and future load dynamics. The result is an energy storage system with longer life and with all the attractiveness of a distributed and modular system.","Our proposed system has relevance in several NASA applications, such as Cube satellites, electrical systems in aircrafts, rovers, landers, habitats, and future planetary science missions. As a single, but detailed example, report JPL D-101146 highlights several needs that must be addressed within NASA missions.  All point at the need for higher specific energy and operations under extreme temperatures, which can be better addressed through efficient modular and distributed systems.","Technologies as the one proposed are critical for renewable systems (solar, wind), and for transportation markets which are increasingly moving towards hybrid/electric vehicles.

Our innovation, Safety Assurance through Flight envelope Estimation in Real-time (SAFER), establishes trust through real-time estimation of safe and robust flight envelope boundaries and providing feedback and command limiting to keep the UAS within those boundaries. We propose to estimate these boundaries with an independent hardware module, requiring only effector commands as input, and enabling any UAS to meet verification, validation, and certification requirements.

We will use these hypergraphs to conduct information hedging, whereby we reconcile discrepancies between the internal models of different software modules, and decide to either tolerate or eliminate these discrepancies. By doing so, we avoid contradictory actions that can result from modules having different internal models of the other module's behavior.

In this proposed research effort, Mosaic ATM will address this underlying cause of the lack of trust on the part of the human specialist in ATM DSSs by developing the ability for ATM DSSs to explicitly identify backup plans associated with the primary recommended course of action. By providing an explicit backup plan, the ATM DSS will better align with the human’s approach to the operational situation and will be more transparent in its function. The human user will gain trust in the automation by seeing deeper into the DSS’s evaluation process, knowing that the automation has a backup plan at the ready in case its primary recommendation evolves into an unsatisfactory state. In this research, we will address the deep and fascinating algorithmic and human factors research topics to align ATM DSS information displays and even their ‘way of thinking’ with the human TFM specialist. Algorithmically, we will study how to define the backup plans and associate a plan B with a plan A. How do we compute the amount of time that is available for switching to the backup plan? From the human factors perspective, how do we convey the information to the TMC so that the recommendations are trusted and accepted?",,-The primary non-NASA commercialization avenue for the proposed concept is transition into operation and use by the FAA

The result is that key TBO systems, such as TBFM, are not functional and are turned off at times when unable to support the current NAS operating conditions.  To fulfill the promise of TBO, systems like TBFM need to be robust to the broad spectrum of NAS operating conditions. ATCorp’s TBO Operational Transition Automation (TOTA) provides automation to assist the human operator with the ability to safely and efficiently transition from one set of NAS operating conditions to another while maintaining a trajectory based operation.  For example, if weather impacts the nominal planned trajectory of a set of flights arriving at a busy NAS airport and the aircraft are required to be vectored around the weather, the current TBFM system does not support this maneuvering of flights and TBFM is no longer used to provide time-base metering. TOTA, however, provides automation to allow the controller to reflect the vectoring maneuvers around the weather in the TBFM system, allowing TBFM to support time based metering for this operational weather scenario.",TOTA provides NASA with the approach to providing a more robust solution and to enable TBO to support a broader spectrum of NAS operating conditions. This can be key to successful transitioning of TBO technology to the FAA and for supporting the transition to NextGen.,"TOTA would provide significant improvement to the overall performance and acceptance of TBO in real world applications, supporting TBO implementation with the FAA and other Air Naviagation Service providers (ANSPs) around the world."

ORCA aims to support airlines operating in a TBO environment in which they collaborate with the FAA to define objectives, share constraint information, develop plans, and share responsibility in the execution. In this vision, operators require the ability to predict with greater accuracy than today the operating conditions and constraints will develop over the next several hours. Improved predictive capability will enable airlines to build more efficient flight plans and prepare alternatives should operating conditions change. ORCA will provide airlines with the ability to better predict operational conditions at destination airports, allowing them to build better flight plans and manage their network operations to improve on-time performance, customer satisfaction, and assist the FAA in matching demand at choke points to available capacity. Our tool will also provide a model for airlines to make decisions under uncertainty, balancing the costs of different outcomes. For the FAA, ORCA offers a tool to integrate multiple factors into a probabilistic assessment of ever-changing conditions and their potential impact on flight safety and efficiency.","ORCA supports achievement of NASA milestones for Increasing Diverse Operations under the ATM-X project.

The future ATS will need to support an incredibly diverse set of vehicles operating from urban vertiports in addition to conventional airfields. Approach and landing systems were originally designed for tube and wing aircraft operating between large airfields with long, clear approach paths free from obstacles. Similar performance characteristics across the fleet enabled the creation and publication of standardized approach and landing trajectories. Future aircraft, especially those designed for high cruise efficiency, may not be capable of meeting standardized approach and landing performance criteria. Urban air mobility concepts typically require small vertiports without clear approach paths increasing the likelihood of encountering wind shear and turbulence during approach and landing. Low wing loaded and disc loaded vehicles, which include many future air vehicle concepts, are more susceptible to turbulence and face larger deviations from the desired trajectory in turbulent conditions. We propose researching, developing, and commercializing an innovative solution to these challenges called the Performance-based Approach and Landing System (PALS). PALS will use information about the air vehicle’s performance and estimates of current turbulence and wind shear levels to autonomously create safe performance-based trajectories for approach and landing. PALS will be able to estimate and control the aircraft’s future position along the generated trajectory to coordinate with air traffic control or directly with other aircraft. PALS is a key component in enabling a future air transportation system consisting of a diverse set of vehicles operating from urban vertiports and conventional airfields.",,

Furthermore, increasing numbers of flight deck applications and air/ground connectivity will make it easier than ever for airspace users to request trajectory amendments, but the FAA is not currently designed to handle that scale of exchanges. Mosaic ATM proposes a new approach to trajectory negotiation that leverages new data exchange architectures and increasingly autonomous capabilities. Our proposed approach supports trajectory negotiation that incorporates airspace user and FAA constraints and preferences, yet takes place outside the FAA’s ecosystem of legacy automated capabilities that are difficult to upgrade, allowing rapid deployment and scaling to achieve automated trajectory negotiation for an increasing number and variety of airspace users. In Phase I, we will document requirements for the automated Trajectory Negotiation Service, develop and evaluate the algorithms for automated negotiation, and develop an architecture for a cloud-based automated Trajectory Negotiation Service. This supports Phase II development of a prototype capability that can be integrated into NASA’s ATM-X Test Bed for technical and stakeholder evaluation.

To support this interest, NASA is conducting research to help formulate procedures and policies to ensure the safety of UAM and other air traffic. However, this process is complicated by the fact that UAM flights are expected to operate in dense urban areas, where there is a much higher probability of risk to life and property. High quality data are needed to help formulate effective policies and regulations. However, at present, there are no such data for UAM flights, due to the fact that these flights are not yet operational. Consequently, the next best alternative to flight test data is the use of simulation-based studies. This proposal aims to develop a trajectory generation tool for UAM flights (UAM-TG).

One of the most critical of these is access to microscale, hyperlocal weather estimates and predictions. Small UAS weigh less than 55 lbs have the risk of losing control in presence of light winds and gusts. The risk is amplified in urban areas due to presence of tall building and other man made objects. The phenomenon of urban canyon can cause high winds between building that are beyond the capabilities of current meso scale weather prediction models. High demand operations such as package delivery involves the UAS to take off from fulfilment center, travel to the destination and land where the customers are and takeoff for the return journey. Therefore, the ability to predict hyperlocal weather is a critical requirement for UAS in the NAS operations. The team propose to develop GUMP, a weather service that combines the coarse estimates of mesoscale prediction from NOAA weather products with high fidelity but localized ground station data using machine learning and computation fluid dynamics simulations. The innovative approach is scalable and transferrable to urban or rural areas. The computational workload is minimized by building on weather forecast publically available. GUMP fills a critical gap in weather prediction technology that will be beneficial for NASA researchers and industry UAS operators.","Researchers at NASA will find the tool useful for exploration of new concepts in small UAS operations. The service will allow them to identify times of day best suited for specific applications, e.g., package delivery operations should occur at times with very relatively calm weather while surveillance operations can take place in presence of mild winds as these operations do not involve landing. The operations can be designed as per local weather neighborhoods.","GUMP service would be most beneficial for commercial operators of sUAS. At present no such service exists. Companies like Amazon, Google and Uber are investing millions of dollars towards sUAS operations and this service would help them improve the reliability of their operations. General aviation pilots can also use the service then taking off from an un-towered airport."

During Phase I, the team will: (1) define a comprehensive set of safety requirements that must be addressed during path generation, (2) develop a proof-of-concept planning algorithm that meets the requirements, (3) assess the analytic guarantees of safety, and  (4) create an initial strategy for simulation-based validation that confirms the analytic guarantees provided by the planning algorithm and efficiently demonstrates that the safety requirements are met when analytic guarantees are not available. The resulting technology will begin to address how airspace operations can be scaled to an increasingly large number of aircraft with variable performance and control characteristics, including legacy users, while remaining robust to changing environmental conditions, congestion, and traffic avoidance.","The proposed research addresses two out of the six NASA ARMD strategic thrusts: Real-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance and Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation (AAAT). AAAT has outlined seventeen candidate mission products for R&D development. The proposed research supports half of these products and is especially relevant for Product #3: UAS Traffic Management and Operations and Product #14: Infrastructure for Experimentation, Evaluation, and Testing of Autonomous Systems.","The proposed research has a high-transition potential to other government agencies and commercial users. Among commercial users, the target market is the UTM and UAM vehicle designer who wants an off-the-shelf certifiable planning algorithm that can be easily customized to vehicle-specific performance parameters such as max climb rate, max turn rate, min/max airspeed, etc."

The approach can also be used to detect all aircraft and birds in the airspace above the TOLA. It also provides a means to offer precision helicopter guidance during landing zone brownout conditions. The architecture proposed uses multiple ultrawideband wide-beam radar systems positioned around the landing pad that cooperatively monitor the approach cone to detect and precisely determine the position of airborne targets in the approach cone above them. This information is transmitted to the landing or departing aircraft and can be used as an integrity check for GPS position data. The system works using the delta time of propagation method among multiple radar transceivers. Each of these ‘transceiver nodes' are situated in the periphery of the landing area. The ground nodes self synchronize and self locate, therefore the system can offer precise landing guidance even in GPS-denied environments. All information is modulated on the radar waveform, making the system independent of any other data communications, also providing graceful failure and robustness if one or more transceiver nodes fails. It will operate with aircraft that have no additional equipment installed, in which case the system can operate as a ground controlled approach controller for vertical operations to helicopters that are equipped with standard radios. It will also detect birds and non-cooperating targets in the airspace above it. Phase I consists of theoretical and simulation based analysis to determine the feasibility of the approach and the requirements for subsystems, with the goal of making system design choices that lead to development of a prototype that will be built and tested in Phase II.","Provide low cost, short range radar, capable of monitoring/relaying GPS performance, UAV path conformance, and vertical approach corridor non-cooperative target detection would provide manned, off-board controlled, and autonomous operations of Vertical Takeoff and Landing Sites (TOLAS).  Detecting large and small radar cross section targets allows for precision  monitoring and feedback to confirm accurate GPS, add guidance under all weather conditions, and ensure autonomous conformance with non-cooperating and co-operating target deconfliction.",Essentially this vertical ILS radar can be used for military Brown-out EFVS accuracy for vertical sites.

In addition to meeting existing requirements for aircraft operational control and safety, operators will need to maintain operational control over their aircraft at all times, eventually without a pilot-on-board to monitor flight systems and control the vehicle. Future aircraft will possess vastly different performance envelopes and often fly in different environments, at lower altitudes with even less predictable weather, and more diverse aircraft. Concepts to overcome these challenges will require extensive planning before receiving approval for operational use. Individual components of a UAM network have been active topics of research, but the community lacks the ability to evaluate how these components will work together. This requires a test environment that emulates operator monitoring and control systems, realistic traffic patterns and density, data on the operating environment to include urban geography and low altitude weather, and the flexibility to accommodate different vehicles. We propose the creation of an integrated Dispatch flight planning and monitoring tool, built off Robust Analytics’ past work creating flight monitoring dispatch tools. The City Air Mobility Evaluation Operations Suite (CAMEOS) would combine flight planning and operational control tools for this nascent industry as it begins to offer flights and increase fleet sizes, integrated in a Dispatch flight monitoring tool.","As a new, untested fusion of new aircraft, business models, and operating environment, UAM requires extensive end-to-end testing and demonstration before the FAA will allow operators to provide services. CAMEOS aims to provide an important development and test capability to NASA researchers and potential operators as they experiment with new concepts, vehicles, and traffic management technologies. CAMEOS can accelerate milestone achievement by delivering to NASA an integrated operational test environment.","In addition to assisting NASA UAM research, our concept can be used by potential operators to analyze vehicles, concepts, and business models before making large investments. Our test environment will help them to develop and validate operational control requirements and solutions, thereby enabling possible early deployment of UAM operations."

This injector features fully 3D-printed Liquid Oxygen (LOX)-centered swirl coaxial design with high-speed hydrogen flowing peripherally and impinging axially on central LOX conical spray.

Because of its potential to be easily tunable in response to combustion dynamics observed in operation, we expect to develop this injector for a stable operation at a rapid pace.

The CCV was designed to replace obsolete Royal/Hadley valves, which have been used at NASA’s Stennis Space Center (SSC) since the 1960’s as isolating valves in cryogenic fluid systems at SSC and have become costly to repair. The CCV is innovative because it is the only butterfly valve that it can adapt to dynamic changes due to changing temperatures.  Temperature changes cause materials to expand and contract.  For example, a 12” long aluminum rod chilling down in liquid hydrogen (LH2) from room temperature to -423 degrees F will shorten the rod length by approximately 1/16”.  This may seem like an insignificant change, but it can cause a significant leak if the critical dimension between the valve disc and seat change.  Ideally, cryogenic valves should be able to compensate for these dynamic temperature changes and maintain a tight seal, but the different valves that were procured to replace the existing Royal/Hadley butterfly valves have not been successful passing the rigorous SSC cryogenic tests and material requirements for LOX systems.  It is this inability of existing butterfly valves to reliably perform as needed which triggered the innovative design of the CCV. The CCV can seal better than other butterfly valves on the market because of the dual movement possible in the hybrid design.  To improve the sealing performance, the CCV combines the rotational movement of a butterfly with the translational movement of a globe valve.","The NASA SBIR Phase I Solicitation for 2019 identifies near-term operational cost reduction and improvements for ground test components by improving ground, launch and flight systems as areas of focus; this Proposal focuses on the development of an innovative cryogenic butterfly valve that will perform consistent and reliable at ambient and cryogenic temperatures. The CCV will eliminate the need for temperature specific testing (i.e., cryogenic environments) for components, while improving the performance reliability in the field.","Better cryogenic fluid flow control systems are anticipated for liquid hydrogen, liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas for the industrial gas, private space flight, electrical energy, chemical processing, and oil refining markets; these will be driven by market demand for more efficient, cleaner fuels, as well as more practical LNG transportation through the supply chain."

For the baseline design, the valve stem interfaces with a slip-fit shaft coupler integral with the end of the rotary bellows and the bellows is hermetically sealed to the valve body on the opposite end.

During the Phase II program, we will develop a fully functional framework for continuous crew health monitoring. We will update and improve all aspects of the sensor fusion algorithms, and incorporate several sensors for monitoring. We will also develop algorithms to differentiate between multiple crew members and monitor their separate and individual health states.","The developed sensor fusion based technology will provide great advantage in crew health monitoring in NASA human exploration missions, especially beyond low earth orbit. Whereas current technology requires crew time investment and needs crew-worn bio-sensors, the proposed technology allows remote monitoring of the crew without any input required from them. This technology supports and advances NASA's medical and crew health maintenance capabilities and the Commercial Crew Program.","The developed technology for continuous non-contact health monitoring is applicable in several application domains:monitor patients without encumbering them with wired sensors, or to monitor human workers in potentially stressful situations. It can be adapted for industrial and engineering inspection applications, to monitor and evaluate material characteristics using remote inspection methods."

Human metabolic solid waste (feces) contains 75% water by mass which is currently not recovered on the ISS and is instead transported back to earth. Return transportation of this waste results in significant cost and unneeded payload utilization. Water recovery and stabilization of solid waste is a critical technology gap for long duration human planetary exploration and future missions to the moon and Mars.  In this Phase I SBIR program, our team will complete a feasibility study to remove water from feces with a direct contact ultrasonic drying method that utilizes no heat. Our proposed technology can recover more than 80% of the water from human solid waste. Removing water through the use of ultrasonic drying can potentially reduce the operational cost of space travel and improve crew hygiene and comfort. Excess water in feces adds up to approximately 680 kgs (1,496 lbs.) of unnecessary waste for a 1,000-day mission by a crew of four. The direct contact ultrasonic drying technology was invented at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The ORNL team demonstrated five times higher drying energy efficiency for clothing (1/5th of the energy input) and two times faster drying rates compared to state-of-the-art residential clothes dryers. The technology also showed strong promise for removing water from liquids and semi-liquid materials, and therefore the application to NASA for feces drying is a strong potential application.  This feces drying application, however needs to be tested through a feasibility study. In September 2018, the lead inventor, Dr. Ayyoub Momen, along with a team of seasoned professionals, launched UltraTech and exclusively licensed the direct contact ultrasonic drying technology from ORNL for commercial and industrial fields of use.","Ultra-efficient direct contact drying (using no heat) can be extremely valuable to minimize human solid waste during long-duration space flight and sustained lunar surface operations.  The technology can significantly improve resource sustainability, water recycling, and crew health and hygiene related to metabolic waste (feces).  In support of the Moon to Mars campaign, direct contact ultrasonic drying has the potential to be a valuable technology for unique material drying needs ultimately aiding long-duration human space flight.","In addition to government applications, Ultrasonic Technology Solutions intends to further develop the technology for industrial and commercial use in a variety of manufacturing applications, for example, paper and pulp drying, biomass drying, chemical powder drying, pharmaceutical processing, and fabric drying."

It is vital that water be reclaimed from metabolic wastes since the cost of resupply becomes prohibitively expensive for long duration missions.  Therefore, practical means of recycling wastes are needed.  Feces contains between 65 and 85% water that can be reclaimed.  The remaining 15-35% solids is composed of mixed organic compounds that must be dried for bio stabilization.  Umpqua Research Company (UMPQUA) proposes an innovative Graded Temperature Fecal Dryer-Densifier (GTFD-D) for the safe and efficient reclamation of water from feces.  In particular, we propose to collect the fecal bolus in a flexible cylindrical silicone container.  The container is sealed with a magnetic lid.  The silicone container is then transported to the GTFD-D where the lid is automatically removed.  Pressure on the outside of the silicone cylinder forces the feces through a set of reciprocating perforated plates and then down through heated rectangular channels for drying and densification.  The channels are heated in a graded fashion to regulate the removal of water and densification of the feces in the channel.  Water is collected on a cooled porous surface. This process prevents the formation of particulates during the production of densified solid feces.  The silicone cylinder is then shifted to the cleaning station where water from the condenser is used to clean the surface of the silicone cylinder.  The dirty water is directed back to the drying channels.  The cylinder is then sterilized before reuse.  The GTFD-D will efficiently recover water from feces leaving a densified, bio inactive solid lowering the Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for life support supplies.","The NASA application of the GTFD-D technology will be in support of future long duration manned missions where the reduction of resupply logistics are highly valued. The primary application of this technology will be the recovery of water from feces and improved storage efficiency of the dried feces  The GTFD-D technology will be purchased as Flight Hardware by NASA, or by an aerospace contracting firm on behalf of NASA, resulting in enhanced capability in support of manned missions beyond LEO.","GTFD-D commercial applications apply to geological regions where traditional waste treatment is impractical, such as polar regions.  where discarded human waste will not decompose and presents a biological hazard. One method of destroying human waste is incineration using flammable liquids.  A more efficient process of drying the feces followed by incineration will be more energy efficient."

Missions to the International Space Station (ISS) rely on resupply missions for replenishing resources, and waste is disposed by either burnup during Earth entry (i.e. Cygnus) or in recovery of reentry vehicles (i.e. Dragon).  Future long duration missions will need a solution for reducing trash volume and processing the resulting atmospheric contaminates.  For such waste systems, there currently is no reliable method for measuring mass flow rates for the effluent gases.  Flow sensing techniques for waste require a robust device able to provide accurate mass flow measurements despite the variable and corrosive gas stream that includes a high content of water vapor and hydrocarbons.  Typical mass flow measurement devices for gases do not operate well in a dirty gaseous stream, which include thermal and Coriolis types.  Thermal elements in the gas stream will eventually collect deposits on surfaces and become non-responsive.  Coriolis flowmeters can be relatively large, and they have a limited turndown range for gases.  Space Lab Technologies LLC with the consulting efforts of Professor James Nabity at the University of Colorado Boulder proposes SHUR Flow™, a robust mass flowmeter for space habitat waste processing systems.  SHUR Flow™ uses a smart hybrid ultrasonic technology in a relatively small formfactor.  The instrument provides robust measurement of dirty flows with negligible pressure drop, corrosion resistance, and tolerance to the buildup of deposits in the inner tube waste processor.  SHUR Flow™ also features high resolution radiation tolerant electronics. In Phase I, Space Lab will determine feasibility of the proposed instrument through conceptual design and analysis, risk and reliability assessment, and prototype testing.","SHUR Flow™ will be valuable in several NASA human exploration programs, including ISS operations, Lunar Gateway missions, and future surface missions, by providing a means to reliably and accurately measure effluent gases from waste process streams, with negligible pressure drop, corrosion resistance, and tolerance to the build-up of in-line deposits.","SHUR Flow™ provides a valuable improvement in flow measurement technology for dirty process gas flows, specifically by providing reliable flow measurement of dirty gas streams with relatively low flow rates and/or small pipe diameters, in a compact instrument.

In Phase I, Nanohmics will target N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) which is common to peptidoglycan in all bacterial cell walls and chitin in all fungal cell walls as well as the KDO antigen which is common to the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of all Gram negative bacteria.  High affinity DNA aptamer sequences for each of these targets already exist to facilitate the 3D modeling.  Nanohmics will determine where to place the fluorophores and quenchers within the Förster distance to best quench fluorescence and lead to a strong “lights on” fluorescence response when targets enter the aptamer binding pockets. These optimized models will then be tested empirically at Texas State University and should enhance sensitivity of the beacon assays. Ultimately in Phase II, Nanohmics will lyophilize the aptamer beacon assays for long shelf life and integrate them into a customized handheld and/or compact fluorometer for use in spacecraft cabins to detect microbial contamination on surfaces via a manual and robotic wetted swab test.

The specific, accurate mass of ions formed in the ionization source and measured in the mass analyzer gives a mechanism for identification of the analyte. Characteristic fragmentation of the molecular species provides additional information that enhances specificity. Thus, mass spectrometry is considered one of the gold standards for identifying chemical compounds. In recent decades, the applicability of mass spectrometry has been extended to the study of large biological molecules. The advent of advanced biological mass spectrometry techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) has resulted in the ability to detect and identify large biological molecules, characteristic of many key bacterial metabolites and microorganisms such as virus, bacteria and fungi. Our team has a long history of the use of the MALDI technique coupled to miniaturized time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers to create biological identifiers that move mass spectrometry out of the lab and into the field. This effort will augment existing capability to automatically collect, process, detect and identify a wide range of biological contaminants in air, water and on surfaces. For this application, Zeteo proposes to develop the Zeteo Space Environment Microbial Monitoring System (zSEMMS) a radical redesign of existing zTADS system to meet size, weight and power (SWAP) requirements for NASA applications.  In addition to directly monitoring airborne microorganisms in the spacecraft, zSEMMS will incorporate an ability to collect and analyze water and surface samples. Because MALDI Mass Spectrometry signatures derive directly from the genome of the organism or toxin producing organism, it has outstanding specificity and sensitivity for both microorganisms and toxins.","Primary zSEMMS application include continuous, rapid monitoring of occupied crew spaces and testing prior to occupation. The system can either be permanently installed on a spacecraft or deployed when need and removed. The sensitive nature of the instrument could also facilitate use in detecting contamination in clean rooms, laboratories or other NASA facilities in which biological contamination could put a mission at risk.","Zeteo Tech is commercializing zTADS to address critical unmet Biodefense requirements and the capabilities developed in this effort will extend zTADS to additional sample matrices.

Potable water is a fundamental requirement for crew consumption, specific hardware applications and more recently for plant growth in space. It is imperative to the success of space mission that potable water be protected from microbial proliferation, especially in the case of stored water for extended periods of time. Iodine and ionic silver are used in potable water on the International space station (ISS) and on space shuttle missions. These chemicals are able to prevent microbial growth but should be used in low concentrations to avoid human toxicity. Therefore, alternative non-toxic biocides are needed for spacecraft potable water systems.

During the proposed project, a resin will be developed for the slow-release of chlorine or bromine.  This resin will be used in a simple flow-through cartridge that will act as both a contact kill biocide device and as a source of free chlorine or bromine.  A halogen residual of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L will be delivered to the water.  Chlorine and bromine have a long history of use within this range for land-based and marine potable water treatments, respectively.  As a result of their widespread use, much data is available concerning their long term health effects, antimicrobial efficacy and materials compatibility.  This concentration range is generally accepted as being safe and therefore removal is not required prior to crew consumption.  The residual concentration will remain within this range over a wide range of flows.  This Halogen Binding Resin (HBR) will be entirely analogous to the original MCV resin but will release chlorine or bromine instead of iodine.  The next generation Microbial Check Valve (MCV2) made with this resin can be used as a direct replacement for the currently used MCV.  The resin will be developed by modifying the structure of existing halogen binding materials.  Currently, existing materials that bind chlorine and bromine provide good contact kill antimicrobial properties but fall short of meeting NASA’s biocide residual needs.  Either the halogen is held too tight, resulting in an insufficient water residual, or the halogen is not held tight enough, resulting in an excessively high residual that requires dilution.  The proposed research will result in a resin with a high chlorine or bromine loading capacity and slow-release kinetics suitable for disinfecting NASA process water.","The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future manned missions.  The production and storage of safe potable water is a requirement for all manned operations in space.

NASA has identified technology gaps in current xPLSS due to the amine swing-bed system not being design for the partial atmosphere of Mars. To solve this, NASA is requesting the development of a robust “Boost Compressor” which can pull vacuums down to 0.1 torr and outlet pressure tolerance over 15.2 PSIA to simplify system complexity. Common pressure swing adsorption (PSA) solutions include dynamic blowers utilizing high impeller speeds to create a differential pressure. Operating up to 100,000 RPM makes them compact and lightweight but the impeller design causes the flow rate to depend on the differential pressure. When pressure is increased, flow diminishes. Here, the blower would be limited to discharge pressures below 5 PSIA, rendering it insufficient to achieve NASA goals. Another option is positive displacement compressors that handle larger pressure differentials, exhibit minimal flow reduction with an increased pressure differential, and handling larger turndown ratios. These are preferable when a wide range of operating conditions, varying pressures and speeds, and higher reliability are required. Their ability to handle inconsistent conditions ideally suits these for PSA applications. The downside is that they are speed limited by bearing loading, making them less ideal for space applications. Air Squared is proposing the development of a Spinning Scroll Boost Compressor (SSBC) that merges the strength of both technologies by capturing high-pressure differential without sacrificing high-speed performance. The innovative spinning motion of the scrolls eliminates various centrifugal loads, allowing it to operate at speeds >8,000 RPM, reducing size and weight. This removes the need for a counterbalance, reducing bulk by eliminating counterweights and easing bearing loads.","The SSBC will define next-generation PSA for xPLSS xEMU in Mars and Deep Space exploration. Capable of operating over several different partial atmospheric environments in a compact footprint, the SSBC will provide flexible xPLSS design adaptable to varied NASA missions and provide a foundation for both Lunar Gateway habitation and human exploration of Mars. These innovations will accelerate the SSBC’s adaptability for both the ORION Spacecraft and Human Exploration Research Opportunity (HERO).","Given the improved pressure and flow rate, adaptability as a compressor, vacuum pump, and expander, and reduced complexity of spinning scrolls, several positive displacement solutions would benefit from the development of the SSBC. Qualified spinning scroll machines would upgrade the performance of aerospace environmental control systems, vacuum mass spectrometry, and waste heat recovery."

The crew dons a snug fitting Inner Boot, and slides it through the xPGS Leg Assembly toward the attached Outer Boot. Two spring loaded pins integrated into the Inner Boot Sole Plate (IBSP), inboard of the crew’s toes, mate with receiving bushings on the Outer Boot Sole Plate (OBSP). The crew presses down, compressing the OBSP heal plate until an Outer Boot spring-loaded latch firmly captures the Inner Boot. The binding system prohibits the crew’s foot from slipping but does not prohibit the toes or ankles from flexing at all. The joined sole plates act as a spring system balancing an appropriate torsional stiffness needed translate rugged terrain with bending flex needed to walk and kneel easily. The toe pins and heal plate allow the Inner Boot to be fully captured while allowing the plates limited independence from each other. This aids in the sole plates spring system performance and enables different sections to expand and contract to different temperatures and coefficients of thermal expansion without restriction. The design includes limited thermal conductive contact between the crew and the surface. Due to their minimal contact area they act to prohibit heat flow to and from the crew, greatly mitigating risks to the crew caused by the extreme temperature range of the planetary surface. To doff the outer boot, the crew pulls a cord to disengage the heal catch and frees the Inner Boot from the Outer Boot. The crew then slides their foot back out through the leg assembly. Any hardware associated with the binding system on the Inner Boot is very low profile and has all edges softened to prohibit any snagging during don/doff activities. This system is also very customizable for crews of different sizes and spring system stiffness preference.","The Lunar exploration market includes the U.S., E.U. countries, Russia and China and further extended by six different companies involved in NextSTEP Gateway Habitat and exploration advances by SpaceX. The integrated binding system could be marketed to these entities, enhancing suited crew exploration and an opportunity to use a derivation of this design to enhance life within the space ships and habitats. The crew uses Toe Bars to offsetting microgravity challenges, which has resulted in foot injury. This system could mitigate this crew risk.","Using the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at JSC to emulate experience in a microgravity environment, a crew member in a Space Suit is very similar to a diver within a diving suit. Deep sea divers often translate across cold, rugged surfaces for considerable periods. This system offers recreational, commercial and military divers the same no-slip translation with their feet being thermally isolated."

Our astronaut subject matter expert has over 240 days of spaceflight time over three missions on the ISS as Flight Engineer and Mission Commander.","Virtual assistants could be used spacecraft-wide, or each astronaut onboard could have a personalized assistant for his/her role. As we establish remote bases (Moon or Mars), AVA could similarly serve as assistants for the entire base or for each astronaut. Ground operations supporting those missions could also benefit from similar systems. Similar virtual assistants could support NASA researchers doing data analysis and experiment design. AVA could help astronauts on the ground in training and refreshing on specific systems or procedures.","Defense applications include helping to operate the Navy’s AEGIS weapon system, or helping in complex ISR tasks across the services. Civilian uses include virtual assistants in power and manufacturing plants to help manage, monitor, and analyze operations. Medical teams need tools that can be used to query data (e.g., medical records), to support diagnosis and for treatment assessment."

A key component of these autonomous agents will be the usage of one or more sequence engines which will be capable of performing various automated scripted sequences for a variety of tasks. Autonomous sequence engines are currently being used on the International Space Station (ISS) through the use of high-level sequence engines, which allow the astronauts to control autonomous tasks more easily through readable commands. These sequence engines are essential for autonomous systems as they are capable of performing many of the routine and repetitive tasks that are currently completed by crew members. There are currently three candidate sequence engines that could be used for deep space autonomous operations. This proposal seeks to perform a detailed analysis and evaluation of the capabilities of three existing autonomous software sequence engines that are currently being utilized in the space industry: Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL), Virtual Machine Language (VML) 3.0, and Timeliner. This evaluation will focus on the responsiveness, performance, and usefulness of these sequence engines in a variety of scenarios including the frequent, repetitive tasks typically conducted by astronauts. Additionally, this study will evaluate the ease of use and functionality of the sequence engines for the Fault Detection, Identification, and Recovery (FDIR) of potential failure modes onboard spacecraft or more permanent space habitats.","As a result of this study, NASA will be able to more easily determine the most effective of these three sequence engines and how and when they could be used for various space missions and scenarios, ranging from low earth orbit to Lunar and Mars missions, and even further out into the solar system, and beyond. The efficiency and safety of these missions can be greatly enhanced through the use of autonomous systems utilizing a reactive sequence engine.","Potential non-NASA applications of the proposed system include: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, and Tele-robotics. Potential non-government applications include: control systems in the sub-sea oil and gas industry, including Blow Out Preventers and Remotely Operated Vehicles, as well as robotic manufacturing for automobile assembly lines."

However, most of these agents are only capable of a single task and incapable of generalizing or performing minimally intelligent in other tasks. For instance, agents that won a world championship against a human cannot drive a car, and agents that can play games aren’t capable of carrying out a conversation. The future of our species lies with exploration outside of our mother planet, and such interplanetary explorations will require intelligent systems that can interact and lower the workload of the crew. Herein, we propose Sigma (Σ) (Rosenbloom, Demski, & Ustun, 2016), a cognitive architecture and intelligent system that strives to combine what has been learned from four decades of independent work on symbolic cognitive architectures and probabilistic graphical models via its graphical architecture hypothesis. Sigma’s development is driven by a combination of four desiderata: grand unification, generic cognition, functional elegance, and sufficient efficiency. In particular, Sigma leverages factor graphs towards a uniform grand unification of not only traditional cognitive capabilities but also critical non-cognitive aspects, creating unique opportunities for the construction of new kinds of cognitive models that possess a Theory of Mind and are perceptual, autonomous, interactive, affective, and adaptive. Sigma’s graphical architecture has recently been extended to handle neural networks. Sigma has quite general parameter learning capabilities, in that probabilistic, neural, and reinforcement learning capabilities all emerge from a local gradient-descent-based learning mechanism operating at the code of the architecture. The aspiration for uniform grand unification, plus this unique blend of capabilities, make Sigma a well-equipped candidate to tackle the challenge of intelligent agents for deep space exploration.","In recent years, many of the satellites control systems have started to make real-time decisions without awaiting instruction. This trend of autonomy across NASA can further be accelerated with Sigma, where many of the already developed or in-development AI modules can be integrated with Sigma and be potentially used in a variety of complex systems that NASA uses including the International Space Station as well as future spacecrafts.","A recent report on the perspective of DoD on the future of AI focuses on The Deep Learning Revolution, that includes 4 Areas of Rapid Progress besides Deep Learning: reinforcement learning, graphical models, generative models and probabilistic programming languages, and hybrid architectures. Sigma is the only cognitive architecture that combines all five of these capabilities, plus deep learning."

Fault Management (FM) is an operational subset of SE, and an engineering activity focused on the detection, isolation, diagnosis and response/recovery in the event of faults and anomalies during system operations. It is imperative that while a system is being engineered during its design, adequate FM measures are incorporated in its design so that “fault protection” is an integral part and not an “afterthought” in the project life-cycle. Given the structural and functional complexities of modern space systems, such as those of NASA’s missions for lunar exploration such as the Gateway and other human exploration missions in development, SE processes need to have extensive FM support and analytic capabilities right at the onset of system design, to capture their operational relevance during missions. The key focus of the Systems Engineering Handbook is System Level Analysis across the entire Life Cycle performed within Cost and Schedule constraints. Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) proposes a TEAMS-FM (Fault Management) “plugin” capability with the SysML modeling environment, called “TEAMS-FM”, that (1) provides a capability to perform FM analysis of a system design in SysML, (2) enables the FM design to be evaluated in an operational context by performing System Health Management (SHM), (3) supports Trade Studies to evaluate the merits of a architecture such as Sensor Placement, Fault Protection, etc. and (4) enables a “System” level assessment and visualization of FM qualities in the SysML Diagrams. Through this effort, TEAMS-FM brings powerful FM capabilities of TEAMS® toolset within the familiar environment of SysML without disrupting the workflow of engineering teams that conduct MBSE.","The proposed technology will facilitate effective MBSE and allow NASA to better plan and execute future Space Missions. It can also operate as part of NASA’s next generation cis-lunar infrastructure, including the Gateway, and deep space human exploration such as the Habitat, allowing NASA to utilize the SE, FM and mission satisfiability information for improved mission execution, safety and success. The Gateway has simulation and vehicle models, relevant to this MBSE effort. Europa is also strong candidate for demonstrating the capabilities.","DoD, USAF, US Navy, Commercial Aviation (SpaceX), NORAD, Space Command ground segments, JSF fleet, Navy platforms, Submarine Commands and BMD systems, UAVs, UMGs and unmanned submersible vehicle markets, manufacturers of DoD and Military’s remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems, OEM customers of semiconductor manufacturing and medical diagnostic equipment, are potential applications."

These organizations, their suppliers and partners create proprietary models of their components and assemblies, often in SysML. Requirements and verification methods referenced in these models often come from NASA, Military, Industry and National Standards and Specifications. DoD, some of the largest Aerospace & Defense OEMs and Standards Development Organizations are using or exploring SWISS to model their part, material and process specifications and standards. SWISS uses an ontology-based linked data model to describe the syntax and semantics of these documents and to enable creation of smart connected models using this information. Linked data, based on Semantic Web standards, and ontological knowledge representation, are known as the best practices for relating concepts from multiple sources, querying that knowledge and ensuring its consistency. While SWISS does not address structure, behavior, and parametrics of a system, it has automated tools to transform legacy specification and standards into linked digital models. We believe, that SysML and SWISS standards are complimentary and propose to develop prototype integration through linking or transformation between SysML and SWISS models. In Phase II, if successful, we will develop a prototype tool for such transformation, extend the SWISS API to query such models, and implement plugins to selected SysML/SWISS tools for analysis of models across distributed data sources.","Vendors in the NASA Community are following MBE initiatives. Their focus is shifting from Geometry, Dimensions and Tolerances, largely addressed in previous years, to non-geometric requirements, that are pervasive, especially in avionics. SWISS and SysML are complimentary and aim to address that niche. We anticipate significant use of the tools and PLM plugins, developed as a result of Phase II, to analyze vendor designs, and to rapidly and precisely evaluate the impact of changes on downstream lifecycle processes.","Aerospace & Defense OEMs and their next tier suppliers are serving larger DoD and Commercial needs; we see these organizations using the proposed integrated platform in a way similar to NASA vendors, especially since there is a significant intersection between these communities."

Model authors can publish models and data, in any format or database, as web-based microservices that can be dynamically composed and orchestrated to realize different engineering workflows for a given project or mission.  Model authors can configure the subset of model information, level of access control, and update frequency, e.g. publish only major revisions and not each iteration, when models are published as microservices. Once published, these microservices are accessible to all stakeholders via standard REST/HTTP APIs using open standards-based concepts. Although each model/dataset is based on authoring tool-specific schema, the microservices published from those models are based on an extensible set of concepts in open standards, such as SysML 2.0, STEP (ISO 10303), and OSLC specifications. Engineering workflows can be configured by parametrically linking the endpoints (inputs/outputs) of the microservices using standard notation, such as SysML activity/parametric models, or BPMN process models. Once configured, the workflows can be executed automatically on a scheduled basis to run verification and validation campaigns and generate nightly builds of the system, such as technical data packages and corresponding reports. The breadth of models includes, but is not limited to, systems engineering (e.g. SysML and UAF/UPDM), requirements (e.g. spreadsheets, ReqIF, DOORS, Jama), mechanical and electrical design (MCAD/ECAD, e.g. NX and Creo), engineering and manufacturing bills-of-materials (PLM eBOM/mBOM, e.g. in Windchill and Teamcenter), software modules (e.g. in Git repositories), project management (e.g. JIRA and MS Project), simulation (e.g. Simulink, Modelica, FEA/CFD models), models originating from home-grown tools, and data in common formats (e.g. CSV, Excel, XML, JSON, RDF).","Technology developed in this project is applicable to all current and future NASA missions, both human exploration and robotic, that are actively deploying or investigating model-based systems engineering capabilities in a distributed and collaborative environment.

When parameter limits are exceeded or watchdog timers are not reset, spacecraft automatically enter a “safe” mode where primary functionality is reduced or stopped completely. During safe mode the primary mission is put on hold while teams on the ground examine dozens to hundreds of parameters and compare them to archived historical data and the spacecraft design to determine the root cause and what corrective action to take. This is a difficult and time consuming task. As human travel away from Earth, light travel time delays increase, increasing the time it takes for ground crews to respond to a safe event. A few astronauts will have a hard time replacing the brain power and experience of a team of experts on the ground. Therefore, a new approach is needed that augments existing capabilities to help the astronauts in key decision moments. This proposal will develop a fault protection monitor that will better understand current faults to help diagnostic efforts, with the ultimate goal of presenting suggested corrective action and relevant collated information to onboard astronauts or predicting upcoming faults and deciding on corrective action. This monitor enables a new kind of awareness within the spacecraft. This awareness is trained on past faults so that the sum total of understanding of the spacecraft’s test and development program is kept on board. This knowledge is stored in a low power neuromorphic chip whose architecture is modelled on the neural pathways of a neocortex to enable advanced pattern recognition and comparison to known patterns with minimal power consumption. Phase I will demonstrate the simplest use of this fault monitor system, which will be to train a Spiked Neural Network (architected so it can work on currently available neuromorphic chips) to detect and report faults, learning from the environment and improving operations.","This Neuromorphic Fault Monitor would be of use to all future spacecraft, human spaceflight and robotic.

One of the key neural algorithms that would be highly useful is reinforcement learning for cognitive communications in software-defined radios. In reinforcement learning a policy function is used for determining action and needs to be updated based on environmental inputs. This function can become extremely complex and is often approximated using deep learning networks, thus leading to deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The updating of these deep networks themselves can be highly energy consuming. At present there are no low SWaP, high throughput deep reinforcement learning processors available commercially. Thus the objective of this work is to develop highly efficient neuromorphic processors for deep reinforcement learning, particularly for cognitive communications.

In parallel, however, the use of human tissue analogs is becoming increasing valuable in drug discovery.  The tissue chip and micro-organ fields are growing at compound annual growth rate exceeding 34%.  These technologies and products are collectively known as organs-on-chips (OOCs). OOCs are microfluidic 3D cell culture devices that closely mimic the key physiological functions of body organs. The chips are not designed to mimic an entire organ but simulate the physiology of a single functional unit of an organ system. They have resulted from scientific advances in cell biology, microfabrication and microfluidics which allow the emulation of the human micro environment in vitro. This unique feature of OOCs is made possible by integrating biology with advanced engineering technologies such as bioprinting. Human OOCs are miniaturized versions of lungs, livers, kidneys, heart, brain, intestines and other vital human organs embedded in a chip. The OOC and bioprinting fields are intrinsically linked and many groups, including Techshot researchers, are looking to leverage bioprinting OOCs to circumvent fundamental structural challenges faced in the race to bioprint large-scale organs for research and discovery.

SOARS directly supports Moon to Mars Campaign (NASA’s Space Policy Directive-1). The key innovation of SOARS enables the separation of liquid and gas in microgravity through our unique rotational settling technology and leads to transfer of only the desired liquid propellant with minimal pressure difference without expensive pumps and thereby providing a cost-effective solution. ZGHT the first and the only company who pioneered this unique SOARS technology to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 through the Facilitated Access to the Space Environment for Technology (FAST) program flight testing using NASA’s Reduced Gravity Aircraft (30 seconds microgravity). Through this NASA SBIR grant, suborbital flight test onboard Virgin Galactic’s SpaceshipTwo (four minutes microgravity) and orbital flight test onboard the International Space Station (ISS) will mature the technology to TRL 7. Exposure to long-duration microgravity environment using ISS facility is a key factor in demonstrating this technology for various operational test scenarios using the Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) testbed onboard ISS. The collaboration with Made In Space (MIS) will enable utilization of the Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) to fabricate the experiment hardware in ISS. Ultimately ZGHT is committed to establish itself as a key player in the area of propellant storage and transfer in space. Phase I of this SBIR will involve planning and preparation for suborbital Virgin Galactic vehicle and orbital ISS testing. Phase II will involve the fabrication and flight experimentation. Phase III involves the identification and collaboration with commercial partners and to utilize Archinaut program of MIS to directly fabricate and test the prototype in Low Earth Orbit.","SOARS will enable the commercialization of on-orbit propellant depots, which will greatly improve the capability of current and future NASA launch systems. SOARS can be an alternative option to expensive Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles through the refueling of Small to Medium Lift Launch Vehicles once on-orbit to extend their range and mission capabilities. SOARS will facilitate Moon to Mars Campaign Missions by providing a base for exploration and enhance the human missions in cislunar space. SOARS can effectively support NASA’s Restore-L mission.","SOARS will be an on-orbit fuel station to meet the demands of commercial space exploration sector. SOARS can support the expanding range and endurance requirements of commercial space missions such as space tourism, transportation, research, mining, habitation, and national security missions.

The heat pipe proposed for this effort will undergo several environmental tests to qualify its use for flight and a microgravity test. Roccor has been working closely with NASA’s TechEdSat group to identify a possible flight opportunity on the TechEdSat 10 mission, a 3U CubeSat launched from the International Space Station. The FlexCool Heat pipe will cool the radio transponder. Under this partnership, Roccor will carry out the design, build, leak tests, thermal performance tests, freeze/thaw tests, and thermal/pressure cycling tests. The prototype will then be delivered to the TechEdSat group to carry out the remainder of the environmental tests.  However, the TechEdSat platform does not provide a platform to characterize and understand critical heat pipe behaviors such as startup from a cold state when exiting eclipse or pulsing on a high power load.  Perhaps most critically, the behavior of a heat pipe changes in a microgravity environment and full flight qualification would be achieved in Phase II, enabling FlexCool to become a new standard for fast, inexpensive integration on emerging power hungry commercial SmallSats and NASA CubeSat science platforms. In addition to working with the TechEdSat group, SEAKR Engineering has agreed to be a subcontractor to derive requirements relevant to their commercial products. SEAKR is a leading supplier of innovative spacecraft electronics.

Preclinical evaluation of the technology, including ex vivo extracellular recording experiments and in vivo surgical development, demonstrated that we are able to reproducibly stimulate degenerated retinal tissue and safely insert the prosthetic into the subretinal space of both rats and pigs. These milestones provide a foundation for further work to test biocompatibility and efficacy of the technology; however, the outcome of future efforts are dependent on the quality and efficiency of our manufacturing methodology. The implants are manufactured using a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique, in which alternating layers of the light-activated protein, bacteriorhodopsin, and a polycation binder are sequentially deposited onto an ion-permeable film. The current terrestrial LBL approach is influenced by gravity, in which sedimentation and gradients of solutions interfere with homogeneity and uniformity of the multilayered implants. We hypothesize that manufacturing in a microgravity environment will improve the quality of the films and, as a result, will enhance stability and performance for future preclinical and clinical trials. Additionally, we predict that these improvements will reduce the cost, time, and amount of material needed for each manufacturing cycle. A pilot manufacturing trial was completed on the International Space Station (ISS) via the SpaceX CRS-16 mission, which led to the miniaturization of a LBL manufacturing device and the proof of concept of creating multilayered thin films using a Low-Earth Orbit platform. In this Phase I proposal, we will perform a series of terrestrial-based parameter setting studies to optimize the LBL manufacturing conditions prior to leveraging the ISS facilities for a subsequent Phase II flight.","This Phase I SBIR establishes the capabilities required to support Low-Earth Orbit commercialization related to the manufacturing of protein-based retinal implants in microgravity.

Such solutions exploit surface tension, wetting, and system geometry to passively control fluids for reliable separation, collection, and transport. Because such aqueous streams for plant habitats can be highly contaminated with particulates, biofilms, and gases, passive no-moving-parts solutions are attractive due to their simplicity, resilience to fouling, and increased reliability.

While such systems offer benefits in power conversion efficiency, size, weight, and cost (SWaP-C), these systems generally lack modularity due to a lack of high power fiber connectors and switch gear.  Due to the specialized equipment and training needed splice fiber components, this lack of modularity confounds the installation of fiber systems through various mechanical interfaces, and makes field repair of an integrated fiber system nearly impossible. To address these issues, Q-Peak proposes to develop an environmentally insensitive, low insertion loss, expanded beam fiber connector with high average and peak power handling (>100W, and >100kW respectively).  Q-Peak is well positioned to achieve such high levels of transmitted power by leveraging novel opto-mechanical technologies which were developed in a number of recent efforts to achieve similarly high power connectors for flight applications at both short and Mid-IR wavelengths.

By enabling modular construction of laser subsystems, it will be possible to qualify high power fiber components ex-situ, thus drastically improving first-pass yields.

Originally created through fragile laboratory experiments, quantum entangled photon sources have matured recently into commercial sources that are rugged and much easier to use. With the growing availability of these commercial sources, new applications have begun to emerge. One such application, quantum key distribution, is the use of quantum entangled photons to create a never-ending supply of unbreakable cryptographic keys for secure satellite-to-satellite communications (see figure at right).To date, commercial entangled photon sources have been used primarily for terrestrial, indoor applications - where unwanted ambient light can be easily controlled. Space-based applications, however, require sources that must operate in the presence of abundant sunlight.One of the major constraints limiting the effectiveness of filtering techniques is the large spectral bandwidth of the entangled photon sources themselves (~1-2nm). This broad spectral output limits the ability of spectral filters to isolate the quantum signal, since the filter must have a comparable bandwidth to avoid reducing the intensity of the source. By developing a source with a narrowed spectral output, much greater isolation of the quantum signal is possible. Toward this goal, we propose to design a bright entangled photon source with a spectral bandwidth 100x narrower (<10pm) than today’s commercial sources. Evaluating the performance of four different design approaches, we will down-select the design that achieves the greatest improvement. Finally, we will show that this improvement, when combined with existing spatial and temporal filters, can achieve the isolation of quantum photons from natural solar photons required to conduct quantum key distribution between satellites.","Commercialization of a narrow-band entangled photon source supports the following program: The 2015 NASA Roadmap for Communications, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization (Tech Area 5) identifies Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) (TA 5.6.4) and Quantum Communications (TA 5.6.5) as Revolutionary Concepts (TA 5.6) that can have very high payoff if successful. Entangled photon sources are a critical technology for quantum communications and quantum networks; and entangled photons represent a promising approach to QKD.","The National Quantum Initiative (NQI) dedicated to maintaining US superiority in quantum information sciences. The Defense Optical Communications Program (DOC-P) is a tri-service effort that includes quantum communication. DOE Quantum Networks for Open Science Entangled photon sources are foundational technology for such a network, and narrowband emission will provide coupling to quantum repeaters."

The lack of sufficient onboard resources have also resulted in custom data storage architectures that vary by mission in the absence of a standard data access framework. Onboard computing capabilities have improved significantly through targeted investments in technologies in recent years and will continue to grow in the future. Additionally, ground-based processing,  which inherits time-lag, communication availability, and limited bandwidth issues, will be incapable of meeting the increasing demands for operational and scientific data processing objectives. As flight software systems mature to take advantage of increased onboard computing resources, a standardized infrastructure will be needed to store and access data onboard.Advanced Space proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of ODIS, the Onboard Data Infrastructure for Spacecraft. ODIS utilizes standard SQL interfaces and open-source relational databases that operate within a standardized framework for data storage and retrieval. Additionally, Advanced Space proposes to design and implement a Database Memory Manager (DMM) that will allow increased data storage onboard a spacecraft. ODIS will be demonstrated within NASA’s Core Flight System (cFS) software architecture. With the ability to utilize standard industry-accepted interfaces such as SQL to facilitate onboard processing of operational and scientific data, ODIS can dramatically increase the scientific yield of future missions. Technologies that use machine learning and spacecraft autonomy will especially benefit from ODIS as data is essential to machine learning implementations. Investing in this capability now and demonstrating in compliance with cFS FSW architecture will accelerate development of autonomous and flexible software and avert a future with differing, incompatible, and low performing architectures.","The application for this technology is any future space missions that require onboard data processing to improve autonomy, science yield, and overall mission performance. NASA adoption of ODIS for all onboard data storage and retrieval operations will establish a standardized approach to mission data handling, enabling inter-spacecraft data exchanges and many advanced spacecraft operations that are required or highly beneficial for deep space applications.","The existence of a standardized, open-source framework for data storage onboard spacecraft will enable sophisticated flight software on any spacecraft mission. Onboard databases can support commercial missions by increasing the amount of instrument data return and enabling onboard autonomy.

Every feature we add is driving towards a vision of reducing the complexity of ground system operations and access.  We propose a technical solution that removes much of the constellation planning daily grind from the customer so they can concentrate on exploiting their data. The end result is a reduced staff, less room for error, and optimized access to data. ATLAS currently uses a generalized highly parallelizable, polynomial-time schedule algorithm called the Flex Scheduler for task deconfliction across multiple ground systems with many customers. The Flex Scheduler is built to support task requests and optimize deconfliction. It is important to note that this approach is the only way to achieve higher utilization of ground systems due to its ability to “load balance” across many ground systems and generate a globally optimal utilization plan. Without giving the customer the ability to generalize their requests a scheduling system can only be a deconfliction algorithm, not a system wide optimization function. Where most scheduling systems are intended for one satellite constellation, the Flex Scheduler is federated across all ATLAS owned systems and considers all customers simultaneously. Federation of the data allows for deeper insights. To improve the Freedom Platform and take it to the next level, we propose the following: System Wide Load Balancing: Define clear goals and allow the customer to adjust their importance, develop a task decomposition phase that generates task requests, and feed them into the lower lever Flex Scheduler. Time Reduction: Abstract the management into a simple to understand set of goals that the customer can adjust on a day to day basis. Rapid Re-Scheduling via Machine to Machine: Define a concise, cloud hosted, API that allows the submission of task requests along with metadata / spacecraft state parameters.","NASA can benefit from the Freedom Platform by integrating any aperture on any network seamlessly and securely, not just on NASA assets. Freedom is a resilient, responsive, and scalable solution. The Freedom Platform can integrate disparate systems into a neural network to capitalize on the synergy of combining existing and future systems. NASA is in the position to influence the development of this leveraging the computing power of the cloud capability to meet their current and future needs.","While human interaction has worked for years, it will soon become impossible to keep up with demand as data and satellite contacts increase in volume. It is not a matter of “if,” but “when” satellite operations must transition to a cognitive machine-to-machine approach.

The PQS eliminates the use of an AQS and the associated hardware and electronics. The AQS requires a high voltage electronic driver that provides a fast switching speed of a few nanoseconds, and a high voltage power supply. The AQS crystal is located in the master oscillator resonator and requires maintaining accurate alignment to the resonator beam axis. A high power intracavity polarizer is also required to provide high losses when the Q-switch is in the off state.  These AQS components are all replaced with a single PQS crystal with relatively minor alignment requirements to the resonator beam axis. Cr:YAG PQS crystals have been used in the past for microchip lasers that are Cr:YAG crystals diffusion bonded to an Nd:YAG crystal with coatings applied to the ends to form a laser resonator. These lasers have short pulse-widths (< 1 nsec) and have little control of the rep-rate. More recently Cr:YAG PQS crystals have been used as separate elements in an MO resonator to control pulse width, and have been used with Nd:YVO4  crystals, since the wavelengths are about the same. The pulse width can be increased to 8-10 nsec by using a longer resonator, and the laser rep-rate can be controlled by operating the laser diodes in the QCW mode for pumping the Nd:YVO4. The Cr:YAG PQS does not become 100% transmissive and introduces some additional resonator losses. The losses can become negligible in a MOPA configuration if the MO is designed for, and operated at a relatively low power. Several stages of amplification can be used to raise the output pulse energy to the level required for space based lidar applications.","The transmitter is primarily a candidate for use in NASA lidar systems where high energy, high rep rate pulses are required to provide enough return signal for detection at long ranges, such as from space. Lidar applications from SmallSat platforms have this requirement as a result of the long ranges involved. The NASA ER-2 high altitude aircraft could also serve as a platform for lidar with high power transmitters to provide an increased field of view.","Non-NASA applications include military lidar for ranging and imaging, particularly with the emerging use of UAV military platforms, and agriculture and forestry UAV lidar monitoring. Some of these lidar transmitter applications may be required to operate at an eye safe wavelength around 1550 nm, which can be provided by output wavelength conversion to 1550 nm using KTP in a high power OPO."

Alphacore’s solution will be an ASIC that will have a 2 GS/S (gigasamples per second), 12-bit, <40mW, radiation hard ADC and a 256-channel back-end digital signal processing (DSP) block consuming <100mW.

Our design and advanced multi-layer Niobium fabrication process will enable us to make a compact SQUID based readout for large scale superconducting bolometer arrays. Arrays of superconducting transition edge sensors (TES) are frequently deployed in instruments for far infrared (IR) astronomy, particularly for cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. In order to reduce thermal loading due to wiring between the detectors and readout, as well as to reduce the cost of readout electronics, multiplexing has become a key technology for enabling detectors arrays at the kilo-pixel level and beyond. Multiplexing allows readout of multiple detectors on a single line by separating the signal from each detector in either the time or frequency domain. Current NASA missions employing time domain multiplexing (TDM) include HAWC+ and PIPER. These experiments feature a SQUID based TDM readout circuit that is interfaced to the TES array through an Indium bump bonding process. Next generation missions such as PIPER Dual Polarization Upgrade and PICO require an increase in sensor desnsity. As part of subtopic S1.04 (Sensor and Detector Technologies for Visible, IR, Far-IR, and Submillimeter), NASA has put out a call for kilo-pixel scale cryogenic, multiplexed readout capable of reading out two TES per 1 mm2 pixel.

While MCPs are only one (albeit one of the most critical) of the many components of the final UV instrument that require development, this SBIR program specifically focuses on meeting imaging resolution, uniformity and count rate requirements on the MCP level; aspects related to sealed tube design (low noise photocathodes (115-400 nm), and large area, high-resolution anodes (such as a cross-strip anode), incorporation into a sealed tube package capable of maintaining an ultra-high vacuum) are addressed in another grant application being made under this solicitation.","The LUVOIR UV Multi-Object Spectrograph (LUMOS) and the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) aboard HabEx will possess large focal planes that require large-area, high spatial resolution detectors to take full advantage of the planned multi-object spectrographs. Large format UV detectors are also outlined as a Priority 1 technology requirement in the Cosmic Origins Program Annual Technology report (NASA 440-RPT-0017). Large area, sealed tube MCP detectors are baselined for both LUMOS and UVS but the specified technology need to be developed.","Non-NASA commercial application include high Energy Physics instrumentation, novel laboratory instrumentation, and all other existing MCP-related applications with high spatial and timing resolution requirements such as TOF-MS, UV and electron spectrometers, night vision, and LIDAR applications. Success of this SBIR program will help Incom push further into and disrupt the established MCP market."

Improved photon detectors provide increased sensitivity, higher resolution, and enable reduced size and weight. For earth sensing, Ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths provide a unique capability to monitor ozone, chlorine compounds, bromine compounds, and aerosols.  For astrophysics, UV provides a critical window for the determination of the atmosphere of exoplanets.  Recently, solid state imagers have been developed with the capability to provide high spatial resolution imaging with single photon sensitivity using various silicon approaches (Quantum Image Sensors, single photon avalanche diodes, scientific CMOS, etc.) These sensors often provide single photon sensitivity, high quantum efficiency, and good imaging performance.  However, these sensors are limited by certain properties of silicon, including high thermal noise rates and high sensitivity to background radiation.  To improve UV performance, we proposed to develop single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and single photon avalanche diode arrays using AlGaN materials, providing larger photosensitive areas with improved sensitivity, lower thermal noise, and excellent rejection of background radiation (solar blind).","Potential NASA applications include a broad range of UV instruments, including spectrometers and hyperspectral imagers.  UV instruments are used in earth observation satellites, particularly those developed to measure atmospheric ozone, chlorine, or benzene.  Space based telescopes can also benefit from UV photon detectors and photodetector arrays, including straightforward UV spectroscopy of the universe as well as exoplanet discovery instruments, where UV spectroscopy can be used to determine the atmospheric constituents of exoplanets.","The annual market for ultrasensitive photodetectors is estimated to be in excess of $1B. Solid-state alternatives to UV photomultipliers can enable improved spatial resolution and higher quantum efficiency, enabling applications ranging from remote sensing, to intercontinental missile launch detection, to high efficiency detection of gamma ray detectors using scintillators (DOE and NIH)."

The proposed innovation leverages a Class-E derived topology of converters by combining an RF source (inverter) and an impedance matched rectifier to produce high voltages at efficiencies greater than 95%.  These efficiencies are possible through the implementation of resonant switching in the topology.  In addition, by implementing power switching at the MHz to 10s of MHz , the size of the converter can be minimized through the requirement of needing smaller values capacitors and inductors (coreless).  The required modulator is also simplified in the Class-E design as the single power switch (GaN MOSFET technology) utilizes a ground reference source simplifying the gate driver requirements.  The modulator will also enable a means to control the output voltage to deliver a linear response to the input command.  The rectifier stage will satisfy a 25kV output isolation requirement needed by detection instruments.  The Phase I program will produce a 10kV high voltage supply with the converter implementing a scalable output rectifier such that additional rectifiers added on the output can be placed in series and boost the output voltage.  As the design matures, we intend to ensure that a path exists for all utilized components to have radiation hardened equivalents to achieve a future rad option.  At Phase I exit, we will have demonstrated a converter with rectifiers placed in series with the output to achieve the desired closed-loop regulated 10kV target.","The subcompact-sized high performance radhard HV ultrafast slew rate (high power) supply offers significant impact to a wide range of NASA SmallSat missions including detection instruments, X-ray tube, gyroscopes, plasma initiators etc. by reducing existing HV power solutions by as much as 10×.

The vast majority of these devices have presented challenges to the scientists and design engineers to translate what has previously been the domain of the laboratory, into compact and low powered devices. Of the family of detectors that have been used to meet the challenge, none has greater potential, yet been more difficult to miniaturize into a portable form factor, than the mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometers, unlike some spectrometers such as ion mobility (IMS), require a partial pressure region to scan for a given mass number indicative of the trace species of interest. Probably the most significant hurdle yet to overcome is how one can create a cost effective, small, and low power vacuum system. Over the past 30+ years, no significant advance in vacuum pump concepts save for the turbo-molecular pump has been realized. The proposed concept offers a potential for game-changing new technology that may obviate a turbo pump in many applications while promising to provide significant cost savings with unprecedented reliability and longevity for future space missions.","Spacecraft laboratories on the ISS as well as future manned spaceflight, could benefit greatly from the success of the proposed technology. Using the vacuum of space for an analytical instrument is highly undesirable due to the safety factor of creating any leaks on a spacecraft, and the discharge of atmospheric gases could affect the space vessel station keeping. As a result, there is a need for a means to create a vacuum for analytical devices such as mass spectrometers used on spacecraft and probes for interplanetary missions. .","Mass spectrometers require a partial pressure region to scan for a given mass number indicative of the target species. Up to now, there has not been a means to miniaturize a high vacuum pump for use in handheld mass spectroimeters or possible drone applications. The high RPM in a turbopump creates a gyroscopic precession that precludes many uses that are not so limited by the disclosed technology."

The instrument extracts 5×1cm cores, and immediately performs in-situ, time-resolved, coregistered imaging and spectroscopic mapping at high resolution – 10µm and 50µm, respectively. Rapid analysis of cores is critical to characterize original material before it has time to lose its volatiles or oxidize. The significant attribute of our technology is the ability to focus on a specific layer or location on the core surface – something that none of the previous, current, or even future surface missions have capability to do. The goal of Phase I is to develop and integrate key subsystems of the Dual in-situ Spectroscopy and COring instrument, DiSCO, and critically evaluate their performance using standards. Phase I will advance DiSCO to TRL4. DiSCO is the first instrument that boasts integrated drilling/coring/caching, imaging, and laser spectroscopic mapping systems. DiSCO integrates a combined fiber-based optical imaging, laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and laser-induced native fluorescence (LINF) system into an SBIR-funded, demonstrated drilling and coring platform. DiSCO advances planetary exploration by enabling unprecedented observational and analytical capabilities on landed spacecrafts by integrating drilling, coring, caching, imaging, LRS, LIBS, and LINF technologies into a compact arm-mounted instrument. Thus, DiSCO: (i) obviates the need for drill-sample/core-analyze approaches, which are popular (Curiosity and ExoMars) but severely limited, (ii) provides evidence relevant to selecting subsurface sample sites, (iii) enables careful selection and caching of subsurface samples, (iv) and facilitates assessment of subsurface composition and transformation processes of metastable materials. These features and capabilities make DiSCO a potential disruptive tool for a wide range of future landed missions.","Our innovation improves instrument measurement capabilities for planetary science missions such as Discovery, New Frontiers, Mars Exploration, and other planetary programs, including: landed exploration missions to Venus, Moon, Mars, Europa, Titan, comets, and asteroids; sample return missions to Moon, Mars, comets and asteroids. In addition, DiSCO may be used to identify and map available planetary in-situ resources, and to spur the development of autonomous in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) devices for robotic and human missions.","While coring robotics and spectroscopic sensing are established fields, DiSCO combines them, for the first time, to develop a new tool for subsurface geochemical/mineralogical investigations.

At UMD, Dr. Arevalo’s group has been working with an international group of experts to develop mass-spectroscopy instruments that use linear ion trap (LIT) and Orbitrap for higher mass resolution and better accuracy in detecting molecules. More recently Dr. Arevalo has been funded through Development and Advancement of Lunar Instrumentation (DALI) program to develop CRATER (Characterization of Regolith And Trace Economic Resources).  CRATER has been conceived as a lander-payload instrument and it pioneers two cutting-edge subsystems: a UV laser and a CosmOrbitrap mass analyzer. CRATER will investigate the dynamics of the moon-forming events, detect life forming blanks, and explore economical important resources in the Moon. Q-Peak proposes to design, develop and prototype a laser that will produce ~1 mJ of energy at 1064, 532, 266 and 213 nm.  A switching mechanism to select particular wavelength will be employed along with a variable attenuation mechanism to continuously change the output energy from 0-100%. Estimated volume of the laser head is < 50 c.c. A key factor in miniaturizing the laser is to design custom miniature optics, combine feature such as passive q-switch and output coupler, and bond the optics in place after they are aligned externally.  Q‑Peak will partner with University of California, San Diego to develop a universal soldering material to bond optics to its heatsink that has different CTE compared to the optics.","NASA applications are in the search of life in the extra-terrestrial by detecting organic/inorganic molecules by means of LDMS, LIBS, LIF, Raman spectroscopy.

The SPICE module will be designed to work in conjunction with a number of in situ analytical instruments depending on the specific needs of the customer. More specifically, the SPICE module will consist of an ultrasonic chamber that can be operated in two modes. A static mode for mixing and homogenizing the sample, and a dynamic mode that flows solvent through the ultrasonic chamber to avoid the re-adsorption of the analytes to the solid surface. This mode is useful for extracting the maximum amount of analyte from the solid sample with a reported increase of up to 70% over static methods. Where traditional extraction of soil/mineral samples involves the removal of organics from the surface, ultrasonic energy can be used to rupture small particles and break apart aggregates to expose inner surfaces that can trap analytes.  The instrument described above will lead to significant improvements in the extraction of soluble analytes from solid samples over current technologies such as mechanical mixing, high temperature extraction or extraction with organic solvents. UAE leads to less cross-contamination than mechanical mixing, is more more energy efficient than thermal methods and does not require large volumes of organic solvent. In addition, the modular nature of the SPICE instrument allows it to be compatible with several analytical techniques currently in use by NASA including capillary electrophoresis, microchip capillary electrophoresis, gas chromatography, HPLC, UV fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy.","The SPICE instrument is an autonomous and adaptable solid sample processing unit to be used in conjunction with other instruments for chemical analysis. It is of great benefit to NASA for processing solid samples from planets, moons, asteroids or other bodies since the return of chemical samples is challenging and prone to contamination. The ability to remove the maximum amount of chemical analytes from soil or mineral samples may reveal the presence of new chemical species important to understanding the chemical makeup of the universe.","The SPICE module will be designed to act as a remote, autonomous instrument which is ideal for processing samples under dangerous circumstances such as in the area of high radiation doses or severe chemical contamination. The module is useful in the analytic laboratory for the consistent processing of solid samples."

Optical multi-pass cells are devices that are fundamental to achieving high sensitivity in spectroscopic instruments for gas detection and measurement.  The proposed project is a unique opportunity for NASA to advance multi-pass optical cell technology in several new directions at once, addressing multiple fundamental design advances with potentially large and lasting impact on the future design of optical instrumentation. The specific NASA SBIR solicitation technical topic that we address, S1.08 Suborbital instruments and sensor systems for earth science measurements, includes development needs for reduced volume multi-pass cell designs and optical subsystems for open path measurements.  The solicitation topic also calls for small trace gas sensors suitable for UAV’s, which need low-volume multipas cells.  The work we propose addresses stated needs for advances in optical absorption cells and related subsystems, both for open path as well as closed path (low volume) measurements.  One of the cell designs we have conceived is specifically for open path measurements, where the base length may vary with the experimental circumstances.  That design, the “Retro-Cat Cell” combines a remote retroreflector with an “inboard” mirror combination that acts like a variable focal length mirror, so it can adapt to variable base length.  We present four different pathways for improving path-length per unit volume in multi-pass cells.  These pathways range from simple filling of excess volumes, to re-injection systems to a new cell architecture.  These development pathways are expected to yield results that improve existing commercial multi-pass cells, improve existing instrumentation and make new more compact instrumentation possible.","These multi-pass cell advances will positively impact NASA scientific endeavors that rely upon optical detection of gases, particularly in its Earth Sciences Division.  Our new open-path cell design may be useful for increasing the path-length of measurement systems such as the NASA LaRC Diode Laser Hygrometer.  New closed path cell designs may be of benefit to numerous NASA centers involved in trace gas measurements, such as: Goddard, Langley, JPL and Glenn.  We note those centers because we previously sold then trace gas instruments or cells.","The new open-path cell design will have application to industrial settings with variable base paths, such as fence-line monitoring, or in environmental measurements where the measurement circumstances change.  Closed path cells are integral to the set of trace gas instruments produced and sold by ARI, so new designs will enhance our products and capabilities."

NASA desires technology for low mass, high thermal performance LHe insulated dewars for future balloon-borne instruments. Light Weight Dewar (LWD) is a novel lightweight dewar concept, using a thin, lightweight vacuum shell supported by underlying IMLI layers and integrated with a lightweight dewar wall, that could achieve heat flux as low as 0.3 W/m2 and up to 79% mass reduction over current LHe dewars. LWD uses discrete load-supporting spacers to form a structural insulation system able to support thin metal vacuum shells at balloon observatory atmospheric loads while minimizing heat flux through the spacers and layers.  Quest’s expertise in engineering high performance insulation systems that support external loads, along with experience gained from designing lightweight vacuum shell and insulation layers with load supporting spacers for two NASA programs, should enable the Quest team to successfully design, build and test a lightweight dewar that provides good thermal performance for LHe storage for high altitude balloon cryogenic sensors.

Critical requirements for such a gyroscope include a high sensitivity to rotations, insensitivity to accelerations, and a simple scheme that is well-suited to miniaturization.  An atomic gyroscope based on the combination of point source interferometry (PSI) and large momentum transfer (LMT) beam splitters is well-suited to meet these requirements.  A conventional PSI is based on the use of cold atoms released from a trap, and subjected to two-photon Raman transitions that act as beam splitters and mirrors for a Mach-Zehnder light-pulse atom interferometer.  In a PSI, the rotation signal is observed by monitoring the fringes develop across the spatial profile of the expanded cloud, and is unaffected by acceleration.  The spacing and the orientation of the fringes are analyzed to determine the components of the rotation vector that are orthogonal to the laser pulses, thus realizing a multi-axes gyroscope.  The sensitivity of a conventional PSI is limited by the relatively small area enclosed, since the conventional Raman pulses produce a momentum separation equivalent to only two photon recoil momenta.  Under this proposal, we will investigate the feasibility of realizing a PSI that makes use of the technique of large momentum transfer (LMT) based on pulsed Bragg Transitions (BT) and adiabatic rapid passage (ARP).  For experimentally feasible parameters, such a gyroscope may enclose an area as large as one square centimeter.  For ten million atoms interrogated per second, it would be able to achieve a rotation sensitivity of about 2.5 micro-degree/hour per root-Hz, which would be nearly a factor of 50 better that the best atom interferometric gyroscope, which is large and based on atomic beams, demonstrated to date.

We propose to develop a manufacturing process for microelectromechanical deformable mirrors (MEMS DMs) that eliminates high spatial frequency topography due to print-through. In NASA's extreme wavefront control systems used for space-based coronagraphy, topography needs to be at or below 1nm rms to avoid being a limiting factor in achievable dark hole contrast. High spatial frequency topography on MEMS DMs can inhibit high contrast imaging in coronagraph systems through undesired diffraction. In previous work we have developed a clear, quantitative understanding of the root causes and sources of high-spatial frequency shape errors in MEMS DMs, and have demonstrated feasibility of one promising approach to eliminate those errors. The proposed new process involves modifications of the annealing processes, sacrificial materials specifications, layer thicknesses, and processing procedures used in MEMS foundry-based fabrication of DMs, and will lead to production of DMs with surface figure errors measuring 1nm rms, about an order of magnitude lower than the current commercial state-of-the-art. We will conduct experiments on test structures to optimize topography-reducing techniques while simultaneously ensuring high yield.  By combining recent process innovations that improve topography with other recent innovations that markedly increase manufacturing yield, we will create a path toward producing ultra-smooth, high-yield MEMS DMs that will become enabling components for the space-based coronagraphs that NASA is relying on in its mission to search for habitable exoplanets.","Deformable mirrors with reduced high spatial frequency topography have a few astronomical NASA commercial applications.

While MFCs have flown, their performance has not been quantified under minimal thermal protection. Data is needed to show the viability of piezocomposites as optomechanical control actuators. Phases I/II will mature optomechanical control through these LEO activities: Phase I establishes the ability of MARIO to robotically deploy and control telescope modules. This sets the stage for flying MARIO. Phase I determines feasibility through: Phase I uses MARIO technology to assemble mirror elements. Phase II conducts a 6–12 month LEO mission demonstrating active submicron optomechanical control.

This proposal outlines a feasibility study for the VR HERMES (VIBE Robotic High End Responsive MSF Elimination System). A SiC with silicon cladding, or silicon, freeform optic (diameter =< 0.25 m) will be generated and polished through the techniques derived at Optimax via years of SBIR and commercial work. After polishing, MSF errors will be characterized through metrology such as computer generated holograms and deflectometry, and the errors will be mitigated by artisans. The smoothing process will be completed while the artisans guide collaborative robots. With this procedure, data will be collected regarding the artisan's technique (i.e., a ""Process Map""). Through the use of state-of-the-art metrology, Optimax will attempt to capture artisan techniques via machine learning algorithms, and compare that to mapped MSF error data. Optimax will use an iterative approach to create algorithms that can then predict, given an error map, what techniques an artisan would apply to to optic to correct the MSF errors (i.e., a ""Predicted Map"").

To help meet this need, Quartus Engineering Incorporated (Quartus) is proposing leveraging analytical models and existing opto-mechanical designs to provide a shift in the approach to the development of space-based optical systems for deployment on CubeSats and small satellite platforms. It is common for technology to be leveraged from mission to mission, such as customizable CubeSat, small sat, or larger satellite buses. This is less common with precision optical subsystems, which are often designed from the ground up to meet the science needs of a mission. If the appropriate work is done to validate the analytical tools used to design optical components and subsystem designs, beyond a particular use case, these tools could be used to adapt current component and subsystem designs to new missions. This approach could lead to semi-custom precision optical systems for space applications, much in the same way spacecraft bus suppliers support the science community. This SBIR proposes the validation of the designs and analytical tools used to assess the SAGE IV Pathfinder telescope for structural, thermal, optical performance (STOP), such that these designs and analytical tools can be used to accelerate development and reduce costs of future NASA and other science missions.","As mentioned at the start of this proposal, the 2017 decadal survey called for a means to reduce costs of earth observation missions.

This work will push CMM technology into the realm currently dominated by expensive, complex and error-prone optical testing. ANCMM will have the capability to measure the prescription and mid- and low-order surface error for meter-class segments for large astronomical telescopes.  Accurate metrology of the prescription (i.e., radius of curvature, conic constant, and off-axis distances) will speed the fabrication, hence reducing costs, of primary mirror segments, because ANCMM metrology will have greater dynamic range than current CMM technology, allowing ANCMM to be used “deeper” into the fabrication process (i.e., from rough machining and grinding of blanks though the fine stages of optical polishing) before transitioning to an interferometric test, if that is even required for the final stages of polishing and verification. Both cylindrical mirrors and freeform surfaces require stringent surface requirements and plan to be implemented in future NASA missions like LISA and LUVOIR.   OptiPro Systems and the UNC Charlotte Center for Precision Metrology have built and tested contact and non-contact multi axis measurement platforms and will be utilized during this project.

In these cases, NASA has traditionally used RTGs.  However, RTGs are inefficient (<8%), with specific powers of just 2.7 W/kg.  Complicating issues is the scarcity of GPHS units due to a long drought of plutonium production.  Even with a restart in production, this necessitates judicious use of remaining GPHS units. ExoTerra’s proposed advanced micro Brayton energy converter operates a pair of units off a single GPHS.  The units are 40% efficient, enabling 100 W of electrical power and a >40 W/kg specific power.  The system uses advances in manufacturing techniques to enable high efficiency heat transfer among components and miniaturize the Brayton Cycle components.  By using a pair of units, we balance inertias across the spacecraft to maintain control. The proposed Phase I effort completes system design of the micro Brayton unit.  We then fabricate a compressor unit to demonstrate the advanced manufacturing techniques.

Furthermore, many of the traditional designs based on the Weinberg converter are restricted to specialized, low voltage, bus systems.  The proposed research will test the feasibility of using multiple anode power modules for PPUs in the 12kW or higher.  The purpose of this phase-one proposal is to convince the reader that there may be significant advantages of the power-brick-array worth exploring. Using well designed, reliable, wide-range, module arrays has become increasingly popular for military power conversion.  It is not unusual to see 5kW converters being made from arrays of 300-watt power bricks. The advantages lie not only in the convenience of design but also there is reliability in high volume electronics.   Space-rated electronic components carry their reliability guarantee from extensive testing but commercial power supplies made in high volumes have been thoroughly field tested and have a higher degree of robustness. Colorado Power Electronics (CPE) has developed a hall thruster anode power supply that has both wide input range and wide-output range.   This 2.25kW module can be used in a power array much like the power modules from Vicor ™ or Synqor ™.  This wide-ranging topology has been used successfully for plasma loads with an estimated $2 billion market sales since inception.  Originally patented in 1996 this topology is still the go-to design for modern thin-film-deposition.",The scalability limit appears to be enormous.  If we use military power-brick designs with fifty-brick structure as a model our current power-brick total power would exceed 100kW.  This power level should satisfy most thruster requirements for several decades. Redundancy for electric propulsion has been limited to redundant PPU-thruster pairs.  There is no redundancy within the PPU itself.  The proposed power-brick topology offers a level of redundancy not found in other PPU designs due to the limitations of mass and volume.,With increasing volumes power-brick operating costs will drop due to minimum-lot-buy requirements and other economies of scale. We are currently proposing power modules for linear accelerators and induction brazing for soil sample recover.   There will been many reusable design elements and circuits that will further improve economies of scale.

An innovative space environmental stable TCMS concepts are suggested through AMSENG IR&D work for the multifunctional, low (αS/εT) material systems that can meet these aggressive goals in cost effective, reliable manner especially to meet the needs identified in solicitation for: the coating to be robust in nature. It is anticipated that the coating be non contaminating and is not a trap for the contamination, and be cleanable; as well as its adhesion need to meet the requirement of the orbital conditions along with the need of no particle generation during the life time of the space hardware. The suggested efforts emphasize Plasma Sprayable Materials developments for the two material systems: the first one considers the Co Doping of the BaTiO3 - PBT-50™ and processing of coating using plasma deposition. The second material system also plans to consider Co Doping using Nano Metallic inclusions in neutral and reducing atmosphere for the Li:GAO™. These innovative approaches can provide the material technology solutions, which can allow higher leakage currents that may also help to defend against the natural solar storm events and provide the needed robustness. The past work and the IR&D suggests that the envisioned derived material systems can provide the needed reliable & validated TCMS in typical space environments of (LEO), (GEO) & beyond with the robustness that can define cleanability and no particle generation. The reliability goal for the robust conductive TCMS is to have a design life of > 10 years in LEO and > 15 years in GEO, with the hardware demonstration during phase II.","The success in the proposed developments will contribute uniquely to the survivable and robust TCMS. The NASA Science missions that can benefit from its applications are the missions that need the affordable conductive TCMS coatings that assures no particle generation.

Some of these payloads may be small robots or rovers which could explore their immediate surroundings and make scientific findings which are not possible using stationary landers. One of the most difficult thermal challenges for lunar rovers is to survive the lunar diurnal cycles. This becomes especially challenging for small rovers or robots (~ 1 to 10 Kg) which, due to scaling laws, have a high surface area to mass ratio compared to larger spacecraft.  As a result, it is unlikely that a small rover would be able to survive such a cold and long lunar night on its own. The Pop-Up Flat Folding Habitat (PUFF-Hab) is an innovation which would allow small robotic explorers and rovers to survive cold lunar nights by retreating into the PUFF-Hab when temperatures fall. The habitat is a structure covered in Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) which uses a combination of insulation and heat stored in the lunar regolith to prevent temperatures from falling excessively inside the habitat. The ultimate goal would be to allow nighttime survival of small robotic explorers and rovers without the need for survival heating by keeping internal PUFF-Hab temperatures above -40 °C. The PUFF-Hab would be folded flat for Earth launch and lunar landing in order to conserve volume. Once the PUFF-Hab is on the lunar surface, it deploys from the side or footpad of the base station using a small release mechanism and unfolds using springs and/or strain energy stored in the PUFF-Hab structure. This objective of this proposal is to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) from 2 to 4, by designing a habitat which will keep internal night time temperatures above -40 °C, showing that the thermal design is robust using analytical models and sensitive studies, and demonstrating the ability of a breadboard prototype to un-fold using a single release mechanism.","The Pop-Up Flat Folding Habitat (PUFF-Hab) has applications to any NASA lunar mission which desires for small rovers (~ 1 to 10 Kg) to survive the lunar night.  In addition, the innovation could be scaled up for larger rovers to help reduce or eliminate survival heating during the lunar night. The innovation also may have applications to help reduce survival heating for Martian rovers by serving as a wind breaker, even though Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) is not an effective insulator on Mars due to the presence of CO2 gas.",The Pop-Up Flat Folding Habitat (PUFF-Hab) could also benefit privately funded missions to the lunar surface or to Mars.  Deployable structures are an active area of research interest in the space industry so advancements in deployable structures for this application could benefit other more general applications as well.

This coupling will not only reduce weight, but will enable an advanced regenerative cooling geometry in which the fuel tanks circumferentially surround the rocket combustion chamber to directly transfer heat into the propellant. With off-the-shelf valve integration and limited assembly/connections, SSR will reduce connections (and therefore possible failure points), cost, build time, and dry-mass.

For every pound of Mars liftoff mass removed from the return vehicle, in this case a Mars ascent vehicle (MAV), the incremental reduction in gross liftoff mass from Earth is several orders of magnitude greater. Consequently, any technology that can reduce the mass that must be lifted out of the Mars gravity well will have a huge impact on the amount of mass that must be lifted off the Earth’s surface. A leading design for a MAV is baselining the use of a hybrid rocket for primary propulsion and nitrogen cold gas thrusters for the reaction control system. Studies have showed that above a certain threshold, monopropellant systems become more mass-efficient. An in-house trade study has showed that for total impulses above 140 N·s, a traditional hydrazine system has less mass than a cold-gas system. The same study also showed that if a foam-based ignition system is used with hydrazine instead of a granular catalyst and external heaters, the breakeven point drops to just 44 N·s. Furthermore, as the total impulse requirement increases, the mass advantage of the foam-based hydrazine system increases significantly. In this project, Ultramet will design, fabricate, and thoroughly bench test a foam-based ignition system for hydrazine.","Virtually any spacecraft or launch vehicle using monopropellant hydrazine will benefit from this technology.

This concept of polymer coating sliding on polymer coating yields the beneficial effects of “transfer layer”, which can efficiently reduce friction. In other words, one of the polymer coatings will work as a “pre-deposited transfer layer”, thus reducing friction. In addition, because the cosmic environment radiation, mainly a combination of protons and alpha rays, might deteriorate the bearing materials after long time service in space exploration, we will study radiation exposure effects on the bearing materials.

This directly addresses NASA’s interest in expanding the ability to explore the deep atmospheres and surfaces of the Moon, planets, asteroids, and comets through the use of long-lived (days or weeks) balloons and landers. This will be based on the transmitter that InnoSys has developed based on its proprietary SSVDTM technology, which has been proven to operate at S band and survive a 500 oC environment.  Although it could possibly be applied to other missions, we believe Venus mission is a good target for us as it has a dense CO2 atmosphere completely covered by clouds with sulfuric acid aerosols, a surface temperature of 460 to 486ºC, and a surface pressure of 90 atmospheres.

We expect the proposed S-band radio will support space systems that can operate without additional environmental protection housings in the extreme environments of these NASA missions.   InnoSys will also ensure the radio that will be developed to be capable of high reliability, ease of maintenance, small form factor, low mass, and low out-gassing characteristics.  For the Phase I study, InnoSys proposes to develop a highly integrated SSVD™-based transmitter design for the Venus radio to be built in the Phase II of this proposed SBIR project. We will perform studies to determine whether SSVDTM or other proven technologies such as the impressive progress made through wide band semiconductor materials by NASA Glenn Center should be used for the receiver design.

This work takes account of detailed design considerations on the power stage consisting of (i) a switching circuit and (ii) SiC gate drivers with minimized parasitics and false turn-on protection. For the voltage gain regulation purpose, an analog-to-digital conversion interface along with a digital control logic will be designed and implemented in our research. In the Phase 1 program we will design and fabricate key components of the SiC DC-DC  converter. These key components are a SiC CMOS Oscillator for providing switching to the SiC power devices. We will also design and fabricate the power switching devices integrated onto a single die, as well as the MOSFET gate driver circuit which applies current to the MOSFET power switches. All these circuits will be fabricated in SiC to take advantage of the wide bandgap semiconductor’s ability to operate at high temperatures. In addition to the semiconductor itself, it is necessary to have interconnects and contacts that can also withstand high temperatures. We are adopting earlier techniques involving TaSi2 to our CMOS process to achieve a complete high temperature process. These high temperature methods will be applied to fabricated test structures and components of the DC-DC converter.","High temperature SiC based power converters have wide applications in space (both inside and outside the spacecrafts), especially with respect to high temperature environments such as Venus and solar probes. The high temperature operation of SiC obviates the need for significant cooling, thus reducing the weight and volume of related electronics leaving more room for scientific payloads and reducing the cost. Applications include actuators, motors, inverters and power supplies.","High temperature electronics is potentially a huge market. SiC can operate at temperatures in excess of 400°C, which is beyond that of silicon.

Solar eruption impacts can cause disruptions in radio transmissions, damage satellites, harm astronauts, and severely impact power transmission grids.  Therefore, accurate and fast modeling is critical to the study and forecasting of such solar activity. CORona-HELiosphere (CORHEL) is a state-of-the-art modeling suite used to generate solar wind and solar eruption simulations from the Sun out into the heliosphere for research and space weather applications.  It contains a multitude of model options from inexpensive potential fields to computationally heavy thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We propose to improve performance and reduce the cost of running CORHEL by adding GPU-acceleration to its model codes using OpenACC.  OpenACC allows the GPU implementations to be done through the use of specialized comments, leading to single source codes that can be compiled to run on either multiple GPUs or CPUs.  When completed, the GPU-enabled CORHEL suite will be able to run low- to medium-resolution simulations in a single multi-GPU workstation, and perform the largest runs on a few multiple multi-GPU compute nodes.  This is expected to greatly reduce costs, improve efficiency, and be a significant step forward for performing solar wind and solar eruption modeling in a timely manner. At the completion of Phase I, all models in CORHEL will be GPU-accelerated with the exception of the thermodynamic MHD model of the corona.  New installation scripts and documentation will be added, and extensive validation performed.  Phase II will complete the GPU implementation by adding GPU support to the thermodynamic model, and culminate in a validated, ready-to-deploy, GPU-enabled CORHEL package capable of modeling the solar corona, solar wind, and solar eruptions.","Adding GPU-acceleration to CORHEL (currently hosted at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC)) would reduce costs and improve performance for solar wind and solar eruption simulations.  Runs on a multi-GPU workstation could be deployed at remote stations (e.g. sea vessels, space stations, etc.) and used for space weather applications independent of ground-locked computing centers. This project also serves as an example of GPU-accelerating legacy science codes, opening the door for adding GPU-computing to other such codes used at NASA.","Solar wind and eruption models are of interest to many government and commercial organizations that rely on satellites, aircraft, and space travel.

An advanced cellular architecture is to be derived such that the global emergent behavior will exhibit the properties of general-purpose parallel execution by means of local rules and high replication. Local rules will be based on a combination of dataflow and actors semantics with a reference tree implementation of a virtual global address space. This strategy reverses the common architecture priority of ALU utilization to stress memory bandwidth and data movement time and energy costs. Instead, ALU availability is emphasized. Beyond the local operation, global operation is guided by the experimental ParalleX execution model to govern resource management and task scheduling, and impose user-friendly programming model. Micro-benchmarks derived from computational kernels of existing applications will be applied to analysis of CCA behavior over a range of scientific computing algorithms (including climate, linear algebra, and graph problems). The proposed Phase I research is a stepping stone intended to inform the design and development of the future optimized custom silicon structures composing the Smart Memory Accelerators to be deployed in NASA data centers alongside the conventional supercomputing hardware. An important characteristic of CCA is the simplicity and uniformity of the computing structures that makes the CMOS implementation feasible to a small engineering team.

Hyperspectral data collects and processes information across the electromagnetic spectrum, dividing the spectrum into many more bands than are visible to the human eye.  The collected images are combined to form a three-dimensional data cube, where two spatial dimensions of the same scene are joined by a third dimension comprised of a range of spectral wavelengths.  These data cubes are capable of supporting many surface biology and geology applications, with particular potential for improving the discovery and management of energy, mineral, and soil resources.

In contrast, imagery from manned fixed wing aircraft and UAVs can be acquired both frequently and at high resolution over limited areas. Land surface monitoring would greatly benefit from a capability to combine imagery from these disparate platforms, for which inconsistent or irregular revisit times and variabilities in resolution and spectral bands make existing spatiotemporal fusion techniques insufficient to combine them effectively. This project will exploit these recent machine learning advances to combine imagery from disparate satellite and airborne platforms, using multi-resolution image time series and transferring fine resolution knowledge gained from higher resolution training images to lower-resolution test scenes. We will test the feasibility of the system to provide improved classification of vegetative land cover and estimations of fractional vegetation cover, particularly for agricultural areas that frequently change on a small spatial scale. During Phase I, we will use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to make weekly multispectral image collects during the growing cycle of several agricultural crops and combine the scenes with Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. We will spatially and temporally subsample the high resolution UAV imagery to simulate imagery acquired from a variety of aerial and additional satellite platforms and compare classifier performance for different spatial resolutions and repeat periods.","Related follow-on opportunities for NASA program infusion include integration with the TOPS-SIMs irrigation management program at the Ecological Forecasting Lab at NASA Ames, and NASA Goddard’s Harvest consortium led by the University of Maryland to enhance the use of satellite data in decision making related to food security and agriculture.

This engineering investment has been worthwhile: we were able to get 100% accuracy on the DeepSat Earth Science dataset in under 1 hour on a laptop. Vision Engine includes an active learning based neural network training technology where the training software is aware of the cost of labeling data. Unlike traditional neural network training that assumes a large labeled dataset, our system carefully picks samples that maximize the learning opportunity and presents it for labeling to a human annotator.

There is not a process for how to use model-based technology to conduct trade evaluations nor a cohesive toolset that combines the multiple analysis methods used to support trade analysis. Our proposed concept is to provide a model-based process and tool-suite that will support end to end system design trade evaluations, design optimizations and reporting. The proposed tool suite will use model-based system engineering techniques and visuals with a mix of traditional reporting elements: tables, graphs, etc. Our proposed innovation will define a trade space modeling methodology, provide a trade evaluation tool that will run analyses and extract results in a trade study report (with visuals and charts for ease of comparison) and displays results in an interactive user interface for optimization support. Tietronix has extensive experience with model-based systems engineering and fault management engineering that we will leverage.

No longer exclusively the domain of isolated experts, MBE has been implemented across the full product lifecycle. This success is, however, giving rise to new challenges. The ability to share disparate models across teams, organizational boundaries, and among communities of practice is important for collaboration on complex projects. Model reuse is important because it minimizes the need to “re-invent the wheel” for each new project or initiative. Finally, the need to rapidly integrate disparate models together is critical for accurate evaluation of multidisciplinary systems and for evaluating different system/mission concepts and architectural variants. Phoenix Integration proposes to address these challenges by developing an analysis model sharing platform similar to GitHub, a successful software development collaboration system. This platform will be easy-to-use, web-based, and built on the Git version control system. Modifications will be made to tailor the Git repository system to version control analysis models and workflows. This model-sharing platform will have provision for documentation, tags and metadata, which includes a software dependencies list and supported OS. Shared analyses and workflows would be easily run in ModelCenter® and Jupyter notebooks. It will rely on cloud computing resources with on-demand provisioning and execute the analyses and workflows on them when requested. Additionally, published analyses and workflows would be verified automatically whenever supporting software versions change.","A successful project will help NASA further advance the MBE vision and help enable more comprehensive, broader, and deeper modeling efforts across all of NASA’s programs.

The work was continued under an Air Force SBIR which emphasized system of systems (SoS) and acausal simulation. SynaptiCAD proposes to enhance this modeling and simulation environment with functionality designed to improve collaboration, multi-fidelity modeling, and analysis of architectural variants. These three themes follow each other naturally and form a nucleus around which to build a highly scalable complex systems design toolset. Collaboration will include the use of web-based libraries so multiple parties can work concurrently on models, subsystems, or system simulations. Multi-fidelity modeling will feature tools to replace models of differing fidelity, map variables automatically between fidelity levels, and wizards to help the user perform these tasks. The toolset will be able to introspect the system being developed to discern its architecture and allow trade studies to take place by varying architectural parameters. The proposed environment will be designed flexibly, to accommodate future insertion into 3rd party workflows such as MBSE/SysML. The use of time & event simulation will provide the mission planner with a comprehensive understanding of a proposed spacecraft in relation to its scientific mission at an early conceptual stage and extending throughout its life. The same simulation tool will be usable in later stages of design given its ability to manage multiple layers of fidelity and the associated collaboration features undergirding this capability. The tool will provide a rigorous understanding of the science potential of a mission vs. cost, risk, schedule, and other programmatic factors.","Complex design projects will benefit across the spectrum of NASA Science, Space Technology, Human Exploration and Operations, and Aeronautics.

However, these tools are varied and disjoint, and require manual intervention to transfer data from the output of one tool to the input of another. This process is tedious, error-prone and scales poorly for large, complex systems. In addition, these tools are often “silo’ed” to the singular functionality for which they were designed. This prevents FM engineers from gaining insight into the overall system level design and characteristics that are the key to transparency, verifiability and efficiency of implementing and testing FM. FM support tools need to have powerful fault modeling and analytic capabilities to capture their operational procedures and mission complexity.Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI), in collaboration with Dr. Stephen B. Johnson, President of Dependable System Technologies, LLC (DST), plans to develop techniques and the concomitant software tools to “integrate multi-domain data” and “perform FM architecture trades” by leveraging QSI’s TEAMS® (Testability Engineering and Maintenance System) toolset. The solution will provide the capability to cost-effectively create a model, and utilize that model to perform FM architecture studies, both visually/qualitatively, and quantitatively. This ability coupled with the option of using the same model for Operations, will greatly benefit science missions. The main focus of this effort will be to (1) capture diverse and disjoint data products and multi-domain modeling information into TEAMS® for standardizing FM Techniques and Processes and improve the productivity of model (knowledge) creation and FM design process, (2) conduct Architecture Trade Studies focusing on FM (including sensor allocation) effectiveness, (3) introduce ancillary capabilities in TEAMS® to support the main tasks such as Common Cause Failures (CCFs), Probability of Failure on Demand Failure (PFD), and, .(4) develop an FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) exchange tool.","The proposed technology will allow NASA to better plan and execute future Science Missions. It can also operate as part of NASA’s next generation Mission Control Technology, allowing NASA to utilize the FM and mission satisfiability information for improved mission execution while improving safety and mission success probability. Europa is strong candidate for demonstrating the multi-domain knowledge import including SysML.

Both processes consume time and resources from system engineers or ground operators and are unlikely to identify novel patterns in onboard data and telemetry that signify a fault event. Orbit Logic proposes the Fault Learning Agent for Prediction, Protection, and Early Response (FLAPPER) solution, to be implemented as a pair of Specialized Autonomy Planning Agents (SAPAs) that expand our onboard Autonomous Planning System (APS) architecture to include machine learning capable of detecting, isolating, and mitigating anomalies in real- or near-real-time with minimal ground intervention. FLAPPER will analyze a subset of onboard spacecraft health and safety data and telemetry to train against and later autonomously detect and categorize spacecraft faults. Categorized faults will then be mapped to acceptable corrective action responses to be carried out autonomously or with expert oversight from operators given the inferred data. Transitioning the fault detection and correction capabilities to an autonomous and onboard application will benefit the mission’s success by reducing the time the spacecraft spends in anomalous states.","The FLAPPER solution has the potential to be applied to human exploration, deep space, un-manned exploration, and any additional spacecraft missions. As long as the spacecraft supports hardware/software, the spacecraft can benefit from the proposed Fault Management technology.","The FLAPPER solution has the potential for application aboard any non-NASA spacecraft, watercraft, factories, data centers, automobiles and even at home (A/C units, hot water heaters, etc.).

We propose to develop a tool that combines the most robust techniques currently available, together with a wide range of data from the Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO), and the option to upload user-supplied data, to produce the most accurate estimates of benchmarks, together with their uncertainties. During our Phase I effort, we will develop a prototype web-based tool that illustrates how space weather benchmarks can be estimated using the most sophisticated statistical methodologies, which have been previously investigated by our team. We will focus on measurements identified in NSF's SWORM Phase I report, which includes data from a range of regions within the heliophysics domain. Importantly, we will carefully quantify the uncertainties with these benchmark estimates, a quantity that is at least as useful as the actual benchmark value.

Electronics associated with the power conversion and power management and distribution (PMAD) systems in FPS have to operate reliably under high temperature (100s of deg C), high power (1-10 kWe), and severe radiation. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising solution with superior electronic properties for power applications.

The LFB operates by storing two separate solutions of redox-active species which are pumped past the cathode and anode respectively to produce a current. By pumping the redox-active fluids across the electrodes, the energy and power can be scaled independently. What makes the LFB distinct from other flow batteries is its use of locally available resources to produce the electrolyte solutions, thereby reducing the launch mass. Lunar-sourced iron, titanium, sulfur, oxygen, and water provide the bulk electrolyte solutions while the more sophisticated components such as membranes, pumps, and electrodes are transported from Earth. Compared to alternatives such as Li-ion batteries, the LFB has vastly superior cycle life and the energy storage is readily scalable, making it an ideal solution for long-term, stationary storage over the lunar day/night cycle. By using locally available materials to produce the redox-active species and with no need for replacement cells for dozens of years, the energy storage capacity is high relative to the total launched mass. The Phase I program will investigate the selective dissolution of ilmenite (FeTiO3), an ore available in high concentrations in lunar mare basalts, using sulfuric acid to produce iron and titanium sulfate electrolyte solutions and incorporate these solutions into a functional redox flow cell. This cell will be cycle tested to quantify its performance with regards to capacity fade and specific energy while any operational issues or degradation pathways will be addressed.","The principal future application of the LFB is to provide long-duration energy storage for a permanent lunar base. The LFB is ideally suited for such a remote outpost with long day/night cycles where locally available resources can provide the basic materials to produce a large-scale energy storage system with a lower launch mass than alternatives. This system could be scaled up or multiplied to provide power to any number of long-duration scientific platforms, human habitats, and ISRU processing systems.","The LFB technology could provide an alternative solution for large-scale remote storage where access to resources is limited. Alternatively, the development of sulfuric acid processing of mixed metal oxides could provide an improved method for the production and recycling of titanium dioxide as a pigment for the coatings industry, opening up ilmenite deposits for cheaper TiO2 production."

Numerous past and upcoming precision observatory missions have recognized the improved stability and other benefits afforded by microthruster based control; including the completed Gravity Probe B, GAIA, LISA Pathfinder missions and upcoming LISA, HabEx and Euclid mission concepts. Busek's BET-300-P passively fed electrospray thrusters have been shown to yield ultra-low levels of thrust noise (predominantly <0.1uN/Hz^1/2 from mHz to kHz frequencies), high dynamic range (<1uN-300uN) and thrust resolution of a few hundred nN. These features are well suited to proposed mission concepts like HabEx; offering both expanded capabilities and reduced propellant mass over the state-of-the-art Colloid Micro Newton Thruster recently demonstrated aboard the LISA Pathfinder Mission.  However, the total impulse capability of the BET-300-P must be significantly augmented to meet the 1000's of Ns per axis required for large observatory missions.  To meet this need, the proposed Phase I comprises a sequence of modelling, experimental and development tasks designed to expand knowledge of life-limiting physical and logistical mechanisms and investigate new means to overcome them.","The BET-300-P is applicable to the proposed HabEx exoplanet mission and the LISA gravity-wave mission.

To reduce cost and potential burdensome security and handling requirements, one of the primary goals of the GCD Program is to use low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.  As a result, uranium nitride (UN) has been selected as the nuclear fuel.  However, techniques are needed to produce refractory metal coatings on the UN particles to allow fabrication of the cermet fuel element and to protect the UN from the hydrogen propellant.  In addition, the UN particles will be susceptible to oxygen, so the refractory metal coating is also needed to protect the UN particles from oxidation.  During this investigation, advanced coating techniques such as autocatalytic molten salt (AMS) plating and physical vapor deposition (PVD) will be evaluated for producing the refractory metal coating.  In addition, techniques are needed to produce spherical UN particles for subsequent coating.  Therefore, an innovative Plasma Alloy and Spheroidization (PAS) process will be used to produce spherical UN particles.  For the Phase I investigation, a UN surrogate will be used.  Detailed characterization of the as-received, post-spheroidized, and post-coated particles will be used to aid in the down selection of the most promising coating technique at the conclusion of the Phase I investigation.

A critical requirement for specific components of such reactors is the high temperature capability of structural materials to withstand temperatures greater than 1500 K over long durations. Certain refractory metal alloys are prime candidates for such applications due to their low creep rates, strength retention at high temperatures, and no embrittlement due to irradiation. However, the primary challenge associated with such alloys is their low room temperature ductility and extreme difficulty in manufacturing these alloys to desired shapes and with intricate features. To address this challenge GeoPlasma Research proposes to develop the necessary refractory metal feedstocks and a corresponding low temperature Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology that will overcome the problems associated with traditional manufacturing of refractory alloys and enable manufacturing of NTP components. During Phase 1 GeoPlasma Research will concentrate on refractory alloys dispersion strengthened by thermodynamically stable phases. The competitive advantage of the proposed GeoPlasma Research technology includes combination of a high strength refractory metal feedstock and an AM technology that circumvents the issues such as cracking from thermal stresses associated with more traditional laser or electron beam AM technology.  In addition, the AM technology circumvents microstructural modifications during the build process by avoiding melt solidification of the powder feedstock. Such a cradle to grave process from development of refractory alloy feedstocks to finished products will enable NASA’s NTP requirements for deep space mission.","Specific NTP components consists of neutron reflectors, cooling channels, and control drums to name a few.

The proposed approach will allow simulating the structural behavior of complex structures and different types of materials, including any metal alloy and composites. Although the method will be first developed to simulate thermal-based measurements such as thermography, flash thermography, and vibrothermography, the framework could be expanded to other domains including, ultrasonic, microwave, Terahertz, and X-ray.

The Orion crew module is a reusable capsule that provides a habitat for the crew and facilitates exploration of the Moon, asteroids, and Mars. The Space Launch System (SLS) is a heavy lift system and is part of NASA’s deep space exploration plans. The SLS will carry humans beyond low Earth orbit and will deliver elements of the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway. Many of these spacecraft are targeted for long-term use, which offers challenges for inspection and maintenance. In orbit or on the Moon, the use of traditional NDE is prohibitive because of location and inaccessibility, and infrequent inspection can lead to conservative, high-weight designs. NASA is seeking technologies to facilitate inspections on large complex structures and provide reliable assessments of structural health. Structural health monitoring (SHM) can help overcome inspection difficulties and has shown good results on small structures. However, transition to large complex structures has been slow. Some reasons for the slow adoption are difficulties with large sensor arrays, timely analysis of large data sets, and overall weight of the system. In order to realize the benefits of SHM, there’s a need to reduce the number of sensors and minimize data acquisition processes while maintaining the ability to accurately detect, locate, and characterize damage. Compressive Sensing (CS) has been shown to greatly reduce data acquisition and processing burdens by providing mathematical guarantees for accurate signal recovery from far fewer samples than conventionally needed. In this project, it is proposed to develop an ultrasound software package to detect damage in large complex structures using CS at two stages in the data acquisition and analysis process: (1) temporally undersampled sensor signals from (2) spatially undersampled sensor arrays, resulting in faster data acquisition and reduced data sets without any loss in damage detection ability.","The technology will add to NASA’s inspection tools for large complex structures made with composites or thin metals, such as the Orion crew module, Space Launch System, and the Lunar Outpost Platform-Gateway. As NASA continues to push into deep space, SHM systems will be needed to provide mission critical information on the structure’s status. In order for these SHM systems to be viable, the total number of sensors, total weight, and data acquisition requirements must be minimized, and the proposed technology will be critical in achieving this.","Non-NASA applications include large, commercial space launch vehicles. Other industries/applications include aerospace (aircraft wings and fuselage), marine (ship hulls), wind energy (rotor blades), railways, civil infrastructure (buildings and bridges), oil and gas (pipelines). Generally, any industry that uses large structures that require frequent inspection will benefit from the technology."

Non-contact forms of ultrasonic NDE, such as laser-induced ultrasound, are particularly suited for in situ evaluation in extreme environments. Current limitations of this method include the inability to identify shadowed defects, probe double-walled vessels, and evaluate surfaces with unfavorable conditions for laser absorption. Corvid Technologies proposes an innovative ultrasound technique that generates acoustic waves beneath the surface of the target material body using Pulsed Radiation-Induced Acoustics (PRIA). This method uses pulsed radiation to deposit energy within a target material and create a thermoelastic acoustic response. This can be paired with conventional and well-understood non-contact sensing techniques, such as laser interferometry, for a fully non-contact NDE technique that possesses an additional Cartesian degree of freedom for ultrasonic source generation. The ability to generate ultrasonic waves at a variable depth would allow for ultrasonic NDE in the presence of layered defects, inhibitive material properties, prohibitive geometries, or complex material boundaries. Corvid proposes a series of simulations to determine the feasibility of using radiation to develop thermoelastic waves, characterize the resulting waves, and demonstrate the ability to detect simulated shadowed defects. Corvid will first use the Monte-Carlo particle tracking software GEANT4 to determine the feasibility of several radiation source types and configurations, and determine the energy deposition of each. The molecular dynamics software LAMMPS will take the output of GEANT4 and simulate the response of the materials of interest. The results from LAMMPS will be input into the finite-element code Velodyne to determine the macroscopic wave properties from the pulsed radiation and simulate the waves in the presence of defects.","Corvid foresees PRIA being utilized by NASA for the inspection of complex or non-traditional geometries, or for the advanced inspection of material with multiple layers of defects that may not easily be detected with currently available methods. Existing structures in space can likewise be inspected using PRIA where thermal imaging or laser induced ultrasound may be inhibited by surface condition/coatings. With miniaturization and optimization for known structures, PRIA can be a low cost and viable alternative to existing methods used by NASA.","The use of double walled/insulated vessels across all branches of the military and in many industrial settings makes PRIA a valuable potential resource for inspection. Specific companies who could also utilize PRIA include aerospace manufacturers such as Boeing,  and utilities that operate nuclear plants such as Duke Energy, who could use PRIA to evaluate reactor equipment and structures."

Oxygen extraction systems rely on solar concentrators to heat regolith to the required reaction temperatures. Opterus proposes development of a lightweight, high power, deployable solar concentrator (DSC) to support this need. Existing traditional rigid reflectors are accurate but untenably heavy, while previously developed inflatable reflectors are light, but have high shape error and low efficiency, which limits their achievable temperatures. Opterus’s DSC is a thin, composite, folding parabolic concentrator that uses curved fold lines and connecting hinges to achieve both low mass and high shape accuracy. The proposed reflector technology is made thin and light by using extremely stiff carbon composite material, which would be made highly reflective through vapor deposition of a metal topcoat. DSC’s hinges fully connect reflector gores to maintain stiffness, while still allowing the reflector to fold for launch. Opterus estimates that such a reflector, if made to an approximately 1 m diameter, would have a power-to-weight ratio of approximately 2980 W/kg. Within the proposed Phase I effort, Opterus will work with NASA to size a concentrator that meets NASA’s system needs, and then optimize our existing folding shell design to minimize weight and packed size, minimize shape error and maximize concentration ratio. The composite lay-up will be selected to minimize the coefficient of thermal expansion. Opterus will produce a scale prototype up to 1 m diameter, measure its shape under 1g loading and demonstrate packing. Opterus will also perform a detailed thermal analysis to determine expected shape error from thermal loading. In a Phase II effort, Opterus will complete system design, as well as demonstrating a complete system with a physical vapor deposition reflective coating.","Opterus’s proposed deployable solar concentrator (DSC) is expected to see first use in NASA lunar missions, as part of a system to extract oxygen from lunar regolith. As stated in the solicitation, “Solar concentrators have been used to successfully demonstrate multiple [In-situ Resource Utilization] technologies,” but existing rigid concentrators are too heavy for space applications. Opterus will align DSC development with NASA’s Moon to Mars mission.

Whether the process is melting via concentrated solar radiation for additive manufacturing, heating in a rotating fluidized bed for volatile extraction, or electrostatic beneficiation of tribo-charged mineral particles to separate ilmenite for oxygen extraction utilizing hydrogen reduction, each process works best for a particular size range of particles, and may not function at all for particle sizes very far outside of the optimal range. Gravity-independent methods to reliably size-sort regolith into multiple conveying lines will be developed and demonstrated.  This project will also demonstrate improved methods for low-gravity, conveying, storage and delivery of regolith in flow-rate controlled streams that can be movable, and can function at gravity levels as low as zero. No gas-solid separation steps are required for the proposed all-mechanical size separation system, and the basic multiple size-separation unit has only one major moving part to create all preselected size ranges.  The system will function independent of gravity level. During Phase-2 novel movable (articulated) conveying lines that can deliver the sorted feedstock anywhere within a finite 3D-volume will be developed/demonstrated. The flexibility of having adjustable end points could facilitate utilization of such regolith feedstock streams in direct additive manufacturing of regolith based structures, or they could be directed to temporary buffer storage vessels for subsequent continuous or batch delivery to processing equipment.","A robust efficient system to size-separate regolith will benefit most ISRU operations. The proposed all-mechanical system is appropriate for the broadest range of potential environments from planetary surfaces to small airless bodies.  Beneficiation methods, such as tribo-charging and electrostatic separation to increase concentrations of certain minerals, function best over restricted particle-size ranges. Size-segregated feedstock can improve effectiveness of such processes, as well and many other proposed regolith ISRU processing systems.","This project will reduce-to-practice a new feeder for ‘flexible screw conveyors’.which can substantially broaden operating conditions, and may lead to licensing agreements with companies like Flexicon or Hapman.  Also, metal Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing sieves all recycled powder.  This simple approach can be more robust than the sieves being developed in the AM community."

In the LEGS a 2.5 GHz solid state microwave transmitter positioned on a downward pointing horn is deployed by a lunar lander or rover using a long boom (e.g. 1-2 m) to set it down on the lunar surface, and then beams power into the regolith using its microwave transmitter. The microwaves directed down onto and into the ground contained under the horn, heating regolith to depths of several tens of centimeters. As a result, gases will be evolved from the cold subsurface regolith into the horn, where their composition will be analyzed by a near-infrared ~1 to 2.4-micron spectrometer mounted horn, and looking through a sapphire window into the interior of the horn illuminated by a tungsten lamp, enabling transmission spectra of evolved gases to be obtained. These instruments will provide qualitative and quantitative data on volatiles, potentially including water, hydrogen, helium, CO2, CO, ammonia hydrocarbons, and other species as they evolve from the subsurface over time. Since gases released by upper layers of regolith will reach the horn first, this procedure will also provide composition as a function of depth. Once gas emission ceases, the horn is lifted by the rod and placed on a new location, where the process is repeated. The LEGS deployment will involve very little disturbance to lunar soils prior to analysis, thereby preventing the accidental release of lightly-bound volatiles that is thought to be significant even following gentle handling. In the proposed program, a full scale working model of the LEGS, including horn, microwave transmitter, and spectrometer, will be built and tested in Pioneer Astronautics","The LEGS program will provide NASA with a key technology finding volatiles on the Moon, which represent a tremendous resource for human exploration. The data produced by the LEGS would be invaluable for lunar science itself, providing essential information for understanding the origin and history of the Moon and similar bodies no doubt present in orbit around numerous planets in other solar systems. LEGS could also be used on Mars, Phobos, Deimos, asteroids, moons of the outer planets, Mercury, Pluto and even comets.","The LEGS be used on Earth without major modification employing its IR spectrometer to determine amounts of volatiles, including trade contaminants, in the soil. It thus represents an instrument with broad potential utility for geology, resource exploration, and environmental remediation."

Soil with a higher hydrogen content will tend to slow down (i.e., thermalize) neutrons rather than absorb them, thereby depressing the fast and epithermal components of the neutron energy distribution while enhancing the thermal component. The primary objective of the proposed effort will focus on the integration of a neutron detector onto a space-worthy mobile platform. An integrated mobile platform provides numerous benefits compared to a stationary instrument, in that it provides greater area coverage and high spatial resolution data. The mobile platform chosen is the CubeRover, currently being developed by Astrobotic Technology, Inc. under a Phase II SBIR contract 80NSSC18C0037. The CubeRover was selected due to its light weight and ability to support the power and data requirements of the neutron detector. The proposed neutron detector is the Omni-Directional Multichannel Neutron Energy Identification Instrument (OMNI), which is currently being developed by Radiation Detection Technologies, Inc. under Phase I SBIR contract 80NSSC18P1952. Whereas both ongoing SBIR contracts are focused on the development of a standalone system, the proposed effort will focus on integrating both systems together (called NeuRover) to provide a mobile neutron detector for lunar volatile characterization and mapping. Furthermore, the resulting technology can be infused into several lunar missions and deployed at numerous locations on the lunar surface. The NeuRover can effectively look for water ice on the lunar surface, which allows for unmatched vertical and lateral spatial resolution.","A compact, low-power NeuRover would yield benefits to the NASA mission beyond the search for hydrogen below the lunar surface as proposed. A major hurdle to overcome to ensure the success of the human exploration of space and extraterrestrial bodies is to limit the radiation dose to astronauts. A commercially-available NeuRover system could help to understand these issues to a greater degree of accuracy than existing technologies, by inexpensively roving in unknown areas before human astronauts are sent in for missions.","An application for a roving (autonomous), robust neutron energy spectrometer would be in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. It is possible that with the increase in nuclear fuel and waste storage, and along with the unfortunate radiological accidents at various sites, e.g., Hanford, Fukushima Daiichi, NeuRover’s remote roving capability may be beneficial for inspecting these sites."

The proposed design builds on ACT’s experience with passive two-phase devices, as well as our pumped two-phase expertise, to address the needs outlined in the subtopic titled, “Mechanically Pumped Two-Phase Flow Thermal Control System Technology Development”.  In Phase I, ACT will design and demonstrate, through simulation and experiment, a prototype cold plate capable of managing heat fluxes up to 5 W/cm2 while maintaining spatial isothermality to within 3 K and temporal isothermality to within 0.05 K/min.  This capability results from a passive design that exploits two-phase phenomena and the unique behavior of fluids at saturation conditions. Compared to single-phase systems at significant heat loads, two-phase thermal management systems reduce spacecraft mass, volume, and power usage while providing performance improvements such as enhanced heat transfer and temperature uniformity.  The Thermal Management Systems Roadmap (TA14) challenges researchers to develop two-phase thermal management systems that can manage high heat loads with improved temperature control.  Such systems have been described by numerous NASA research papers and, as outlined there, these systems have significant mass- and power-saving potential, as well as additional capabilities such as isothermality and heat sharing.  The purpose of the work proposed here is to support pumped two-phase thermal management system development by addressing technology gaps that are related to heat collection as identified in the referenced work and outlined in the solicitation.",The potential applications for the proposed cold plate are NASA missions that require spatial and temporal temperature control for improved instrumentation functionality.  Additional applications for this cold plate and associated two-phase system would include spacecraft with thermal demands beyond the capabilities of capillary systems and those interested in low-cost alternatives to conventional thermal management systems.,"In Phase II, ACT will extend the development of the cold plate to a complete two-phase thermal management system.  During this phase, ACT will investigate application with the growing commercial satellite and spacecraft market.

Effective heat rejection is needed for a number of NASA missions especially those associated with planetary and lunar orbits where extreme temperature differences due to lighted versus dark regions challenge radiator systems. Supplemental heat rejection systems are needed with these radiators to fully reject the heat loads from space vehicles. Phase change material (PCM) heat exchangers are capable of supplementing these radiators, especially for long duration missions. These systems store excess thermal energy during periods of high heat loads or hot thermal environments by melting a material within the heat exchanger. At a later time, this heat within the heat exchanger is removed freezing the phase change material. This frozen phase change material is thus capable of adsorbing a heat load again continuing the process.","Innovations in PCM heat exchangers are desired to continue improving the storage capacity of these units in support of many cross-cutting programs at NASA ranging from ISS, to cubesats, satellites, and rovers. In particular, NASA is challenging design innovations for these PCM heat exchangers that have more phase change material and less structural mass, specific goals being at least 2/3 PCM and less than 1/3 structural mass.","Commercial opportunities for the PCM heat exchanger can support electronic systems especially for smoothing out thermal energy during pulsed operations. Additionally, when electronic systems’ cooling systems are temporarily unavailable, a PCM heat exchanger can function as a standby system protecting the electronic system."

Unfortunately, two-phase flow systems are inherently unstable and can accordingly introduce significant management challenges in the reduced and variable acceleration fields that are typically present on spacecraft. While, in spacecraft, a stable separation of the fluid phases can be achieved in a phase-separator (i.e. via the radial acceleration about a vortex flow field), such stability is not easily available in the flow channels of implemented condenser or evaporators.  The several flow regimes that can exist in two-phase flow channels (e.g. bubbly flow, slug flow, annular flow) are highly sensitive to the external acceleration field.   Further, flow regime, flow rate, heat-flux, flow quality, and pressure drop, and temperature are all interdependent, where a change in one causes (potentially dramatic) changes in the others.   This introduces a hard design and operational challenge due to the starkly different fluid and thermal properties that can exist as a function of the flow regime in a two-phase flow channel, and the risky thermal transients that can occur. This problem can be substantially reduced by an intelligent sensor that can discern the thermal and fluid characteristics in a two-phase flow channel and provide such information to an intelligent control system in real-time.

The SPAHR concept has a base turndown capability of at least 13:1, with the potential of up to 43:1 using a propylene glycol/water (PGW) working fluid, providing unique capability to support crewed exploration with a non-hazardous working fluid. The two orientations of the SPAHR radiator are ideally suited for the operational heat loading (6-8 kW) and dormant loading (1-2 kW) as called out by the solicitation. The SPAHR capability also more than meets the stretch goal of 12:1 identified in the NASA technology roadmap TA14.2.3. This turndown capability is of the radiator device only; in a Thermal Control System (TCS) SPAHR turndown ratios can exceed the 50:1 goal in TA14.2.3.6 for Variable-Geometry Radiator.  This very high turn down enables human exploration well beyond our present capabilities and enables single-loop thermal control of a crewed vehicle with a non-toxic fluid, which reduces TCS launch mass by 25% or more due in large part by eliminating the need for the external pump package. SPAHR actuates via through solid-state, temperature dependent two-way shape memory torque tube. This actuation varies the view of radiator panels that also employ selective emissivity faces; the combination of which provides the high turndown. The shape memory torque tube is actuated by the working fluid temperature alone. No active control, instrumentation, or power is required; the passive nature of its behavior makes for a highly dependable and robust thermal control mechanism and decreases the complexity and mass of control systems that would otherwise be required to orient the radiators. When in its highest heat rejection configuration, SPAHR’s mass and heat rejection per unit area are on par with state-of-the-art conventional flat panel radiators.","SPAHR is applicable to future human exploration systems, habitation systems, and to satellite systems. In Technology Area (TA) 14.2.3.6 of NASA’s 2015 Technology Roadmap, NASA identifies the need to develop variable heat rejection radiator technology that can achieve a turndown ratio of 12:1 (stretch goal) with an even higher performance goal of a 50:1 turndown ratio possible. SPAHR will surpass the stretch goal and contribute substantially toward achieving to the higher performance goal.","SPAHR applies to vehicles, satellites, and habitats requiring pumped fluid loop radiators including large portions of the DOD and commercial satellite market.

Spacecraft radiators reject waste heat; however, more complex mission environments and spacecraft power require more sophisticated thermal control. NASA desires low mass, high turndown variable radiators for future manned spacecraft, exploration vehicles, habitation, and interplanetary missions. Lander Variable Radiator is a low mass radiator, using discrete passive thermal switch actuators within an IMLI structure, can provide highly variable and controllable heat rejection. LVR can give precise thermal control, for complex heat load requirements and environmental conditions, with an expected turndown ratio of 80:1 and an areal mass as low as 1.5 kg/m2. LVR has discrete integrated heat actuator/spacers in an IMLI insulation structure. SMA springs in the actuators passively actuate at mission-specific temperatures, connecting heat conductors and functioning as a good radiator. When the lander is in a cold environment and must retain heat, the actuator/spacers disconnect, and LVR becomes IMLI insulation to retain system heat. The lightweight, passive LVR system draws on Quest’s experience solving complex thermal control requirements with innovative, high performing insulation technologies. This experience will enable Quest to successfully design, build and test a sophisticated variable radiator with a high turndown ratio and low mass for future variable environment missions. This novel advanced radiator integrates passive actuators within IMLI to achieve higher thermal performance than current state-of-the-art louver radiator; enabling thermal control.

The spacecraft ATCS must transport heat loads from inside a space habitat to subsystems that reject heat to the surroundings. Deep space habitats will require ATCS that maintain cabin temperature despite wide fluctuations in heat loads (during crewed and un-crewed periods) and sink temperatures.  Historically, dual loop architectures have been utilized, because there are no known fluids that are both non-toxic (safe to use inside the habitat) and non-freezable (reliable for use outside of the habitat).  Thus, a low-freeze point fluid is used in an external loop and a non-toxic fluid (water) in an internal loop, increasing overall mass and complexity.  These dual loop architectures are safer with a nontoxic internal fluid but hazards still remain. Non-freezable, nontoxic coolants and freezable radiators will enable single loop ATCS architectures that have reduced complexity and mass over dual loop systems.

FRESR builds upon and integrates ground tested heat exchanger/radiator technology, into a realizable single loop architecture with low mass materials and more reliable components. A FRESR ATCS includes human-safe coolant, eliminating the toxic hazard of ammonia or HFE7200; freeze tolerant components that allow thermal expansion during freeze; and self-regulating temperature control, making it robust to fluctuating heat loads and heat sinks.

Their physical properties, including an unusual combination of hardness, strength, and elasticity, have made them ideal candidates for the production of strain wave gears. Both the lack of ability to produce thick components and the cost per gram of the material result in preclusion of subtractive manufacturing methods as the primary mode of part formation. Instead, components are formed from metallic glass using injection molding, thermoplastic forming or 3D printing. Unfortunately, draft requirements associated with molding techniques and the lack of precision in 3D printing often make some form of subtractive post-processing inevitable. This creates a manufacturing challenge for both high volume and rapid prototyping applications. Currently, CNC milling and electric discharge machining (EDM) are the primary methods for post-processing of near net shape BMG components. Unfortunately, CNC milling is unable to deliver on needed thin features due to the hardness and elasticity. EDM on the other hand imparts thermal stress on the components and can promote crystallization near the affected machining surface. We propose using pulsed electrochemical machining (PECM) as both a manufacturing solution for volume production and for prototyping. Traditionally, PECM is used as a volume solution to manufacturing and is already capable of filling this need for the BMG community. Voxel Innovations is currently working with BMG manufacturers to incorporate PECM in this way. In the proposed research, we present a method for allowing PECM to meet BMG rapid prototyping needs (specifically targeting this effort towards strain wave gears), allowing prototyping and volume manufacturing to maintain continuity in how it is accomplished.",Prototyping of bulk metallic glass strain-wave and planetary gears for extra-terrestrial cold-world robotics.,

There remains an opportunity to further develop the process by extending the longevity of the FSW tools that are prone to wear and improving the economics of the processing.  In Phase I, higher wear resistant tools will be designed for FSW of aluminum alloys in the 2xxx series, but these FSW tools could also be applicable to harder metals such as titanium and metal matrix composites.  Tungsten carbide (WC) and particularly WC cermets with a cobalt (Co) binder are the materials of choice for FSW of many metals.  However, it is desirable to develop higher performance WC cermets/composites without Co, a costly strategic metal which is also a known carcinogen and health hazard.  In this program, WC-based materials using an iron-based binder with and without carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforcements will be fabricated, using a recently developed consolidation approach which should result in residual porosity levels ≤1% and thus the optimum mechanical properties.  Traditional metallurgical methods for enhancing fracture toughness, such as grain size refinement, Co content optimization, and strengthening agents, have been substantially exhausted with respect to conventional WC cermets, and this program represents an innovative means to improve performance via 3 separate or combined approaches:  (1) use of higher hardness iron-based binder, (2) use of CNT reinforcements to increase toughness, and (3) use of novel consolidation approach to minimize porosity and optimize performance. Improved performance FSW tools should result in higher wear resistance and longer lifetime tools.  The materials will be characterized for microstructure, hardness, fracture toughness, and strength, and preferred compositions assessed through the FSW of Al 2xxx plates over a length of 1200” and depth of 0.625”.","This proposal addresses the need for longer lifetime, wear resistant FSW tools with the development of improved quality WC cermet/composite tools which would be utilized for NASA applications involving the FSW of propulsion and propulsion-related components and hardware.  Decreasing costs and shortening the time for manufacturing crew modules and large-scale aerospace hardware like fuel and oxidizer tanks, and particularly the use of lightweight aluminum tanks, would be highly beneficial to NASA.","The largest application is cutting tools for machining steels and hard metals. Others are armor-piercing projectile cores for military weapon systems, knives/hammers, road scarfing inserts for patching and replacement of roadways, bearing/sealing applications, and inserts for roller cone bits and those used in mining and drilling of earthen material in the coal, oil, and gas industries."

In addition, the economic advantage of using FSW has been established for welding of low melting point, Al and Mg alloys. However, tool material development has been the major limitation for the application of friction stir welding (FSW) or processing on high melting point alloys such as Ni-based alloys and titanium alloys over the past decade. During friction stir welding of these high melting point materials, weld temperatures can exceed 1000⁰C, so the tool material needs to be strong enough to sustain wear and deformation at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. The major drawbacks of currently available tool materials are insufficient high temperature strength, short tool life time and expensive tooling cost. Therefore, it is of great industrial interest to develop a new cost-effective tool material with the required high temperature strength and lasting tool life time. In this SBIR program, QuesTek Innovations LLC and University of North Texas (UNT) propose to design a cermet-type tool material with high entropy alloys (HEAs) as the binder phase, by combining Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and efficient experimental processing approaches. QuesTek will apply the ICME approach to computationally design and optimize the ceramic-binder tool material (composition and processing) and UNT will process and test the material with their expertise in Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) techniques and processing FSW tool materials. The final goal of this program is to design a suitable tool material for FSW on high strength Ni-based superalloys such as Inconel 718 or Haynes 230 alloy of interest to NASA.","The development of tool material described in this proposal would be significant support to the efforts at NASA to implement fully friction stir-welded space exploration system elements (SLS, Orion and ground systems). The efforts here would be invaluable in advancing the solid-state welding technologies at NASA in conventional-FSW, Hybrid-FSW, TSW of high melting point materials. An ICME approach on developing FSW tool materials will enable the tailoring of material microstructure and processing to achieve required properties.","QuesTek has consulted multiple OEMs working in space-related research who have admitted that the availability of an FSW weld tool for high strength materials (ex. Ni-based alloys) would be of considerable interest as it opens the possibility of solid-state welding of the associated components. The developed tool material would enable FSW of Ni-based alloys used in the turbine engines, nozzles."

This welding robot will be an adaptation of a versatile Busek developed system called SOUL (Satellite On Umbilical Line) with a suitable weld head attached to it. SOUL is a small (<10kg), nanosat-sized space vehicle hosted by and deployed from a larger mother ship (Host Space Vehicle, HSV) as needed to perform a variety of duties.  SOUL was originally developed to capture large space debris (and towed by the HSV to a disposal orbit) which now includes servicing. Upon completion of its mission the SOUL is re-stowed inside the HSV in a marsupial-like manner. Unlike “free flying” robots, the SOUL never runs out of power, communicates securely with its HSV over a fiber optic link embedded in the umbilical without the need for encryption, and in case of malfunction, does not become another uncontrolled space debris.  Thus, SOUL is a low risk system that in case of malfunction, is retracted by the HSV and re-stowed. Unlike fixed robotic arms attached to large spacecraft, the low mass, low momentum of the SOUL precludes damage inducing accidental collisions that may create additional space debris.  The SOUL system was awarded a US patent. When equipped with suitable welding device, SOUL can perform both micrometeoroid damage repair and join metallic surfaces by welding. In Phase 1, one or two candidate welding technologies will be selected and tested in Busek vacuum chamber.  The principal candidates include Laser, Electron Beam, arc-based techniques (TIG and MIG) and spot-welding.  Busek has Laser, robotic TIG for 3D printing, and Spot welders in house.  The existing SOUL vehicle will then be examined to assess the changes required to carry the selected welder.  Finally, the existing SOUL will be tested to determine if its position control is adequate for welding.",In addition to welding applications SOUL has the following broad application set:,The SOUL system and or its elements have a long list of possible commercial applications which in some cases overlap with NASA applications.

However, technology advances and system requirements continue to push the boundaries of what is needed by future space explorers and commercial products. Beginning with the Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF), MIS has progressively pursued additional manufacturing processes using the core subsystems of AMF as a baseline. VULCAN, a metal additive and subtractive manufacturing machine, and EMMA, an electronics manufacturing machine, are two programs that are currently underway. AMF, VULCAN, and EMMA provide a basis for pursuing in-space welding and are used to guide MIS from initial systems requirements development, through creating the critical design of this capability. MIS proposes to develop a Mobile End-effector Laser Device (MELD) capable of on-site, on-demand joining and repair of space structures. MELD is a self-sufficient end-effector that interfaces with a robotic arm and uses the arm for mobility. Key subsystems are directly contained in the end-effector such as power supply, laser system, cooling system, vision system, and avionics. This system is programmed to be autonomous and relies on minimal human interaction, depending on the task. The MELD system provides a tool that applies to many use cases and repair functions that are vital to future long duration exploration missions.","The International Space Station and Lunar Gateway are two large NASA assets that require maintenance due to the environments they are in. Free orbital debris, micrometeorites, and other hazards cause unseen and unplanned damage to the outsides of these habitats and must be considered when human lives are at stake. MELD would be used to remediate any damage that would occur to the external surfaces by either welding over or adding material to the outside of the surface for additional strength and protection.","The autonomy provided by the combination of a robotic arm appendage and MELD provide significant cost benefits to mass production and construction companies. High levels of accuracy and precision are two main principles that must be followed with welding and could potentially be disastrous if not achieved. Welding of car struts, foundation beams, and large construction benefit from using MELD."

The method combines automated agglutinate generation in a Discrete Element Method (DEM) numerical framework to produce irregular grain shapes composed of bonded particles. Additional factors are introduced in the model to study soil mechanics properties relevant to ISRU and exploration missions targeted at the lunar poles including terrain generation with reduced soil compaction. Unlike previous lunar DEM terramechanics models which incorporate both individual particles to represent agglutinates, the proposed software allows the interlocking of irregular agglutinate shapes which act to increase angle of repose, shear strength, and abrasiveness of the soil. The product of the Phase I project will include automated generation of irregular grain shapes in DEM, coupling of DEM with the Finite Element Method to simulate a wheel and deeper soil layers, and terrain generation routines to allow for variable compaction within the DEM soil layers. These efforts will lead to standalone terramechanics modeling software in Phase II whose mechanical response will be calibrated to results obtained in laboratory experiments.","The primary NASA application of the proposed terramechanics software is the analysis of soil-wheel interactions for conditions found at the lunar poles. These developments allow robust, low-cost analysis of rover designs aimed at ISRU and exploration missions at lunar polar regions. Parametric inputs in the software allow testing of complex wheel geometries under a range of potential terrain and soil mechanics conditions.

It advances the Science Mission Directorate's Strategic Goals and Objectives of enabling sustainable long-term exploration and utilization of space resources by making possible multi-lunar-day missions into permanently-shadowed regions while using onboard instrumentation (including a compact drill and one or more spectrometers) to prospect for hydrogen-rich resources. This proposal specifically addresses the thermal management system analysis and design, required for COLD-MAPP to survive the lunar night and PSR environments. The thermal management system utilizes novel thermal control technologies to heat COLD-MAPP; these novel technologies include the EarthHeat heat collector to collect radiated heat from the Earth, and the DrillHeat bore-hole heat pipe to capture warmth from lower levels of the lunar regolith where solar heating remains after the lunar sunset. Also proposed is a cryogenically-stable hub motor/wheel drive combination, which will operate while being in constant contact with the lunar regolith over a temperature range of -230C to +150C.

The IRLW uses improved slip estimation, embedding estimation, and entrapment detection algorithms and methods, which allow for the perception of mobility risk when moving on any terrain and especially on challenging and extreme terrains. Beyond the innovative algorithms incorporated in the IRLW, the motivation for the integration of risk assessment and mitigation systems into a wheel is two-fold: First, offloading risk assessment capabilities to an intelligent robotic wheel would allow a rover to allocate more of the main computing power for high-level mission objectives while simultaneously improving the reaction time to potential mobility issues. Second, the self-contained IRLW would allow the rover design process to be more modular which extends the rover design space and promotes the IRLW design to be used for multiple space missions on multiple platforms.","The IRLW can be used to enhance the mobility of any NASA mission with wheeled autonomous systems.

However, HPSC-enabled computers are only one aspect of a full spacecraft avionics system.  As technology and mission complexity continue to advance, additional technologies will be needed in order to operate full spacecraft systems.  By the time HPSC-enabled computers become readily available, Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology will have advanced well beyond the capability of the HPSC itself.  As a result, COTS technology will need to be integrated into high-performance space systems alongside HPSC computers.

The HPSC Chiplet includes support for several popular high-speed interconnects: Serial RapidIO (SRIO), PCI Express (PCIe), and Ethernet.  High-reliability space systems, including those with built-in redundancy, must implement sophisticated Fault Detection, Isolation, and Reconfiguration (FDIR) features within the spacecraft bus interconnect system.  The selected interconnect standards have varying degrees of built-in support for high-reliability, fault-tolerant systems.  Innoflight’s goal is to extend and tailor these existing FDIR capabilities for spacecraft architectures.  We also plan to standardize these new capabilities between the different interconnect types.

Results of Phase 1 will inform design and implementation of a fully automated in-line tension / thickness control system in Phase 2 including scale of the mini-false beam concept to a full scale 3D-TPS set-up with tens of thousands of ends of warp fibers, and integration of the system with TEAM's existing PLC controlled loom programming logic.","The proposed technology is directly relevant to future NASA missions that would leverage NASA's various 3D weaving based heat shield technologies, including deployable decelerators and 3D-TPS.  Specific missions may include Venus and Titan, Mars sample return (MSR) and future outer gas giant missions (Uranus and Neptune).","The proposed technology is relevant to a wide array of applications for which 3D woven preforms are being used and/or developed.  Some of the most mature applications to date include net shape preforms for aircraft engine vanes, blades and shrouds, and thick 3D preforms for composite armor and oil and gas components."

Many times, even for the most experienced weavers, when variations are identified a defect is already woven into the product.

Dust and debris particles are liberated and may strike the landing vehicle and surrounding assets and may obscure ground observation for safe landing. In addition, craters are formed on the landing surface, posing an additional challenge to vehicle stability and surface operations. CFDRC has developed the Gas-Granular Flow Solver (GGFS) capable of simulating the multi-phase gas-particle interaction and the complex physics within the regolith compositions found on Moon and Mars. Eulerian-Eulerian models are applied to efficiently model the gas and particle phases as continuum fluids. This capability has successfully been introduced into NASA project applications for Mars lander development.  With the current focus on returning to the Moon in the near future, this plume-surface effects simulation capability must now be applied in the lunar vacuum environments. In this case, a mixed continuum/rarefied approach must be used to properly simulate the gas-phase dynamics. This project will combine existing capabilities for gas-granular flows with mixed continuum/rarefied gas flows into a coupled toolset using a novel micro/macro coupling approach. This combination facilitates a local switch to continuum or rarefied gas flow in a seamless automated process. During Phase I, the mixed continuum-rarefied gas flow capability will be implemented and its influence on the particle phase response demonstrated. A plan will be devised for modeling the reverse effects of the particle phase on the state of the mixed rarefied gas phase. A list of required validation cases for this new capability and suitable experimental facilities will be identified to generate validation data in Phase II. Phase II effort will complete implementation of all models and perform extensive validation and application demonstrations.","Potential NASA commercial applications include all NASA led lunar lander development projects. Small commercial lander activities and NASA sponsored instrument payloads under the CLEPS program will require accurate definition of the plume-particle distribution environment below the landers near the surface encountered by the landers and the payload instruments. The development of medium/large size robotic and human class landers, in the context of the Lunar Gateway outpost, will require detailed information on plume-surface interaction risks.","Potential non-NASA applications include mixing in pharmaceutical industries, where flow and heat transfer through particle beds can force local conditions to be non-continuum due to the small length scales. The tool will be relevant to multiple applications that encounter ablation through porous media in low-pressure environments such as terminal high-altitude National Missile Defense vehicles."

This regolith particle flow induced by a spacecraft landing occurs in a combination of “extreme environments” that combine low gravity, little or no atmosphere, with rocket exhaust gas flow that is supersonic and partially rarefied, and unusual mechanical properties of the regolith. Of these environmental factors, characterizing the regolith granular material fluidic behavior and gas-granular interactions is the most complex and least developed. In the proposed effort an integrated project team consisting of CFD Research, University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins University will develop an integrated approach for developing a combined measurement and modeling methodology to further improve accuracy of the gas granular flow solvers used for analysis and design by NASA engineers. Targeted experiments will be conducted to analyze gas-particle flows in high-speed and low-speed dilute conditions on both monodisperse and polydisperse particulate mixtures. Crucial data for model validation such as particle velocity fluctuations, particle concentrations and bulk velocities will be obtained. Subsequently, model improvements will be made for both, Eulerian-Lagrangian and Eulerian two-fluid simulation approaches and improved capabilities demonstrated. Particular effort will be made toward advancing the granular phase constitutive relations the numerical framework relies upon for polydisperse compressible flows.","Potential NASA commercial applications include all Lunar and Mars lander development projects and missions landing on asteroids and other objects. Mars lander plume-surface analysis will be provided to propulsive Entry, Descent, Landing and Ascent systems integration teams. Lunar lander customers include small commercial landers and instrument payloads under the CLEPS program.

Future NASA missions to Moon and Mars require reduced weight in combustion chambers and nozzles so that overall mission payload fraction and cost can be improved. Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) nozzle extensions are a way to reduce weight and improve specific impulse because of the low density and high temperature capability of the material. CMC nozzles can help reduce component mass to 60% of current values. This proposal addresses one of the primary outstanding challenges in using CMC nozzle extensions for flight applications: sealing the interface between metal thrust chamber and CMC nozzle extension. In traditional, heavy engines, the junction between thrust chamber and nozzle extension is welded, but this is impossible for dissimilar materials. In the Phase I effort, PSI will develop a sealing geometry based on existing couplings and incorporating similar joint methodologies from other industries. The performance of the seal will be tested at the nozzle proof pressure, tested at firing temperature, and before and after simulated launch loads have been applied. PSI will design and manufacture surrogate nozzles to faithfully represent the nozzle geometry and the coupling. The nozzle surrogates will be machined, assembled, and tested at PSI during Phase I. PSI will deliver a manufacturing sample prototype and design data to NASA at the end of the Phase I effort, and a functional CMC nozzle extension with lightweight coupling at the end of a Phase II effort.","PSI’s program objective is to design, build, and test a metal-to-CMC coupling suitable for in-space rocket nozzles from 1,200 pounds thrust to 35,000 pounds thrust and greater. NASA applications include upper stage engines for Earth launch vehicles and descent and ascent for missions to Mars and Moon. The proposed technology can be used for sample return missions and rocket-based decelerators.","In-space rocket engines and nozzles are of high interest to several of PSI’s existing customers. These customers are involved in divert and attitude control systems (DACS) for exo-atmospheric vehicles, commercial space launch, reusable launch vehicles, and other rocket nozzle applications.

Research has shown that deep cratering will occur on Mars for human-class landers and that it might occur on the Moon for the very large landers planned by NASA for human missions from the Lunar Gateway, and for large landers on the soft rims of young craters or in permanently shadowed craters where the data indicate the soil is much less densified than at the Apollo sites.  It is vital to make progress observing, describing, and understanding the physics of erosion and scouring under a supersonic jet, and deep jet-induced fluidization cratering.  The physics of deep cratering are very complex and almost no progress has been made by prior researchers since this is a unique area of physics that occurs only for larger rockets landing on planetary bodies. Experimental work, proposed in this effort, is needed using actual rocket thrusters and regolith with adequate instrumentation, in addition to laboratory and low gravity experiments.

CMP-8 (CUA Mono-Propellant 8) is a non-detonable yet energetic COTS formulation that possesses many system-level advantages including lower cost (COTS propellant and non-refractory thruster construction), lower thermal load (<1000°C flame temp), low viscosity (comparable to water), and common materials compatibility (aluminum, stainless steels, and most elastomers).  The existing technology has achieved 187 s specific impulse at 160 mN thrust during demonstrated continuous firing times exceeding 10 minutes. CMP-8 has demonstrated a shelf life exceeding 1200 days (a storage test ongoing since 2015).  Phase I studies include preliminary hazard classification of CMP-X (a less energetic formulation allowed on air transport) to establish Insensitive Munitions (IM) characteristics and provide guidance for large scale storage and feed (i.e. critical diameters) as well as catalyst risk reduction studies and characterizations.  CMP-X is designed not for highest performance Isp, but as a monopropellant option for customers who can accept a modest 20% performance penalty (relative to AF-315E and LMP-103S) for the advantages of air transportability, considerably fewer range safety concerns, lower flame temperature resulting in considerably less thermal soakback into the spacecraft, and longer continuous thrust burns.  CMP-X retains the ability to scale in thrust magnitude and requires minimal catalyst bed warmup time.The primary Phase I technical objective is to produce a flight-like TRL 5 thruster head and improve the integrated system design in order to deliver an integrated TRL 6 CubeSat propulsion system with ACS by the end of Phase II. The estimated Phase II volumetric impulse of a 2U-sized MPUC deliverable is >1200 N-sec with a peak power draw of <5 W and 185 s specific impulse.","MPUC responds to goals in NASA’s Roadmap for In-Space Propulsion with a focus on long life and cost reduction both with common COTS construction materials. MPUC has demonstrated performance that will yield volumetric impulse levels above those of legacy hydrazine systems. Its lack of detonation and demonstrated storability makes it a prime candidate for missions where costs and logistics are dominated by system transportation and range safety concerns. Potential missions include orbit change, drag makeup, and deorbiting.","Potential MPUC system applications include drag makeup allowing extended-duration low altitude orbits, low Earth orbit raising, and/or deorbiting for micro/nanosatellites.

This system is designed to offer 1600 N•s in a 2U frame. The design calls for one central thruster that will provide 0.2 N of thrust. The resistojet thruster uses a patent-pending exothermic Warm Gas Generator (WGG) that decomposes from a single heating point once on-orbit. The gas is held at high pressure and released through a regulator and valve to supply consistent and controlled flow to the nozzle. Inside the nozzle chamber, the gas is heated to high temperatures (up to 1000° C) to increase efficiency. At these elevated temperatures the system can achieve an estimated specific impulse up to 175 s. The fuel for this warm-gas resistojet system is Azodicarbonamide (ADA). ADA comes in a powdered form and is Department of Transportation approved for shipping. It is most commonly used in plastics manufacturing and commercial baking. It is safe to handle and non-toxic. ADA undergoes an exothermic decomposition reaction when raised to a critical temperature. A rapid decomposition occurs at temperatures above 230° C. The resulting gas is a blend of N2, CO, CO2, and NH3. Once started, the reaction takes <1 second to propagate through the entirety of fuel in the tank. The warm gas produced has a specific impulse of 86 s with no additional heating. Increasing the temperature in a resistojet system will provide a specific impulse of 150-175 s depending on power input. Benchmark is targeting 15 W and 150 s for the initial design. This SBIR Project by Benchmark Space Systems will develop an efficient and benign chemical propulsion system for small satellites. The goal of the project will be to design and integrate the propulsion system into a CubeSat mission. Phase I will produce a benchtop model to characterize the system and design a prototype model to be built during Phase II.","This technology benefits many future NASA missions. Earth orbiters like CIRAS and IRIS can use the proposed system to reach target orbit when launched as a secondary payload, opening a wider range of launches that are lower cost or launch earlier. They can also use this system for lifetime extension, increasing chances for mission success and lowering average lifetime cost. Missions beyond Earth’s orbit - like Lunar Flashlight or INSPIRE- can use this technology for orbital maneuvers when escaping or approaching a target orbit.",Private and defense satellites also benefit from the proposed technology. Commercial can operate at lower costs by using Benchmark Space technology for lifetime extension. Defense missions can reduce risk by transitioning operations from large satellites to constellations.

If a CMOS Integrated Circuit (IC) latches-up, it can often be recovered if it is reset quickly. To protect space electronic circuits from latch-up problems, a radiation-hardened Latch-up Monitor IC is required to determine when any IC on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) latches-up and to reset that IC. There is an extremely limited range of solutions available to solve the latch-up problem today. We found only one radiation-tolerant latch-up current limiter device available from 3DPlus that is in a 15mm x 15mm x 12mm cube-like package and has a limited specification. It can monitor only four channels. There are also commercial current-limiting power distribution switches that are themselves susceptible to latching-up. An example of the latter is the Micrel MIC20XX that has been used in low-cost CubeSats. VORAGO Technologies propose to develop a radiation-hardened latch-up monitor IC. VORAGO Technologies has developed Intellectual Property (IP) blocks for an 8-channel analog-to-digital converter and a SPI interface that can be used as a base to design a radiation-hardened latch-up monitor IC.

These devices require robust latch-up monitoring and protection. The proposed IC offers this solution to NASA.,"Commercial aerospace companies have the same problem as NASA. Sometimes they have no option but to use COTS devices that are susceptible to space radiation effects and need to protect them.

The project will enable delivery of electronics that can operate in space for a prolonged time and without errors. The enhanced technology should encourage many firms to participate in recently announced lunar payload projects and for the Moon to Mars campaign. Almost any application that NASA desires to address, such as thermal management, energy storage, rad hard-high performance computing, cryogenic fluid management, various lunar sensors, solar arrays, and coordination of space vehicle swarms requires rad hard electronics able to withstand ionizing space radiation for a prolonged time. The premise behind this novel approach is to leverage in-house Micro-RDC expertise in radiation hardening to device design. Micro-RDC will develop and then lay out a set of test structures that will be tested for the total ionizing dose (TID) and single event upset (SEU) effects. Layout modification will be completed on elements prone to degradation transistors on already existing, commercially available processes (e.g. bulk 0.13um from Jazz) without any changes to the process itself. Once fabricated, test bars will be properly characterized under ionizing source and cryogenic temperatures, replicating circuits operating in space. Upon completion, Micro -RDC will deliver a set of rad-hard pcells with the same current-voltage (I-V) and other electrical characteristics found in standard cells, but with much higher resistance to adverse TID and SEU effects. Devices will be properly characterized and modeled, ready for low cost use in redesigns and new designs by end users and system integrators. To demonstrate the viability of the approach, Micro-RDC will redesign a test vehicle (micro-controller 8051 in Phase II) that will be re-tested for radiation hardness and robustness.","NASA will see a direct benefit from this project by having access to a radiation-hardened-by-design approach that will significantly lower expenses of new integrated circuits.

The results of the program will be made available to fabs creating multiple sources and competition capable of modifying standard cells to expand design kits for rad hard cells that will greatly benefit the end users.",Results of this program will show how to enhance the capabilities of older fabrication lines with depreciated equipment for rad hard applications.

While it is relatively easy to shield against non-ionizing RF and microwave radiation, shielding against higher energy ionizing radiation – gamma rays, protons, neutrons and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) – is much more challenging.  With longer missions to Jupiter or future manned missions and with the use of smaller spacecraft that cannot accommodate additional weight needed for shielding, the importance of lightweight shielding to NASA has increased.  Radiation shielding approaches that have been considered through prior work include fabricating spacecraft out of hydrogen-rich radiation absorbing and scattering plastics instead of aluminum, placing external liquid hydrogen fuel and internal supply water around astronauts as radiation absorbers, and creating strong electromagnetic fields to deflect the radiation.  To be effective, however, conventional shielding materials need to be thick and material thickness increases the total unwanted mass to be carried by a small satellite, and the amount of power required to create a deflection field would require significant fuel.  NanoSonic proposes to develop lightweight composites consisting of multiple layers of graded atomic number (Z-number) materials as effective ionizing radiation shields beyond Low Earth Orbit.  NanoSonic shall advance the Technology Readiness Level to 3 – 5 during Phase I.  The composites could be used as the structural shells and support members of small satellites so serve multiple purposes.  Preliminary research results with NanoSonic’s materials in the Department of Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences at Colorado State University, and at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, have shown that our materials significantly attenuate X-rays and gamma rays without secondary radiation, and structurally survive simulated 50-year exposure to solar energetic particles and GCR.","This program would develop a lightweight radiation shielding composite. We foresee integration with future spacecraft as a path to market our materials on a much larger scale. These radiation shielding composites offer enhanced safety and reliability for space structures as they include components for moderate protection against galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar energetic particles (SEP), and secondary neutrons. This radiation shielding methodology could represent a large market to improve virtually any existing spacecraft shielding needs.","Similar, multifunctional nanocomposite shielding materials are being developed for other applications by NanoSonic building on our Metal Rubber family of materials, in the 1) electronics, 2) aerospace and defense, and 3) biomedical engineering areas.

This is over and above the man-made debris generated as a result of launching these space objects and their density is increasing exponentially with time.  If nothing is done about this, the earth will eventually have its own Saturn ring if not a spherical shell of orbiting objects and debris. There is definitely a pressing need for an inexpensive and reliable method of de-orbiting satellites after their mission life has ended. We propose to carryout a for a passively deployable, lightweight, low-compaction ratio bolt-on de-orbit device for satellites.  The de-orbiter is packaged into a small bolt-on canister that gets attached to the spacecraft.  It stays in the packaged configuration until the end of the satellite mission at which time it is activated deploying the de-orbit element out of its canister, increasing the spacecraft drag area against the atmosphere.  For high low-earth orbit starting altitudes where the atmospheric density is extremely low, the de-orbiter drag sail is made to work like a solar sail capitalizing on the solar radiation pressure but in this case to decrease the satellites energy thereby lowering its altitude over time. It is pointed out that using this solar-sailing approach has practically unlimited delta v capability. The innovation in the proposed de-orbiter design is the use of a proprietary shape memory composite material for the structural elements of the de-orbiter.  It is foldable and packageable into a small stowed volume and deployment is passively achieved by simply releasing the stored strain energy in the packaged configuration.  Tests and measurements performed in the laboratory show that the material formulation we use achieves deployment to the memorized configuration even after the material has been in the folded state for years. When the solar sail mode is used, it can be used to extend the satellite lifetime.","NASA can use the drag sail as de-orbiter devices for satellites in low earth orbit.  And for higher starting altitudes where the atmosphere is extremely thin, the de-orbiter is made to work like a solar sail capitalizing on the solar radiation pressure but in this case to decrease the satellite energy to lower the satellite altitude over time. This approach has practically unlimited delta v capability.  In fact, the drag solar-sail configuration can be made to work in GEO orbit to place non functioning satellites in higher parking orbits.","The military and commercial sectors will find the de-orbiter design as an inexpensive addition to their payloads to enable de-orbiting their spacecrafts after mission life has ended.  When the solar-sail mode of the de-orbiter is turned on, the de-orbiter can be used to increase the satellite lifetime on orbit."

This technology represents a high-payoff technology using primarily atmospheric drag, but with the additional option for solar sail deorbiting from higher altitude orbits where atmospheric drag is negligible. The Phase I effort will focus on concept design, analyses, configuration trade off studies, and simulations for a CubeSail-D (Deorbit) design that can be integrated as a module on or into a larger small/nanosatellite.  Unique features of the CubeSail-D design are its absence of any sail support structure, and its ability to control the solar sail blade pitch from the end of the sail and therefore enable continuous deorbiting thrust from solar photon pressure, not just aerodynamic drag.  This capability of CubeSail-D becomes progressively more important at higher altitudes and is critical above 1000 km, and will also be important during times of minima in the solar sunspot cycle when atmospheric density drops and consequently drag effects decrease.  Further, the ability to pitch the blade during deorbit enables alteration of the amount of aerodynamic drag seen by a CubeSail-D equipped satellite and may provide enough control authority for targeted reentry.  The goal of Phase II would be delivery of a flight ready CubeSail-D demonstrator as either an add-on module or a self-contained CubeSat demonstrator.","The NASA Technology Roadmap calls for the development of Drag Sail Propulsion (TA 2.2.2.2). CubeSail-D provides a continuous effective thrust propulsion solution, providing enough potential Delta-V for deorbiting from LEO beyond the capabilities of like-sized chemical/electric propulsion options. A low-mass, low-cost deorbit capability would be very attractive for many or most of NASA LEO satellites, especially for those above altitudes of 680 km where the atmospheric density is low enough that natural decay lifetimes for reentry are >25 years.","Prior to launch, all Earth-orbiting spacecraft are required to have a concept of operations including a plan for when they reach the end of their useful life that they will be deorbited or moved to an orbit that poses no risk to other spacecraft.  Thus, all government, industry, or academia satellites are potential customers for the CubeSail-D (Deorbit) deorbiting module."

While relatively simple drag sail devices, such as Nanosail-D2 and Surrey’s InflateSail have been shown to be effective in reducing deorbit times to within an acceptable range, these sails have not been capable of orbital maneuvering to allow for controlled, targeted re-entry.  Being able to actively change orbital inclination and/or throttle drag area to control re-entry location could be a game-changing capability.  In response to NASA’s desire for such a capability, Roccor proposes to develop the Sail Trimming ActuatoR for Targeted Reentry (STARTR) system.  This simple, small and lightweight system can be used to guide the spacecraft to a known reentry point.  The key enabling technology for STARTR is a gimballed boom that controls the relationship between a planar drag sail’s center-of-pressure (CP) and center-of-gravity (CG) to induce attitude control torques large enough for orbit changing maneuvers.  Furthermore, Roccor envisions a retractable sail membrane that can be used to throttle the effective drag area up or down to further fine-tune reentry time and location.  The system is designed to easily scale for a given spacecraft mass and size.  The proposed Phase I effort will involve the conceptual development of the STARTR system, including system modeling and analysis for stability (aero- and gravity gradient), orbital trajectory manipulation and drag throttling.","The proposed STARTR system could be applied to spacecraft end-of-life deorbiting, especially in situations where there is a concern over on-orbit collisions with other objects, or human safety on the ground, or if there is a desire for object retrieval in a known location after reentry.  Similarly, the STARTR device could be used for targeted Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) operations for planetary science missions.  And finally, the STARTR technology could also be utilized to steer a solar sail.","With regulatory bodies such as the FCC becoming more stringent about spacecraft deorbit requirements, the STARTR technology is envisioned to be an excellent candidate drag sail technology for use on commercial CubeSats or SmallSats."

Cornerstone Research Group, Inc. (CRG) proposes to deliver greater affordability and performance for medium to large composite structures for small launch vehicles using low pressure assisted composite molding. The major benefits are derived from the use of lower cost materials associated with liquid molding, while adding a small back pressure during cure using less intensive infrastructure. The use of unique low pressure methods for curing prepreg composites has been demonstrated by others.  The use of low pressure processing with liquid molding is a logical extension of the technology. The resulting proposed process, while taking advantage of the cost benefits of traditional liquid molding, also leads to higher fiber volume and the potential of more integrated structures, which in turn leads to higher performance similar to autoclave cured composites while reducing the capital costs associated with an autoclave. Processing in this manner will maintain compatibility with existing qualified resins and reinforcements, and enable more mass-efficient composite structures.",,

Having a modular hybrid rocket motor will allow bluShift and other organizations to rapidly develop various launch vehicles for a micro satellite (CubeSat) launch fleet. There are two innovative fundamental ideas behind bluShift’s MAREVL: Modularity and Hybrid Rocket Motor Technology. By only perfecting and using a single simple modular motor bluShift will lower development costs (only one motor is designed for a whole class of vehicles), lower manufacturing costs (only one set of parts that are made in a higher quantity), increase adaptability by making developing new vehicles easier, increase launch cadence by building an inventory of building blocks. Hybrid rocket motors have several advantages that made bluShift choose them for the MAREVL. Simpler: Compared to liquid engines hybrids only have one liquid system to handle (the oxidizer) therefore there is half as much weight and complexity from plumbing and valving. Safer: Hybrid rocket motors are safer than most liquid and solid propellant motors. The fuel is inert and will not pose hazardous risks during storage or handling; the nitrous oxide bluShift is using is safer than liquid oxygen. Throttle Capability: Unlike solid propellant motors, hybrids can be throttled to optimize performance, and can throttle individually in a cluster to eliminate the need for an entire gimbaling system. Over the last 5 years bluShift has been developing a very specific hybrid rocket motor that has some particular advantages. Carbon Neutral: The proprietary hybrid fuel bluShift has been testing is 100% bio-derived, it is carbon neutral and will not contribute to a net gain in greenhouse gases. Higher Fuel Regression Rates: The wax-based fuel bluShift uses has a high enough regression rate that fuel grains can be left with a simple single fuel port, increasing simplicity and lowering waste.","bluShift Aerospace, Inc. will position its business as a potential launch service provider for the NASA Launch Services Program under the Venture Class Launch Services Contract.

The turbopump has a unique feature in that it has an integral electric generator used to generate electricity and power an external fuel pump. By using hydrogen peroxide decomposed over a catalyst pack only one fluid can be used to drive the turbine. Typically, a turbopump combusts a fuel and an oxidizer  in a gas generator to generate the gases to drive the turbine. This requires two sets of feed lines (one for fuel and one for oxidizer) and careful mixture ration control so that the two combust at a ratio that does not yield such a high temperature that may destroy the turbine. If the mixture ratio is too close to the stoichiomentric ratio it will be hot enough to damage the turbine. If it is too far away from the stoiciometric ratio it may not generate the required gases to drive the turbine or even cease combustion (flame out). This problem does not exist with hydrogen peroxide as its maximum decomposition temperature is about half that of modern turbojet engines. Thus, no exotic materials need to be used for the turbine. The built in electric generator generates electricity to power an external fuel pump. This allows the fuel pump to be placed anywhere on the rocket engine that is desired and does not necessitate mounting it onto the turbopump itself. this greatly simplifies the plumbing of a rocket engine. It also allows the oxidizer and fuel pump to have different speeds so that the engine can change its mixture ratio in flight. This turbopump is designed to be used with a rocket engine burning hydrogen peroxide and kerosene as a fuel. This allows for a relatively simple yet fairly high performing rocket engine. The specific impulse and density are similar to the hydrazine/unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide propellants used by the Titan II, III and IV launch vehicles with great success.","This turbopump could be used on rocket engines ideal for cost effective launch vehicles. Due to its use of non-toxic, non-cryogenic propellants it can stand by and be available to launch quickly. Since the system would be cheaper to operate many missions that currently cannot be justified could be possible. For example, sending inspector spacecraft to look at damaged operating satellites is currently not justifiable since building an entirely new spacecraft is more cost effective.","For commercial operators a launch vehicle using this technology would both reduce cost and increase reliability. Due to its simplicity it could reduce wait times. This means that many commercial endeavors, like nano-sats and constellation maintenance, would become potentially profitable. Current launch systems are just too expensive to make these business models work."

Specifically, this program will focus on carbon-fiber reinforced carbon (C/C) materials with oxidation resistance provided via reactive melt infiltration (RMI) with Group IV A/B metals, such as silicon, zirconium, and hafnium. This material system has been successfully demonstrated over extended durations in high-temperature oxidizing liquid propellant environments, but currently, there is a lack of understanding regarding how this material can be optimally processed. To date, manufacturers have implemented a prototyping approach; many of the practices employed have, in some way, been derived from both experience and tribal knowledge. While this approach has been sufficient for the manufacture of prototype hardware, there exists a need for a better understanding of how the material behaves during processing. A program emphasizing multi-scale modeling and simulation of these materials through manufacturing  and operational environments will seek to establish a relationship between a variety of process parameters and the quality of the resulting composite material. A successful Phase I program will establish the feasibility of using the developed CMC material in an environment relevant to small launch vehicle providers. The development of these high strength-to-weight ratio materials is critical in reducing launch costs for small spacecraft.","The government and commercial launch contractors with whom NASA engages are motivated to explore higher performance nozzle and throat materials for a wide range of boost and reaction control applications. The Phase I team has elected to pursue a low cost fabrication approach to eliminate the cost-related barriers to entry for using UHT composite materials. As a route for potentially deep cost reductions in UHT materials manufacturing, the solution is ideal for insertion into boost nozzle and other liquid rocket engine component applications.","The effort proposed would address a growing need in the hypersonics community for high-temperature capable, oxidation resistant C/C. Using the models developed, a C/C can be optimally infiltrated to form a variety of refractory carbide materials in a rapid, low-cost manner.

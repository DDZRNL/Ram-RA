15-2 H12.01-9633,NNX15CC42P,Measurements of Net Ocular Blood Flow,Optical System for Monitoring Net Occular Blood Flow,"Physical Sciences, Inc.","20 New England Business Center, Andover, MA 01810 - 1077",(978) 689-0003,Mircea Mujat,mujat@psicorp.com,"20 New England Business Center, Andover, MA 01810 - 1077",(978) 738-8254,B. David Green,green@psicorp.com,"20 New England Business Center, Andover, MA 01810 - 1077",(978) 689-0003,3,6,"Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a novel ophthalmic imaging platform for the characterization and monitoring of visual impairment observed in long-duration space flights. This platform will combine non-invasive measurement of retina/choroid structure and ocular blood flow based on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and wide-field semi-quantitative global flow visualization using Line-scanning Doppler Flowmetry (LSDF). During Phase II a system will be fabricated utilizing the most deeply penetrating waveband around 1060 nm which is especially critical for choroidal imaging. Therefore, the PSI's instrument will address the need for accurate 3D measurement of posterior segment layer thicknesses and volumes, and vascular (retinal and choroidal) topology and flow quantification. This novel imaging platform will enable Phase II imaging studies in animals and human subjects in normal and fluid-shift models of micro-gravity conditions, which are in line with the International Space Station (ISS) mission. Prior PSI experience in developing advanced ophthalmic imaging systems and space-qualified hardware will be leveraged to ensure the successful outcome of this important R&D program.","This technology addresses a clear need for studying and quantifying image-based ocular biomarkers that can be used to assess the health status of astronauts. As already known, changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) and correlated effects on vision encountered in space exploration missions, collectively referred to as Visual Impairment and Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome, have created the need for advanced imaging modalities to monitor these effects, pre  and post flight, and potentially on board the International Space Station (ISS). Investigations of VIIP phenomena and its potentially permanent effects have elevated it to high priority gap and operational need status. Ocular functional and structural alterations including reduction of near visual acuity, signs of several degrees of optic disc edema, globe flattening with hyperopic shift, choroidal folds and cotton wool spots have been experienced by astronauts involved in long-duration space travels. The etiology of these findings is unknown, however, it has been observed that these anatomical changes affect retinal physiology and may also cause glaucoma-like loss of neurons or retinal degeneration during very long-duration flight such as for a Mars mission. The response to fluid shift with edematous changes in the optic nerve head (ONH), retinal and choroidal vessels and possibly neurons of various types, and nerve fiber bundles may constitute a long-term visual impairment risk.","This technology has multiple potential uses in clinical research and healthcare. Understanding normal retinal functions and its alterations is a very active research area. The retina is among the most highly vascularized and metabolically active tissues in the body. It represents the only part of the central nervous system where capillary blood flow is visible and can be measured non-invasively. Like the central nervous system it is susceptible to ischemic (insufficient blood flow) injury. Degenerative neurovascular diseases (e.g., diabetic retinopathy) of the eye often have either hemodynamic consequences or causes, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. In addition to diseases there are other causes that can disturb the hemodynamic activity of the retina. Little is known about the ocular and cerebral blood flow during exposure to increasingly hypoxic conditions (insufficient oxygen supply) or hypercapnia (too much CO2). Blood flow alterations occur under the influence of prolonged hypoxia. There is a close correlation between the regulation of blood supply to the brain and to the retina, due to similar vascular regulatory processes. The auto-regulation of blood flow in the eye is clearly exquisitely sensitive to many neurovascular and metabolic signaling systems. An advanced diagnostic imaging system which can accurately track multiple anatomical and physiological changes in the eye over time is therefore fundamental to understanding and mitigating these effects.",Display; Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing,Measurements of Net Ocular Blood Flow   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

While ~100 We-class radioisotope power sources continue to be in demand, new higher power electric generators (≥500 We) will enable, and enhance, numerous robotic space applications and are ideally suited for upcoming Discovery- through Flagship-class missions.  These ≥500 We generators will require both increased source power and increased conversion efficiencies.  State-of-the-art thermoelectric generators, for instance, achieve ~7% efficiency, and recent laboratory results are paving a route toward ~15% efficiency. Alternatively, promising results from Lee et al1 and other groups have shown that thermionic thermal-to-electric (TTEC) generators are capable of achieving high conversion efficiency (>25%) at temperatures ≥1200 �C by leveraging modern microfabrication techniques.  An additional benefit is that the high-quality �waste heat� from these thermionic systems is rejected at ~800 �C, which opens the door to its use as a topping stage for more traditional converters, including thermoelectrics, dramatically raising the ceiling on total system conversion efficiency. To further advance NASA�s high-power solid-state thermal-to-electric conversion capabilities, Nanohmics Inc., working in collaboration with The Boeing Company (Huntington Beach, CA) and Sandia National Labs� Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) proposes to demonstrate a high-efficiency thermionic thermal-to-electric converter (TTEC) module based on nanostructured, high survivability emission materials. TTEC realization will open up new opportunities for deep space planetary science missions, and future manned spaceflight voyages that are no longer tethered to the sun by photovoltaics.","Nanohmics Inc. is developing a novel high efficiency Thermionic Thermal-to-Electric Converter (TTEC) product that uses innovative nanostructured low-work-function emitters capable of high current thermionic electron emission. The primary NASA application of this innovation is for space craft power systems.  Within NASA, two key potential customers are the Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) program and the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC). The target application of the TTEC are high power (500 We class or greater) power systems, and specifically RPSs.  RPS systems such as Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) would benefit greatly if the TTEC technology is proven to have higher efficiency and low power degradation rates.  Currently, RTGs are used by NASA for deep space missions where solar cell power systems are not practical.   If the TTEC can be demonstrated to operate at the same temperature and efficiency as the thermoelectric devices used in RTGs, it has the potential of being a better choice for radioisotope power generation systems on future spacecraft. At the higher end of power generation requirements such as manned mission in the ~ 2025-2030 timeframe, thermionics may reduce Mars round-trip mission times from two to three years, to less than one year. A high temperature thermionic device could be used to help realize this goal using fission energy as the power source.","In addition to NASA space power systems, The TTEC could be used as a novel power system for future U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force hypersonic vehicles. Additionally, two key markets that present large commercial opportunities are microwave vacuum electronics, and combined cycle power generation.  Combined power systems, sometime referred to as combined heat and power (CHP), can generate electricity from the waste heat not used when burning fossil fuels to generate electricity.  There is significant interest in developing new thermionics technologies for combined cycle and CHP because of the opportunity to greatly improve the efficiency of these systems. The combined power systems and CHP markets provide a considerable emerging commercial opportunity and is predicted to reach $3.5 billion by 2019 and grow at a considerable rate (CAGR of 20.2%) as by 50% of the U.S. power production is expected to come from natural gas-fired combined cycle plants by 2038. Likewise, microwave vacuum electronics continue to be used for high power radars, radio, and other applications across the military, medical, and space exploration communications.  There are over 200,000 vacuum electronic devices used by the DoD alone, and the Navy expects them to be used in radar and electronic warfare systems for many decades to come. Because of their continued use within DoD and other areas, the market for these devices was estimated to be greater than $1 billion for 2015.",Conversion,Solid-State Thermal-to-Electric Power Generation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The work will address the following limitations of most commercially available FMS: they have limited advanced features; are specific to a single aircraft type; and cannot be readily modified by researchers. The proposed research will identify and extend advanced FMS features for the simulation evaluation of 4DTBO concepts in different phases of flight, based on the feasibility demonstration during Phase I work. Some of proposed feature include (i) advanced 4D guidance modes such as Required Time of Arrival (RTA), 4DFMS, and Interval Management (IM), (ii) high-fidelity wind modeling and wind update capability for improved predictability, (iii) trajectory negotiation, (iv) optimal 4D trajectory planning. Phase II work will develop a generic FMS interface to NASA's Multi-Aircraft Control System (MACS) to enable the evaluation of FMS modules from multiple vendors in 4DTBO simulations. The proposed FMS platform and the generic FMS interface will allow the users to deploy a wide array of autonomy enabling FMS features through a Graphical User Interface. All the algorithms and software developed under this research will be delivered to NASA at the end of the project.","The FMS platform developed under the proposed research is an enabling technology for autonomicity (or self-management) - based architectures for the entirety, or parts, of the NextGen airspace operations.

Compared to current radio-frequency (RF) space communications, DSOC will provide 10- to 100-times more data returns for future advanced instruments, live high-definition video, telepresence, and human exploration beyond cislunar space. To be accepted operationally, the optical link must provide substantially greater data rates/data-return volumes than equivalent mass and power RF systems�and at lower cost per bit. Therefore, to prepare for these deep-space missions, substantial enhancement of the current NASA telecom-link capacity is needed. To satisfy NASA�s DSOC needs, a scalable high-precision (≤ 100 ps), high-throughput (> 100 Gbps) high-channel-count (≥ 256) time-to-digital advanced processor (HiTAP) architecture will be developed for use in single-photon-counting free-space optical communications systems and test beds.

NASA�s Space Communications and Navigation program office identified optical communications as an important technology for NASA missions, enabling enhanced volume and quality of data to be returned from the farthest reaches of space in preparation for future human deep-space exploration missions. Although several missions have validated optical communications from low-Earth and geostationary orbit, the unique challenges of deep-space optical links still require separate risk-retiring technology demonstrations before implementing inner-orbit communication. Many other NASA applications benefit from the innovation, such as reading out individual pixels of APD arrays, including single-photon avalanche-photodiode detectors and sensor signal-processing nodes.

Inc. proposes to advance the maturity of an innovative Spacecraft on Umbilical Line (SOUL) System suitable for a wide variety of applications of interest to NASA, DoD and commercial missions.  SOUL is a small (<10kg) robotic, self-propelled, self-navigating, autonomous vehicle equipped with a tool (e.g. gripper, light, camera etc.).  The SOUL vehicle/robot is attached via the umbilical line to a larger host spacecraft that stows it in a marsupial-like manner and communicates with ground.  The umbilical delivers power and commands to SOUL from the host spacecraft.  Conceptually, the SOUL is a tool on the end of tens of meters long robotic arm with infinite degrees of freedom (flexible umbilical) that can access locations unreachable by conventional robotic arms.  The initial purpose of the USAF and Navy funded SOUL development was removal of large space debris (1000kg class).  Under this program, the development of the SOUL vehicle was extremely successful.  The SOUL, tested on a air table, autonomously recognized simulated debris, estimated its pose relative to the target (fusing visible, IR images and IMU information), planned a path to the debris and executed the path and the touched the target with minimal momentum transfer.  In Phase 1 of the present program, Busek designed, build and tested a winch that is the key part of the SOUL deployment and retrieval system, panning out or reeling in the umbilical line.  In the proposed Phase 2 effort Busek will build the entire SOUL system consisting of the SOUL vehicle, umbilical, the Deployment/Retrieval system and the Command Module.  The entire system will be housed for launch in a 6U CubeSat deployer which will also stow SOUL when inactive.  Demonstration of the integrated system including the 6U deployer will be performed on the air table.  The ultimate goal is to make a flight worthy system and demonstrate it on the ISS.  Flight readiness will be achieved by qualifying program on the Phase 2 hardware.","Possible NASA applications include: 1) Inspection of ISS external systems reducing requirement for costly and dangerous manned EVAs.  2) Inspection of heat shield on reentry vehicles to prevent disasters such as Columbia.  Integrating SOUL into such vehicles for routine use prior to re-entry would greatly increase the crew safety; 3) Collect small samples from asteroid/comet surface without landing the larger mother ship/host.  If Philae was on an umbilical line or if the harpoons were on an umbilical, the Rosetta mission would have been greater success; 4) Create large deployable space system such as large antennas/apertures by coupling multiple satellites using the umbilical line (e.g. rotating formation for stability or artificial gravity); 5) Enhance manned the EVA capability: a) The SOUL robot could carry lights, bring tools, spare consumables (e.g. air tank) to the EVA astronaut working on the ISS or any other future ship; b) The SOUL robot could provide real time video of EVA activity from vantage points unreachable by either other astronauts or conventional robotic arms; c) The SOUL robot could provide auxiliary heat management system or even water vapor capture system reducing weight and power requirements for the EVA suit; d) The SOUL-like umbilical line could carry power and fiber optics comm link reducing reliance on EVA suit batteries while the fiber optics can relay high resolution video from the EVA suit camera.","Many of the NASA and non-NASA applications overlap and some were listed above.  Purely commercial applications are also numerous centering on the commercial GEO sat.  Examples include: 1) Self-inspection leading to on-orbit servicing/repair of host spacecraft.   This of particular interest to GEO Com sat owners/primes during deployment of appendages, anomaly diagnostic and aging assessment; 2) Inspection of other spacecraft with development proceeding to on-orbit servicing/repair and even refueling (when the umbilical contains a propellant transfer tube); 3) Autonomous operations enabling on-orbit assembly and repurposing as envisioned by DARPA�s Phoenix Program; 4) Capture of large debris which could then be towed to disposal orbit by the larger host vehicle,  Small SOUL mass decreases the danger of additional debris produced by inadvertent collisions due to SOUL low momentum; 5) Function as a long boom with sensors on the end, (e.g. Langmuir probes, magnetometers etc.) enabling better measurements via greater distance from the large host vehicle causing less disturbance to local plasma/environment; 6) Assist in space situational awareness by sensing RF, presence of effluent molecules some distance away from the host etc.; 7) Calibrate RF/radar antennas by measuring near-field pattern by flying the SOUL vehicle with the appropriate sensors in front of the antenna/aperture.","Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Image Processing; Perception/Vision; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Tools/EVA Tools","Human Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystem, Manipulation Subsystem, and Human System Interaction   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To begin, we selected two example aircraft power systems and developed dynamic models for those systems within the DyMonDS framework.  Next, we derived optimized sets of control set points for the power systems.  Each set of set points constituted an optimized allocation of resources under an assumed aircraft operating condition.  A separate set of control set points was derived for each assumed operating condition.  To do so the selected aircraft electric power systems were first mapped into equivalent terrestrial power systems. The NETSS optimization software for terrestrial electric power systems was then applied to optimize the aircraft power systems.  Finally, we developed and stabilizing controllers for electric power system operation around each set point set.  To do so, critical, and potentially unstable, aircraft electric power system dynamics were first identified for closed-loop control.  Finally, the required controllers were designed and simulated to show that they indeed stabilized the dynamics around the prescribed set points. All accomplishments were greatly facilitated by the DyMonDS framework.","The design and power-electronic control of individual aircraft energy system components is well understood today. Less consideration has been given to integrating these components into electric power systems that operate in adaptive conditions-driven ways to ensure fault-tolerance, stability and efficiency. The DYMONDS framework developed here directly addresses this systems-thinking need.  It introduces a multi-layered interactive approach to nonlinear power-electronically-switched control of AC-DC and DC-AC converters so the desired power is provided in transiently stable ways in response to varying aircraft situations. The approach can be extended to controlling electric power systems for single vehicle and future multi-vehicle manned deep-space missions.","The non-NASA commercial applications primarily concern the operation of terrestrial electric power systems such as utility systems, �smart� grids and micro-grids. The proposed DYMONDS framework enables a significantly new approach to the modeling and control of future electric power systems. These systems in particular will require the systematic integration of diverse energy storage and intermittent resources, which is directly addressed by the DYMONDS framework. For example, in parts of the Texas power grid today, wind power plants involving doubly-fed induction generators connected via a weak power-electronically controlled transmission line have experienced oscillations. Advanced digital control is required to prevent the oscillations, and such controls could be naturally developed within the DYMONDS framework. It is our belief that pursuing the modeling and control of complex NASA energy systems will contribute greatly to the process of modeling and controlling future terrestrial electric power systems. In this way the results of our Phase I project have the potential for major non-NASA impact as well.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Distribution/Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)",Low Emissions Propulsion and Power   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

A number of such modules can be connected together into several possible convertor layouts to scale power, achieve system redundancy and cancel vibration forces. This modular approach provides the system designer with unique packaging options not available with conventional stirling convertors. Our primary Phase II focus will be to build and test this core module within a simple three-module convertor configuration.The part count per module is low and the design is amenable to mass production manufacturing methods. An intrinsic feature within the thermodynamic circuit prevents catastrophic piston over-stroke in the event the electrical load is interrupted. A potentially transformational passive reciprocating hydrodynamic gas bearing suspends the moving piston within its cylinder, eliminating wear and providing a highly effective piston seal. An optional hydrodynamic spin bearing system is available as a backup.","Space Power Generation - The proposed innovation has the potential to support space power generation applications in the 75-500 W electrical power range using thermal input from one or more radioisotope heat sources, with waste heat radiated to space. Overall conversion efficiency is projected to be around 31% with a 640C heat source and 60C radiator. Other heat source/sink options and temperatures are possible depending on convertor efficiency requirements.  Cooling - The convertor is a reversible heat engine and can be run backwards to produce cooling in the cryogenic temperature range (50-100 K) from electrical input. By introducing staging lower temperatures are possible. NASA cooling applications include direct cooling of space sensors, vapor re-liquefaction for zero-boiloff fluid storage or cooling superconducting magnetic bearings in support of flywheel energy storage systems.","Our convertor has the potential to be a lower-cost alternative to other Stirling machines and might find application as a generator using natural gas or renewable biofuels. The redundant convertor configurations could be beneficial for terrestrial remote power applications requiring high reliability (e.g. navigation or communications equipment in off-grid areas).Operated as a cryocooler, the convertor could cool high-temperature superconducting magnetic bearings in industrial spindles and motors. The ability to cool a central load and reject heat at the periphery is ideal for zero-boiloff re-condensation of liquid nitrogen, volatile fuels and other substances.The core hydrodynamic bearing technology could be applied to linear free-piston compressors for domestic refrigeration.

During this program, United Silicon Carbide will extend the capability of its SiC JFET integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technology to produce electronics compatible with such extreme environments. Silicon Carbide (SiC) junction field effect (JFET) based electronics are ideal for these environments due to their radiation tolerance and their high performance and reliability over an extremely wide operating temperature range. SiC electronics can be used in applications ranging from low power, low noise mixed signal electronics for precision actuator control, sensor interfaces, and guidance and navigation electronics to power electronics for power management and distribution and power processing units. SiC based electronics will have longer storage and operating lifetimes when compared to existing silicon electronics. Use of SiC integrated circuits will also lower system mass, volume, and power by reducing or eliminating the need for cooling and radiation shielding.In Phase I, we showed the feasibility of our approach by measuring SiC JFET IC device characteristics at 500 �C; performing a 500 hour, 500 �C reliability test; and using TCAD simulations to further explore the devices behavior at high temperature and when subjected to radiation. In Phase II, we will fully develop the extreme environment capable SiC IC fabrication technology and use it to fabricate an integrated circuit which will be characterized at 500 �C and before and after radiation exposure.

The commercially viable, high temperature capable electronics technology developed in this program will fill this need leading to new research and ultimately a new generation of engine controls for improved aircraft performance and efficiency.","Extreme environment electronics also have applications in the areas of defense, aerospace, scientific research, energy exploration, and industrial controls. DoD needs radiation tolerant electronics for space and missile defense applications and high temperature electronics for electronic aircraft controls being developed to replace hydraulic systems. Distributed engine control developments enabled by SiC electronics have direct applicability in commercial jet engines where there is a continual push for increased fuel efficiency. Scientific applications include nuclear physics research and instrumentation for nuclear facilities. High temperature electronics are needed for improved downhole tools for geothermal energy exploration, development, and production. There is also a well-established market for extreme temperature pressure sensors in which SiC electronics can increase performance by buffering the sensor signal within the high temperature environment.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Conversion; Distribution/Management; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)",Extreme Environments Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

New technologies are needed for advanced in-space propulsion systems to support exploration, reduce travel time, reduce acquisition costs and reduce operational costs. The goal is a breakthrough in cost and reliability for a wide range of payload sizes and types supporting future orbital flight vehicles.  Lower cost and reliable space access will provide significant benefits to civil space (human and robotic exploration beyond Earth as well as Earth science), to commercial industry, to educational institutions, for support to the International Space Station National Laboratory, and to national security.  NASA?s Technology Roadmaps call Zero Boil Off storage of cryogenic propellants for long duration missions? the #2 ranked technical challenge for future NASA missions, and new technologies are necessary for improved cryogenic propellant storage and transfer to support NASA's exploration goals.  Heat leak through tank mounts such as struts and skirts is an increasingly large part of the total heat flow into modern, well insulated tanks. Specifically, NASA has a high priority for simple mass efficient techniques for vapor cooling of structural skirts (aluminum, stainless, or composites) on large upper stages containing liquid hydrogen and liquid methane (can include hydrogen catalyst).  Improved cryogenic insulation that can incorporate vapor cooling to reduce the heat flux through struts and skirts would benefit cryogenic fluid management, and help towards achieving zero boil off.Vapor Cooled Structure MLI (VCSMLI) is a novel system that uses discrete spacers to create a sealed vapor layer within IMLI for lightweight, efficient vapor cooling of tank skirts. In the Phase I program, VCSMLI was modeled, designed, fabricated, installed on a tank skirt and its thermal performance measured.  VCSMLI provided a 41% reduction in total system heat flux reaching TRL 4.","This Phase II program would continue VCSMLI development and increase technology maturity to TRL 5 - 6.  Improved cryogenic insulation that can incorporate vapor cooling to reduce the heat flux through struts and skirts would benefit overall cryogenic fluid management, and help towards achieving zero boil off.  Any cryogenic launch vehicle could benefit from VCSMLI.  The Atlas V family uses the Centaur cryogenic upper stage, with LOX and LH2 tanks with support skirts external sidewalls, such that heat gain and cryopropellant loses are substantial during launch ascent and on-orbit. The Delta IV cryogenic upper stage LOX and LH2 tanks are contained within the Interstage and Payload Fairing, but still have little thermal insulation. Improvements to the cryogenic insulation of the Centaur and Delta Cryogenic Second Stage could add additional capabilities to these launch vehicles. Reducing heat load even further with vapor cooling might be a future enhancement to these launch vehicle families.VCSMLI could help meet cryogenic fluid management goals, reducing propellant boiloff and enhancing the capabilities of current space transportation systems as well as future systems (LH2 storage for SLS for chemical propulsion and for future Nuclear Thermal Propulsion vehicles).","Several aerospace prime contractors have interest in Quest insulation. Vapor cooling of support structures could reduce upper stage cryopropellant boiloff, increasing payload capacity for commercial missions with long coasts.  High performance VCSMLI  could be used or new vehicles such as Vulcan and SLS.Advances in thermal insulation have relevance to terrestrial commercial applications. Reducing thermal conductivity and heat leak impact heating and cooling industrial processes and energy efficiency. Quest has a current grant from the State of Colorado's Advanced Industry Accelerator program, which is funding prototype development of our commercial grade superinsulation for appliance use.IMLI and derivatives might be able to provide improved thermal insulation for storage and preservation of cryogens for a wide variety of industrial uses, such as insulation for dewars for LHe, LH2, LN2 and LOX, for commercial, medical, industrial and research uses. Large LNG tanks could benefit from improved thermal insulation.  Quest has had conversations with VJP suppliers to the LNG industry about our advanced Wrapped MLI.  For industrial cold transfer piping, Quest Wrapped MLI has 12X lower heat leak than spiral wrapped MLI, and may enable next generation high performance vacuum jacketed pipe insulation with significantly lower heat leak.Quest high performance insulation has many opportunities for green energy savings and thin insulation panels.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fuels/Propellants; Passive Systems,Cryogenic Fluid Management for In-Space Transportation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposal is in response to Subtopic A1.08 Ground Testing and Measurement Technologies, whereby the primary objective is ""to develop innovative tools and technologies that enhance testing and measurement capabilities."" More specifically, the proposed innovation addresses critically unmet measurement needs of the Commercial Supersonics Technology (CST) Project of the NASA Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP). The proposed innovation is a highly miniaturized, dynamic piezoelectric pressure sensor array with sub-mm spacing for high bandwidth, high spatial resolution measurements of cross-flow transition. High-spatial resolution pressure sensors with sub-mm spacing provide a much-needed capability that does not currently exist among state-of-the-art offerings, enabling dynamic wall pressure measurement and identification of traveling and standing cross-flow modes. The proposed concept extends the basic design to high bandwidth, high-spatial resolution, dynamic pressure sensing via reduction in sensor geometry and integration of multiple sensors arrayed on a single chip. The end result is a miniaturized, highly-compact array of dynamic pressure sensors with backside contacts to enable a truly flush-mounted, smooth interface for flow measurement applications.","External customers for dynamic pressure measurements include universities and industry aircraft manufacturers such as the Boeing Company. Particularly, those customers seeking or currently designing next generation, civilian or defense supersonic aircraft have an identical unmet measurement need as NASA Langley. Furthermore, in-flight flow-control (a rapidly growing area of research and development) requires compact accurate measurements of key fluid dynamic parameters such as wall shear stress and dynamic wall pressure. This is a potentially larger volume market with relatively high ASP but will require more development time to meet the tighter space constraints, tougher operating conditions and unique target specifications that such an application entails.","The proposed instrumentation technology has the potential to be transportable across multiple NASA facility classes as well as implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities. The target market is the research-grade instrumentation and measurement shear stress sensors market for the aerospace research and development industry. The target application for entry into NASA Aeronautics Test Program is as ground test wind-tunnel instrumentation for turbulent skin friction measurements and separation detection and control. cross-flow boundary layer transition measurements for swept wing models, such as is performed at NASA Langley. These measurements are critical to the proper design of swept wing geometry for the next generation of civilian supersonic aircraft. The design and operating conditions of these aircraft expose the vehicle to cross-flow instabilities that complicate the prediction and control of laminar flow and transition to turbulence. Accurate measurement of these cross-flow instability modes is not currently possible with existing technologies due to limited spatial resolution and sensor spacing constraints. Our proposed technology surmounts the constraints of existing technologies, enabling the required sensor spacing and resolution, thereby directly addressing the previously unmet need.","Aerodynamics; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Pressure & Vacuum Systems",Ground Testing and Measurement Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Area-I has continued this tradition in its development of the Resource allocation for Multi-Agent Planning, or ReMAP, guidance and navigation system for unmanned aircraft. The ReMAP system, whose core function is to significantly reduce operator workload by providing mission-driven autonomy to unmanned aircraft in single- and multi-agent scenarios, was proven through flight testing during the Phase I program. The work proposed will further mature the ReMAP technology and core capabilities, resulting in continued flight-based evaluations on Area-I aircraft. Core capabilities provided by the ReMAP system include: 1) A small, lightweight, inexpensive avionics package that provides real-time mission-driven guidance capabilities to unmanned air vehicles 2) A system architecture that is platform and autopilot agnostic and can therefore be utilized by a wide array of aircraft with varying performance levels 3) A multi-agent planning and control algorithm to allow multiple aircraft to coordinate and thereby maximize mission capabilities and results 4) Aircraft and obstacle avoidance capabilities, including ADS-B In integration, providing autonomous avoidance maneuvers or operator warnings 5) A mission planning interface to provide situational awareness and mission management to operators, usable as a stand-alone system or integrated with existing mission planning tools such as NASA's Airborne Science Mission Tools Suite","The ReMAP system provides a unique ability to enhance two of NASA's mission directorates: the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) and the Science Mission Directorate (SMD). The system improves the goals of the ARMD through the development of a system that promotes the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System (NAS) and is in line with the goals of the NextGen system. The majority of others'work performed in multi-agent systems has been largely academic and often solves very specific or theoretical problems. The goal of the ReMAP development, however, has been to provide a successful and operationally relevant product that may be used in a wide variety of applications. The result is a system that has a significant potential impact on the SMD to support a variety of missions, both present and future.","The ReMAP system has a large number of end-use applications, including multiple aircraft platforms and mission types. Analysis shows that a multi-UAS system such as ReMAP is key to enabling UAS for commercial applications. Our strong industry support shows the significant impact the ReMAP system may have on UAS applications and provides a clear path to commercialization.

Today, these behaviors are largely detected after an incident has occurred. In July 2013, an Asiana Boeing 777 flew too low approaching San Francisco International Airport (SFO), its tail hitting a seawall and crashing into the runway. Three people died and 180 were injured. This type of anomalous behavior (i.e. foreign pilots consistently flying too low into SFO on visual approach) could have been detected prior to the crash because the data was available, but no one was looking at it. Metron proposes to develop a semi-autonomous background monitoring system to apply this type of data mining and data discovery to flight track data in order to identify opportunities for improvements to safety and efficiency in airspace operations. In the Phase I effort, Metron demonstrated a proof-of-concept statistical approach that we call the Normalcy Score Broker (NSB), which uses historical flight data to develop models of normal behavior, and then applies statistical methods to combine multiple features into a single score for identifying outliers. Metron has used this same NSB technique to develop operational systems for customers in the land and maritime domains.In the Phase II, we propose to extend the techniques to process at scale, whether for real-time streaming data or for efficient analyses on forensic repositories. In addition to generating new features associated with clusters of flights interacting with each other, we propose to incorporate greater context (e.g., flight behavior in the presence of convective weather) and learning techniques to reduce false positives based on operator feedback on the relevance of the reported anomalies. We will test and evaluate our software on the NASA Cloud-based SMART-NAS Test Bed.","The long-term goal of this A3 Airspace Operations and Safety work is facilitating the development of autonomy in the future National Airspace System (NAS) through the modeling of how human behavior influences the details of flight path selection.  The short-term goal is to improve the current NAS by identifying flights deemed ?anomalous? by a suite of indicators designed to assess flight efficiency and safety.  The transition path for NASA priorities begins with the Performance Data Analysis and Reporting System (PDARS) flight repository, the source of the forensic data for this project.  ATAC has been the primary developer / integrator of PDARS, and Metron is developing joint business opportunities with ATAC to complement their domain and visualization expertise with Metron?s analytics. Part of ATAC?s responsibilities on PDARS is to consolidate, to cleanse, and to otherwise add value to NAS data?the indicators that we propose to develop for this project are designed to aid that mission.  During the execution of the Phase II, we will work with ATAC to transition our short-term technology to an FAA NextGen program (e.g., Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT)), and leverage these in-roads to begin transitioning our deeper human-behavior modeling effort.","For Non-NASA commercial applications, we plan to use the proposed work to extend our technology base of kinematic modeling and anomaly detection (which is focused on the land and sea domains) to include air operations.  This will allow us to break into new areas within agencies such as the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA). NGA is already using our anomaly detection capabilities as part of a suite of tools that we have developed to support Activity Based Intelligence on land and maritime-based track data. In FY16, we will be moving some of these track analytics developed for NGA to a computing cloud environment, and the NASA Phase II development can provide a complementary set of techniques. Similarly for the Navy, much of our technology base for anomaly detection was developed as a kinematic component for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), where it is important to understand the behavior of commercial shipping.  We would use the extension of this work into the air domain to develop a similar capability for the Air Force, providing capabilities for them to interact more safely and effectively within the context of civilian airspace.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Fusion; Data Processing; Intelligence; Process Monitoring & Control; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Autonomy of the National Airspace System (NAS)   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

MON-25, with 25% of nitric oxide (NO) and 75% nitrogen tetroxide (NTO, N2O4), allows lowering the oxidizer freezing point to -55 C, which is a close match to that of the fuel, MMH (which is around -51 C). While toxic, this propellant combination is hypergolic and allows operations over a wide range of temperatures, particularly in extremely cold environments as those envisioned for many future missions. For NASA deep space and Moon/Mars missions, such as lunar lander and Mars ascent vehicles, the introduction of a micropump in the propulsion system provides significant performance benefits. For missions with high delta-Vs, the system wet mass is greatly reduced, or at fixed total wet mass, scientific payload mass increases. For example, in the case of a lunar lander (delta-V > 3,000 m/s), a two-stage configuration can be replaced by a pump-fed single-stage system of the same mass while the pressure-fed would have to be larger.Flight Works is proposing to develop and characterize micropumps suitable for 5 lbf and 100 lbf MMH/MON-25 thrusters.  These will be used to perform pump-fed MMH/MON-25 hot-fire test demonstrations of the technology under representative environmental conditions in order to reach a TRL 6 by the end of Phase II.","The technology offers the means of improving propulsion systems to be used over a wider range of temperatures than what is currently available. The propellant combination MMH/MON-25 allows for operational temperatures as low as -50 C. These propellants, combined with electrically driven micropumps, provide increased mission flexibility and performance. Trade studies show that it can be an enabler. For example, a single-stage can be used instead of two-stages for the Lunar Geophysical Network, a candidate New Frontiers lunar lander mission. The micropump can also be used in MMH/MON-3 systems. With the reduced vapor pressure of MON-3 compared to that of MON-25, the propulsion system can be further transformed into a low-pressure, low cost, more compact and lighter system while allowing high performance thrusters. Studies conducted for another candidate New Frontiers mission, the Trojan Asteroid mission, show the possibility to increase scientific instrument mass by as much as 76% or more depending on the selected (low) tank pressure.   In general, the micropump technology has applications in any NASA mission with challenging propulsion needs: scientific missions going in or out of gravity wells, e.g. Moon landers, Mars ascent vehicles, or deep space missions to asteroids or comets. Flight Work?s strategy is to work closely with propulsion system integrators during the development phases so as to transfer the technology into operational products.","The technology is applicable to propulsion systems in general, such as those on commercial spacecraft (e.g. telecommunications market), for DoD spacecraft and missiles including in Divert Attitude Control Systems, and to on-orbit propellant management.",Fuels/Propellants; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Spacecraft Main Engine,Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Phase 2 target criteria are 1) development of an inoculum capable of removing 95% of organic carbon, and 95% conversion of ammonium (75% removed as nitrogen gas and remaining 25% converted to nitrite/nitrate) when treating ersatz EPB wastewater with a startup time of less than 15 days; 2) development of a reactor that can effectively treat EPB wastewater; and 3) development of an operations manual providing process guidelines. PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY: Properly configured biological wastewater systems can treat wastewater containing high organic carbon and nitrogen and produce a high quality effluent using minimal consumables. However, such systems can be difficult to startup rapidly and reliably. Developing a reliable inoculum to permit rapid startup of biological wastewater systems that treat high levels of organics and nitrogen would make such treatment viable. PLAN/PROCESS OUTLINE: Pancopia proposes to 1) To optimize lyophilization and reactivation of the inoculum developed in Phase I; 2) to develop a reactor system that permits accelerated startup; and 3)  to operate the wastewater system for an extended period of time and develop an operations manual.  BENEFITS: 1) Significant improvements in startup time and reliability for a system that can treat wastewater high in nitrogen, and 2) reduced costs due to optimization of bioreactor design and treatment optimization.","The primary NASA application for the proposed treatment system is the capability of rapidly and reliably starting up a biological wastewater system. This innovative treatment system will ultimately be capable of shortening the start up time of a wastewater treatment system to 15 days while enabling the to plant to remove high levels of organic carbon and nitrogen. It may be possible to use the inoculum to remotely start a wastewater treatment system, thus permitting the system to be operational at the time of occupancy of the station. A secondary application of the inoculum is for use as a backup in the event of failure of the wastewater system. This capability would be useful in cases of toxic shock, equipment failure, operator error, etc. Another application of the inoculum is its use as a standardized base to ensure reliable, uniform treatment. Use of a standard inoculum would lessen variability during treatment and simplify process control. A standard inoculum would permit different researchers to better compare research results. It would also simplify testing potential new wastewater constituents to determine how they may affect treatment","Currently the wastewater treatment industry is being revolutionized by a new type of treatment that can remove nitrogen from wastewater at less than half the present cost. The combination of simultaneous nitrification/denitrification (SND) coupled with deammonification has moved out of the research phase and is being implemented in plants throughout the world with the Blue Plains WWTP in Washington, DC being one of the early adopters. Although this technology is starting to be used, it is still in its infancy with less than 50 full-scale installations worldwide. Unfortunately, one of the primary organisms, anammox, necessary for this type of treatment has an extremely slow growth rate and it can take up to a year to start up a plant unless it receives seed from another plant. Even with seeding, plants generally take 50 days or more to start. Developing an inoculum to rapidly and reliably start up a mixed SND/deammonification system has great commercial possibilities. The Chesapeake Bay watershed is an excellent example of the possible economic potential of this new technology. The Bay's watershed has 539 treatment plants that are under or are coming under mandate to remove nitrogen. The estimated cost for nitrogen removal in 2002 was $8.2 billion for these plants. Development of a process to rapidly and reliably start up mixed SND/deammonification plants has the potential to be extremely profitable and be the source of significant environmental improvement.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Remediation/Purification",Bioregenerative Technologies for Life Support   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The module, named TOMO (Toolkit for Optimality Metrics Overlay), is a metrics toolkit for comparing SMART NAS simulation runs to the optimal decisions that should be made/should have been made relative to a selected metric to help compare the performance of the scenario being simulated to a best possible outcome, either in shadow-mode or in post-operations mode. The output from TOMO is not only a normalized metric, but the 4-D trajectories of all aircraft in an optimally-performing system.A key component to the success of any simulation environment is the quality of the metrics that it is able to report back to a user to allow informed decision-making. TOMO addresses the need to develop metrics that are comparable across scenarios by computing a 'baseline' for each scenario that represents the best that the system could perform given the operating constraints, weather, and demand. By normalizing metrics relative to this baseline, it allows for more direct comparisons across scenarios along multiple dimensions both in shadow mode and playback scenarios. When used in shadow mode, TOMO will identify the actions that should be taken to optimize for a given objective.In addition to computing the metrics, TOMO's output includes descriptive information on how the trajectories in the scenario being simulated differ from those in the optimal solution, and provides insight into how system performance may be improved.","The core application of the work in this project will be to further NASA's goals to enable safe and efficient Trajectory-Based Operations, and to develop a decision-support capability to enable better decision making. SMART NAS will be the primary application of TOMO; we envision that TOMO can be plugged into SMART NAS as a module enabling metrics computation and comparison. TOMO will display its results on a convenient user interface, to allow SMART NAS users to readily make informed decisions.If successful, it is envisioned that TOMO will not only integrate with SMART NAS to enable scenario simulation and evaluation, but will also provide output on the optimal trajectories that will promote new learning and improved decisions.TOMO can also be used for post-operations evaluation of the existing system and be integrated with real-time data feeds such as SWIM to allow TOMO to be run in playback or shadow mode.","The FAA will have similar interest in TOMO as would NASA, by leveraging TOMO's powerful decision support capability. These simulation and experimental needs are shared by other non-NASA organizations, especially those who possess or are developing large-scale air transportation simulators. Those organizations include Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, MITRE-CAASD, and Volpe. Each of these organizations has a European counterpart with comparable roles and interests. Those organizations include EUROCONTROL, SESAR, and the Ecole Polytechnique.Furthermore, there are many foreign air navigation service providers (ANSP), who are the counterpart of the FAA, with burgeoning air traffic management systems that could benefit from decision support tools for better trajectory planning and understanding of the cost/benefit tradeoffs of flow management initiatives. In some respects, these are even more viable customers for our product than the FAA, because their air traffic management systems are less highly developed (in some cases, nascent) and, therefore, able to incorporate new subsystems.

The innovation includes a central database of critical microfluidic properties.  It is designed to allow ESP system engineers to efficiently narrow down the system component trade space and thereby substantially reduce the development time of advanced ESP systems.  ESPET takes an engineering model approach that breaks the ESP system down into multiple microfluidic components or domains that can be described by analytical microfluidic solutions and specific parameters of the domain.

The Phase II Work Plan includes construction of a microfluidics properties database, the development of the domain models and network solver, and the testing and validation against data produced by current ESP system developers.","For NASA to gain high-value science from SmallSat technology requires lightweight, miniaturized, precision impulse bit, fuel efficient propulsion systems that extend mission time and greatly enhance SmallSat utility.  While a broad range of chemical and EP systems are under consideration for SmallSat thrusters, micro-fabricated electrospray (ESP) arrays have been clearly identified as an emerging technology for efficient and high precision propulsion systems, with scalability that also makes them attractive for applications on larger spacecraft.   ESPET will accelerate the development of ESP systems that meet NASA requirements.  ESPET will provide NASA with a tool for quick comparison of various fuels and thruster configurations.  It will provide designers with estimates of thruster fuel and power efficiency, stability of output thrust, and potential for contamination effects.  It will also enable them to develop accurate thruster control systems.","SmallSat technology is bringing the space vehicle deployment cost within reach of a much larger market including small commercial enterprises like Cosmogia Inc., Dove-2 remote sensing mission for NOAA, research and educational initiatives like University of Florida's SwampSat demonstrator, and developing countries without a major space program, such as Poland's BRITE-PL for celestial observations.  As the ESP technology becomes more generally available and new applications are envisioned, engineering software tools like ESPET will be essential to tailoring the thruster design to mission requirements.  ESPET may also be extended to microfluidic system designs of miniaturized electrospray ionization sources for portable mass spectrometers.","Attitude Determination & Control; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Modeling and Measurements for Propulsion and Power   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The high pressure EOC is based on proven electrolyzer technology demonstrated at Giner and delivers a continuous stream of dry oxygen with a highly controllable oxygen pressure (0-3600 psi) by feeding a low pressure humidified oxygen stream into the cathode side of the stack where oxygen is consumed.  The generation of pure oxygen at 3600 psig is particularly applicable for filling tanks used for extravehicular activity (EVA).  The benefits of using this technology rather than a standard high or large pressure differential electrolyzer stack include: 1.) significantly reduced membrane degradation resulting in an improvement in stack lifetime, 2.) increased safety as there is no risk of producing a combustible gas mixture in the event of gas crossover through the MEA, and 3.) simplified balance of plant (BOP) for the reason that typical liquid cathode feed electrolyzer stacks require sophisticated water management.  Giner further simplified the high pressure EOC BOP by integrating a low pressure static vapor feed electrolyzer (SVFE) into a shared-end-plate stack.","The proposed technology will take ambient air and water and deliver pure, dry high pressure oxygen at a rate of 0.9 kg/day at the end of Phase I.  The high pressure achievable allows for both direct oxygen use and filling of oxygen life-support tanks.  There are no other sub-systems necessary for this device and, obviously any NASA manned space mission could use this technology. As volumes would be low for NASA applications, Giner would work with a space system integration company to develop test and final space articles.  Giner is currently working with Hamilton Sundstrand in the development of a simplified static feed oxygen generator for the International Space Station.  A similar relationship would be pursued to deliver this technology to NASA  Giner would also consider working with NASA to directly deliver the technology for NASA needs. In a parallel path to NASA?s needs, Giner has a relationship with other private sector space integrators such as Bigelow Aeropsace which may be interested in this technology as it matures. Today our interaction with these type of companies have only accepted high TRL level products to incorporate into their ongoing projects.","Giner is very excited about a secondary application for the EOC, however in the field of organ preservation.  Giner has come quite far in developing an organ transport and preservation system to maintain viability during transport by keeping the organ exposed to oxygen by persufflation, the passage of oxygen through the organs vascular system.  Although this device uses an EOC, most of our work to date has concentrated on demonstrating the efficacy of the concept.  The current NASA program will further advance the underlying technology, allowing us to increase reliability, while reducing mass; critical features for both applications.Underwater manned vehicles will be another secondary application and customer base that we would pursue, starting with Treadwell who currently serves the US NAVY, followed by Corac (ACI) who serve the British and French Navys, and ultimately offering to select private integrators for recreational use.","Conversion; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Generation; Medical; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Storage",International Space Station (ISS) Demonstration of Improved Exploration Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

New technologies that enable beyond visual line of sight operations and that allow one operator to control multiple vehicles will expand the range of missions that can be accomplished and reduce operating costs. Automated upset recovery technology will reduce reliance on a human operator to mitigate hazards posed by Loss of Control (LOC) due to upset, leading to greater operational freedom. This technology is critical because LOC due to upset is one of the main causes of accidents in manned aircraft and is already emerging as an important causal factor in UAS accidents. LOC of an UAS operated at low altitude poses a hazard to people and property on the ground and is a barrier to relaxing operational restrictions. The Phase I research has developed a recovery system that replaces the perception, cognition, and decision making of a skilled operator with a two-stage automated recovery architecture and an innovative upset detection system. The decision about when to activate each stage of a recovery is difficult to make at design-time, so the upset detection system employs a novel statistical testing framework that combines at run-time numerous pieces of data including vehicle attitude, rotational rate, and controller performance to answer the question: Has an upset occurred? During Phase I, the recovery system was evaluated in a high quality simulation of a small fixed-wing vehicle.  All hardware needed for flight testing was obtained, and systems integration work was performed. The proposed Phase II effort will focus on flight testing of the recovery system, including tests with multiple vehicle designs. The Phase II team includes a flight testing and commercialization partner with a track record of safe, legal, and effective UAS inspection operations in support of commercial customers.","The proposed research aligns closely with several NASA programs and thus has multiple potential NASA commercial applications. The system directly addresses the Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP) focus areas of perception, cognition, and decision making and operation of multiple UAS with minimal human oversight.? The overall goal of the IASP is to demonstrate integrated technologies to a maturity level that is sufficient to reduce the risk of implementation for stakeholders in the aviation community. To meet this goal, the Phase I effort has been used to lay the groundwork for a series of flight-test experiments in Phase II that will advance the recovery system to TRL 7. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) project is researching prototype technologies to enable and safely manage the widespread use of low-altitude airspace and UAS operations. The proposed technology will help meet the autonomicity goals of this program, enabling UAS to maintain control when faced with the large range of precipitating factors that lead to LOC.  The Safe Autonomous Systems Operations (SASO) project seeks ways to safely integrate within the National Airspace System the highest level of automation that is justifiable, exploring future airspace concepts including point-to-point and on-demand usage of personal air vehicles (PAVs).  The recovery system is applicable to any autonomous vehicle whether a small UAS or self-flying PAV.","The proposed Phase II program is structured to raise the maturity of the recovery system to a level that enables product commercialization onboard commercial inspection UAS. One of the Phase II partners is actively conducting inspection flights for utility companies under a Section 333 exemption from the FAA and has provided low-cost aerial imagery to identify numerous infrastructure problems and wildlife issues. Inspection operations are conducted at low altitude and in close proximity to infrastructure to provide the highest quality imagery. Clearly, this leaves a very small margin for recovering from upset events. The recovery system will help to mitigate the ground hazard, a very real concern considering a significant amount of utility infrastructure exists in densely populated areas. As continued use allows stakeholders to gain confidence in the system, the recovery system will enable flight beyond visual line of sight, operation of multiple UAS by a single operator, and larger mission envelopes. The operational experience that is gained after initial commercialization of the recovery system on commercial inspection UAS operated will leave the team well poised to market the technology in other sectors including (1) military and intelligence gathering operations, (2) law-enforcement operations, (3) land management oversight, (4) aerial photography, and (5) package delivery.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Intelligence; Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling,Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Phase 1 addressed the feasibility of the PCF FOG concept, demonstration of critical components, performance/size tradeoffs, and preliminary designs of FOG-based IRU and IMU, leading to a prototype gyro to be designed and built in Phase 2. In particular, Phase 1 involved a comprehensive study of available state-of-the-art PCF and associated components. Based on this, three different PCFs were obtained and extensively tested for suitability in small gyro applications emphasizing tight bending diameters and temperature tests. The tests demonstrated that the technology is sufficiently developed to enable implementation of advanced PCF-based FOGs in the near future. Phase 2 will (1) implement selected PCF for the gyro application, develop and evaluate components including the PCF coil, modulator and polarizers, and develop the required support infrastructure and tooling, (2) perform performance modeling and trade-offs followed by a complete PCF gyro design, (3) evaluate low-power solutions for the light source and electronics and preliminary valuation of unique electronic miniaturization designs, (4) deliver a tested and validated gyro sensor and electronics, and (5) design a compact open-loop PCF FOG-based 3-axis IRU system.The Phase 2 strategy includes a development and integration plan, potential demonstration opportunities, program schedule, transition activities, and estimated costs.

This technology will allow NTP systems to start up by rotating the control drums to a single predetermined location and remain there for the duration of operation for the majority of the burns associated with a Mars mission.  Passive technology will greatly simplify the control of NTP systems and increase their overall performance during operation. USNC's passive criticality control technology works by  -Employing advanced burnable neutron poison to completely remove the need for control drum movement during a full power burn. -Tuning the hydrogen density in the tie-tubes to ensure a consistent start-up position for the control drums. -Enhancing the fuel temperature reactivity feedback mechanism to ensure the stability of the reactor and reduce the burden for active control.This work addresses noted research needs so that NTP systems can help enable human exploration to Mars and other destinations. USNC's Phase 2 work will be a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art and increase the overall knowledge of NTP control.

USNC's work directly aligns with the NASA Technological Roadmap 2015 which calls for complex reactor models to optimize the nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) engine systems. Currently, NTP and USNC's passive criticality control technology is being investigated for a human Mars mission in the 2030s time frame, but NTP also has application for longer term goals such as exploration beyond Mars and aiding in Space colonization.In the near term, USNC's technology will be able to support NTP development efforts by providing the research tools needed to address NTP related questions (TRICORDER) and give assurance that private industry can address key technology needs for NTP systems (BORGalloy, and  HYPOSPRA). TRICORDER will be able to provide the highest fidelity modeling of the NTP system to date and will be a valuable research tool for developing NTP systems.  Beyond NTP, the technology and expertise that USNC is building has application to small nuclear systems for surface power and science missions. Small nuclear systems are a very appealing technology for space exploration because they can provide power independent of solar availability and for extended periods of time.","There is an emerging market need for advanced reactors that provide power in locations and markets where traditional nuclear power plants cannot be utilized effectively.

The chemical detection capability can interrogate a molecule one layer thick adsorbed on the surface determining chemical content and allowing detection of leaks or contamination in pressurized or vacuum conditions.  The LIDAR provides both ultra, high resolution imaging of surface imperfections and holes caused by micro meteor or debris, and the chemical content map of the 3D imaged area. Maximum range for the Raman LIDAR is 300m at 3mm resolution and 6 meters at 15micron resolution.","Potential NASA commercial applications for the High Range Resolution, Raman Spectral LIDAR are primarily for satellite inspection and repair and commercially with life extension packages for geosync communication satellites. Additional applications include space junk removal, operation of air and space platforms, 3d multispectral mapping and high speed descent landing for missions, such as the Mars, Venus and asteroid missions. Additionally, rendezvous and docking missions, such as with the space station, are supported. Other NASA commercial applications include long range acquisition, navigation, inspection, and robotic control of space platforms and satellites.  Future uses would support non-GPS assisted navigation and optimal route planning for virtually every air platform from small UAVs to large airplanes.","Non-NASA commercial applications of the High Range Resolution, Raman Spectral LIDAR include intercept and docking missions for communications satellite life extension satellites and can be used for vehicle inspection missions by commercial and DoD customers. The Raman Spectral capabilities allow both multi-dimensional surface mapping and chemical analysis of surfaces for superior navigation, flight control, landing operations, docking, satellite inspection and maintenance.  Critically needed structural inspection of commercial space assets is a direct spin off.  Other commercial applications include: remote sensing of chemicals in the environment, monitoring of crops, forests, and urban areas; detection of explosives, bio toxins: and detection and monitoring of radioactive containers by the nitrous oxide adsorbed on the surface. Other applications are in waste stream monitoring, pollution and leak detection, and multi-dimensional imaging.  Airborne applications can be eye-safe on the ground with ranges up to 3km.  Ultra-high range accuracy applications include high resolution 3D imaging of complex, multispectral scenes.","3D Imaging; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Data Fusion; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Visible",NDE Sensors   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To develop such next-generation systems, multiple design variables must be assessed efficiently within a conceptual design software environment.   A blend of physics-based, mid-fidelity tools featuring low CPU and ease of setup can provide this capability.  Phase I built on an established, highly efficient lifting surface free wake model, the CDI CHARM analysis, and also began initial development of a novel variant of the CDI Cartesian Grid Euler (CGE) model to yield fast-turnaround, low- mid fidelity tools well suited to this requirement.  Phase I involved several key upgrades to CHARM and preliminary validation on  representative CROR designs.  Regarding CGE, formulation of the new rotating frame and multirotor capability has been largely completed, and demonstrations of single rotor modeling are complete.  Phase II will entail: additional upgrades to the CHARM rotor blade and airfoil models for improved fidelity; completion of implementation of the CGE analysis for CROR cases; integration of the two models into a unified CHARM-CGE AeroAnalysis (C2A2) architecture; and extensive validation and operational testing.","Open rotor propulsion systems can help meet long range emission reduction targets in support of initiatives such Green Aviation.  The final Phase II C2A2 code package will be made available to NASA engineers, and will aid multiple investigations of the potential of advanced CROR propulsion concepts to improve fuel efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of commercial transports. In addition, to direct analysis of particular CROR designs, the model can efficiently produce full performance maps of candidate designs for use in conjunction with system-level design studies.   The C2A2 software can also enhance analysis and conceptual design capabilities for assessment of novel air vehicles featuring Integrated and Distributed Propulsion systems such as the ongoing LeapTech initiative.  Finally, the modeling capabilities of the CHARM and CGE codes can be exploited- in conjunction with standard noise models - to support initial studies of unsteady loading and acoustics for these advanced concepts.","The enhanced fast-turnaround, physics-based analysis and design tools for CROR systems that will emerge from Phase II will support both civil aircraft manufacturers and DoD. The US Air Force is actively seeking more efficient future transports, and airframers and private industry can utilize these tools in designing aircraft with lower emissions footprint and a superior balance of reduced fuel burn in cruise and community noise impact. Spinoffs of the model to the design of propulsion systems for compound rotorcraft and UAVs are also possible.  Phase III commercialization will benefit from the beta testing that will be a feature of the Phase II, as well as by offering new capabilities the pre-existing installed base of CHARM and CGE software users.","Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)",Physics-Based Conceptual Aeronautics Design Tools   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Innoflight proposes developing a Compact Wireless EVA Communications System (CWECS) as a replacement and advancement of the Space-to-Space EVA Mobility Unit (EMU) Radio (SSER).  The CWECS goals are to: (a) provide backward-compatibility with the existing SSCS network and SSER; (b) provide enhanced communication between the EMU and space vehicle (or ISS or future space habitat) via 802.11n, including high-speed telemetry from the EMU to the spacecraft; and (c) provide body area network (BAN) coverage for wireless biomedical devices and sensors within the EMU.  The Phase II will leverage Innoflight�s DeSCReeT IF-SDR architecture, which uses cutting edge radiation-tolerant components as the foundation of a software-defined radio (SDR), and transform it into an integrated unit supporting SSCS, 802.11n and BAN.  The end result of the Phase II will be a brass-board CWECS that demonstrates compatibility with the selected waveforms.","The current SSER is provided by NASA as GFE.  To provide backwards-compatibility to EMU / EVA space suits efforts that use the GFE SSER, Innoflight proposes to build an SSER-compliant variant of CWECS.  This will enable consideration in upcoming EMU block upgrades for ISS operations as well as using the ISS and the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) as enabling capabilities for a Mars surface mission.  Furthermore, for advanced EVA concepts, including the Exploration EVA, the CWECS will be repackaged into smaller form factor and weight.  Deep-space high-speed wireless capabilities (especially 802.11n) will be of interest to the Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) and their robotics efforts.  Furthermore, advancing state of the art SDR for space will be appealing to numerous mission areas � most notably, AES�s SCaN.The NASA SBIR program is ideal vehicle to provide cost savings and/ or cost avoidance for an EMU program overdue for innovation but with budget constraints that prohibit a large scale program to advance the space suit design.","Innoflight will work with JSC to understand the opportunities to pursue opportunities to offer EVA technologies to commercial spaceflight companies, such as Virgin Galactic, and international space agencies, such as ESA or JAXA.Furthermore, high-speed wireless capabilities in SDRs will be of interest for autonomous spacecraft.

There is optimism that estimates of PSD will be available from ocean color measurements (such as NASA's upcoming PACE mission), and will be able to help constrain global-scale ecosystem/carbon models and estimates of primary production. However, natural PSD variability is not well understood due to the challenges of routine measurement, and there exists little field data over large space and time scales. We propose to bridge this gap by developing an instrument for ship-based flow-through application that uses laser scattering from multiple wavelengths for estimation of the PSD across a wide range of particle sizes from 0.1 to 500 micron, covering a range from the smallest oceanic pico-plankton to larger meso-plankton.","The proposed instrument for measuring PSD in underway systems has wide applicability in the field of ocean optics and ocean biology and biogeochemistry. Existing methods commonly used in oceanography are time-consuming and expensive, thus the proposed system will be an attractive option for particle size measurement and advancing the state of the art in ocean color and biogeochemistry. NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers--especially those working on developing phytoplankton functional group algorithms and/or increasingly-complex biogeochemical models--are currently hindered by a lack of ground truth PSD data. Given the current push within NASA programs in preparation for launch of the PACE ocean color mission and EXPORTS field study, development of this system is very timely for advancement of Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems research.","Similar to the NASA Applications, the target market for the proposed instrument is a broad. Government agency-funded (including NSF, EPA, NOAA) researchers routinely use turbidity, pigment analysis, and cell counting for water quality monitoring and science applications. Adding the ability to make measurements of PSD at higher space-time resolution would be highly significant. One potential application with major societal relevance is monitoring of changes in PSD as a tool for detecting harmful algal blooms.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",Surface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The solution takes full advantage of emerging communications technologies to integrate AOC/FOC and flight deck capabilities and leverage existing system integration between the AOC/FOC and TFMS to fully close the loop between controllers, traffic managers, pilots and dispatchers on tactical reroutes. Closing the loop between these four key stakeholder groups is an essential element for the extension of Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) and User Preferred Trajectories (UPT) into the enroute domain including NAS Oceanic airspace. This approach offers a more robust, extensible architecture that can be tailored to an individual airline's operational model while simultaneously offering an upgrade path for adding more capability over time. Our solution aims to combine the best features of recent NASA research products including DWR, DAR and TASAR, and adds more capability via enhanced data communications and connected cockpits. The solution is centered on both integration with AOC/FOC systems and the EFB  and integration of AOC/FOC systems, to provide full access to superior information. This enables our architecture to use the best available data, allocate data processing and analytical functions to where they can be performed most efficiently, and allows the stakeholders to collaborate and make the best operational decision for the users as well as ATC.Robust Analytics will developed and flight test a prototype of the EDCN with matched AOC and EFB applications to support uploading of graphical weather and exchange proposed flight re-routes to avoid weather and other NAS constraints.","There are five immediate NASA applications:1. The SMART NAS Regional Trajectory Based Operations Sub-project is directly relevant to this effort. Under Regional TBO, NASA will develop and test concepts for TBO in the New York metroplex. Our prototypes provide two direct applications:a. Concepts to testb. AOC-aircraft communications and application testing infrastructure to install and evaluate new TBO-related algorithms2. TASAR operates in the EFB and would benefit from data that EDCN can receive from the AOC.3. Dynamic Weather Routing (DWR) is a TMU-AOC decision support tool that currently operates outside of the airline IT security firewall. This severely limits is usefulness to dispatchers, especially during weather events when they need it most.

NASA is involved in research that would greatly benefit from advancing the ability of UAS to make autonomous real-time decisions based on sensor data.  This SBIR effort will provide this capability, developing and demonstrating an intelligent controller for a UAS that can autonomously perform agricultural chemical spraying leveraging EPA-approved software and following NASA guidelines for suggested certification requirements for commercial UAS over 55 lbs.  This is a high-value civilian application well-suited to autonomous UAS given the dangers posed by maneuvering manned aircraft at extremely low altitudes.  This also serves as a test case for evaluating future UAS certification requirements.  Phase I established feasibility by demonstrating the ability to perform the required onboard sensing, to establish communication between a UAS and flight controller at high enough bandwidth to allow inflight decision-making, and to execute a pre-determined flight path/spraying strategy autonomously.  Phase II would see the design, development and implementation of a fully-autonomous, prototype system that can perform high-level decision-making during flight and satisfy NASA�s draft certification basis for UAS performing precision agricultural spraying.  The prototype system would install algorithms based upon existing EPA-approved spray drift management software within the autonomous flight control system.  The end goal of the Phase II effort would be a flight demonstration of the prototype system consisting of a modified, midsize UAS spraying intelligently and autonomously, with high-level decision-making, within a relevant environment.","The proposed effort directly addresses NASA program goals to develop technologies that provide the ability of UAS to extract information in-flight and utilize this information in decision making.  This SBIR effort also directly supports current NASA/industry initiatives to establish airworthiness standards for FAA-certification that will provide a roadmap for future application of UAS in commercial applications within the United States.  Specifically, this SBIR effort dovetails with a NASA/DPI partnership to study civil airworthiness certification for use in the national airspace through demonstration of precision agricultural spray application, a mission that is particularly suited to UAS given the significant dangers faced by manned aircraft maneuvering at extremely low altitudes.  The proposed SBIR effort complements and directly supports this NASA/DPI effort by demonstrating fully-autonomous, flight path and mission management system for UAS tailored toward a specific task, in this case agricultural spraying.  The proposed project addresses two key elements that must be demonstrated before UAS can be applied in commercial missions within the U.S; a need for technical advancement related to autonomous control and decision-making and a need to develop airworthiness FAA-certification requirements for UAS operations.","The DoD is seeing growing use of UAS in surveillance and urban operations where the ability to extract information in-flight and utilize this information in decision-making with minimal human oversight is critical.  The number of trained operators of DoD unmanned aircraft systems is currently being vastly outstripped by requirements for operating an ever-increasing fleet of UAS aircraft.  UAS operators are currently being forced to work longer and longer shifts with no alleviation in sight.  The technology developed during this effort directly supports addressing this need, providing advancements in the ability for autonomous control of UAS platforms that will reduce the level of direct piloting required.  Private industry will also benefit greatly from this current effort.  First, this SBIR will provide advancements in fully-autonomous, application-specific, UAS platforms.  Autonomous control is critical to the eventual expansion of the customer base beyond those with piloting experience to the general public at large.  Thus this area of research supports an enormous leap in commercialization potential.  Second, the proposed effort also has a component addressing FAA-certification requirements for autonomously-controlled UAS.

This Phase 2 work will focus on refining the path planning portion of MACE as well as maturing the resource and task allocation library developed during Phase 1. The path planning architecture will define key modules to plan paths to a global objective, assess potential obstacles, and avoid collisions while maintaining progress towards the global objective. The framework will be constructed in a modular fashion to allow a plug-and-play capability for the resource/task allocation as well as the various components of the path planning pipeline, giving end users the flexibility to explore other methods for UAS collaboration. At the conclusion of Phase 2, the MACE framework will be demonstrated using Heron Systems� HWIL simulation/stimulation environment. Once verified via the HWIL environment, the MACE framework will be deployed onboard several aerial assets and tested against scenarios specifically tailored towards precision agriculture applications.","Collaborative unmanned operations can offer NASA significant new capabilities in the areas of airborne science, weather monitoring and the ongoing study of UAS integration into the National Air Space (NAS). We have identified the ongoing Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) program and related studies being conducted at NASA Langley and NASA Ames. Collaborative capabilities can support several ongoing initiatives either directly or by offering capabilities that empower further opportunities. Methods for determining suitable paths in the presence of both compliant and non-compliant aircraft are vital for safe integration.  Additionally, MACE can provide NASA with a framework for enabling safe terminal area operations where collaborative control can be used to guide entering and exiting UAS into safe and predictable flight patterns. A secondary NASA customer set will be the Aeronautical Earth Sciences programs operated by NASA Langley. MACE can empower enhanced data collection through the deployment of multiple sensors and increased coverage areas. Further, the flexible resource allocation capability can allow scientists to maximize their data collection time to focus on targets of opportunity that may not be fully understood prior to launching the mission. A third opportunity is insertion into the ongoing storm monitoring and prediction activities jointly conducted by NASA and NOAA. MACE can be used to supplement ongoing GlobalHawk flights to gather high fidelity data.","Commercially, MACE promises to dramatically improve the efficiency of operations of many envisioned UAS applications. Of particular interest are those in the areas of precision agriculture and aerial surveying.  Heron Systems will build a service delivery model tailored for precision agriculture supporting rapid surveying of fields and follow-on tasking based on real-time findings.  Similarly, a second product line will tailor to the needs of civil engineers supporting inspection requirements.

Airport ramp areas are the most crowded and cluttered spaces in the entire National Airspace System (NAS). Operations associated with turnaround of the aircraft from the gate represent a significant source of delay and therefore impact the predictability of NAS operations. The computer-vision-based Gate Activity Monitoring TOol Suite (GAMTOS) will specifically identify the various stages of turnaround such as refueling, baggage handling, and deicing. It will further employ a probabilistic model of the times associated with each of these events, that will be used for predicting the future sequence of events and their predicted times of completion. We seek to leverage our expertise in monitoring aircraft using the Vision BAsed Surveillance System (VBASS) currently being developed under a Phase III SBIR research from NASA Ames Research Center. At the end of Phase II, the GAMTOS software is expected to operate in two different modes. The first mode is an offline mode, which generates a database of gate activities, their timings, and their sequence. The second mode is a real-time mode which involves continuous monitoring of activities and prediction of future activities.","By providing improved pushback time Prediction, GAMTOS directly benefits Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA), which is part of the Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) II. GAMTOS is also directly applicable to objectives of the Networked ATM sub-project under the Shadow Mode Assessment Using Realistic Technologies in the National Airspace System (SMART NAS) project. GAMTOS is expected to increase the gate operations predictability and reduce the total cost of National Airspace System operations. GAMTOS would further enhance the development of Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO) concepts and enabling technology solutions that enable capacity, throughput, and efficiency gains within the various phases of gate-to-gate operations.","Low-cost airport activity monitoring techniques are of considerable interest to FAA and airports in general. It can be used by airlines to monitor the efficiency and bottlenecks in their own operations. GAMTOS directly benefit the American Airlines who is working on expected off-block time prediction.

The ECO concepts will represent rational approaches to incorporating multiple NASA technologies in a synergistic manner for the 2030-2040 timeframe, including distributed energy management, embedded fan split-wing configuration for powered lift and improved aerodynamic efficiency and structural rigidity, ducted radiator cooling systems, hybrid power supplementation, and tail reduction via propulsive aircraft control. Complete design iterations of the ECO-150 and ECO-80 concepts will incorporate lessons learned relating to the following objectives and cross-check them with the existing vehicle design, competing discipline requirements, and detailed component integration: (1) Advance the TeDP system design through non-superconducting, high power microgrid design and detailed motor/generator sensitivity analyses; (2) Advance the TMS design with a new TMS architecture for redundancy and by applying thermal capacitance to achieve transient performance targets; (3) Take credit for the propulsion system?s utility as an aircraft control mechanism and address any new design requirements this imposes on the aircraft; (4) Investigate hybrid power supplementation and establish a roadmap for the sizing and synthesis of HEDP architectures; (5) Continue the high-fidelity aero-propulsion CFD study to improve the high lift and cruise efficiency of the split-wing design, and use the CFD results to validate and calibrate ESAero?s analytical propulsion duct models.","This work will facilitate the conceptual design of hybrid/all-electric propulsion systems from transformational thin-haul to transport air vehicles. This application comes from the improvement in fidelity and integration of TeDP and HEDP power and propulsion systems into a moderate- to high- fidelity ECO reference vehicles sized using PANTHER with power systems from Rolls Royce and aero-propulsive knowledge from Helden.  This work benefits multiple NRA projects, and other direct NASA projects like RVLT, AATT and TACP. Several nuances native to the turbo-electric or hybrid electric distributed propulsion are electric component weight and structure, power transmission networks, and thermal management systems.  These new design hurdles have not been addressed in previous methods or efforts, but play a significant role in determining the feasibility of these aircraft, as one of the major benefits to a decoupled energy management system using distributed propulsion is the freedom in placing the propulsors virtually anywhere. With a potential decision by NASA to determine if these types of vehicles are feasible in the next few years, the results of this ECO effort will equip NASA with opportunities for independent technology assessment and comparison, system integration and challenges, potential partnership funding paths, and potential component or system commercialization opportunities to support ""vision vehicle"" configurations for internal NASA studies and public relations.","ESAero will use this work to guide aerospace primes toward the identification of feasible hybrid-electric architectures and support power system manufacturers interested in how their technology affects hybrid/all-electric designs. A robust PANTHER tool and high confidence vehicles will be available to advance the art and understand tradable system architecture parameters for future hybrid pursuits.  Electric air vehicle design services for Aerospace companies (especially primes) are only becoming of greater demand. This has been shown by ESAero with other government entities and industry including Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, General Atomics, Electricore, automotive manufacturers, etc. While these efforts have been specific to electric- or hybrid-electric distributed propulsion type of aircraft, limitless integration opportunities to support quick iteration conceptual design with little incoming knowledge of the system provides a relatively new service and capability. There is potential and interest to sell and/or otherwise make the resultant ECO configurations and PANTHER open source to industry partners to advance the technologies necessary. Having been told that ESAero is one of the only groups looking at tube-and-wing distributed propulsion and rotorcraft at this level for more conventional machines, there is limited competition, as the major airframers and universities are looking at hybrid, blended wing bodies and larger systems.","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Distribution/Management; Heat Exchange; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Passive Systems; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Storage; Verification/Validation Tools",Low Emissions Propulsion and Power   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

That goal has inspired innovative space-based coronagraphs that aim to collect spectral data from earth-like planets orbiting stars in distant solar systems. NASA's SBIR Solicitation topic Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronography calls specifically for small stroke, high precision, deformable mirrors and associated driving electronics scalable to 10,000 or more actuators. This research aims to overcome the two major technical problems that affect yield and lifetime of the micro-electro-mechanical system deformable mirrors (MEMS DMs) that currently define the state of the art for high-resolution wavefront control: (1) keyhole voids occurring during manufacturing (reducing manufacturing yield) and (2) field emission damage that occurs during device operation (reducing operational lifetime).  In this project, the technical solutions to these problems that were demonstrated in the Phase I project will be integrated into a full DM wafer-scale surface-micromachining batch production run to make the first 100% working 2048-element MEMS DM. As a byproduct of the process enhancements developed in Phase I research, this run will feature unprecedented surface smoothness and exceptional device reliability and lifetime in addition to high yield. The devices will be produced in a form factor that can be used with the heritage coating, packaging, and testing technologies. They will fit into existing packages and will be controllable with existing driver technology. Consequently, they will allow rapid insertion of these new high-reliability DM devices into appropriate NASA test beds.","Reliable, high precision deformable mirrors with high yield and precision and associated drive electronics has a few astronomical NASA commercial applications.

These include the Alpha Centauri Exoplanet Satellite (ACESat), Extrasolar Planet Imaging Coronograph (EPIC), Exoplanetary Circumstellar Environments and Disk Explorer (EXCEDE) and the Centaur pathfinder mission. For ground-based telescopes, BMC has already had success developing arrays up to 4096 elements for the Gemini Planet Imager and multiple high-yield smaller devices to high contrast imaging testbeds at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the University of Nice. BMC can achieve similar results for larger arrays requiring high-density electronic equipment for other new and existing installations such as the planned Extremely Large Telescopes (Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT)).","High precision deformable mirrors and associated drive electronics have multiple commercial applications.

NASA GSFC's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) offers advanced mission design and optimization capabilities with a flexible GUI, but its 3D graphics are lacking in both the quantity and quality of its graphical components as well as the maturity of its visualization subsystem. Emergent will therefore modernize GMAT with world-class visualization capabilities via a graphics architecture that can adapt to future visualization technologies by replacing the existing basic graphics code with the OpenFrames visualization software. OpenFrames is an Open Source API that allows simulations to incorporate high-performance interactive 3D visualizations without requiring significant changes to the existing software architecture. We will utilize the mission design visualization requirements developed in Phase I to fully integrate OpenFrames into GMAT and demonstrate how it enables new and innovative mission design applications such as visual interactive trajectory design and Virtual Reality-based simulation and modeling. As a result, this research will not only bring GMAT visualizations up to par with COTS mission design tools such as STK/Astrogator, but will also enable it to be viable for use in virtual reality environments such as the Oculus Rift. Modernized visualization technology will increase GMAT's user base and enhance its utility for future NASA Discovery and Human Space Flight missions that require high-fidelity simulations paired with truly interactive 3D visualizations.","Robust and high-performance visualizations are especially important during trajectory optimization for interplanetary and asteroid missions. Enabling visual interactive trajectory design (VITD) in GMAT allows users to 'drag and move' trajectories intuitively, which greatly reduces the time required to create optimal trajectories for complex mission design problems. Furthermore, combining VITD with VR technologies such as the Oculus Rift and Power Gloves creates a never-before-seen application for mission design; designers now fully engage their visual analysis expertise to design the energy-constrained trajectories needed for asteroid tours such as Lucy, low-thrust CubeSat missions such as Lunar Flashlight, and Discovery-class planetary missions such as DAVINCI. Therefore, our integration of OpenFrames will make GMAT even more effective as a primary mission design tool for NASA's upcoming flagship Discovery-class missions in which cutting-edge trajectories must be designed to meet increasingly complex science requirements.","Small space startup businesses will also benefit from the advanced mission design technologies made possible by our research. For example, CubeSat missions are becoming increasingly affordable for small businesses, due in part to technology demonstrations from NASA's public CubeQuest challenge. GMAT will enable the design of low-cost CubeSat ventures such as asteroid mining and planetary science missions, for which low-thrust limitations necessitate designing complex long-duration trajectories. Our implementation of visual interactive trajectory design greatly reduces this effort by allowing mission designers to visually create and intuitively alter the trajectories, and immediately see how the changes affect the mission. Additionally, the VR industry is getting ready to explode. It is reasonable to predict that in the near future, mission designers will want immersive simulations that have, until now, only been seen in science fiction. By integrating advanced visualization and VR technologies such as Oculus Rift and Power Gloves, we enable GMAT to bridge the gap between science fiction and reality. Furthermore, the low cost of these VR technologies, coupled with the cutting-edge visualizations we implement in GMAT, will eliminate several of the major hurdles associated with space mission design and open the door for small businesses to create novel missions.","Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Outreach; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

During Phase I period, we had (1) verified the concept of the proposed floating driver for controlling an HV switch configured by a pair of transistors, (2) developed a high-voltage unity-gain buffer for tracing an isolated voltage signal, which is an essential tool towards developing switch arrays with high quality, (3) established the test methods for measuring switch parameters that directly impact the performance of a DM, (4) identified the main switch parameters, feedthrough and leakage, which are the primary impediments causing the drift of a stroke. All of the above made it possible for us to focus on (1) screen HV IC processes to find a qualified IC process with which a switch featuring low leakage can be fabricated, (2) apply decoupling technique to eliminate feedthrough, (3) manufacture an advanced 32x32 switch array with a voltage-resolution of 16-bit or beyond in Phase II.","The proposed ASIC driver, featuring a voltage-resolution of 16-bit or beyond, is specifically designed to drive a stacked DM, which NASA has been qualified in ground.

With a vertically integrated ASIC driver, the fabrication of a DM will be greatly simplified as thousands of wire bonding and cabling will no longer be required. Thus, the yield and reliability will be improved. Furthermore, with a simplified architecture, DMs with tens thousands of actuators will become possible. Another main potential non-NASA application is the scanning microscopic fidelity imaging where a compact DM is used to correct optical aberrations in the field of bio-science. Non-NASA applications for deformable mirrors also include laser beam shaping, laser communication in free space and retinal imaging.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors)",Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In Phase II, we will demonstrate, test, and characterize a laboratory-scale AFLOGA, then use the knowledge gained to design, construct, and test a compact AFLOGA that will fit within a 10 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm case. A design for a complete, six-axis SIMU will be developed with a footprint comparable to commercial inertial measurement units, but with dramatically higher sensitivity. In parallel, we will design, construct, and test a laboratory-scale AFLIFOS system.  Finally, a theoretical investigation will be carried out to develop a Master Equation based model for quantum noise limit on the enhancement in sensitivity using a superluminal laser sensor.  Northwestern University will serve a subcontractor for this project.","The gyroscopes and accelerometers developed in this program will have substantially improved sensitivity and reduced SWaP compared to conventional technology. These will find use for navigation of NASA space vehicles of all sorts, where SWaP concerns and precise navigation are critical. These technologies may also enable an array of new scientific missions, such as gravitational mapping of subsurface geologic features and gravity wave detection. An ultrasensitive gyroscope may also enable a critical test of general relativity via measurement of the gravitational frame dragging effect to an unprecedented accuracy. An ultra-sensitive fiber-optic sensor may be enable precise measurement of strain, temperature,and other effects under conditions relevant to NASA missions.","The gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sensors developed in this program will enable improved navigation accuracy at reduced SWaP cost, much as they do in NASA space vehicles. In addition, they can be used in atmospheric and terrestrial vehicles and ordnance for positioning and navigation in GPS-denied environments, a critical need for many military applications. The improved SWaP performance of these systems would be particularly useful in UAV navigation. High-sensitivity accelerometers can also be used in improved vibration sensors, with an array of applications in seismometry and subsurface explosion detection for nuclear non-proliferation applications. Improved strain and displacement sensors would also have a wide array of applications in monitoring the structural health of buildings and infrastructure.","Acoustic/Vibration; Attitude Determination & Control; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Inertial; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Navigation & Guidance; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z)",Slow and Fast Light   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The system will provide onboard off-nominal state detection and isolation capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness. The ability to autonomously isolate spacecraft failures to component levels will enable faster recovery thereby reducing down time. Model-based systems can provide better fault coverage than traditional limit-checking systems. The proposed system in particular will result in a relatively compact software package because it relies only on modeling nominal behavior; fault models are not needed. Thus this approach has the capability to detect any off-nominal behavior including un-modeled faults. Health information produced by the FM system can be used to make resource allocation and planning and scheduling decisions by ground operations or by other on-board autonomy agents. The system can be built and tested standalone potentially reducing FM developmental and testing costs. The FM system provides an evolutionary approach to full onboard autonomy as it can first be implemented and tested in ground-based systems and then migrated onboard spacecraft. Onboard fault management will be crucial to NASA mission success particularly during critical times where the situation changes rapidly and unpredictably with no opportunity for operator support.,"The need for the proposed capabilities is emerging as NASA seeks to provide higher quality fault management systems for its missions. The model-based fault detection and isolation system could support current and future programs with applications on the ground, in support of recovery operations, and in space, providing onboard autonomous fault detection and isolation. The fault management core diagnostic algorithms are general in nature and do not need tailoring to specific programs. User-supplied models allow customization to a particular target. Thus the developed system will be applicable to a very broad range of NASA mission classes from small to large, near-Earth to interplanetary, risk-adverse, and experimental. In particular missions such as Europa and Mars 2020 would greatly benefit from this technology. Ultimately, NASA and industry partner fault management products will enjoy a larger customer base. The potential market includes a wide range of customers from systems engineering, mission planning, and operations groups in all NASA centers especially ARC, JPL, and MSFC.","The need for robust and reliable onboard fault management will increase dramatically as spacecraft systems become more autonomous. The DoD's drive to increase situational awareness has already pushed it into exploration of autonomy-enabling architectures, including improved fault detection and isolation techniques, which will only increase as spacecraft autonomy moves into the broader spacecraft industry. The solution consists of diagnostic algorithms that utilize models provided by the users. The system can thereby be targeted for virtually any mission class. The proposed model-based FM solution is particularly well suited for spacecraft with modular HW/SW architectures. These new architectures will require updated approaches to FM and tools to support them. Potential non-NASA customers include: Large, medium and small prime contractors DoD Labs (NRL, AFRL) FFRDCs/UARCs (Aerospace Corporation, JHU/APL) Non-US organizations (ESA, JAXA, CNES, DLR).

Its low density and high wear resistance also make it attractive for the structures of manned spacecraft and extraterrestrial habitats. However, its use in structures is limited by its flammability and poor mechanical properties under load compared to other structural materials. While carbon fiber/UHMWPE are an obvious solution, to date they have not proved useful because load is not easily transferred to or from UHMWPE, and because its melt state is too viscous to infiltrate fiber preforms. In this Phase II project, TDA will apply its recent advances in composite manufacturing to create a UHMWPE-matrix composite that has good load transfer to a creep-mitigating continuous fiber reinforcement. Such a composite will not only have outstanding radiation shielding properties, but also have sufficient mechanical properties to be useful as a structural material.","Multifunctional radiation shielding was identified as the top technical challenge in the Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing (MSMM) draft Roadmap (Technical Area 12), and the technology proposed herein offers a solution. The composites proposed herein should be a key components of the structural materials used in extraterrestrial human habits, whether they are in space, on the moon, on Mars, or any other location subject to high energy galactic cosmic rays and/or solar particle events. The lightweight and high strength of the proposed materials will enable their use in efficient structures, providing true multifunctionality from a radiation shield and minimizing the parasitic weight of the shielding.","The Cf/UHMWPEm composites should be commercially useful in other wear-resistant structures, including mining equipment and ballistic threat protection. Self-reinforced UHMWPE composites dominate the market for lightweight armor, and the composited proposed herein should provide a complementary but similarly outstanding set of properties for mitigating a broad spectrum of ballistic threats.

However, the hurdle of operation safety in the form of avoiding airborne collisions must first be overcome.  UAVradars LLC is proposing a small, lightweight, and low-power radar system designed specifically to give small UAS (< 55 lbs) airborne collision-avoidance sensory capability.  Radar is ideally suited for this purpose due to its all-weather capability to provide accurate position and velocity data.  The proposed radar is based on previous R&D funded by NASA and performed at the University of Kansas from 2012 to 2014.  This effort resulted the successfully flight testing of a large scale proof-of-concept radar that was then miniaturized as an academic demonstrating of the potential reduction in size, weight and power (SWaP).  The SBIR Phase I focuses on overcoming critical factors specific to commercialization needs that were left unresolved.  These were 1) replace the bulky user laptop controller with a small Raspberry Pi 2 to allow the miniature radar system to be installed on a sUAS; 2) move the radar operations to the ISM band to avoid FCC licensing complications; and 3) implement radar transmit encoding to allow multiple radar systems to operate in the same area without cross jamming.  The successful complete of Phase I indicated the radar commercialization feasibility which leads into Phase II.  The objectives in Phase II is to create a flight tested prototype.  This involves 1) maximize radar hardware performance; 2) create a target detection and tracking algorithm; and 3) perform radar flight testing to validate its capability.  By completing these tasks, the Phase II miniature radar system will be proven as a disruptive technology for overcome key sense-and-avoid barriers in NASA?s efforts of integrating UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS).","NASA currently has multiple UAS applications/technology development programs which could benefit from the proposed situation awareness radar system.  The Phase II miniature radar system will allow NASA pilots to operate multiple UAS with minimal oversight, enhance multi-vehicle cooperation (especially in an unknown environment), and achieve higher levels of situation awareness for intelligent decision making in real-time.  For example, NASA?s Autonomous Robust Avionics (AuRA) would directly benefit from the radar?s ability to reduce operator workload.  Either as a stand-alone sensor or integrated with other devices, the situation awareness provided by the radar is a disruptive solution that will greatly affect the rules and regulations for UAS in the NAS which NASA, the FAA, and other agencies are collaborating on.  NASA AFRC has successful R&D on large scale UAS in the NAS using vehicles such as the Ikhana but will so move towards sUAS such as the DROID3 or Area I.  This proposed radar system with its miniature SWaP form factor has been identified as suitable for installation onboard these sUAS.  Furthermore, detection range and coverage provided by the radar lends itself to be a backup sensor on the large scale UAS without upsetting the current payload limitation.  Finally, since radars are capable of operating in outer space, the proposed radar could theoretically be applied to space mission as well.","The worldwide commercial UAS market is already a multibillion dollar industry and growing at 15 to 20 percent each year.  The U.S. however, is lagging due to FAA restriction on UAS operations primarily due to collision-avoidance concerns.  Research has shown that once unleashed, UAS will be use in agriculture, film/photography, academia, package delivery, law enforcement, and many more creating a multibillion dollar UAS industry in the U.S. almost overnight.  However, to achieve this possibility, UAS operation must first be made safe.  The proposed radar system will be a critical sensor in achieving this safety threshold and therefore, will be applicable to all commercial sUAS that has roughly a 4-lbs payload.  This is expected to include precision agriculture, the movie industry, pipeline monitoring, search and rescue, border patrol, package delivery, and many more.  Beyond Phase II, UAVradars will work towards developing sensor and autopilot integration, creating a complete airborne collision-avoidance package that is plug-and-play to further reach additional markets.  As an example, Amazon in Dec 2015, presented its latest UAS for package deliver which changed form a hexa-copter to fixed-wing aircraft.  This is exactly the type of sUAS that could carry and benefit from the collision-avoidance radar system since flight beyond line-of-sight must be performed to have any commercial value.","Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Electromagnetic; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Perception/Vision; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This is the driving spirit behind NASA's increasing interest in the CubeSat platform, and the vision that is guiding development and demonstration of higher-risk technologies that can eventually lead to low-cost atmospheric science from CubeSats. For example, a tantalizing next-generation CubeSat system would combine a high-gain deployable antenna with a high-frequency Ka-band transponder to support very high bandwidth communications on the order of 10s of Mbps and/or very high-resolution radiometric remote sensing of atmospheric phenomenon. To address this need, Tendeg proposes to develop a Ka-band deployable mesh antenna that can package within a 3U CubeSat volume and deploy to diameters of 0.8-1.5m. The antenna employs a backing structure that is a hybrid wrap-rib/perimeter-truss design. A net supports a reflective mesh while the entire assembly provides the structural depth and surface accuracy needed for Ka-band operation.","The primary NASA target application for the proposed deployable antenna technology is future NASA CubeSat and SmallSat spacecraft for which communications up/downlink or passive RF remote sensing measurement resolution is a major bottleneck in the system design. In particular, the proposed technology will enable very high bandwidth communications on the order of 10s of Mbps and/or very high-resolution radiometric remote sensing of atmospheric phenomenon.","Beyond NASA applications, the proposed deployable antenna technology could see use in other military and commercial applications where data up/downlink or passive RF sensing is also a considerable need.

The EMOS addresses NASA�s need for in situ sensor systems for use on rigid and/or flexible ablative thermal protection system (TPS) materials to measure multiple TPS structural, aerothermal, and aerodynamic response parameters including temperature, heat flux, and pressure. EMOS is based on use of novel materials for high-temperature operation and uniquely designed fiber optic microsensors. The EMOS system is capable of simultaneously measuring multiple TPS response parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, and heat flux) using a suite of miniature (diameter <400 micron) fiber optic sensors. An EMOS will tolerate operating temperatures >1500 degrees C and measurement errors within 0.4% for temperature sensors, 0.2% for pressure sensors, and 20% for heat flux measurement. The outcome of the Phase I EMOS program was the successful feasibility demonstration of the proposed EMOS technology, capable of operating at temperatures at >1500 degrees C. At the end of Phase II, POC will perform a technology readiness level (TRL)-6 demonstration of the EMOS at POC or at NASA facilities, and will deliver to NASA a fully operational EMOS system prototype.","The proposed EMOS system will provide for NASA a distributed and embedded in situ system for measurement of TPS response in aerothermal and aerodynamic environments. It will provide better traceability from the modeling and design tools to actual performance, because the resultant EMOS data can lead to higher-fidelity design tools, improved risk quantification, decreased heat shield mass, and increases in direct payload. For specific NASA applications, these microsensors can be applied to different types of ablative materials used for TPSs including, but not limited to, PICA, PICA-X, SIRCA, Superlight Ablator (SLA), and Avcoat, and those under development for planetary aerocapture and entry as well as return to Earth.","Military applications of the EMOS system will include health monitoring of military aircraft components. The military will benefit from this technology by incorporating EMOS into the engine and drivetrain components of rotorcraft to monitor, in situ and in real time, potential component failure, to reduce the amount of inspection and testing required, and increase reliability and mission availability. Commercial applications include health monitoring of industrial control and heavy equipment used in construction and mining operations, commercial aircraft engines, drivetrain systems, and utility systems. An immediate application of the EMOS system will be monitoring coal-fired power plants, natural-gas-based power plants, geothermal plants, as well as other power-generation facilities throughout the nation.

NASA is a major user of helium and significant future cost savings in operations can be realized with improved monitoring of purge activities.  Without real time measurement of species being purged from systems, extended purge cycles and excess helium is used to ensure completely purged lines.

NASA customers include active structures like space-based deployable telescopes. Phases I/II advance MFC actuator materials to TRL 6 or better for space. Implications of the innovationWhile the piezocomposites needed for active control have flown and are space qualified, their performance has not been quantified under minimal thermal protection to enable large deployable precision structures like 10�30 m class space telescopes. Data is needed on the viability of piezocomposites as control actuators for deployables. MFC actuators also enable structural health monitoring (SHM) methods that expand the potential commercial market.Technical objectivesCVS uses a nanosatellite for LEO tests. Nanosatellites provide low-cost rapid access to space-based testing. CVS leverages our previous NASA research and builds on the Phase I TRL 5 prototype, which is defined as a CubeSat payload. Our earlier work found an unexpected deviation in the behavior of MFC actuators reacting to thermal cycles like those experienced on-orbit. This atypical behavior could cause imprecise deployment in active space structures. We established Phase II feasibility by defining and controlling this behavior. Research descriptionPhase I developed and validated performance evaluation and thermal compensation tools for MFC actuators subjected to thermal cycling, verified weight, size, and power estimates for a flight payload, and established that CVS will fit into a CubeSat. In Phase II we deliver a flight-ready nanosatellite.Anticipated resultsPhase II produces a ready-to-launch TRL 6 or higher nanosatellite compatible with JPL CREAM space environmental sensors. We plan a 6-12 month LEO mission.","CVS is the first extensive spaceflight validation for piezocomposite actuator materials. CVS will establish operational limits, determine long-duration space environmental exposure trends, and evaluate thermal compensation options for the piezocomposite materials needed to control large-scale precision active space-structures like large deployable adaptive optical surfaces. Piezocomposite material applications include active control of composite reflectors (for example, see JPL Active Composite Reflector research), large sunshields, external occulters, large solar arrays for solar electric propulsion and other active structures. Examples include structures like the OCT Lightweight Materials and Structures long-duration deployables. Maintaining the shape of large, high-precision reflectors will be quite difficult; active reflectors that adjust their shape in situ will be cheaper and lighter. JPL CREAM compatibility provides a low-cost path to in-situ real-time space environment measurements that can, for example, unravel complex synergistic environment and interaction degradation effects on materials. Other CVS applications include active shape distortion compensation in non-reflector surfaces, e.g., struts, bipods, etc. Additionally, an active, mission-capable SHM system has a host of key applications like crew safety, ISS utilization, deep-space missions, vehicle mass reduction, and Mars and lunar exploration.","Non-NASA MFC actuator applications include small aperture adaptive optics for nanosatellite-based Earth imaging firms like PlanetLabs and nanosatellite space telescopes like ExoplanetSat. Modern tactical aircraft and hypersonic vehicles require that substantial portions of the structure withstand extreme environments that induce major thermal, mechanical and acoustic loads. A fundamental problem is the dependence of the deformation state of the structure (feedback effect) on these loads (heating, aerodynamic, acoustic)?this could be addressed by the proposed work. Active control is needed for jitter suppression and to compensate for thermal and mechanical disturbances. Commercial space companies need SHM to reduce time to launch and operation costs and improve safety. These needs are particularly important for re-useable vehicles, where information on structural integrity during all stages of flight is important for flight recertification, validation of vehicle operation models, and prediction of remaining service life. Other applications include Homeland Security structural analysis to mitigate threats (preparedness) and assess damage (response), smart structures, and SHM of civil infrastructures, land/marine structures, and military structures.

During Phase I, Innovative Technology Applications Company (ITAC), LLC and researchers from UND developed and demonstrated drag reduction of more than 65% in turbulent boundary layers using the SLIPPS approach. This approach intervenes in the Streak Transient Growth Instability mechanism which is a dominant mechanism in the production of drag in turbulent boundary layer flows. In Phase II, we will investigate and test the use of SLIPPS concept at both higher Mach number and Reynolds number flows, as well as build an improved understanding of the physics in order to make even further efficiency gains possible. Phase III will advance the TRL to a level suitable for flight tests and integration into production systems.","When fully developed, the SLIPPS technology would be widely applicable within NASA. Any system with significant contributions to drag from attached turbulent boundary layers could potentially benefit from this approach. This would include not only flight vehicles, but also test facilities, which could take advantage of the reduced power required to maintain test conditions.","Since fuel costs have historically been the largest single cost of airline operations, any technology which offers significant drag reduction (and thus fuel savings) will be of great interest to aircraft manufacturers.

All vehicles have very tight requirements for the thermal control systems while simultaneously placing incredibly stringent demands upon them. These demands are getting even more intense given the shift towards variable heat rejection, which is essential in missions reaching beyond the lower earth orbit. Specifically, the thermal control fluid must maintain excellent thermal properties for heat rejection under peak conditions while at the same time remain liquid at extremely low temperatures. Currently used fluids either do not meet the low temperature requirement (glycol/water mixture) or do not have thermal properties conducive to a compact, efficient system (Galden).

Solar arrays with higher power, better mass efficiency and improved packaging are critical, especially given NASA interest in solar electric propulsion (SEP).  The Phase I results shows that the Compact Telescoping Array (CTA) architecture, originally conceived by a NASA sponsored team, is a very promising new technology.  Not only has CTA shown outstanding performance metrics, but it does so in a manner that is scalable, reliable and offers compact stowage.The proposed innovation is a solar array design consisting of a single central truss structure flanked by tensioned flexible photovoltaic blankets.  This configuration has been shown in multiple analytical studies to be the most mass efficient for a cantilevered solar array.  Phase I results confirm that CTA has very low structural mass which, with state-of-practice cell technology, allows the platform to deliver excellent specific power.  For example, sub-200 kW systems show specific power approaching 190 W/kg and mega-Watt versions of CTA still produce better than 150 W/kg.The CTA stowed wing achieves the ?compact? attribute due to the fact that the two primary components of the system, the boom and the PV blankets, though by different methods, both stow into highly volume-efficient packages.  The individual boom segments all nest neatly inside one another while the PV blankets stow into compact Z-folded stacks.  The result is a system that is capable of delivering compactness in excess of 100 kW/m?, far beyond expectations.  The CTA system, although a new solar array configuration, is shown through Phase I research to have high reliability.  This is achieved by leveraging heritage mechanical subsystems and by minimizing new mechanism design, thereby effectively delivering a higher TRL than would ordinarily be associated with a new system.  The CTA design draws heavily from heritage designs of Angstrom Designs subcontractor Orbital ATK Goleta.","Potential CTA Phase II and Phase III SBIR contracts will build demonstration units representing 17 and 30 kW systems respectively.  This will advance CTA technology to TRL 6.  Increasing power level step by step advances CTA technology toward larger systems by taking advantage of the natural scalability of the CTA platform.  This will bring SEP power class systems 50 kW and higher well within reach.NASA programs involving large solar arrays would be particularly interested in this technology development path as it directly supports mass-critical SEP mission requirements.  The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) is one relatively near term NASA mission that could benefit from CTA.  Following Phase II and Phase III work, Angstrom Designs expects applications should be in the form of purchase contracts with our subcontractor and commercialization partner, Orbital ATK, to supply ARM or other NASA missions with efficient space power.Phase I results show that a CTA system could supply 50 kW for a potential ARM SEP mission delivering metrics of 190 W/kg specific power and 88 kW/m? power density.  A future Mars cargo SEP mission could be fitted with 190 kW of CTA power with outstanding metrics: 187 W/kg and 98 kW/m?.Versatile packaging, exceptional performance and solid reliability over a wide range of power classes and g-loads all indicate that the CTA platform lends itself well to future NASA missions.","CTA is primarily the combination of flight-qualified components so the design is inherently lower risk than completely new arrays.  After successful completion of the Phase II work, including building and testing a CTA wing, risk will be further reduced and the TRL of CTA will be significantly advanced.  Phase II work will further reduce development costs and risks of future programs.  CTA?s exceptional metrics and packaging versatility are also of great benefit to the non-NASA, commercial market.  Phase II work will advance technology and lower risk to enable commercial infusion beyond NASA.  Commercial satellite enterprises will be able to reap the benefits of reduced solar array mass in the form of increased payload capacity and/or reduced launch costs.  CTA is also an excellent candidate for the advanced arrays needed for GEO-Comm satellites to take advantage of the cost benefits of using SEP and dual launch.  The Phase II demonstrator CTA wing will be representative of a 17 kW system, a power level of interest to the suppliers in the GEO-Comm market. At least two suppliers of commercial satellites, Boeing and Orbital ATK, are currently seeking to replace rigid panel technology with flexible blanket systems in near term programs.Other high probability customers include the department of Defense, Air Force Research Laboratory and foreign governments all of whom have an interest in high power, low mass, low risk, low cost solar arrays.","Actuators & Motors; Deployment; Generation; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",Deployable Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

By virtue of their construction, the photo-generation occurs efficiently and with very high gain, and the devices have been shown to operate over a wide voltage (10-15 V) and temperature range (-170 C to 400 C measured).   Ozark IC's extensive library of SiC analog and mixed-signal IP and its expertise in extreme-environment IC design have been used to create the world's first fully integrated 2-D UV imager (up to 192 x 128 at > 10 frames per second); ready for fabrication in Phase II.

An instrument based on the proposed technique is very feasible and would offer significant advantages in performance, size and weight over a discrete SiC diode-based approach. 2) For planetary composition experiments such as ATLAS and NOW, an instrument capable of generating a faint object spectrograph in the 115 nm - 350 nm UV range is also possible using this technology. 3) For planetary exploration experiments such as the proposed Discovery and New Horizons missions which intend to image planets from orbit or as landers; such as those proposed for Venus, where the high temperature operation of the imager would be desirable.","Other non-NASA markets include Machine Vision, Disinfection, Industrial Controls, Safety, and Diagnostic/Inspection Systems.

The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons.

The innovation is the development of polymer-regolith composites and their efficient fabrication for structural radiation-shielding materials to protect humans on deep-space missions.  The anticipated result is the creation of composite materials that combines in situ resource utilization (ISRU), i.e. regolith, with a hydrogenous polymeric matrix.  Additives, such as boron, could be included to enhance absorption of neutrons generated by interactions of GCR and SPE particles with shielding materials.  The proposed composites have multifunctional properties of radiation shielding against galactic cosmic radiation, neutrons and electromagnetic radiation, and structural integrity to permit use in habitats.","The proposed multifunctional high-performance polymers will find application in NASA missions in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from space hazards, including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing structural components for habitats.  It is expected that these polymer-regolith composite systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used for human habitats.","Multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial sector in reducing collateral damage from heavy charged particles emerging as a therapeutic approach in nuclear medicine.

Currently, NASA heat shield predictive models are not reliably consistent with observed measurements. The proposed concept will provide time-resolved recession measurements that can be used for model validation (both during arc jet test and flight tests). With validated predictive models, NASA can optimize the heat shield design for expected reentry conditions.Additionally, reliable onboard real-time recession measurements could possibly be used to identify localized excessive recession.

CFDRC team proposes an inflatable airlock structure that employs unique fabric architecture capable of delivering the lowest mass and greatest versatility of any competing design. The proposed design features a completely integrated air beam inter-wall to passively generate the wall stiffness required for airlock depressurization?without the mass and bulk of aluminum pressure hulls or complexity of multi-structure adaptations of competing inflatable habitat architectures. This unique architecture utilizes a matrix of braided fiber tendons to contain the structure?s global pressure loads. The underlying woven fabric and gas barrier envelopes are thereby only exposed to minimal local shell loads where they bulge outwards between adjacent tendons. Working in pure tension in the absence of load coupling, the tendon array architecture has been shown to be statically determinate and auto-stabilizing under extreme deflection. The proposed airlock stows compactly for transport to the habitat further reducing logistic costs. Phase I effort focused on conceptual design of the airlock system, identification and evaluation of candidate materials, and characterization of the airlock system. Phase II effort will focus on design refinement, integrated testing, analysis, and integration plan that will culminate in the fabrication and demonstration of a subscale prototype inflatable airlock structure.","Successful completion of this SBIR effort will result in the development of a lightweight fabric inflatable airlock structure for advanced space exploration missions that protect habitable environments and reduce operational and logistical overhead.

These destinations include asteroids, comets, Phobos and Deimos, Titan, Ganymede, Mars and the Moon. Feasibility of these proposed missions is improved if subsystems can be designed to be more robust in operations and survivability such as to reduce the burden of the overall system and preserve critical resources (i.e. power and mass).  In the case of DACEE, the ability to operate a functional electro-mechanical subsystem at temperatures at or below -190C addresses one of NASA's technology hurdles. In Phase 1, a two-axis compact brushless/stepper motion control design was completed with extreme cold operations maintained as the primary design driver.  Individual components of the design were evaluated for risk in achieving these goals.  The highest risk components were thermally tested.  The results of these tests almost completely retired the risk of one component, pending further evaluation, and identified a coherent development path to remedy power regulation needs at extreme temperatures. The objectives of Phase 2 are to deliver a prototype flight-like electromechanical instrument mechanism which includes the fully developed 100 krad tolerant DACEE.  This subsystem will have been cryogenically tested and characterized.  The motors, gear boxes, and actuated components will be selected by leveraging the best in family for cryogenic operations.  The specification of the mechanism will pay close attention to design criteria compatible with achieving significant lifetime actuation cycles based upon appropriate material selections and lubrication approaches. The objective of the Phase 2 activity is to produce a complete instrument mechanism prototype with motion control electronics capable of surviving 100 million revs at the motor.","The applications for the DACEE within NASA's exploration roadmap are numerous. While each investigation has its own unique observational instrumentation needs, the operations contained within those instruments share commonality. For operations which adjust lenses, open covers, pan and tilt, deploy hinges, etc., a stepper or brushless motor control drive capable of delivering between to 1-3 amps @ ~30V covers a broad spectrum of applications. Coupled with the benefits of small form factor and low power means the DACEE can be mounted in or near the instrumentation itself simplifying system level interfacing and control needs. With an expanded operational thermal range the DACEE preserves valuable spacecraft resources by not consuming excess power for heaters or requiring extra mass for radiation protection. The DACEE can operate on weather balloons where temperatures tend to become very cold and challenge typical electronic operational ranges. The DACEE can also be operated in-situ for instruments that may be deployed by future Mars rovers. Again the small size is conducive for space station observatories that need to perform typical scanning and tracking operations.","Outside of NASA's interest, creating a low power, small form factor dual axis controller is very attractive. GEO communication satellites maintain a large number of control interfaces for the ever evolving complicated deployment schemes developed for extending antennas and supporting a variety of hosted payloads. Many satellites include pumps for cooling loops which require similar control needs.  Some of the existing control systems are very outdated and the cost of maintaining legacy electronic systems is becoming increasingly expensive. Providing a robust, rad tolerant, low power commercial control solution based upon the DACEE development could save manufacturers a reasonable amount of cost, power, and mass which could better be allocated for providing additional data services.","Actuators & Motors; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Deployment; Manufacturing Methods; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)",Extreme Environments Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This effort significantly improves the TRL of the system and we exit Phase II with complete validation and having completed a Preliminary Design cycle in support of technology insertion onto the SLS EUS.","CELSIUS has application to NASA as an insulation solution for the exposed Hydrogen tank barrel section on the SLS Exploration Upper Stage (EUS). CELSIUS can, for minimal mass provide ascent-to-orbit protection for the barrel section and excellent long term thermal and MMOD protection. CELSIUS will greatly extend the EUS on-orbit life providing NASA improved mission flexibility for Exploration Missions.  CELSIUS also has future application for orbital propellant depots, habitats, and as a complete launch fairing solution.  In this role, CELSIUS may be an enabling technology that provides a single solution to the ground-to-orbit and long term on-orbit storage of cryogenic propellants.  With CELSIUS there is never a moment when the cryogenic system is unprotected, nor is transfer needed.  The CELSIUS fairing and insulation system is carried directly to orbit and remains to protect the cryogen system from the duration of its useful life. CELSIUS is being investigated for ground applications for improved cryogenic insulation.  This is a particularly large cost for NASA, the United States Air Force, and commercial launch providers who must maintain facilities and produce or deliver cryogenic propellants in large quantities in some of the warmest and most humid regions of the country.","CELSIUS has significant interest from commercial launch providers where it can improvements cryogenic upper stage thermal and MMOD protection for minimal mass.  This enables on-orbit services and mission flexibility in GEO, and planetary missions.

Our Phase I effort began by testing the recycling of current launch packaging materials, identifying several that are possible to recycle.  We then prototyped concepts for sealable bags made with readily recyclable A.M. materials, including Ultem thermoplastic.  We next developed a process for 3D printing customized containers having integral vibration-damping features, and performed testing that revealed this CRISSP packaging can provide vibration protection equivalent to or better than current foam packaging materials.  To fabricate these containers, we developed novel 3D printer infills which can controllably provide a wide range of compression and flexing directions depending on the print parameters. For the highest performing infills, energy attenuation was up to two orders of magnitude better than that of a volumetrically equivalent amount of foam.  We then demonstrated recycling of these test samples into 3D printer filament. The Phase II effort will mature the CRISSP technologies to flight-ready status by performing thorough materials-degradation studies to characterize the performance of the materials as a function of number of recycling iterations, maturing and optimizing our infill generation software to enable highly-automated design of customized CRISSP containers optimized for a given payload�s vibration sensitivities, prototyping 3D printed packaging for a test-case vibration-sensitive payload, and then performing extensive environmental qualification testing to mature the technology to TRL-6 or better.

BeatMark software will significantly decrease the cost of X-Ray mirror production. BeatMark will allow for parametrization of surface metrology data, which will be used as feedback for polishing parameter optimization and metrology experiment planning. By providing the parametrized optical surface description, BeatMark will optimize the costly polishing-and metrology cycle and enable numerical simulation of the performance of new X-Ray mirrors performed by NASA. BeatMark will help fulfill the requirements for sophisticated and reliable information about the expected surface slope and height distributions of prospective X-Ray optics before the optics are fabricated. As we demonstrated in Phase I, an optical surface can be thought of as a stationary uniform stochastic process and modeled with optimal Invertible Time Invariant Filters (InTILF). It was further shown that the modeling of one-dimensional (1D) slope measurements allows highly confident fitting of the X-Ray mirror metrology data with a limited number of parameters and a 10-15% reduction of required length of metrology profiles.  Theoretically, a reduction of 50% is possible.  In Phase II, we will conduct field tests to assess what reduction in metrology is practical and implementable. With the parameters of the InTILF model developed in Phase I, the surface slope profile of optics with a new specification can be forecast reliably. BeatMark will also process 2-D metrology data and provide a polishing optimization method, based on analysis of the mirror quality response to the polishing parameters.

UAM-enabled structures are an important enabler for minimized touch labor and final assembly steps, increased reliability and reduced cost. UAM, by its nature, enables improved lead times by directly printing parts in one machine at one time, eliminating part movements from process to process (and vendor to vendor).The solid state UAM bond in conjunction with an additive / subtractive system allow for custom structures to be manufactured with reinforcing members in any three-dimensional configuration. These composites can be created directly on existing structures manufactured through other processes, resulting in launch structures with lower mass and improved process lead time.The solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for combining any metal combination without formation of brittle intermetallics. This enables layer by layer material changes for complex graded metal structures. This can directly lead to lighter structures with increased structural efficiency by combining multiple functions in one component. The UAM application has potential for manufacturing in space. Processes that melt the substrate material are dangerous for the operator especially during long-duration space flight.

The key element of such systems is a high energy optical source with good beam properties operating in the vicinity of a methane absorption line. A number of very promising architectures for designing high energy lasers at 1651 nm have been described recently, but the performance of the lasers developed in these earlier efforts has been limited by the lack of a sufficiently high-power tunable seed laser. We demonstrated in Phase I of this SBIR program a feasibility  of a high power fiber-coupled, narrow linewidth, tunable  seed laser at 1650nm. For this SBIR Phase II program, we propose to develop and to deliver a robust seed laser that is highly reliable, compact, and which ultimately will allow the realization of much higher performance high energy laser sources designed for methane detection.","Development of a new high power seed laser at 1651 nm will push the performance of LIDAR systems for methane detection to levels not currently possible, and it will allow for the deployment of significantly longer range systems with higher precision measurements of methane concentration and distribution in the Earth's atmosphere. This laser technology to be developed will also potentially provide new capabilities for measurements of other atmospheric constituents and the surface topography of the Earth and other planetary bodies anticipated for numerous NASA mission programs. A significant increase in laser seed power will lead to dramatic enhancements in the stability of operation for methane detection laser transmitters with consequent improvements in overall LIDAR system reliability. Moreover, the wide tuning range and higher efficiency of the proposed seed source can potentially replace several seed lasers that must be used at present for covering a wide spectral range.

In Phase II, we will fabricate a Stirling cryocooler that incorporates the regenerator with high heat capacity, optimize the cooler, and deliver the cryocooler to NASA for further performance characterization at the end of the program.","The successful completion of this program will provide mission planners with a high performance, lightweight, and compact cryocooler that can meet requirements for a variety of missions.

This offers the possibility of entirely new mission classes for space exploration.  However, CubeSats small surface area limits their power availability.  Typical CubeSat arrays are <100 W.  The low power limits their capability, particularly as increased distance from the sun reduces power further.  The low power limits instrument selection, telecommunications options, and electric propulsion usage.To resolve these issues, ExoTerra has developed a CubeSat Solar Electric Propulsion Power Module.  The module incorporates a lightweight deployable solar array with up to 296 W (BOL) of power.  The module efficiently delivers the power to a micro Hall Effect Thruster at nearly 300 V via a direct drive power distribution card.  The specific power of over 140 W/kg and power density of over .17 W/cm3 efficiently packages the module into a 6U CubeSat.  When not needed for electric propulsion, the card steps the voltage down to either 28 or 12 V to deliver high power for either instrument or telecommunications use.ExoTerra builds on the Phase I prototype and functional testing effort by building a qualification unit of the array and direct drive electronics in Phase II.  During the period of performance, we initiate functional and environmental testing to push towards commercializing the technology.","The technology enables multiple NASA mission opportunities.  CubeSats offer the potential for low cost exploration throughout the inner solar system.  With the higher power availability, CubeSat missions can power high deltaV Electric Propulsion to perform interplanetary trajectories.  Once at the target, the arrays enable high power instruments such as lidar for imaging and long range telecommunications to send the data back.  The lightweight arrays also enable CubeSat missions to be conducted further from the sun in low flux regions such as near earth asteroids and even Mars.",The high power arrays have multiple commercial applications as well.  CubeSats have the potential to replace large monolithic satellites with constellations of microsatellites.  The high specific power benefits CubeSats and Microsats generically through reduced weight and launch volume.  This capability can enable the use of higher power payloads or telecommunications.  The arrays also form the foundation of a CubeSat SEP module that can provide high dV rideshare compatible propulsion for the first time.  This enables CubeSats to alter their trajectory from their drop-off orbit and maintain their ideal orbit once they arrive for coordinated constellations.,Deployment; Distribution/Management; Generation,"Small Spacecraft in Deep Space: Power, Navigation, and Structuresis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

While these facilities can be expensive to maintain and operate, the cost to acquire data can be significantly reduced by implementing measurement systems featuring high data capture per test while requiring limited modification or instrumentation of models. There has recently been a significant upturn in the use of fast responding Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) technology. Fast PSP, which offers a means of acquiring unsteady pressure data at millions of locations on a model surface, has long been viewed as a disruptive technology. Recent advancements in fast CMOS camera and LED technology have facilitated the realization of this long promised capability. Data at an individual pixel can be extracted and processed as traditional pressure tap data to identify mean, rms, and spectral content and full data sets can be decomposed spectrally to present the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations spatially at a series of frequencies. Acquisition of the data is only one portion of an effective fast PSP system. Fast PSP systems generate thousands of images in seconds, and each of these images represents a sample of up to one million fast pressure sensors. For maximum productivity, the data must be collected, processed, and a preliminary analysis conducted in near real-time to allow users to identify flow features of interest, and modify the test plan to maximize tunnel test time. The data processing tools must include fast processing of the data and automated analysis tools to identify key flow features in near real-time. The objective of the Phase I and Phase II program is to both identify the fast PSP hardware for a large wind tunnel system, and develop and integrate the data processing tools that will result in a productive system.

Such low-modulus, conformal nanomembrane sensor skins with integrated interconnect elements and electronic devices can be applied to new or existing wind tunnel models for multi-axis surface pressure analysis, or to lightweight UAVs as part of active flutter control systems. NanoSonic has demonstrated the feasibility of NM transducer materials in such sensor skins for the measurement of dynamic shear stress and normal pressure. Semiconductor NM sensor skins are thin, mechanically and chemically robust materials that may be patterned in two dimensions to create multi-sensor element arrays that can be embedded into small probe tips or conformally attached onto vehicle and model surfaces. Sensors may be connected to external support instrumentation either through thin film and ribbon cable interconnects, or potentially wirelessly using RF communication directly from electronic networks incorporated into the sensor skin material.","The anticipated initial market of the NM sensor skin arrays is for flight testing and wind tunnel testing of flow models for NASA flight research centers.

The majority of coding and debugging time is not spent defining the problem physics but instead in balancing computations between multiple heterogeneous devices, handling communication of data, managing distributed memory systems, and providing fault-tolerance. Often, the resulting programs are barely readable as the details of the work being performed are obscured by hardware-specific setup and communication code that dominates a program's codebase. Even worse, the code used to balance computation, manage data communication, and provide fault-tolerance is re-implemented in each piece of an application even though it performs the same tasks across those sections of the software. This makes software more difficult to maintain and upgrade, and hinders porting to new hardware platforms as they become available. The time spent improving, modifying, or debugging these device specific code paths and common code sections could be better spent improving kernel performance or adding new features.To address the problem of separating physical science from computing science, we are developing a solution that decouples the problem definition from the platform-specific implementation details. This is accomplished by dividing the computation into distinct tasks, each of which takes some defined input data and produces some output data. These tasks can then be connected into a task graph by defining their dependencies on each other. This task graph describing a particular code can then be used to automatically manage data and schedule work across heterogeneous devices without requiring further user intervention. Therefore, to make use of new hardware, the user need only port any tasks that might take advantage of the new hardware, and all scheduling, data management, and synchronization required are handled automatically.","These tools could be used to reduce software development and maintenance time and improve the computational performance and scalability of a variety of high-performance computing applications. Specifically, we intend to initially focus on applying this technology to GEOS-5 for earth modeling, this framework can also benefit other earth modeling packages.

During Phase 1, Honeybee Robotics investigated several techniques for providing hermetic sealing such as Knife Edge, Shape Memory Alloy, C-ring, O-ring and Induction Brazing. These were identified as promising hermetic sealing approaches which can be applied to Sample Return (SR) missions, such as the Flagship Mars SR, New Frontiers (NF) Comet SR and the Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin SR, identified by the NRC Decadal Survey as the primary missions for the next decade. The sealing system would be used to store samples of rocks, soils, atmospheric gas, ice or icy-soil. Based on Phase 1, we determined that a brazing approach is the optimum method of sealing planetary samples and should be used as a primary seal. Knife edges and O-rings should be pursued as secondary and redundant (backup) seals, respectively. Therefore, we propose to design and fabricate hermetic sealing canisters and test their hermeticity to achieve leak rates of 10-7 atm cc/sec He. The canisters will be exposed to dust and thermal cycles to reach TRL 5/6 at the end of the Phase 2.","Future robotic astrobiology and geology missions such as Mars Sample Return, as well as Lunar, Comet and Asteroid sample return missions will benefit greatly from the ability to hermetically seal samples in a dusty environment. A robust sample canister that is dust tolerant will greatly reduce the complexity of support equipment that may otherwise be required to clean containment vessels prior to sealing.","Terrestrial uses of robust hermetically sealed containers might include telerobotic inspection and sampling of hazardous materials: chemical, biological, or nuclear. Tele-operated robots can go into many hazardous areas which humans cannot. These robots could be outfitted with canisters with hermetic seals which function in the presence of dirt, dust and chemicals. The canisters could be robotically filled with hazardous material, and hermetically sealed using the induction brazing technique. For example, when using a double walled cylinder approach, the outer contaminated sleeve could be separated, leaving the internal chamber sealed and safe for human handling and laboratory analysis.","Heat Exchange; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling",Contamination Control and Planetary Protectionis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

However, those techniques are intrusive, bandwidth limited, time consuming to implement, require extensive data processing and the resulting data may ultimately generate false results in the form of pseudo (noise) sources. Advanced Systems & Technologies Inc. proposes an optical non-contact sensor fusion concept which, for the first time, enables direct capture and observation of full-field non-stationary dynamic structural vibrations (SV) and unsteady radiated sound fields or transient flow fields around the structure of interest. SV depict the flow of energy in a structure and provides an unambiguous identification of structural noise sources and sinks. Additionally, the ability to capture and correlate the acoustic/flow field data with the structure borne intensity, offers an unprecedented and rapid diagnostic capability for noise source characterization and evaluation of noise abatement systems. In addition to being non-intrusive the measurements are fast, can be made at operationally relevant bandwidths, which extend to the ultrasonic domain, and provide deeper insight into the complex structural dynamics which are the root cause of noise emission.","The ICARUSV contributes towards current and future noise reduction goals by providing a diagnostic tool for evaluation of a wide range of aircraft structures designed to effect noise reduction. Examples of applications include testing of continuous mould line wing structures, drooped leading edge, active flow control, adaptive and flexible wing structures, smart cheverons, and toboggan fairings. Related applications include evaluation of engine noise reduction systems such as Ultra High Bypass engines, distortion-tolerant fans and variable fan nozzles. The ability to visualize energy flow paths between sources and sinks on the structure will elucidate the contribution of specific design features in determining these paths and suggest design modifications which mitigate or redirect this energy away from specific locations. ICARUSV also offers a new tool for identification of vehicle specific aero-elastic instabilities and for fundamental aeronautic studies related to ground testing, wind tunnel tests, and flight experiments.","The parallel sensor architecture of the ICARUSV overcomes limitations in existing technology, introducing, for the first time, a true imaging modality to the laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The ICARUSV concept and related instruments is thus anticipated to appeal to a broad spectrum of applications and industries where existing commercial single beam LDV�s are currently employed. In addition to performing routine vibration measurements much more efficiently (orders of magnitude faster than LDV) the imaging modality of the ICARUSV is anticipated to find new diagnostic capability beyond those of traditional LDV, including aerospace, automotive, electronics and industrial plants applications.

Under our Phase I program, Fibertek successfully demonstrated the capability of a new laser source, a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Er:YAG laser to generate millijoule output near 823 nm that was tunable through water-vapor absorption lines for DIAL measurements. The new laser system offers simplicity and efficiency that will reduce risk for future airborne and space-based missions. Significantly, the new laser approach offers an upgrade path with reduction in size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption over current state-of-the-art DIAL based on less-efficient non-linear parametric conversion of diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. This new-generation technology reduces the size and weight of flight hardware to make it compatible with affordable, more capable airborne and satellite payloads. In Phase II we propose to build on our successful Phase I demonstration to develop a full scale water vapor laser transmitter source, meeting or exceeding requirements for planned DIAL instruments.","Fibertek is working closely with NASA LaRC and the Earth Sciences Technology Office (ESTO) to develop reliable, efficient laser sources meeting the requirements for advanced instruments for remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere on a global scale.  The data provided by these sensors is critical in supporting and validating climate modeling. The novel near infrared laser with frequency conversion will enable lidar systems to be based initially on research aircraft and high-altitude UAVs for global sensing of the atmospheric water vapor and methane. The LaRC/ESTO HALO instrument planned for initial deployment in 2016 is an example of an opportunity for transition of the new technology into a fielded system.   We anticipate partnering with NASA on future IIPs, ACT and EV programs to fully develop the high-performance systems built around the laser transmitter delivered under this SBIR program.","Long-range lidar systems are entering production in all branches of the military.  Increasingly these active systems require higher power for greater range and sensitivity.  The requirement for eye safety dictates that these 3D imaging and range finding systems operate in the near infrared between 1450 and 1700 nm.  The Er:YAG source with fundamental wavelength at 1645 nm developed under this SBIR program is well matched to requirements of planned 3D imaging lidars and rangefinders.  With average power greater than 10 W, diffraction-limited beam quality and nanosecond pulse width, the proposed laser system has high utility for lidar systems for aircraft, ship and ground vehicle installation.  Space-based lidar systems for DoD are also in the planning stages, and will benefit from the availability of the technology being developed under this program.",Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics),Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The ESG gripper couples an electrostatic Perception Robotics is developing an innovative product, the ?Electrostatic Gecko Gripper(ESG Gripper), for the industrial automation market.  This unique gripping solution overcomes the shortcomings of vacuum grippers by eliminating the need for a compressed air system and offering more rapid actuation, thus achieving significant cost savings and throughput improvements in customers manufacturing processes.  The ESG gripper couples an electrostatic adhesive with an adhesive element inspired by gecko feet.  When the electrostatic and gecko adhesives work together, a positive feedback cycle is created that, depending on surface type, can be greater than the sum of its parts.  As the gecko adhesive engages, it brings the electrostatic adhesive closer to the surface, thus increasing its adhesive force; in turn, the electrostatic adhesive helps engage more of the fibrillar stalks of the gecko adhesive.  Previous experimental results have shown that the combination adhesive technology can provide up to 5.1x greater adhesion that an electrostatic or gecko-like adhesive alone.This body of work will result in two hardware and software deliverables for transfer to NASA:1.A piezoelectrically driven rig to automate and normalize the post-treatment process for improving the gecko adhesive (Q3CY1)2.An improved industrial electrostatic gecko gripper with sensing and control software for an industrial robot.  This factory-ready unit will position us well for production of a flight-ready version in Phase III.  (Q4CY2)","NASA?s interest in this technology stems from Subtopic: S4.02 Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling.  This technology could benefit several NASA initiatives including in-space assembly, satellite service and salvage, space debris mitigation & elimination, gripping mechanisms for free-flyers (e.g. AstroBee) and spacecraft inspection.Of specific interest is the ISS Remote Inspection System (IRIS) being developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, 2015). This system utilizes gecko-inspired adhesive feet to anchor IRIS to the micro-gravity environment of the ISS.  The development of the ESG gripper would result in a significant performance increase in the adhesion of the feet in a low-cost, low-energy package.  Another candidate JPL target for this technology is the In-Space Telescope Assembly project or other in-space assembly programs, as the gripper can function as an end-of-arm-tool (EOAT) for manipulation of large, flat objects such as positioning and holding of solar panels to a backbone truss.This technology is also particularly well-suited for satellite servicing and salvage, as the combined gecko and electrostatic gripping mechanisms are able to grip smooth rigid surfaces as well as thermal blankets.","Industrial manufacturing is rife with applications in which gripping an object is challenging or impossible with conventional grippers due to the shape or fragility of the object.  Current solutions often rely on complex and expensive vision systems, vacuum or custom grippers, and/or repetitive, injury-prone manual labor.  The ESG Gripper provides a simple and cost-effective solution to these situations.While there is a wide range of potential applications for adhesive gripping solutions in industrial automation, we have identified solar panels and glass manufacturing as the primary target markets due to the industries? versatility, expansiveness, and expressed interest in our solution.  Other potential markets include aerospace and automobile manufacturing, packaging and warehousing, hazardous materials handling, palletizing applications, and medical device manufacturing.

Humans require faster learning curves for introduction of more complex robotics in space, but the only way to accomplish this is to acquire open source software on easily adaptable hardware. This will enable astronauts to perform multiple design cycles while they are in space, such as on the ISS. Swift Engineering is proposing a lightweight surround visual and sensory feedback system for robotic pilots that can easily be transferable, and is modular and scalable to any robotic system. Using 360 degree cameras, LIDAR, and a Myo armband, the robotic pilot will be able to quickly adapt to any environment from anywhere, including mission control. The key is that all of this work is being built from open source platforms so that nothing becomes overly proprietary, and astronauts can perform design cycles in space quickly and efficiently.","NASA applications that could be considered are: (1) Adaptation of the robotic arms onto an assistive free flyer capable of autonomously monitoring  the environment. When an anomaly is present, the human operator can control and manipulate the environment with the robotic arms with full surround sensors. (2) Repair satellites will be required in the future, and full autonomy is unable to predict every anomaly and complexity. This system will require a human-in-the-loop with immersive technology and surround sensors. (3) Canadarm augmentation will be necessary as space stations grow, and humans are required to operate closer to moving robotic objects in space. Full system surround knowledge will be required with a human-in-the-loop at all times for risk reduction. (4) Rover robotic arms and/or backpack arms and/or quadcopter arms and/or ATHLETE robotic arms: human-in-the-loop robotic arm manipulation is required for non-redundant, risk adverse space environments. (5) As NASA plans to build structures on the moon and Mars utilizing robotic technicians, there will need to be a ?supervisory robotic assistant with situational awareness and full dexterity to control fully autonomous robots.","Non-NASA Applications are: (1) Prosthetics: brain training whereby the physical therapist moves his/her arm and the amputee?s arm moves in succession. Brain waves can be monitored and trained to then move in that same motion. Never before have physical therapists and robotics been able to interact in such a way. (2) Education: STEM students will bring about change by understanding how they can help others with a tool where they have surround situational awareness and can manipulate the environment remotely. (3) Extreme Work Environments: Swift Engineering uses freezers and autoclaves in daily operation. If the engineering staff could enter an immersive environment and enter the freezer to remove need prepreg material rolls, time and energy costs would be reduced from the standard of opening up the freezer manually up to 50 times a day. If a vacuum sealed bag leaks in the autoclave, an engineer could fix it remotely without opening the autoclave, and hundreds of parts a year would not be affected. (4) Underwater vehicles: At extreme depths submarines need a better method to control the robotic arms that are on the front of their submarines. If pilots were inside the submarine, and could manipulate the robotic arm similar to their own arm, control would be vastly superior to current methods.

Key current capabilities are: (a) advanced image processing for visual odometry based on stereo processing and an innovative routine of feature detection, tracking, and pruning for highly accurate robot motion and position estimation; (b) improved localization by vision and inertial system fusion; (c) simultaneous online local and global mapping; and (d) vision and touch based terrain traversability estimation using a combination of environment classification, ground plane detection, and ground interface analysis. During Phase II, the system will be customized for operating in indoor and outdoor environments and for any robotic vehicle type with the goal of increased autonomy by providing a complete GNSS-free awareness of location, an understanding of surrounding environments, and the ability to navigate autonomously. Areas of work in Phase II include: (1) customization to NASA's robotic platforms such as Robonaut; (2) accurate localization over multiple kilometer distances without GNSS; (3) complete integrated touch and vision based traversability system; (4) holistic scene and indoor/outdoor environment understanding; (5) consistent global map generation with included traversability information; (6) optimal route planning with obstacle avoidance for autonomous navigation; (7) robustness to diverse or adverse conditions in indoor or planetary environments; and (8) verification & validation, embedded development, and implementation in robotic vehicles. The final system can be applied to a variety of systems for NASA, the military, and in the commercial sector.","The RT-INSPEX will directly support NASA�s future missions ranging from the exploration of remote planetary surfaces (assuming very limited and time-delayed Earth-based communication) to assistive operations in man-made structures such as the International Space Station (ISS). The pervasive use of intelligent robotics with accurate navigation capabilities will enhance exploration and facilitate mapping of uncharted regions. This particularly benefits planetary exploration mobile robotic platforms such as the Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity Mars Rovers. Another application would be the �K10� series from the NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group. However, the very flexible and modular nature of the system and software lends itself to operation in indoor environments as well such as the case with the Robonaut 2 at the ISS. For instance, the RT-INSPEX can be used to help obtain an autonomous understanding of the Robonaut's surroundings such as identifying important objects that should be avoided or interacted with, and to facilitate navigation along corridors without relying on any type of external guidance.","One of the main objectives of this SBIR is the commercialization of the research results. The RT-INSPEX is a highly useful system for GNSS-free robotic navigation and environment understanding and therefore presents significant application potential for a wide range of non-NASA systems within both the civilian and military sectors. The technology is closely aligned with developments related to self-driving vehicles, where the ability to classify terrain, objects, etc. is very important for collision avoidance and navigation along roads. The capability of localization without GNSS using vision can be used to know one's position in consumer applications when GPS is not available or intermittent. Further areas the technology would find application in include: (1) commercially available and military based personnel tracking devices; (2)  GPS-free navigation for both manned and unmanned ground, air, and sea vehicles; (3) military missions involving unmanned platforms; (4) accurate floor plan mapping of GPS-denied indoor environments that pose a risk for human intervention; (5) robotic surveillance applications; (6) aiding search and rescue missions; and (7) local law enforcement agencies for detecting the locations of harmful objects.",3D Imaging; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Inertial (see also Sensors); Intelligence; Navigation & Guidance; Optical; Perception/Vision; Ranging/Tracking; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),"Human Robotic Systems - Mobility Subsystem, Manipulation Subsystem, and Human System Interaction   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Broad commercialization will focus on direct sales to government, commercial, and nonprofit organizations that need to process and analyze large environmental datasets for applications ranging from climate change and risk assessment to watershed management and regional planning.  Local governments in particular will provide a major marketing opportunity. Therefore, outreach efforts will be directed at the GIS, Water, Transportation, and Planning/Zoning Departments within these government units that are most likely to be facing critical geospatial data processing challenges.

The relative magnitude of the two varies depending on altitude, temperature and the planet.  Usually radiation is more significant at lower pressures and at higher temperatures.  Gas conduction is more dominant at higher pressures and lower temperatures.  In most planetary entries, both modes of heat transfer are significant.   Typical flexible or rigid refractory ceramic fiber Thermal Protection System (TPS) such as Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) and Shuttle tiles can take high temperatures, can reduce gas conduction at lower pressures, and scatter radiation at higher temperatures.

An unobtrusive system to measure, assess, and predict Astronaut cognitive workload can indicate when steps should be taken to augment cognitive readiness. This system can also support testing and engineering (T&E); engineers can accurately evaluate the cognitive demands of new tools and systems, as well as how they affect task performance. In our Phase I effort, Charles River Analytics designed and demonstrated a system for Cognitive Assessment and Prediction to Promote Individualized Capability Augmentation and Reduce Decrement (CAPT PICARD). CAPT PICARD: (1) robustly and unobtrusively performs real-time synchronous data collection with a suite of sensors to provide a holistic assessment of the Astronaut; (2) extracts, fuses, and interprets the best combination of indicators of Astronaut state; (3) comprehensively predicts performance deficits, optimizing the likelihood of mission success; and (4) displays the data to support the information requirements of any user. The solicitation defined the following Phase I goals: review physiological, neurophysiological, and cognitive assessments in extreme environments and long duration missions; design an algorithm to assess workload. We did focus on these goals; however, we went beyond them to also demonstrate a functional prototype by the end of Phase I. Based on the success of this Phase I effort, we recommend a Phase II effort to refine and develop each component of CAPT PICARD, and iteratively evaluate this system in an undergraduate lab, at a T&E lab at Johnson Space Center (JSC), and in a mission-like analog environment at JSC. Successful completion of these tasks will result in a tool that can both dramatically improve Astronaut mission readiness and the design and development of tools Astronauts use to carry out mission objectives.","We expect the full-scope Cognitive Assessment and Prediction to Promote Individualized Capability Augmentation and Reduce Decrement (CAPT PICARD) system to have immediate and tangible benefit for NASA. In particular, CAPT PICARD will help monitor the workload of Astronauts over short- and long-duration missions. We plan to enhance the effectiveness of widely-used tools, such as assessments that interrupt task performance, including the Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test used by Astronauts on ISS missions (NASA, 2014) by incorporating the innovations developed under CAPT PICARD. Augmenting these tools will enable the crew monitoring Astronauts to cue Astronauts of impending deficits to augment mission performance. CAPT PICARD will also enable more effective testing and engineering by measuring the workload created by new tools and systems during design and development instead of during deployment. This capability will ultimately result in increased Astronaut performance and decreased cost to deploy technology to Astronauts, furthering NASA's goals of expanding the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space, and developing technologies to improve the quality of life on our home planet.","We see two approaches to commercializing the technologies developed under this program. First, they can be licensed to other commercial entities that will use them directly or incorporate them as added functionality to their commercial products. In particular, long-haul trucking and shipping crew experience similar challenges as Astronauts' long periods of low workload. Therefore, we will look at companies in the long- and short-duration shipping market, including UPS and FedEx, as potential licensees of this technology. Second, we will incorporate this new technology into our HumanSense? software, which will both increase its appeal as a commercial product and enable us to use the tool to provide consulting services based on HumanSense to customers within the DoD, other Federal agencies, and commercial markets.",Computer System Architectures; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures,Unobtrusive Workload Measurement   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

NASA in collaboration with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) has been conducting research in developing technologies to enable Distributed Engine Control (DEC) architectures. Realization of such future intelligent engines depends on the development of both hardware and software, including high temperature electronics and sensors to make smart components. NASA is particularly interested in the design and development of these applications for assessing the benefit they bring to the engine system. Compressor discharge pressure measurement has long been a key aspect of turbine engine control to manage stall margin. Given that, there is a need for a high-temperature, smart P3 sensor as a key building block for distributed engine controls. Given the current limitations of high temperature electronics, the business case for smart control elements (sensors and actuators) can be made in the fan/compressor section of the engine. The long-term objective of the proposed effort is to advance high-temperature P3 sensor technology for DEC applications through working with OEM partners and industry working groups to: (1) to iterate the current technology toward DEC formats/functions, (2) advance the digital electronics design/firmware and high temperature electronics, and (3) (through demonstration and stakeholder collaboration) present the viability (technical and business case) of the proposed sensor.","The proposed sensor directly supports NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) research thrusts including vehicle safety, efficiency and carbon emission reduction. The proposed sensor is broadly applicable to NASA GRC efforts in vehicle health monitoring and advanced controls.   The sensor is also directly applicable to a planetary exploration mission to Venus since a high temperature sensor that does not require cooling will significantly reduce payload weight, volume, and complexity. Space propulsion systems, including chemical rockets, nuclear thermal propulsion, launch and station keeping, all exhibit high temperatures and would benefit from the proposed technology. Energy generation systems such as Stirling engines and fuel cells also have high operational temperatures that could be monitored by the proposed sensor. In situ resource utilization systems utilize high temperatures and pressures and would benefit from the proposed technology. Derivative sensor technology could potentially be applied for sensing conditions in thermal protection systems for alloy and ceramic matrix composite structural components.","Aero propulsion turbine engines, communally used in commercial and military jets, would benefit significantly by having a non-invasive, small mass, on engine component sensor allowing for visibility of the conditions in the turbine engine. The technology and sensor product described in this proposal would allow exactly that, while existing sensors fall well short of the application's demand. The conditions in this application are harsh, and sensors must be able to withstand high temperatures, high pressures, high flow rates, jet fuel, and exhaust. In order for existing and future aero propulsion turbine engines to improve safety, reduce cost, and emissions while controlling engine instabilities, more accurate and complete information is necessary. The technology described in this proposal would allow the next boundary in sensing technology to be achieved: direct measurement from the point of interest within the turbine. Commercial applications abound for the successful results of this proposal in commercial and military turbine engine industries, which are made up of companies such as GE, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce.

The CAVoR thermally extracts ice and water bound to clay minerals, which is then combined with small amounts of oxygen to gasify organic matter contained in carbonaceous chondrite asteroids. In addition to water, CAVoR produces hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide that comprise precursors to produce oxygen for propellant and breathing gas and to produce organic compounds including fuels such as methane when integrated with a downstream methanation-electrolysis. Thermochemical production of hydrogen by CAVoR results in substantial reductions in electrolysis mass and power requirements compared to combustion-based volatile recovery methods. A conceptual Phase II continuous flow auger reactor design was based on successful Phase I batch reactor operations. Phase II advancements will include reactor seal designs to accommodate regolith simulant feeding and discharging while collaborations will be developed to aid the infusion of the CAVoR system into a conceptual asteroid resource utilization mission plan.","The primary application of the Carbonaceous Asteroid Volatile Recovery (CAVoR) system is to provide a compact, high performance apparatus for the extraction and recovery of water and organic matter in support of propellant production, breathing gas, and life support. The in-space production of these mission critical items results in substantial launch cost savings and can help to enable the extension of NASA's mission beyond low earth orbit to include long-duration space habitation, lunar, and Mars colonization missions.","The autothermal steam reforming technology proposed for the CAVoR has applications in the recovery of water and energy values from terrestrial wastes and resources. Steam reforming technology has mostly been applied to feed matter containing only small amounts of inorganic matter. The efficient use and recovery of process heat to be established during the CAVoR program will enable non-catalytic autothermal steam reforming technology to be applied to feeds such as contaminated soils, low-grade hydrocarbon feeds, oil shale, un-sorted municipal waste, and other organic materials, including renewable resources. By so doing, many otherwise refractory, hazardous compounds can potentially be broken into syngas constituents for use as fuels rather than being incinerated with no economic gain. The CAVoR technology will be poised for entry into the growing market demand for waste volume reduction and low-grade fuels resources.

Semplastics has developed a novel, innovative ceramic material which is lightweight, low-cost, and ideal for application as a mirror substrate. High-thickness, high-stiffness objects with excellent dimensional stability, low density, and low coefficient of thermal expansion can be manufactured in one piece through our energy-efficient process. Semplastics is proposing to extend prior research and manufacturing process development to produce larger-scale circular mirrors. This innovation will reduce mirror costs per square meter by an order of magnitude over current approaches based on glass or glass-ceramic solutions. As a part of the Phase II effort, Semplastics will deliver to NASA four large mirrors (up to 0.6m in diameter), sealed to address the residual surface porosity using one of two different coating systems, with ground and polished surfaces. At the end of Phase II, we will have matured and developed our production processes such that we are ready to establish the capability to produce mirrors of one meter diameter or larger.","Several NASA activities benefit from improvements in mirror performance as well as a significant reduction in areal costs. Earth-observing and space-observing telescopes that are either balloon-borne or on-orbit have a constant need to reduce the cost and mass of their optical systems. In NASA?s search for extraterrestrial life, the mission is to locate stars with planets similar to Earth. Mirror technology is a significant key in determining whether an exoplanet's atmosphere has atmospheric water vapor or carbon dioxide as well as measuring other atmospheric chemicals. Other NASA programs with interest in improved mirror technology include the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractory Observatory (CLARREO), and the European Space Agency (ESA)/NASA dark-energy mission Euclid. WFIRST is a NASA observatory designed to perform wide-field imaging and surveys of the near infrared (NIR) sky. The CLARREO effort is a future Earth-observing mission that will establish climate benchmarks in order to assess optimizing strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. The Euclid space observing mission will address questions related to the fundamental physics and cosmology on the nature and properties of dark energy, dark matter, and gravity. Reduced mirror areal costs translate directly to cost savings on these projects, increasing chances of success.","Commercial applications for this technology outside of NASA are numerous. In the short term, direct application of the process developed under Phase II to create optics can be used to manufacture mirrors for professional and amateur astronomy / telescopes, as well as adaptive mirrors for military, medical, and automotive applications.

While the technology for unmanned air vehicles operating day in and day out without constant human supervision is maturing steadily, much remains to be done to make these vehicles commonplace. We have identified a number of challenges that must be addressed for these vehicles to safely and efficiently conduct their tasks in the National Airspace System (NAS). Civilian applications of UAS must ensure that they can: (1) fly safely without an operator, using but not relying on maps or GPS to guide their course; and (2) deal with contingencies, especially rare events such as complete failure of sensors that provide awareness of the environment. We plan to address these challenges in the context of small, low-cost air vehicles in a manner that will enable our technology to be widely adopted. In Phase I we have demonstrated GPS-free navigation and environmental mapping in real time on a kilogram-scale sensing and computing payload for a small multi-rotor aircraft. The demonstration was noteworthy because it was conducted in complex environments in which GPS signals are blocked or degraded by multipath. In Phase II we propose to extend GPS-free navigation to a larger set of operating environments and to show collision-free guidance from take-off to landing with emphasis on the phases at low altitudes. We will work with the UTM team at NASA Ames to coordinate our experiments on block 4 testing.  We expect to show in this program that it is possible for small autonomous air vehicles to reliably and safely fly in the first and last 50 feet of operation.","Safe and robust flight and landing are of great application to NASA. On the air side, the proposed technology can be refactored as a safety aid for aircraft that must operate in degraded visual environments or in unprepared sites, providing information to a human pilot. On the space side, NASA has enduring interests in low-form factor sensing that could be applied to landers. Additionally, Near Earth's technology will provide an enhanced capability, enabling more comprehensive UAS flight-testing for NASA's collaborative efforts with the FAA to accommodate UAS operations in the NAS. As the capabilities mature and are integrated into more air vehicles, they will also be of direct use to NASA in their flight testing of navigational aids and guidance systems located in remote areas. The proposed autonomous technology will enable greater utilization of UAS in other NASA areas, particularly for experimentation and testing, for example expanding the utilization of UAS in the Ames FINESSE volcano research. The technology will ultimately enable greater use of UAS in space. A UAS that knows its position and is able to set down and avoid obstacles in a cluttered environment can be used for repairs inside and outside a spacecraft and perform exploration of planetary surfaces. The successful development of the technology specified in this solicitation will enable NASA and its contractors involved with autonomous systems to accomplish testing with increased safety and decreased cost.","The UAS market is forecast to require hundreds-of-thousands of units within just a few years of the FAA establishing the appropriate regulatory procedures for the operation of UAS in the NAS. An enhanced capability for safe and robust autonomous take-off and landing will fuel the market's forecast growth. Technology ensuring the safe operation of UAS, particularly during the first and last 50 ft of flight, will contribute to testing that verifies the safety of UAS operations as well as providing regulators, legislators, and the general public with increased confidence in UAS operations. UAS are already in high demand, and they are being used in an increasing number of applications. Military UAS requirements are well documented and tens-of-thousands of UAS are already in use worldwide. The ability to take-off and land in tactical cluttered environments will allow UAS to be used more extensively in support of forward units. Additionally, the commercial market is forecast to grow to as many as 160,000 UAS. As soon as UAS operation in the national airspace is fully implemented, the cargo transportation market, in particular, is forecast to be the largest market segment.

A key component of the Starshade structural system is a series of dimensionally stable composite cables (or spokes) that connect the center structural hub to the perimeter truss and largely determine the deployed shape and stiffness of the system much like a bicycle wheel.  There are many challenges in developing the Starshade spoke. Perhaps most notable is that meeting the CTE requirement necessitates accurate control of fiber volume fraction (resin content) to less than 1%. Also challenging is that meeting the stiffness precision goal of less than 0.5% variation between cables demands that minimal fiber fraying and damage be allowed during the tow spreading and alignment process and that the net cross section be made in one step with no required post-processing.

The feed system features an innovative piezo driven valve that saves volume, mass, cost, and energy with respect to state of the art alternatives. The feed system also features a low mass plastic propellant tank that may be manufactured through additive processes.  This allows low cost, complex shapes that can maximize the use of available space inside volume-restricted spacecraft.  The feed system will be especially attractive for small spacecraft and CubeSats. Iodine stores as a solid and sublimates at modest temperatures as the molecule I2, which allows many benefits with respect to traditional Hall effect thruster fuels such as xenon and krypton.  These advantages include higher storage density, lower storage pressure, the ability to test high power systems at space-relevant conditions in modest facilities, the capability to store propellant in space without active regulation, and the capacity to transfer propellant at low-pressure conditions in space.  In a space-limited spacecraft, using iodine instead of state of the art xenon could increase available delta-V by a factor of three (3) or more. In Phase I, Busek developed a feed system featuring the advanced components, which was integrated into the iSAT spacecraft form factor.  The system was then tested with an iodine compatible Hall effect thruster in relevant space conditions.  In Phase II, an improved feed system will be designed, built and tested.  Major Phase II technical objectives include developing an engineering model iodine resistant, piezo driven flow control valve, finalizing the feed system control architecture, identifying and evaluate commercial components to fill out the system, and building and characterizing the system.  At the conclusion of the Phase II effort, engineering model valves will be delivered to NASA for further characterization.","The proposed feed system supports iodine Hall thrusters, ion engines, hollow cathodes, and other plasma generators currently under development for NASA.  Possible near term applications include the Iodine Satellite (iSat), Lunar IceCube, and follow-on missions.  The Phase II feed system will be ideally sized for a Hall thruster operating at power levels of 100 W to 600 W, and for gridded ion engines operating at similar or lower power levels.  These thrusters would be used for orbit raising and interplanetary transfers.  Missions of current interest include resource prospecting at the moon, Mars, asteroids, and NEOs.  The technology is applicable to spacecraft of all sizes from CubeSats to Asteroid Redirect spacecraft to future MW-class cargo transports supporting human exploration. The ability to flow iodine as a HET propellant is a the game changer.  Iodine is efficient, compact, highly storable, and an order of magnitude cheaper than xenon.  Full power thruster demonstrations and throttling in space conditions are feasible because iodine is efficiently pumped by liquid nitrogen cooled panels.","The proposed feed system supports many types of plasma generators used in space and on the ground.  In the near term, the innovative feed system components are most likely to be used as part of a space propulsion system.  Commercial and military applications for iodine propulsion include orbit raising, orbit circularization, inclination changes, station-keeping and repositioning.  The next stage for commercial users is an all-electric satellite, where electric propulsion accomplishes all propulsion functions.Beyond stored density and pressure, iodine has many additional benefits with respect to xenon.  For instance, a fully-fueled, non-active system may be stored on the ground or on orbit for long periods of time.  This reduces the cost of on-orbit spares, and minimizes down-time in the event of a failure.  Low pressure on-orbit refueling is also feasible.  Due to these and other advantages, iodine may be very attractive for commercial missions such as asteroid mining.","Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Material Handing & Packaging; Polymers; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Prototyping; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine",Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Since propellant tanks are generally the largest individual mass item on a launch vehicle or spacecraft, this mass savings of this magnitude can have profound effect on vehicle performance.  A conceptual design of a spherical BHL cryotank for the NASA Morpheus Lander shows an 80% reduction in mass from the existing aluminum cryotanks.  Replacing all four metal tanks on Morpheus with BHL cryotanks would provide the lander with more than 15% additional ∆V.In the Phase II effort, GTL will develop a spherical BHL cryotank suitable for use on the Morpheus lander.  This will include fabrication and testing of a full scale (48? diameter) developmental unit, followed by the fabrication and delivery of a prototype spherical BHL cryotank.  This effort will also demonstrate the capability to integrate propellant management devices into the spherical BHL cryotank.","The immediate application for the 48? diameter spherical BHL cryotank is on NASA?s Morpheus Lander.  Replacing the existing metal tanks on Morpheus with BHL cryotanks would reduce tank mass by 75%, which would translate into more than 15% additional ∆V.NASA?s Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer project (CPST) could benefit from the reduced mass of spherical BHL cryotanks and the long-term cryogenic propellant storage potential.  The BHL cryotank technology could also be used to upgrade the NASA Space Launch System (SLS).  If implemented for the entire vehicle, SLS could potentially deliver double the payload of the current design.","The BHL technology provides performance benefits to a wide spectrum of industries and applications by offering a light weight alternative for transporting cryogenic propellants.  A leading application for BHL technology is liquid natural gas (LNG) storage and transportation.  All LNG is currently transported using ships, train cars, or trucks over the road using massive double walled metal tanks to transport the LNG. Using a cryogenic-compatible BHL composite, the overall weights of these transportations methods could be reduced, greatly cutting shipping costs.One of the most significant sectors for BHL commercialization is in launch vehicles (commercial, military and NASA).  Traditionally, metal propellant tanks are the most massive components in a launch vehicle and constrain vehicle performance.  When BHL cryotanks are substituted for metal tanks in conventional launch vehicles, the mass savings would double the launch vehicle performance.","Aerodynamics; Composites; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)",Cryogenic Fluid Management for In-Space Transportation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Fault Management (FM) is a crucial mechanism to ensure system functionality from system design through the operational phase of a mission. FM is implemented with spacecraft hardware, on-board autonomous software that controls hardware, software and information redundancy, ground-based software and procedures. Given that most NASA missions require highly complex systems, at least a basic level of fault detection and isolation capability is almost always added on to them to protect against thousands of potential failure modes. It is therefore imperative to treat FM like any other engineering discipline and formalize the tools, metrics and best practices to ensure a uniformly high quality of implementation of FM across all NASA missions. The proposal to utilize recent advances in the theory and practice of FM, and in particular in the theory and practice of FM metrics, to enhance the ability of system and FM engineers and operators to measure and document the value, cost and risks associated with the FM design. This SBIR is aims to utilize existing capabilities of TEAMS toolset and extending it as necessary to enable it to compute a range of FM metrics, quantitative assessment of an FM design and V&V of the FM activities. As schedule and resource pressures build, there comes a need to reduce the amount of planned testing while guaranteeing a degree of confidence in FM design. By defining a methodical approach to identifying and assigning priorities to tests, one can define a minimum set of tests required to certify FM (i.e., incompressible test list). This SBIR also seeks to develop a Prioritized Validation Test Suite that ensures that critical risks are detected and appropriate FM Mitigation Strategies are employed to minimize the risk.","NASA's system design and engineering community, especially those who are involved with Systems Health and Fault Management (FM) have a vision of ensuring that FM design is an established rigorous discipline with consistent processes and methodologies that can be applied across all NASA platforms. The proposed effort has significant range of applications across various NASA multi-disciplinary engineering centers that are in charge of System Design where FM is an integral part of the System Design process. Quantifying SHM/FM in terms of standard and recognized metrics has been proven in practice in the Space Launch System (SLS), managed by Marshall Space Flight Center. The metrics developed here for TEAMS are perfectly general to any system that uses FM. The QSI team has close relationship with the NASA MSFC SHM team responsible for the design of the FM system who are also current users of the TEAMS software. Likewise, other immediate applications of this technology will be with the Orion Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program, managed by Johnson Space Center, and the Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, the operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Other strong users of TEAMS, with strong FM programs include Glenn Research Center, Ames Research Center, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The aviation programs at ARC and at Langley Research Center are also likely long-term beneficiaries of this project.","DoD institutions such as the Missile Defense Agency, Air Force and Navy that use SHM and FM in many applications can benefit from the metrics implemented in TEAMS. Applications that can benefit include aircraft, spacecraft, launch vehicles, ships, submarines, and command and control systems. FM performance metrics will help determine the efficacy as well as identify the gaps for FM on the TEAMS based CBM+ solution being developed onboard the LCS by QSI along with Lockheed Martin (LM), General Dynamics and NAVSEA. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets where the FM aspects of system design is required to be highly efficient and cost-effective because of the natural budgetary pressures, could also be potential targets for the proposed technology. QSI is working with LM on leveraging TEAMS technology for FM for actuation processes with the KMAX unmanned helicopters with potential application to other LM unmanned aerospace and marine vehicles. Technology developed through this effort will also be critical to measure the current performance of those FM systems as well as identify potential deficiencies under different failure scenarios. Outside of the DoD, electrical power and nuclear power utilities also require rigorous modeling techniques such as those developed here. The automotive industry is also now adopting more formal methods than in the past, largely drawn from aerospace applications but adapted to the automotive context.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Knowledge Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",Fault Management Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

It will measure aerosol light absorption simultaneous at three spectral regions: blue, green and red. The proposed measurement technique takes advantage of the current rapid development on high-power semiconductor lasers MEMS microphones. It will eventually weigh less than 25 pounds and consume approximately 300W electrical power. It will also be capable of being remotely controlled and being operated at a variety of sampling pressure conditions for the airborne measurements. Since majority of the electronic and optical components of the proposed system are commercially available except the home-designed acoustic cells, its total manufacturing cost could be less than $20,000 per unit.","The primary NASA need for this technology is to measure spectrally resolved light absorption by atmospheric aerosols for its Airborne Measurement program. At present, aerosol light absorption is measured by collecting sample on a filter subtract and measuring light extinction and scattering of the collected samples during the airborne measurements. This method suffers from a number of intrinsic errors. The proposed RGB DPAS technique will be far more sensitive than the filter-based techniques, and is capable of providing 1s data acquisition measurement. Additionally, past NASA programs such as EXCAVATE, APEX, UNA-UNA, and AAFEX have had as a major focus, on the measurement of black carbon emissions from civilian aircraft engines. Since mass absorption coefficient of black carbon is known at several visible wavelengths, the proposed DPAS aerosol absorption monitor can be used as a black carbon emission monitor.","We expect that the 3-color RGB DPAS aerosol absorption monitor developed under this program will significantly benefit the atmospheric science community in characterizing the radiative properties of ambient aerosols. The ability of the proposed instrument to simultaneously measure particle absorption with good time resolution and high precision in three colors will enable continuous measurements of the particle optical absorption that can be directly used by regional and global climate forcing models. In combination with the Cavity Attenuated Phase-Shift (CAPS) extinction monitor, which represents a dramatic improvement on current particle extinction measurement technology, single particle albedo of ambient aerosols could be directly determined. Since aerosol scattering of solar radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming, direct measurements on single particle albedo of ambient aerosols are critical in understanding aerosol effect on the Earth radiative balance.","Acoustic/Vibration; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Nanomaterials; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Visible",Airborne Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Rapid freezing eliminates the artifact caused by ice crystal formation within the tissues.  Ice crystal nucleation and growth occurs between 0?C and -20?C typically.  To avoid this damage and minimize destruction of proteins, RNA and DNA by lytic enzymes, cells or tissues have to be rapidly cooled through this temperature band.  This is typically done in an isopentane bath cooled by liquid nitrogen (LN2) to -150?C.  This 2 step process eliminates artifacts caused by ice nucleation as well as artifacts caused by nitrogen bubbles that surround the tissue as it boils if submerged directly into LN2.  While these open methods are acceptable for terrestrial laboratories, they would not be compatible with experimentation on the International Space Station.  Our proposed gaseous nitrogen-based Rapid Freezer clamp would provide an alternative means to rapid cool through ice crystal nucleation and growth temperatures without exposing the crew to the spill hazards of LN2 and chilled isopentane as well as the extreme flammability of isopentane.","The Techshot Rapid Freezer (formally known as the Snap Freezer) is being developed as an enabling device for conducting microgravity research aboard the ISS.  Beginning first as an application for NASA mission programs, Techshot will have developed a unique device capable of safely rapidly freezing samples in space. Therefore, the initial targeted application of the proposed innovation is an offering of both the equipment and services associated with flight hardware and integration activities, which are highly desired by NASA-funded scientists. In 2015, Techshot signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA, and was awarded an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract from the agency to enable the Government to lease (as needed) a wide variety of our ?professional grade? flight hardware. This new business model is expected to be very attractive to NASA because it reduces the agency?s upfront risk for flight hardware development, and more importantly, it reduces NASA?s cost of ongoing maintenance and upkeep of the flight hardware - for the life of the equipment.","The Rapid Freezer is expected to be of particular interest to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, academic researchers and terrestrial national laboratories, and Techshot is committed to investing in its commercialization.  Beginning with the Phase I award, the company built a technology demonstrator with internal funds, and it will continue to invest its own funds in the further maturation of the Rapid Freezer system. While typical laboratories snap freeze tissues by plunging specimens into liquid nitrogen or an isopentane bath chilled by liquid nitrogen, this may not be compatible with all experimental protocols or facility safety standards, which will provide commercial opportunities.  Much like the safety concerns on the ISS, significant burn hazards exist from liquid nitrogen spills and isopentane is an extremely flammable liquid.  When these conditions exist in terrestrial labs, researchers use cold blocks to freeze samples.  But even actively-cooled plates in cryostats do not typically reach temperatures sufficient for effective rapid freezing.

Our ""CloudTurbine"" innovation eliminates the distinction between files and streams.  Streaming and static data have long been considered separately. Whereas streaming data protocols continue to fragment, a great unification of approach for static data has occurred. The paradigm for file-sharing services is simple:  (1) put data in a local file folder, (2) it automatically shows up at other linked systems.  Wouldn't it be nice if one could unify an approach for streaming data while leveraging the file-sharing cloud infrastructure?  This is precisely what we propose. CloudTurbine is a streaming data interface to file-sharing and file-transport services such as Dropbox and FTP. It delegates much of the data transmittal, security, and server resources to the third-party service.  It eliminates the distinction between files and streams, and enables a simple, cost effective new paradigm for streaming data middleware.Phase I demonstrated the features, utility, and performance of the prototype CloudTurbine to be very appropriate for a wide range of data-streaming applications.  A significant performance issue is the inherent latency imposed by file bundling plus transfer time. Testing has proven this to be tractable, with low latency (2-5s) for several file sharing services, and very low latency (10-50ms) for protocols such as FTP and mapped drives.We propose an Open Source CloudTurbine web portal as a hub to provide this technology to NASA, scientific, and industrial communities.  Following the legacy of the earlier-generation DataTurbine, we will vigorously move to establish a self-sustaining Open Source community which provides CloudTurbine access, development, services, spin-off products, and community support.","CloudTurbine would provide a significant advancement of the NASA ""Virtual Presence"" infrastructure for flight research data and wind tunnel test data remote collaboration.  Other potential NASA applications include LVC-DE distributed flight simulation, SOFIA sensor data streaming to schools for educational outreach, and conversion of legacy flight data to a sustainable, transparent archive format.

When passed over a warm catalyst bed, gaseous nitrous oxide and an ethylene-ethane gaseous blend combust instantly. A small 1 N thruster can be designed to provide small satellite propulsion systems with a specific impulse of approximately 300 seconds. Both propellants are self-pressurizing, capable of delivering feed line pressures in excess of 800 psi at room temperature, and 400 psi if cooled to 0?C. For longer duration missions, both nitrous oxide and an ethane-ethylene fuel blend do not require thermal heating to maintain a liquid state, and as such, can be stored on Earth or in space for in-definite periods of time with no parasitic power drain required to maintain a liquid propellant. Compared to other available chemical propulsion systems, a NEERHI system offers a cost effective solution as other hypergolic engines use hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which are toxic and dangerous to handle, increasing ground costs. As an added capability, the NEERHI engine has the ability to operate as a monopropellant engine if the catalyst be is heated with a bipropellant reaction, increasing the lifetime of the catalyst bed and reducing heating loads on the engine. The fuel and oxidizer have nearly identical vapor pressure curves, allowing them to be stored in compact common-bulkhead tanks.","A NEERHI system is capable of replacing any monopropellant or bipropellant space propulsion system currently used by NASA with a green propellant, self-pressurizing, cold-storable, hypergolic rocket system. The recent MAVEN mission, which uses a propulsion system based off of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, uses a total of 20 hydrazine monopropellant thrusters. A NEERHI system could be adapted to future missions to provide a greater specific impulse with a much lower ground cost due to the low toxicity of the propellants. Future lunar missions, which have historically used an NTO and MMH propellant engine, could use a NEERHI system to not only provide RCS thrust, but the nitrous oxide can also be used to produce a breathable atmosphere for any manned mission. The current technology roadmap for NASA also features a main propulsion unit for the micro-satellite, which could employ a NEERHI engine to provide delta-V maneuvers, station keeping, and even Earth-escape missions. Almost all satellite systems that don't have ion RCS systems could greatly benefit from the integration of a NEERHI unit to reduce the launch cost of the system.","A NEERHI system can be used on any commercial satellite system that requires a simple, hypergolic, RCS propulsion unit but wishes to avoid the difficulties encountered when working with a nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine system. The NEERHI can be used in the emerging cubesat industry, were the primary development teams are university students designing their first space system. A NEERHI engine would provide a safe and affordable system for universities that often have rigorous safety standards, and as such, avoid current hydrazine-based propulsion. In the new field of commercial crew development efforts, the SpaceX capsule currently uses the Draco rocket engine to provide attitude control. The Draco uses an MMH and NTO propellant combination. A NEERHI system could be built to replace these thrusters, and with a supply of Nitrous oxide onboard, future Dragon spacecraft could use the nitrous to produce breathing air instead of bringing along an additional system, taking up mass and space on the craft. A hypergolic and green propellant is the solution sought by all companies to phasing out the use of the dangerous hydrazine-based thrusters, and the NEERHI program could revolutionize the market.","Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fluids; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine",Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Resulting aircraft designs such as blended-wing bodies with distributed propulsion can provide the large reductions in emissions, fuel burn, and noise required to make air transportation growth projections sustainable.  The power density requirements for these electric machines can only be achieved with superconductors, which in turn require lightweight, high-capacity cryocoolers.  Creare has previously developed a Cryoflight turbo-Brayton cryocooler concept that exceeds the mass and performance targets identified by NASA for superconducting aircraft with high-temperature superconducting (HTS) materials requiring cooling to 50 K.  Here, we extended the temperature range of our cryocooler with an innovative new cycle concept to provide cooling to 20 K for MgB2 superconductors, which offer price and performance advantages for certain superconducting machines.  In Phase I of this project, we evaluated the performance advantages of our concept through modeling and preliminary component designs.  In Phase II, we will fabricate and test the highest-risk components to bring the overall TRL to 4.  In Phase III, we will build and test a complete cryocooler to support extended performance testing with MgB2 systems.  This development effort will provide an enabling technology for the superconducting systems needed to make turboelectric aircraft feasible.","Our proposed cryocooler development effort will support NASA?s long-term goal to increase aircraft efficiency and reduce aircraft emissions and noise.  By providing a cryocooler capable of cooling MgB2 systems and optimized to meet the aggressive power density target required for aircraft, we will enable an alternative approach to HTS systems and allow a detailed evaluation of the relative advantages of HTS and MgB2 superconducting technologies.  Such an evaluation is needed to clarify the road map for superconducting aircraft.  While such aircraft are still two or three decades from production, supporting technology development needs to begin now if such aircraft are to become a viable alternative to the aircraft configurations in production today.  The results of this SBIR project will support continuing NASA design trade studies, system demonstrations, and eventual superconducting aircraft demonstrations.  Other NASA applications include space applications such as hydrogen cryogenic liquefaction and zero-boil-off storage for in-space propellant depots, planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, CEVs, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles and extraterrestrial bases.  Terrestrial NASA applications include cooling for spaceport cryogen storage and transportation systems and for demonstration hydrogen production and transportation systems.  The highly reliable and space-proven turbo-Brayton cryocooler is ideal for these applications.","Superconducting materials have the potential to revolutionize the way we generate, transmit, and consume power.  Transformational initiatives that rely on superconducting technologies include power conditioning and power transmission systems, large-scale offshore wind turbines, high efficiency data centers, Navy ship systems, and turboelectric aircraft.  While the latter is the target application for the proposed cryocooler, the other applications represent potential near-term markets for the technology.   Companies are currently pursuing approaches based on either HTS or MgB2 superconducting materials.  The low-temperature cryocooler proposed here will support MgB2 systems, which offer a number of advantages over HTS systems including lower cost and reduced losses in varying magnetic fields.  The 20 K operating temperature of these systems makes the cryocooler a critical component of any solution.  There is also a large potential market beyond superconducting applications, including cooling for laboratory and industrial-scale gas separation, liquefaction, cryogen storage and cryogen transportation systems, liquid hydrogen fuel cell storage for the automotive industry, and commercial orbital transfer vehicles and satellites.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems,Low Emissions Propulsion and Power   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The novel optical isolator design is based on enhanced magneto-optical (MO) effects in magnetic photonic crystals. The innovation in the technology is its capacity to engineer MO effects not only by choosing the right material but also by adjusting the lattice parameters of 1 dimensional photonic crystals. While occupying a very small volume (~0.1 cm^3), a MOI device will achieve high optical transmission (2 dB or less forward loss) and excellent optical isolation (40 dB) at target wavelengths at a low cost. Therefore, the MOI technology directly addresses NASA's requirements for a compact, robust optical isolator for applications in cold atom systems. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of the MOI technology through modeling and analysis, as well as fabrication of a proof-of-concept prototype with basic performance parameters characterized. In Phase II, POC will further optimize the device and fabricate prototypes for validation of key performance metrics, as well as evaluate life cycle and environmental performance.","The primary NASA applications of the proposed MOI system are in metrology, magnetometry, and inertial navigation. NASA applications inherently require miniaturization of all system components. Frequency stabilized lasers are currently used in atomic clocks. Next-generation magnetometers and inertial navigation sensors also need optical isolation of the laser sources. In any NASA application that requires frequency stabilized lasers, MOI devices can replace bulky optical isolators to reduce the volume by a factor of >100.","Metrology and inertial navigation are important in various military and civilian applications. Laboratory demonstrations already have shown that cold-atom systems are superior to any other technologies for navigation and timing applications. However, the biggest hurdle in transitioning this technology into field-deployable units is quite often the sheer volume and weight of the system. To take full advantage of the extraordinary performance of cold atom systems, miniaturization of individual components is necessary. Other than metrology and navigation, optical isolators also have significant commercial applications in diverse fields, such as optical telecommunication, magneto-optic imaging, and gas sensing.",Electromagnetic; Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Interferometric (see also Analysis); Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Optical,Atomic Interferometry   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Manned systems are more costly to operate and have a much larger operational footprint than their unmanned counterparts. But the unmanned multirotor does not have the range and endurance to compete with the manned systems. Aurora Flight Sciences believes that the Passive Miller Cycle (PMC) Series Hybrid System is a viable way to achieve the range and endurance required to penetrate the manned vehicle market. The PMC, like the typical Miller Cycle, uses delayed intake valve timing that allows the expansion ratio to be greater than the compression ratio; reducing pumping losses and giving greater energy extraction. But the PMC does not use a positive displacement supercharger. The delayed intake valve closing also allows the PMC greater quench in the combustion chamber to confront the fuel droplet issue associated with small engines. The delayed valve timing also allows the generator in the hybrid system to be optimized for power generation while still being used as the engine starter.Based on the models developed in the Phase I program, Aurora will design, procure, and integrate the components required to demonstrate the Passive Miller Cycle (PMC) in a series hybrid architecture. The test system will be used to calibrate Phase I models and design a multirotor using the PMC hybrid system that will be able to perform police and news gathering missions.","The proposed unmanned multirotor vehicle with enhanced endurance enabled by a passive Miller Cycle series hybrid propulsion system confronts many commercial markets relevant to current NASA efforts. Two potential commercial markets that we will pursue include Emergency Services and Inspection Services. Aurora intends to replace expensive manned helicopter systems used by both emergency personnel for fire or disaster mapping, and by commercial inspection services for building inspections or utility service inspections (e.g. cell phone towers, power lines, and bridges). A second potential market for these multirotors would be in environmental monitoring and data collection in severe operational conditions where the use of manned vehicles would pose an inordinate risk to the pilots. This could include wildfire monitoring, storm tracking, environmental data collection in extreme environments (i.e. arctic conditions), and more. The passive miller cycle series hybrid propulsion system is an enabling technology for breaking into these markets as the current state-of-the-art in multirotors has endurances too low to be practical for such missions.","There are two main non-NASA commercial markets that Aurora sees as prime targets for using the high-endurance and payload capacity vertical lift aircraft developed under this program: Commercial applications and non-NASA Governmental applications. On the commercial side the primary market we are targeting is for urban operations, primarily for police operations and electronic news gathering. This market is currently limited to manned helicopters which are expensive to maintain and operate. Opening up this market to unmanned vehicles would provide a substantial reduction in operational costs and operational footprint (e.g. takeoff/landing area requirements, emissions, and noise) than the current manned systems. Additionally, it is expected that the lower operational costs would open the market to smaller law enforcement departments and news agencies that up to now have not had air services.On the government side, there are many aspects of the government and military that could benefit from this platform. Its long endurance would be a useful in ISR missions as well as inspection services for oil and gas lines, solar and wind farms, and other large areas that need to be monitored. Additionally, its payload capacity would be invaluable in distributing material (i.e. ordinance, radios, first-aid supplies, rations) in contested urban environments with friendly forces spread over a large the area.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Atmospheric Propulsion; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems),Vertical Lift   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The initial 1 kWe FPS requires a total radiating surface of 2.5 m2. Higher power designs will require corresponding larger radiating surfaces. In order to achieve optimum radiator performance, the face sheets of these radiators should present waste heat loads as isothermal sheets pointed to the sink of space. The current state of the art designs do not meet this requirement and rely upon heat pipes to axially carry the waste thermal loads while radiating fins, with typical thermal gradients and losses, provide thermal distribution away from the heat pipes via simple conduction. Under Phase I, Peregrine has successfully demonstrated an alternative design which promises to be lower in mass while improving performance based upon pulsating heat pipes (PHPs).  PHPs can directly acquire and then readily distribute thermal loads across the face of radiator panels to create highly efficient near isothermal designs. PHPs are an autonomous, self-contained, low profile, lightweight, high performance thermal transport system based upon heat of vaporization.Phase II will characterize a titanium/water pulsating heat pipe system, build prototypes of a Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) radiator for a 1 kWe FPS, and also build a conventional heat pipe design in order to provide a side by side comparison of performance increases of PHPs versus the conventional design.

For example, UAS platforms such as the ScanEagle or the Sierra require at least one operator to handle the routing / navigation tasks for the aircraft and another operator to handle and operate the mission-specific payload. In this setting, the UAS platforms actually become a force-divider instead of a force-multiplier. The requirement of multiple operators for each individual UAS platforms is problematic for commercial applications where the high cost of human operators would inhibit many key applications such as package delivery from becoming financially viable. To address these issues, Opto-Knowledge Systems Inc (OKSI) and Analytical Graphics Inc (AGI) are joining forces to design, demonstrate, and deliver a robust multiple Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) semi-autonomous command and control tool that will enable a single human operator to manage multiple UAS platforms concurrently. Though there has been significant research into the single-operator multiple UAS control paradigm, there are currently no existing commercially available tools for this application. This work is aimed at shoring up this gap by creating the Single-Operator Multiple Autonomous Vehicle (SOMAV) command and control tool that will be integrated with AGI�s Systems Tool Kit (STK) software and sold commercially at the end of the Phase-II program.","NAS Integration and Air Traffic Control (NASA NextGen Program):  For the past decade, NASA has been working to develop NextGen Air Traffic Control (ATC) Management capabilities that will provide increased efficiency and throughput of the National Air Space (NAS) to meet growing system demands. The SOMAV STK module for multiple-UAS command and control directly promotes these efforts in several ways. First, it provides a high-fidelity simulation environment for testing potential ATC routing algorithms, particularly those for systems of UAS platforms. Second, our tool reduces human operator workload by pushing much of the low-level control onto the UAV platforms themselves and having the routing/coordination performed autonomously. Reducing operator burden is listed as a specific goal of within Topic A2.02 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology of this SBIR effort. Third, our UAS routing and coordination tool will automatically optimize separation assurance for the UAS platforms in each team, which relates to the goal of safely and seamlessly integrating UAS platforms into NextGen. Fourth, the proposed module directly promotes autonomous operation for systems of UAS platforms using machine intelligence for decision-making. Finally, the UAS coordination tool addresses NASA�s goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous navigation under uncertain conditions (e.g., collision/hazard avoidance) and cooperative task completion.","UAS Communication Networks): Recent advancements (e.g., Aerial Communications Node platforms) have resulted in UAS-based aerial communications platforms that are able to provide up to 10 times more coverage than traditional ground-based communications towers, and that are able to dynamically move to address changing customer needs. There has recently been a great deal of talk about bringing these capabilities to the civilian communications sector. This forms a complex UAS route coordination problem: Given a set of UAS platforms and a dynamic set of customers that have changing bandwidth requirements and move throughout the environment (e.g., traveling from work to home, or 50,000 people being packed into a stadium on game day), how should the UAS platforms optimize their routes and coverage areas in order to optimize the total bandwidth coverage available to customers? The SOMAV module will readily address this routing and coordination problem in a way that concurrently maximizes coverage over a mobile set of customers and minimizes the total fuel consumed by the fleet of UAS communications nodes. SOMAV will provide high fidelity simulation and modeling of the entire UAS fleet and the RF communications links between the ground-based users and the UAS communications nodes including effects due to radio and antenna characteristics, weather, terrain, and communication protocol.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Navigation & Guidance; Process Monitoring & Control; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In the case of Radar REMPI, temperature and velocity are obtained through the spectral broadening and frequency shift associated with two-photon resonance interactions in atomic oxygen and nitrogen.","The proposed diagnostics are needed in test programs for atmospheric reentry and planetary entry at NASA's arc jet facilities, hypersonic wind tunnels, and shock tunnels. Non-intrusive unseeded measurements of temperature, velocity, and dissociation are required for validating fluid/chemistry models that incorporate real-gas kinetics, including those used to predict planetary entry aerothermodynamics. The diagnostics can serve as tools in very high enthalpy flow experiments that focus on testing the integrity of thermal protection systems.","The unique capability to measure temperature, velocity, and dissociation fraction in high enthalpy flows will be attractive to the private space industry, including low Earth orbit and planetary exploration.

Our innovation is researched through achievement of five objectives and associated work efforts. The first objective is the refinement of use cases for the big data application. We draw upon our knowledge gained in Phase I research and continued interactions with aviation stakeholders to narrow the use cases to specific applications that are a challenge to NASA and the broader aviation community related to RSSA, SMARTNAS, and other ATM research efforts. The second objective is to create a Big Data technology-driven architecture and processing capabilities for the more specific use cases developed to meet objective 1. The third objective is to achieve a subcomponent demonstration for each refined use case so that we can measure the benefit of using these techniques to solve ATM analytics challenges.

The instrument is based on a room temperature interband cascade laser (ICL) operating in the 4800 - 4900 nm region.  This laser has a substantially reduced (by a factor of 40) power requirement compared to quantum cascade lasers operating in the same region and should be better-suited for atmospheric field instruments.  Phase I concentrated on characterizing the sensitivity and precision that can be achieved for OCS measurement, using this laser in a laboratory prototype.  Phase I also demonstrated direct measurement of ambient carbonyl sulfide in the local outside air, at levels of about 450 parts per trillion.  Phase II emphasizes development of an airborne-worthy prototype instrument that can be field tested during the Phase II performance period.  Carbonyl sulfide is the most abundant naturally occurring sulfur species in the atmosphere.  The lifetime of OCS in the troposphere is believed to be several years, allowing its transport into the lower stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to sulfate particles. Improved understanding of the tropospheric - stratospheric exchange of OCS is needed to gain a better understanding of its role in sulfate particle production. In turn, the sulfate aerosol layer may significantly influence the earth's energy budget through increased solar scattering. Existing instrumentation for measurement of OCS is bulky and expensive and is complicated by several indirect steps. In contrast, this R&D effort will result in an instrument that measures OCS directly, in real time, with time response of a few seconds or better. At the conclusion of Phase II, Southwest Sciences will manufacture and sell commercial instruments for OCS measurement to NASA and the broader atmospheric research community.","The direct outcome of the work will be a prototype instrument for measurement of carbonyl sulfide that could be used by NASA for measurements of this important sulfur species from airborne platforms or in ground-based measurements.  The instrument platform, with substitution of suitable lasers and possible adjustment of the optical path length, could be adapted for measurement of other atmospheric species (including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon gases, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other sulfur species).","Potential customers for this instrumentation include government agencies active in atmospheric research (NASA, NOAA, DOE, NSF) and atmospheric researchers at universities.  The instrumentation, if adapted for measurement of pollutant gases, could be of interest to EPA and industrial customers concerned with pollutant monitoring and control.  Southwest Sciences will build these instruments on a custom manufacturing and sales basis after the conclusion of Phase II.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",Airborne Measurement Systems   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

NASA has determined through various studies that ISRU will be critical for both robotic and human exploration of the Solar System. ISRU is also viewed by commercial Space companies as a significant source of revenue; volatiles (mainly water) could be mined and sold as Hydrogen/Oxygen fuel to satellite operators to extend spacecraft life.Traditional ISRU architecture follows methods employed in the mining industry on earth: material is mined, crushed, transported, crushed again, processed, and waste is disposed of. However, mining concrete-hard ice and icy-soil is difficult without using explosives. Volatiles will get lost during crushing and transportation, and robotic material handling, as shown by the 2008 Mars Phoenix mission, is difficult. For these reasons, we propose the Planetary Volatiles Extractor (PVEx) Corer, which uses a drill based excavation approach and an integrated volatiles extraction plant. PVEx successfully addresses several aspects: drills can penetrate hard materials, there is no need for material crushing and transfer, if volatiles sublime, they will flow directly into the capture system. PVEx can also work with hydrated minerals.Under the SBIR Phase 2 we propose to mature the technology from TRL 4 to TRL 5/6, and in turn ready the system for NASA's next HEOMD and SMD missions, as well as commercial planetary missions.","NASA applications would satisfy goals of HEOMD and SMD. In particular, the Planetary Volatiles Extractor could be initially used as a reconnaissance tool to map and characterize volatiles distribution around the area before deploying ISRU plants. Depending on the required water (or other volatiles) production levels per day, the PVEx could be used to extract water and other volatiles to support human habitats,for LOX/LH2 propulsion systems to enable return of humans or samples back to Earth or for a journey to the outer reaches of Space. Because of the system's flexibility, the PVEx could be deployed on any extraterrestrial body that contains volatiles or hydrated minerals: Mars, the Moon, Europa, Enceladus, Asteroids, Comets, Phobos and Deimos. If the system were to be deployed on the Moon or NEOs, the water produced by the system could be returned to the ISS.NASA's near term goal is to send humans to Mars. As such, PVEx could not only be used as a reconnaissance system, but also as a production plant to mine and process water and other volatiles. These would need to be mined and stored before human arrival to the surface.","The PVEx system could be used by several commercial companies that are interested in In Situ Resource Utilization for financial gain. These include Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries targeting Asteroids and Shackleton Energy Corp, targeting the Moon (see letter of interest from Shackleton Energy section 13). The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to establish human presence on Mars. As such, SpaceX would also benefit from mature volatile extraction technology.Brining water from the Moon or NEOs could be very profitable given that launching water from Space costs ~$20,000/liter. The major market for water could be human consumption (e.g. once Bigelow Space Hotels are established) or refueling of existing satellites. The latter is of particular interest, since satellites come to the end of their life not because of electronics, or power, but because there are running out of fuel for station keeping. NASA and industry have been developing in space refueling technology, the first step in enabling refueling of satellites. Other non-NASA applications include robotic acquisition of volatiles as well as soil and liquid samples from hazardous environments: chemical spills, nuclear waste, oil spills.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Conversion; Deployment; Heat Exchange; In Situ Manufacturing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Resource Extraction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems),Regolith ISRU for Mission Consumable Production   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In particular, Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing will be used to embed optical fiber strain sensors anywhere in a metal part that can subsequently be used for structural health monitoring (SHM). Success in this program enables real time strain and temperature measurements throughout a structural aluminum part that complements the integrated system of data, models, and other analysis tools to represent an aerospace vehicle over its entire life cycle.This new capability is in direct support of the NASA Virtual Digital Fleet Leader / Digital Twin program, a concept which combines as-built vehicle components, as-experienced loads and environments, and other vehicle-specific characteristics to enable ultrahigh fidelity modeling of aircraft and spacecraft or their components throughout their service lives. When augmented with real time data, Digital Twin provides actionable information for making decisions now (diagnosis) and for the future (prognosis), considering all sources of uncertainty.Data generated from this enabling work will provide the engineering design and programmatic information necessary for implementation into a flight program. In this effort we will contribute to NASA's plans to prepare for future generations of vehicles that will rely on increasingly complex, heterogeneous and multifunctional material forms with increasingly complex failure modes.","Embedding optical fiber strain sensors in aerospace aluminum alloys for structural health monitoring is an important constituent capability for the Virtual Digital Fleet Leader or Digital Twin. In the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap, TA-12: Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing, the Digital Twin technology state of the art is described as TRL 1. The Digital Twin is in the concept stage, but the constituent capabilities are in various stages of development. The technology performance goal is described as TRL 6. This would include the ability to adjust life prediction based upon the monitored past, the current structural status, and the potential new environments coming in the vehicle life, with confidence in sensor interpretation, and in integrated prediction accuracy. We plan to elevate embedding optical fiber strain sensors in aerospace aluminum alloys to TRL 6 by the end of the Phase II program, fully addressing the need for this constituent capability.NASA plans to have the Digital Twin capability ready for Planetary Exploration Design Reference Missions to Mars in 2033, with the technology ready by 2027. We are on track to meet these goals.","This program, which embeds optical fiber strain sensors anywhere in a metal part, provides multifunction aluminum parts with integrated health monitoring sensors in support of the Digital Twin program. The Digital Twin program is, in fact, a joint Air Force - NASA effort. The initial commercial applications of this technology lie clearly with defense and aerospace manufacturers. Aerospace and Defense are early adopters of additive manufacturing because it enables lightweight designs and the production of parts with complex geometries. Additionally, aerospace and defense manufacturers frequently incorporate high value materials, and additive manufacturing allows them to maintain fine control of material properties and reduce raw material waste.There are very few conceptual approaches for fabricating metallic load-bearing structure with embedded multi-functional capability. Traditional fusion based welding and/or thermomechanical processes used for fabricating metallic structure would destroy delicate instruments. The solid-state nature of UAM is unique in that it allows sensitive sensors, such as thermocouples and strain gages, to be placed inside of metallic structure.","Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Processing Methods; Smart/Multifunctional Materials",Multifunctional Materials and Structures   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

One method that can reduce the cost of rocket test operations is to recover hydrogen and helium gases using an electrochemical process.  Sustainable Innovations is developing a commercial electrochemical platform that separates and compresses hydrogen using Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology for industrial applications such as metals and electronics processing. A Helium Recovery System (HRS), based on the same platform and constructed by Sustainable Innovations, selectively removes hydrogen from the mixed H2/He stream, leaving behind the high-value helium.  The system then removes residual water vapor from this helium and compresses it to commercial storage pressure.  This system featured a subsystem that captured the vented hydrogen and helium gas mixture, an electrochemical separation subsystem that purified both hydrogen and helium streams, and a compression subsystem that permitted high pressure gas delivery. A critical next step in the advancement of the HRS design is proving the scalability of this technology.  The innovative step in this proposal is to increase the gas capacity capability of the electrochemical separation system while maintaining optimal operating efficiency and durability.  It is expected that at least a doubling of throughput capacity per unit cell area ? largely driven by the amount of current that can be practically applied to an individual cell area without hindering longevity of critical components, can be achieved. This performance will be validated by cell durability tests. The innovation will be scaled in Phase II and integrated into a low-cost, scalable, modular package that will be delivered to SSC.","Hydrogen/Helium Separation - (SSC, KSC, MSFC) SSC has significant needs to separate and recover hydrogen and helium from its large rocket engine test stands. Hydrogen Separation for Resource Recovery ? SI is working with MSFC on a system that can separate and compress hydrogen from  CO along with other reactive gases including methane, acetylene, ethane, and ethylene.This research project has shown that electrochemical hydrogen separation and compression is an enabling technology for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction System, facilitating closure of the oxygen loop in an Advanced Life Support System. Pressurization for Mechanical Actuation ? (JSC) The In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), group at JSC is interested in the use of hydrogen as a working fluid for mechanical actuation.  In this application, hydrogen would be compressed electrochemically, using the core architecture of the HRS.Reformate Separation ? (JSC, MSFC)   There is a need to separate hydrogen from CO, CO2, and excess fuels in processes such as reformation of methane and other fuels.  The HRS being developed here provides the necessary technology base to support efficient separation of these constituents.Fuel Cell Energy Storage ? (GRC, JSC, JPL) Hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell systems are being carefully examined by NASA as a means of providing efficient energy storage for many different NASA missions.  Long-term missions are hampered by helium in hydrogen tanks. An HRS can alleviate this problem.","-Process Hydrogen Markets: Hydrogen used as process atmosphere in industries such as metal heat treatment, electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, float glass production, and electricity production (for electric generator cooling.) -Hydrogen Fueling Markets: Hydrogen used as fuel in a variety of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) (forklifts, scooters, passenger cars, ships, etc.), stationary power and research markets. -Hydrogen Tri-Generation: Separation of hydrogen from stationary fuel cell reformate, and compression for fueling (such as FCVs) applications.-Hydrogen Production: Captive production, merchant production and delivery, and distributed production of hydrogen from natural gas or methane via reformer, or via electrolysis. -Power-to-Gas Energy Storage:  Energy storage in the form of hydrogen produced from excess renewable power and stored in the natural gas infrastructure. -Helium Production: Separation of hydrogen from mixed gas stream containing helium, hydrogen and other byproducts in the production of helium.","Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Distribution/Management; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Remediation/Purification; Resource Extraction; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Storage",Cryogenic Purge Gas Recovery and Reclamation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The system, called DRIFT-UAS (Distributed Resilient Framework for Trajectory Management of Unmanned Aircraft Systems), is intended to support autonomous Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) under Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO). It is composed of algorithms and information-sharing components that enable autonomous trajectory planning while optimizing system-wide objectives such as safety, efficiency, and equity. DRIFT-UAS works for a mixed environment (manned and unmanned aircraft), but special emphasis is placed on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The immediate application is primarily targeted at lower-altitude aircraft (below 18,000 feet) but DRIFT-UAS would apply as well to upper altitudes.Using DRIFT-UAS, flight operators and air traffic management iteratively exchange trajectory intent and congestion feedback to develop trajectories that are efficient and equitable, while preserving an aircraft�s autonomy in generating its own trajectories based on its internal objective tradeoffs. The feedback aspect of the DRIFT-UAS architecture separates it from other �evaluators,� i.e., systems that check whether operating constraints are violated given a set of trajectories. Once DRIFT-UAS checks the proposed trajectories against system constraints, it provides each aircraft with information via a price update on levels of congestion and system constraints in space and time that would enable the aircraft to revise its trajectory if required. This two-way communication between aircraft and air traffic management on trajectory intent and feasibility results in better trajectories as well as clearer guidance to airspace users as to which trajectories are most likely to be available.","The core application of the work in this project will be to further NASA�s and the FAA�s goals to enable safe and efficient Trajectory-Based Operations for UAS. If successful, it is envisioned that DRIFT-UAS will provide the platform though which all aircraft (unmanned or otherwise) would strategically interact with the air traffic management system to signal trajectory intent and receive feedback on delays and congestion. DRIFT-UAS would also serve as a centralized repository for trajectory intent and system capacity. In the short-term, DRIFT UAS could be integrated within NASA�s SMART NAS platform as a trajectory planning module. This would aid SMART NAS in technology demonstrations and research experiments for topics such as integrating UAS into the national airspace system, planning traffic flow management activities, collaborative decision making for traffic flow management, trajectory-based operations, and enabling civilian low-altitude airspace UAS Operations. Near-term applications of DRIFT-UAS include estimating the impact of late entrants (i.e. unmanned or manned pop-up flights) to the system by examining the marginal cost of their addition, and measuring the marginal cost of all aircraft in the system to devise more efficient allocation schemes.","The FAA will have similar interest in DRIFT-UAS as would NASA, by providing a prototype tool for planning trajectories based on user intent and preference information. If DRIFT-UAS were to go live, the FAA would be the holder of the software. Like NASA, the FAA will have interest in conducting research experiments for UAS integration and trajectory-based operations. These simulation and experimental needs are shared by other non-NASA organizations, especially those who possess or are developing large-scale air transportation simulators. Those organizations include Embry Riddle University, MITRE-CAASD, and Volpe. Each of these organizations has a European counterpart with comparable roles and interests. Those organizations include EUROCONTROL, SESAR, and the Ecole Polytechnique. Furthermore, for real-time application of DRIFT-UAS, there are many foreign air navigation service provides (ANSP), who are the counterpart of the FAA, with burgeoning air traffic management systems that could benefit from more organized methods of trajectory planning. In some respects, these are even more viable customers for our product than the FAA because their air traffic management systems are less highly developed (in some cases, nascent) and, therefore, able to incorporate new subsystems.

As an alternative to OOA prepreg systems, infusion of dry fiber preforms made by automated dry fiber placement (ADFP) can mitigate out-time issues and shelf-life problems combined with lower cost manufacturing.  Although improvements in ADFP products have continued, use and application of these ADFP products have been limited due to the necessary balance of processing and performance of the infusion resin.  This is a result of not only the low permeability of the ADFP product preforms but also the inadequate damage tolerance and micro-crack sensitivity of the developed composites.  Accordingly, Applied Poleramic, Inc. proposes to develop a novel low viscosity, long pot-life infusion resin for use with ADFP product preforms that results in cured performance similar to that of unidirectional Hexcel 8552 prepreg parts.  Specifically, the infusion resin will be capable of significantly lower infusion temperature (less than 150 ⁰F) as compared to current commercial infusion resins along with improved fracture toughness. This innovative epoxy infusion resin will enable large complex composite structures to be developed using ADFP product preforms with lower manufacturing risk, reduced production time, higher part quality, and a new level of performance not attainable with current commercial infusion resins.  Ultimately, the technology will lead to a new generation of low cost composite materials, critical to future NASA space programs and missions.","This composite technology can provide cost, performance, and design advantages where traditional prepreg and OOA prepreg materials have been used or specified such as future production of spacecraft, large space structures, space stations, satellite, orbiters, landers, rovers, and habitats.

The technology may also find use for cryogenic tanks where thin-ply ADFP product preforms would be resistant to micro-cracking.","Opportunities for commercial applications come from NASA funded crew and cargo space transportation partners, commercial aircraft, rotorcraft, satellite, and transportation structures.  This OOA infusion composite technology will be targeted for future large structural parts in which layup and manufacturing time has excluded the use of traditional prepreg materials due to out-time concerns.

CRGs offers NASA the ability to reprocess space mission waste packaging plastics as an In-Situ resource for in space manufacturing via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) type 3-D printing of replacement tools, parts, and devices.  This innovation is enabling for space exploration, the application of CRG?s reversible thermoset (RVT) polymers combined with a plastic recycling, blending, and extrusion process will allow current and future packaging materials to be processed into a copolymer blend filament suited to FDM 3-D printing system. This approach offers two implementation routes including; (1) An RVT additive that can be combined with existing waste packaging during a reclamation process to produce 3-D printer filament and (2) A RVT based replacement packaging material that can be directly reclaimed into 3-D printer filament.  The material properties of 3-D printer filament from the RVT-based reclamation process can be tuned for mechanical performance (stiffness, flexibility) by adjusting the blend ratios of reclaimed waste packaging:RVT.  This will provide NASA with a means to generate 3-D printer feedstocks with varying mechanical performance from on-hand packaging plastics without the need for separate 3-D printer material payloads.  CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of RVT additive in reclamation of NASA?s packaging materials in Phase I by producing a co-polymer blend of RVT with NASA packaging, producing a FDM printer filament with the reclaimed packaging, and successfully 3-D printing the resulting reclaimed packaging material.  CRG?s proposed approach to further develop thermally-reversible polymer materials to reclaim NASA?s packaging will provide a material and processing technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 at the conclusion of the Phase II effort.","Supporting NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and the MSFC, this project's technologies directly address requirements for solutions to recycling on-board plastics materials into 3-D printable formats for low-earth orbit and space flight additive manufacturing systems.

Expansions of tropospheric ozone measurement efforts, such as NASA?s TOLNet program, are critical to improve our understanding these effects. In response to this need, Bridger Photonics Inc proposes developing the most efficient, compact, rugged, low-power consumption and cost-effective UV ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) transmitter available.   The proposed transmitter will enable widespread deployment of ozone DIAL systems capable of continuous range-resolved atmospheric ozone measurements from ground-based and airborne platforms to advance NASA?s Earth science mission. To achieve this design goal, Bridger will apply innovations proven out during its Phase I effort and developed previously for its MIR series laser product. The overall project goal is to design, construct, and test an autonomous, production-grade prototype, two-wavelength ozone LIDAR transmitter.  The proposed transmitter will enable state-of-the-art continuous ozone LIDAR measurements without the need for a skilled operator.  It will also provide a long maintenance-free interval (> 2 years), and will cost under $200k per transmitter.  Successful completion of this Phase II program will allow Bridger to demonstrate a simultaneous DIAL, brassboard transmitter with pulse energies >200 ?J in both DIAL wavelengths capable of autonomous operation, without degradation, for 3 months.","NASA?s primary application for the proposed transmitter would be for widespread deployment of ground-based and airborne sensors to map ozone concentrations with high spatial and temporal resolution.  This will allow NASA to carry out its Earth Science missions with smaller and/or more affordable DIAL transmitters enabling NASA programs to meet multiple mission needs and make the best use of limited resources.  Our system will be highly useful for both integrated column and range-resolved measurements due to its short pulse durations and scalable high energies.  Additionally, our base pump laser can be frequency down-converted into the SWIR spectral band rather than frequency up converted to the ultra-violet band.  This will enable compact single-mode, high-energy pulses for profiling other important greenhouse gases and pollutants such as CH4, CO2, H2O, CO, NO2, and many others. Finally, the base pump laser when frequency doubled into the visible region will enable compact single-mode, high-energy pulses for profiling of cloud and aerosol backscatter, ice mass and phytoplankton measurements, and direct-detection Doppler LIDAR wind measurements.","The pump laser for the proposed design would be the most compact and high energy kilohertz-rate Nd:YAG laser on the market.  Bridger envisions a wide variety of applications for this laser including gas sensing lidar, hard-target ranging, ablation applications including mass spectrometry, nonlinear spectroscopy and as general purpose OPO pump.  To date Bridger?s MIR Series has been sold primarily to laser ablation mass spectrometry customers, but Bridger has experienced interest from customers for hard-target ranging and nonlinear spectroscopy applications.  Within the lidar market both NOAA and the EPA would be potential customers for the complete UV transmitter to advance their ozone monitoring initiatives. Other commercial markets include detection of illicit methamphetamine labs, on-site pollution detection, verification of carbon sequestration sites, methane pipeline monitoring, and chemical weapons detection.  The proposed transmitter could easily be adapted to detect a host of other gasses, most of which are detected in the short wave infrared and mid-infrared spectral regions and are well suited to a seeded version of Bridger?s existing OPO.",Lasers (Ladar/Lidar),Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In Phase II we will build on our success with the NPBCG benchmark, and move boldly into tackling the acceleration of a real-life high-profile code, namely NASA�s Cart3D, improving its performance by a paradigm-shifting 2x to 4x end-to-end wall-clock time acceleration by the end of Phase II. Our firm has accumulated crucial know-how and has synthesized its expertise into a powerful industrial-quality process for software acceleration that will be used to ensure success on completing Phase II objectives. In Phase II we also plan on injecting a second NASA code with basic Compressive Computing techniques, and providing it with base levels of acceleration of ~1.3-2x. We will choose this second code from a pool of high-profile codes that have already signed up as early adopters for this project: FUN3D, USM3D, Enzo, and WRF. The work on a second NASA code will also serve as the ultimate field test of the broadness and ease-of-infusion of the proposed technology.We have secured complementary funds in the amount of $500,000 to increase resources and ensure that the proposed Phase II proposed will be successfully accomplished.","The impact of the proposed technology spans most areas of importance to NASA's scientific missions, including: aerospace, weather forecasting, cosmology, combustion, climate research, and chemistry, among others. To this date, five of the Top NASA HPC applications have enlisted as partners of the project to become early adopters of the technology. This fact speaks clearly about the interest that the NASA community has shown on the potential uses and benefits of infusing the knowledge generated from this project into NASA. Furthermore, once the technology is fully operational, it will benefit tens of thousands of users, who will see substantially increased performance in their regular, day-to-day runs, as well as in their massive, supercomputer-based production runs. One of the lead developers of NASA's Top Codes mentions that this technology ""can be considered critical in achieving the next generation of so-called exascale software applications, [and] in turn, these efforts will enable scientific and engineering breakthroughs previously considered computationally intractable"".","The resulting technology will increase the efficiency of memory access in most modern computer architectures, thus directly enabling unprecedented speedups in memory-access-bound HPC applications. With a significant fraction of HPC codes belonging to this ""memory-bound"" category, numerous scientists, developers, researchers, and complete industries will benefit, in areas as varied as aerospace, climate research, molecular dynamics, chemistry, weather forecasting, energy, civil engineering, geophysics, and life sciences, among others.","3D Imaging; Computer System Architectures; Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Image Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Systems that provide recycled treated water aboard the International Space Station, and that will supply water aboard future spacecraft, are inherently complex and can be susceptible to biofilm formation and microbial contamination. Further, it has been noted that pathogenicity and virulence of microbes can increase in microgravity environments. These factors, along with the high consequence of sickness in the remote space environment, make rapid, reliable methods of detecting microbes at low levels a critical need. Rapid microbiological detection systems have taken dramatic steps forward in the last two decades and today detection of even a single organism is possible in less than one hour. Unfortunately, development of rapid detection methods has far outpaced development of sample concentration and preparation techniques, which are necessary to enable detection of low microbial concentrations in drinking water. Currently, without sample concentration, rapid detection techniques alone produce results that are hundreds to thousands of times less sensitive than the minimum desired detection limit for microbial water contaminants. InnovaPrep proposes development of a rapid microbial concentration system designed for use aboard the International Space Station. The system will concentrate microbes from up to 5 Liters of potable water into volumes as small as 200 uL, providing concentration factors as high as 15,000X. It will be based on technologies developed and commercialized by InnovaPrep, but will contain innovations to allow for operation in microgravity. Large volumes of potable water are processed through a hollow fiber membrane filter concentration cell as microbes are captured within the lumen of the fibers. Following capture, the microbes are efficiently eluted using a novel Wet Foam Elution process and then delivered to a rapid detection system for analysis.","In the proposed format, the Hydrosol Concentrator for microgravity (HC-ug) will have direct application to the microbial water monitoring needs of the International Space Station & all crewed national and international space agencies and missions. Further, because small sample sizes are a requirement of rapid microbial detection systems, & because required microbial detection limits for drinking water are extremely low, this need is not anticipated to decrease in the near future.  The WetLab-2 initiative will directly benefit from the Hc-ug program, & they will be able to spin off additional tools using this technology.  In addition to the needs of the space agency community, many components of the technology developed in the proposed project will also have application to USG earth-based microbial water monitoring applications. The small, zero-power format of the HC-ug system will lend itself to development of fieldable concentration devices for DoD water monitoring needs in austere environments.  It will be applicable to field sampling and analysis during outbreak investigations in remote locations, or when sending samples to a laboratory is not acceptable. Water monitoring in developing countries is an important need that could benefit greatly from low-cost, fieldable kits that allow for delivery of a concentrated sample to rapid detection kits. InnovaPrep is already working to identify aligned opportunities within US DoD through DTRA's SOCOM handheld sample prep prgm","The proposed Phase II project will perfect elution fluid formulation and development of our fluid canisters, and improve manufacturing techniques for elution canisters and handheld devices for use in an InnovaPrep biological concentrator for use in a microgravity environment.  We expect that the improved performance of our space systems will provide commercial potential for InnovaPrep.  The feasibility, usefulness, and market need for commercial InnovaPrep systems that use canned elution fluids and/or hollow fiber concentration has already been demonstrated.  As of December 2015, over 150 instruments have been sold or leased worldwide that use our canned fluids, and nearly 10,000 fluid canisters have been manufactured here and sold to those customers.   Over 50,000 concentration cells have been sold.  This initial success includes early adoption by DoD in the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), which is now in the early manufacturing and design (EMD) phase.  When completely deployed by 2019, over 4500 of those systems will be in daily operation, using up to 4.5 million canisters per year.  InnovaPrep has also made significant early progress in commercial markets, and customers include global market leading companies in  biopharmaceuticals, commercial products manufacturing, animal health,  food & beverage, and other applications of industrial microbiology and life sciences R&D.  The sales to these customers are expected to exceed the sales to DoD.","Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients)",Environmental Monitoring for Spacecraft Cabins   is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

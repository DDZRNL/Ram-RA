Scott  Merritt,sbir@pragmasoft.com,"130 Elsmere Ave., Delmar, NY 12054-4310",(518)439-8815,,,,,,,"This proposal responds to the urgent need for improved pilot interfaces in the modern aircraft cockpit.  Recent advances in aircraft equipment bring tremendous resources within the reach of the today's pilot.  Unfortunately, these advancements are often accompanied by increases in system complexity and pilot workload.  In many cases, the detailed interaction required by modern avionics significantly interferes with the pilot's need to scan instrument gauges, maintain visual separation from other aircraft, and attend to other critical tasks. To address these concerns, PragmaSoft's proposal combines innovations in robust speech recognition and interface design with powerful application language constraints to deliver highly effective voice interface solutions.  Development efforts are carefully target at high workload pilot tasks to ensure substantial benefits and commercial acceptance.  Initial product sales are leveraged to collect an extensive corpus of actual (in-flight) speech and operational data for subsequent research and development. PragmaSoft believes that the lengthy and focused attention required to operate some aircraft devices presents an unacceptable safety risk to flight operations.  The proposed innovations deliver effective and commercially attractive voice interface solutions that allow pilots to interact with their cockpit environment in a safer and more efficient manner.","Under subtopic A1.01, NASA requests ""innovative technologies to improve airspace safety with a crew-centered focus ... [and] high potential for emerging as marketable products"".  PragmaSoft's proposal directly addresses this need by delivering advanced speech recognition technology that is commercially attractive to a wide spectrum of aircraft operators, and yields immediate benefits in safety and efficiency. NASA's Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) program includes a mandate to demonstrate improvements in the ability of single pilots to function competently in complex airspace.  This proposal provides an exceptional opportunity for NASA to demonstrate additional capability in support of these objectives.","The proposed innovations deliver commercially attractive, speaker-independent, voice interface products that significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of advanced flight operations.  Initial products are carefully targeted to specific applications to ensure substantial benefits and commercial acceptance.   Non-certified versions of the product are configured for convenient use in a wide variety of aircraft, while certified versions are provided for permanent installation.  The persuasive cost/benefit profile of these products ensures that a wide spectrum of aircraft owners and operators will finally enjoy the benefits of advanced speech recognition technology."

Presenting information by 3D display can significantly facilitate human perception and counteract biases and error-tendencies, leading to improved aviation safety.  To address this NASA need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new 3D COckpit Display (3D-COD) system for aircraft flight decks, based on fast scanning liquid crystal (LC) optics, to create a compact multiuser, multiperspective 3D display system that has no moving parts and requires no 3D glasses.  This interactive system brings automultiscopic viewing to pilots and crew members on the flight deck, with a greater than 60 degree FOV, 2048x2048 resolution, 60 Hz flicker-free full-color, high-brightness, and crosstalk-free operation, introducing 3D display technology to the cockpit.  The use of LC technology well developed for flat-panel LC displays, reduces cost and makes the system commercially attractive.  In Phase I POC will develop a scaled-down version of the fast-scanning LC optics display system and demonstrate its 3D operation on a laboratory 3D testbed system.  This testbed will be upgraded to a fully packaged optimized prototype in Phase II.","The proposed 3D-COD display system will be used not only in the cockpit, but also for air traffic control, training, and multicraft airspace image displays, engineering design, training and simulation, and scientific visualization and analysis.","The 3D-COD technology has huge commercial potential.  It will find applications in the engineering development and entertainment industries, particularly in theme parks, museums, and educational institutions.  This technology can also address the multibillion dollar video game industry."

Since C2 effects are so prominent, development of new operational concepts, and evaluation of proposed changes, requires simulation and modeling capabilities that include C2 effects.  Metron Aviation leverages its extensive knowledge of the Command and Control (C2) functions of the National Airspace System (NAS) to develop models that enable realistic NAS simulations.  The key innovations of this effort are 1) the implementation of models for NAS ATM C2 processes, and 2) the integration of these models with the NASA Langley Systems Analysis Branch's (SAB) Simulation Environment. The development leverages the following key capabilities: Metron Aviation's extensive experience supporting NAS C2 activities, and Langley's infrastructure for conducting NAS-wide simulations of air traffic. By developing this interaction we enable a system that allows researchers and analysts to evaluate current NAS operations and to investigate future technologies and concepts of operations. These users exploit the system's capabilities to observe NAS behavior and compare the benefits and impacts of operational concepts prior to pursuing implementation in the operational system.","Understanding of the system-wide impacts of NAS Command and Control is lacking in both operational practice and current research. This understanding is crucial for the evaluation of current/proposed future operations. Currently, NASA programs such as the Virtual Airspace Modeling and Simulation (VAMS) and the All-weather Capacity Enhancement NRA are developing system concepts to meet increasing air-traffic demand, reduce delays and improve safety/security. While evidence suggests that these techniques may provide significant benefit, NASA must accurately assess tradeoffs between such benefits and costs of implementation. Realistic NAS-wide simulations, including C2, are required to assess such operational concepts and technologies.","Estimates of ATM costs due to delays range from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions of dollars per year. Several research activities are being pursued to develop new concepts and technologies in an effort to meet the increasing demands. Many of these developments promise to be costly and laborious to implement, and the difficulty of adequately assessing the anticipated impacts creates significant risk operators and users of the NAS. Development of simulation capabilities and benefit assessment methods that include the effects of C2, creates significant commercial demand for accurate and robust C2 modeling capabilities."

A large contributor to the above injuries and costs is that flight crews do not have sufficient situational awareness of the location and severity of potential turbulence hazards to their aircraft.  AeroTech will improve pilots' situational awareness of turbulence hazards by developing an integrated, graphical cockpit display of turbulence hazard information scaled to their specific aircraft.  This display will negate the need for inference that is required to interpret current turbulence information.  With better knowledge of turbulence hazards' severity and location, pilots will be able to avoid turbulence encounters or prepare for them by having all occupants seated with seatbelts on, thereby avoiding injuries.  Phase I work will develop, based on pilot input, a concept of operations and a requirements document for this display, evaluate several potential turbulence hazard information sources, and define requirements for simulations to be carried out in Phase II.  By the end of Phase II an intuitive and meaningful cockpit, turbulence hazard display will be developed and tested using simulations and operational flight evaluations.","When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, this cockpit display and underlying system will directly contribute to the stated national goal of NASA's Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) of a 50% reduction in aviation accidents by 2007. This work will be completely aligned with other Turbulence Prediction and Warning System (TPAWS) efforts, as well as other efforts in the Weather Accident Prevention (WxAP) element.","When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, this cockpit display system will provide pilots with improved turbulence hazard information allowing them to operate more efficiently and safely.  Significant reductions in fuel waste and costs associated with injuries due to turbulence are expected to be major commercial drivers for this system. The market for this display is all Part 121 carriers (both domestic and international).  Delta Air Lines is currently operationally evaluating several of the technologies whose outputs will be integrated into the proposed display and has also agreed to support the efforts of this proposal."

It combines a new generation low power ice protection system with a novel path to certification that is based upon requirements that turbine engines be capable of operation in a hail environment.  Eliminated are requirements for high voltages and currents characteristic of all previous impulsive or expulsive deicing systems.  It is postulated that if the engine can operate safely in the hail environment as defined by the FARs, then it can be expected to operate safely and economically in the presence of particles shed by the deicer which are demonstrably smaller and less hazardous than hail. Such a system presents a viable alternative to the use of hot air ice protection systems.",The system proposed is a viable alternative to bleed air ice protection for engine inlets.  NASA has a national objective an overall improvement in the safety of aircraft operation.  Protection of aircraft from exposure to icing environment is included in that charter.  One of the most important trades involved in the development of icing conditions is between energy and icing performance.  This trade has been shown that it can be addressed by the use of low power ice protection systems on lifting surfaces.  It remains to apply these principles to engine inlets. This is the commercial promise of this system.,"The system proposed is a viable alternative to bleed air ice protection for engine inlets.  It should find wide application on turbine powered aircraft that are designed to achieve even greater efficiency of operation through the use of exclusively electrically powered systems, including ice protection.  This ""all electric airplane"" concept has been under consideration for many years by NASA and other industry organizations.  Indications gained from public disclosures by companies, especially Boeing, of the elimination of bleed air as a means of ice protection are firm indications of the intent to develop new technologies in support of more efficient aircraft."

In this proposed effort we will develop a fast sampling multifrequency profiling and dual polarization narrow beam radiometer system to overcome these deficiencies. In this proposed radiometer system, all beams are collinear and match the antenna gain pattern of weather research radars. The radiometer will have the capability of profiling (ranging) water vapor along the beam as well as discriminate ice and water phase hydrometeors. We will also develop a fast beam steering system to operate in concert with the radar.

We propose a new approach to detect and characterize the corrosion and cracks in missile and aircraft structures. The technique consists of very small, low cost guided wave leave-in-place health monitoring sensors known as piezo-disks, innovative Correlation Analysis Technique (CAT) for fast defect sizing and localization, and a miniaturized local computing device with data acquisition and processing capabilities and wireless module for remote monitoring.

Unfortunately, controller complexity and controller validation are required to ensure the safety of next-generation systems.  Barron Associates proposes an aggressive plan of research to develop monitoring algorithms that estimate, in real time, safety margins of complex systems based on observed differences between the model used for controller development and actual flight data.  The Phase I and Phase II research will focus on the flight test environment where these algorithms would allow the flight test engineer to monitor and revise the test plan in real time - skipping ahead in the buildup when safety is assured and avoiding test points where safety is questionable.  The tool would also recommend test points that could help refine safety margin estimates for as yet unexecuted maneuvers.  The result will be reduced flight test costs and improved safety.

Secretary of State Colin Powell has said that ""no threat is more serious to aviation"" than man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS).  Although on-board defenses against MANPADS are being developed for commercial aircraft, these systems will not be deployed for many years and will be very expensive. The innovation proposed herein provides an information and decision support system to enhance security monitoring and patrolling around the perimeter of airports ? where the threat of MANPADS attacks is at its highest. This effort will merge the use of advanced airport surface surveillance data with decision support algorithms and security threat and vulnerability assessment methodologies to identify and alert security personnel regarding the airport perimeter areas of highest vulnerability and greatest access to targets of opportunity for MANPADS attacks or other terrorist activities.","The MANPADS threat against commercial aviation is real and must be addressed as soon as possible. A significant need exists for the Airport Perimeter Security Advisor (APSA) technology that will be developed through the conduct of this SBIR to complement airborne solutions.

A novel algorithm combining measurement data from the sensors and the analytical model based on the concept of finite element analysis is proposed and the feasibility of the algorithm to detect structural damage will be tested in this project.  The project will focus on the impedance-based nondestructive damage evaluation technique.  However, the algorithm can be extended to handle other types of sensor data such as acceleration and temperature.  The data analysis system can monitor the performance of defective structural component in a space vehicle and issue proper warning for maintenance and repair.  If the concept is tested successful, the algorithm can be further developed into a commercial software to be used for the structural integrity monitoring of many engineering applications.","The proposed system can be used to monitor the integrity of a wide range of space structures.  This system can be used to monitor the performance of metallic and non-metallic structural components and the space structural system.  The structural health monitoring system will be a key component in space vehicle health management system and the data collected can be used to predict the remaining service life of the space structures.  The system will be a valuable technology for the safety of future space exploration including manned and unmanned missions to the Moon, the Mars, and other long-rang space missions.","Since the proposed data analysis system is non-parametric meaning that the technology is not dependent on the geometry and material properties of the structures being monitored, the system can be used to monitor the structural integrity of one structural component, a sub-structural system, and the entire structural system.  This technology can be applied to a very wide range of engineering applications.  Examples of potential applications include automobiles, nuclear power-plant structures, and civil infrastructures such as the pipeline systems, bridges, and high-rise buildings.

The development of Micro unmanned air vehicles (Micro-UAVs) and Mars aircraft has received considerable attention in recent years.  Unlike conventional aircraft and UAVs, Micro-UAVs and Mars aircraft suffer from operation in an extremely low Reynolds number flight regime.  Both Micro-UAVs and Mars aircraft can have operational Reynolds number regimes from 20,000 to 120,000.  At these extremely low Reynolds numbers, the aerodynamic flow features are dominated by laminar separation and separation bubble effects, which are the primary source of poor performance in both drag and maximum lift for this class of vehicles.  It is proposed to use a robust and powerful active transition fixing technique to eliminate the effects of these large separation bubbles and provide revolutionary performance as of yet unobtainable by this class of ultra low Reynolds number vehicles.  By artificially transitioning the flow upstream of the laminar separation bubble, the bubble itself can be eliminated resulting in a greatly reduced drag.  The increased resistance to separation of a simple turbulent boundary-layer can pay revolutionary dividends at these very low Reynolds numbers.","The enhanced active transition fixing technology will provide revolutionary performance for ultra low Reynolds number vehicles including Micro-UAVs and Mars Aircraft.  Additionally, low Reynolds number propeller based propulsions systems will also greatly benefit from this technology.  Finally, the technology can provide significant performance improvements for any low Reynolds number system suffering from laminar separation issues.

These actuators promise considerable savings in weight, power, and volume over existing electomechanical and hydraulic systems.  Incorporation of these actuators within lifting surface structure, or as trailing edge control devices, would greatly simplify the actuation systems of these aircraft, thereby permitting greater payload fraction, increased range, enhanced robustness, and/or smaller vehicle size, and thus reduce both operational and fixed system costs.  Choice between the two actuation concepts for a particular installation represents a tradeoff in actuation system bandwidth and power availability, and thus the same vehicle may include both systems depending upon the particular functional requirements.  These actuators represent a derivative technology from a previous Army SBIR Phase I/II effort directed at providing in-flight helicopter blade tracking using actively controlled trailing edge tabs, and thus have been designed to have low mass and low power requirements from their inception.  Since they lack any physical hinge joints, they may be embedded directly within aircraft lifting surfaces, eliminating interference drag associated with control deflection.","NASA has a need for advanced control actuation and systems to support long endurance high-altitude UAV applications.  This technology would help mitigate known issues with reduced aeroelastic stability of such high altitude platforms, as well as provide vehicle robustness (load alleviation) to atmospheric gusts.  Its all-electric actuation and lack of moving parts (i.e., no discrete hinges) enhances the actuator's capability to support longer duration UAV missions planned by NASA for the future.","The actuators developed here could support DoD applications and commercial aircraft uses for UAV flight control and ancillary functions such as deploying flaps, landing gear and doors that house optics or weapons.  They have a minimum number of moving parts, are extremely lightweight for the actuation stroke and force they provide, and utilize modest electrical power.  In one configuration, electric power is only required to switch the actuator between discrete positions, making this actuator ideally suited for flap deployment and/or trim tab applications.  These devices may also be used as auxiliary trim systems and flight control units for manned aircraft."

The enhancement employs control oriented techniques, namely, model uncertainty, linear fractional transformation framework, mu-analysis and nonlinear operators identification, to adopt the emerging aeroelastic flight-test data. This toolbox augments the current match-point solution approach using the mu-analysis method with identified nonlinear operators. The procedure calls for ZAERO's high-fidelity linear aeroelastic model to be tuned quickly with available aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic, AE/ASE, flight data sets, while block-oriented models are used to highlight the underlying nonlinear structure of the AE/ASE system. This framework is capable of accounting for several nonlinearities including those due to aerodynamics, structures, control/actuator, and/or geometry.

Structural mode interaction can be a significant problem in high performance aircraft and other aircraft with low frequency vibration modes.  Use of notch filters requires a compromise to be reached between airframe structural stability and handling qualities.  Successful application of the proposed method will relieve the flight control system designer of the need for managing this compromise and will allow the achievement of full potential system performance with better handling qualities.  Basic feasibility has already been established and Phase I will broadened this to cover practical implementation issues and to define test evaluation plans.  Phase II will extend the method into actual test evaluation, either by laboratory test or flight test, or both.  Other possible applications such as aircraft active control systems and control of space structures will be considered during the research program.","NASA is involved in development of advanced FCS concepts for various manned and unmanned aircraft which require treatment of interaction between the FCS and aeroelastic characteristics.  Structural mode interactions are exacerbated by the introduction of adaptive systems, so the proposed SBIR project is relevant to these projects.  Flight test and evaluation phases will require consultancy on the implementation aspects of the method.  Other NASA projects, e.g. control of space structures, are potential applications.  Enhanced scope of application and functionality of the NASA STARS software represents another NASA sales opportunity.

The one dimensional (1-D) or linear embodiment of the sensor is similar in function to the well-known linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). In this configuration, it is anticipated that the PCS will provide similar measurement accuracies, but with significant cost, size and weight reduction.  This makes the PCS especially attractive for use in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) and other applications where size and weight are important. The PCS approach can also be implemented as a two-dimensional (2-D) sensor, which may facilitate the measurement of complex surfaces, and holds promise for many new and evolving UAV and aircraft applications such as aeroelastic wings and measuring the position of swept surfaces or moving panels. The PCS two-dimensional concept also offers the potential to introduce novel surface sensor measurement functionality and could conceivably be fabricated within the composite aircraft structure.","Displacement sensing is prevalent on all aircraft platforms. Various sensors are applied to a multitude of functions including: Flight controls, control surfaces and actuators, landing gear, munitions, speed brake doors, brake and steering systems, fuel and engine controls, environmental controls.

Previous NASA efforts in the development of advanced decision support tools have benefited greatly from deep understanding of the ATC operation. Through data warehousing and data mining capabilities, the proposed SODAA tool will provide the infrastructure and information necessary for NASA researchers and other industry analysts to achieve this level of knowledge and understanding of the airport surface ATC operation. Additional tools will support the creation, validation and maintenance of SMS adaptation data.","Air carriers conduct analyses of airport surface operations in an attempt to reduce costly delays, but current information sources lack sufficient detail. A significant market exists for a commercial analysis product for air carriers. Mosaic ATM maintains close working relationships with numerous air carriers and is well positioned to obtain commercial funding to develop and implement tools to help optimize the daily air carrier operation. Note that FedEx and Northwest airlines already use SMS as an integral part of their daily operation for Memphis, and UPS will begin to use SMS as part of their operation for Louisville shortly."

Because of the unique beam forming properties at the millimeter-wave frequency of 83 GHz, a compact and efficient materials heating system can be devised that can satisfy this need.  To date, microwave and millimeter-wave based systems for materials processing have been developed only for terrestrially based manufacturing operations.  The purpose of this SBIR proposal is to begin the development and to perform proof-of-concept tasks to demonstrate the feasibility of the microwave approach to space-based materials processing.  Current conventional heating technology requires the heating of the complete volume of the furnace in order to achieve the temperatures necessary to perform a fabrication activity.

Millimeter-wave processing technology is an enabling one that should help reduce significantly the space requirements (i.e., footprint) needed to set-up a high-temperature materials processing facility.","The joining of high-purity ceramic materials is a continuing challenge.  A recent project focused on the joining of precision ceramics to be used in an advanced accelerator design for the Department of Energy.

The nanoparticles are formed at room temperature with low pressure and shear forces to prevent the denaturation of protein drugs, which will be important for the treatment of major diseases such as heart disease and cancer.  Since cells rapidly uptake nanoparticles with sizes less than 500 nm, the major objective for this proposal is demonstrate highly monodisperse particles in this regime.  Furthermore, we anticipate that producing such particles in a microgravity environment will lead to an improved fundamental understanding of droplet formation itself and to the production of homogeneously distributed therapeutics in a perfectly spherical nano-particle.","Potential NASA applications for the nanodroplet technology are for space medicine.  The need for highly effective therapeutics and neutriceuticals are important for astronaut health, especially on long duration missions.  Such a technology would provide an individualized approach to space medicine that is tailored to each crew member.  The prospects of a technology that is capable of programmable drug dosage 'on-the-fly' that may be readily integrated into a drug delivery platform would be an attractive approach for preventative and high performance measures.  The nanodroplet technology may be utilized for treating illnesses, traumatic events and psychological disorders on long term missions.","The Nanotrope targeted drug particles have the potential to successfully target drugs to specific cells in the human body with a high success rate. The technology provides a compact device that is capable of titrating particle compositions on demand, which can allow specific protocols for  individual patients to be used, according to the response to initial treatment. In addition, the drug particles are delivered using inexpensive microfluidic devices that are readily adapted to conventional devices such as syringes or inhalers.  Thus, we anticipate the facilitated integration of our on-demand, monodisperse drug formulation technology with a reduced time to market."

Isolation is required because the fluids used are either toxic or can cause suffocation. The extra hardware doubles the mass of the system, consumes more power, and reduces reliability.  Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc., supported by Hamilton Sundstrand, proposes to use a heat pipe heat exchanger to provide two levels of isolation between the two fluid streams.  This will allow the safe use of the otherwise toxic or harmful exterior fluids with no danger to the crew and will avoid the mass and power penalty of the existing approach.  This approach is also potentially lower mass than an incremental improvement to the existing exchanger. The Phase I work will include conceptual design of a liquid/liquid and liquid/air replacement for the existing exchangers and a liquid/air exchanger that replaces both system exchangers. A system-level trade study will be conducted to assess the impact of the new exchanger designs on power and volume consumption and on thermal performance. Representative exchanger segments will be fabricated and tested to demonstrate readiness of the technology.","Potential NASA applications involve life support system for manned spacecraft.  If successful, the program will allow the use of heat rejection systems using thermally-favorable fluids such as ammonia or Freon while avoiding the risk of contaminating the crew compartment with those fluids.  This will reduce the mass, volume, and power consumption of the cooling system","Non-NASA Commercial applications of the technology include bleed air coolers and oil coolers for Navy vessels, heat exchangers for ammonia refrigeration plants, and heat exchangers for food and pharmaceutical processing.  The Navy expects to need between 10 and 50 bleed air coolers and at least 200 oil coolers per year.  They require absolute isolation between the seawater coolant and the fluid stream being cooled to assure availability of the systems and to prevent catastrophic damage to other equipment."

This will close the hydrogen loop which currently requires 50% resupply and also produce carbon nanotubes, a high value product which may be employed as an adsorbent or catalyst for removal of atmospheric trace contaminants, thus further lowering the resupply burden for manned spacecraft.  Microgravity compatibility of Gradient Magnetically Assisted Fluidized Beds (GMAFB) has been demonstrated through a series of KC135 flight experiments.  Metallic cobalt, which has been fluidized in microgravity using the GMAFB method, is an excellent catalyst for promotion of methane pyrolysis.  Recently, fluidized bed catalytic methods have been shown to efficiently recover hydrogen, and produce single walled carbon nanotubes.  Using the GMAFB method, this process can be rendered totally compatible with operation in the microgravity of spaceflight or the reduced gravity of planetary environments.  By recovering all of the hydrogen which is lost as methane in the Sabatier reactor, the requirement for production or resupply of hydrogen is reduced to the absolute minimum.","The NASA application will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future long duration exploration objectives such as a lunar base, Mars transit or Mars base.  The primary application will be for the recovery of hydrogen lost in the Sabatier process for CO2 reduction to produce water in Advanced Life Support systems.  Secondarily, this process may also be used in conjunction with a Sabatier reactor employed for propellant and fuel production from Martian atmospheric CO2. This process will also produce carbon nanotubes which may be employed for adsorption or catalytic destruction of toxic airborne or waterborne contaminants.","Production of carbon nanotubes is an area with extremely high economic potential. Numerous potential applications for these materials, include: nanometer sized semiconductor components and devices, field emission displays, hydrogen storage, sensors, energy storage and energy conversion devices, catalysts, and conductive and high strength composites. Carbon nanotubes, are extremely valuable products for which there are currently no efficient methods of high volume production, particularly for the production of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). A secondary commercial application of the innovation will be as a means for the production of hydrogen with extremely low CO contamination for use in fuel cells."

Conventional techniques, using either metal hydroxide or metal oxide sobent, require after-mission regeneration or replacement, thus putting a critical cap on mission duration.  More recent techniques, such as pressure swing adsorption-based process also require regeneration and use expendable resources. A novel approach to the problem is the use of a membrane device that can effectively separate CO2 in the presence of moisture, using space vacuum as the driving force. Such a membrane device has minimal mass, volume and power penalty and does not require regeneration; therefore, long-duration space exploration can be realized.  In Phase I, we will develop a novel nanocomposite membrane with a microporous aminosilicate structure for enhanced CO2 separation with simultaneous humidity control. CO2 preferentially adsorbs onto the pore surfaces of the aminosilicate membrane and transports via surface diffusion, thus resulting in pore blockage or pore size reduction to prevent other inert gases such as O2 and N2 from permeating through. With the combination of molecular sieving and surface diffusion mechanisms, the proposed membrane can be expected to achieve superb CO2 separation performance for effective spacecraft cabin air revitalization.","Potential NASA applications for the proposed novel membrane include environmental CO2 partial pressure control for spacecraft, space station, and spacesuit applications.  This proposed novel composite membrane could be an enabling technology for NASA manned space program, allowing potential extended mission duration with less consumables compared to the baseline technologies.","Potential non-NASA applications for the proposed novel membrane include enhanced oil recovery, separation of CO2 from natural gas streams, CO2 recovery from fermentation processes, building CO2-level active control, and fruit and vegetable preservation."

This absorption is irreversible so longer flights require more LiOH.  For long duration flights it is essential that a small, lightweight system that recovers the CO2 be developed.  This allows the CO2 to be used to regenerate O2 for re-use.Compact Membrane systems (CMS) has identified a novel membrane contactor process for absorption and subsequent desorption of the CO2.  Key to the process is that the contactor both operate effectively and that loss of the absorption/desorption fluid be kept to a minimum.In Phase I, CMS will build system and demonstrate systems capability with a focus on key desorption unit operation.  Analysis will demonstrate ability to transport CO2 while maintaining minimal loss of absorbent.  System stability will be demonstrated by evaluating performance over wide temperature range (30-90o C).  Chemical stability with absorbants will also be demonstrated.  With all the above basic data in hand, we will evaluate the needed system size, weight and power consumption.  Lastly we will compare results to molecular sieve adsorbants which are the incumbent for long duration flights.","As humans increase their presence in space, the problem of CO2 removal will become more difficult.  The long duration missions of the future will be technologically more demanding than the relatively short duration missions of the past and the current missions in earth orbit.  There will be a greater need to reduce mission mass, reduce power usage and recover oxygen.  The technology offered in this proposal addresses these critical issues.","This is a cornerstone technology with numerous potential commercial opportunities.  This includes (a) capturing CO2 for CO2  sequestering, (b) acid gas removal from natural gas, and (c) CO2 removal from submarines.  There is a major CO2 sequestering initiative associated with global warming and low cost way to recover CO2 is essential.  A parallel major initiative is developing greater supplies of natural gas.  Removal of CO2 and other acid gasses will significantly enhance this objective.  Submarines have similar CO2 removal needs and would therefore benefit from this technology."

A single unique, high-resolution omnidirectional wraparound image projector projects continuous wraparound imagery onto thin, curved, three-color-(RGB)-multiplexed holographic optics, which collimate the projected light into a virtual image.  EVIS will thus display a greater than 180 degree (up to full 360 degree) free-standing FOV of flowing virtual earth scene to a crew member on a treadmill.  Without multiple projectors, bulky optics, or a tiled screen, EVIS will be compact, lightweight, and power-efficient.  It is producible at low cost by integrating commercially available microdisplays for the omnidirectional projector and by mass producing the multiplexed holographic collimating screen by means of established POC technologies.  In Phase I POC will design in detail an EVIS display system for a treadmill, and fabricate a proof-of-concept model to demonstrate feasibility.  Phase II will focus on optimizing both the material technology and components so that a fully operational prototype is completed.","The proposed EVIS display system will benefit the psychological and physiological well-being of NASA space crews on ultralong-duration missions to the Moon or Mars.  It can also benefit real-time telepresence, remote space exploration, and EVA applications, space flight training, flight navigation, and spacecraft and space station design.","The EVIS display system with a personal exercise machine will create a more inviting and pleasant environment (e.g., jogging in New York's Central Park or along a California beach) than the home or gym.  It can also be used for simulation and training for government and civilian personnel programs such as commercial airplane flight simulation.

The PPLL is a high-resolution ultrasonic spectrometer that measures changes in natural velocity with parts in ten million accuracy.  With this resolution, the PPLL can be used to measure a material's nonlinear elastic constants, which are related to changes in the speed of sound as it is loaded.  Nonlinear elastic constants are more closely linked to bone strength than traditional absolute measurements of the speed of sound, thus providing an important new capability for bone health assessment.This technology has been demonstrated on a number of engineered materials, including fasteners, heat-treated aluminum, heat-treated steel, composite materials, railroad rails, and adhesive bonds.

The important goals include extending human presence in the solar system culminating in the exploration of Mars and other remote destinations.  To accomplish this goal, affordable, new technologies to support long-term missions must be developed.  One of the most critical problems facing such space missions is identification of effective methods to control solid waste.  With current waste models, 1300 kg of waste occupying a volume 20 m3 will be generated in a 180-day mission to Mars.  Unprocessed waste poses a biological hazard to the crew and continual exposure to odors from untreated waste is a serious threat to crew health and morale.  The waste processing methods currently under consideration include incineration, microbial oxidation, pyrolysis and compaction.  Although each has advantages, no single method has yet been developed that is safe, recovers valuable resources including oxygen and water, and has low energy and space requirements.  In this Phase I SBIR project, TDA will conduct tests with a new, low temperature oxidation process that converts waste to carbon dioxide and water.  In addition to having low power requirements, the system will be compact and reliable.","The most immediate NASA application for a low temperature oxidation process would be to control solid waste on a long-term space mission.  In addition, the process would find use in removing carbon deposits from heat exchangers in high-speed aircraft that utilize fuel for cooling.  In some cases, thin layers of carbon are deposited on the heat exchanger walls, which if left to accumulate, can cause the unit to fail.  Therefore, identifying a cost effective, simple, and safe procedure to remove coke between missions represents enabling technology for the continued development of reusable high-speed aircraft.","In addition to the use our process would find in controlling waste, there are several commercial applications.  The process can be applied to any situation where oxidation at low temperatures is necessary.  For example the process can be used to clean hydrocarbons from semiconductors, magnetic disks, medical devices, flight hardware, etc.  High temperature processes would damage these components, however at the moderate temperatures required with this process, these components would not be harmed."

Significant reductions can be achieved using water treatment systems based upon thermally regenerable ion-exchange (TRIX) resins.  Ion-exchange (IX) has been the preferred method for removal of aqueous ionic contaminants due to the efficiency of flow-through beds.  Attributes of IX systems include ambient temperature and pressure operation, minimal energy use, rapid and efficient contaminant removal, and compared to other purification technologies, failure mechanisms are relatively benign.  However, strong acid and alkali are required to regenerate these beds, making regeneration aboard spacecraft impractical.  New hybrid TRIX resins developed at UMPQUA RESEARCH COMPANY offer the potential to remove ionic contaminants from water with an acceptable ESM, while retaining the intrinsic advantages of flow-through IX beds. Testing and further development of TRIX is proposed for removal of ionic contaminants from wastewater generated by future transit and early planetary base missions.  The primary program objective will be the demonstration of efficient salt removal from different wastewater sources using TRIX resins.  Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of water purification based upon TRIX.  Phase II will result in development and testing of a fully functional system suitable for further independent testing by NASA.","The ESM for current and future water reclamation systems will be lowered by replacement of ion-exchange sub-processes with a TRIX system.  TRIX systems can also be designed to augment other water treatment methods, such as for ammonia removal and nitrate recovery from biological water processor (BWPs), salt removal from post-treated photocatalytic or catalytic oxidation effluents, or salt removal from intermediate treatment processes such as reverse osmosis (RO).","Employment of TRIX as a salt-free water softener for domestic and commercial uses, will be a major environmental benefit. TRIX will reduce regeneration chemical requirements for commercial ion-exchange systems.  Commercial interest has been indicated by Novation Environmental Technologies for development of 'brine free' water softening methods and hardware to treat problematic industrial waste streams.  Novation has expressed willingness to provide realistic waste stream compositions which cannot easily be treated by conventional methods, and to facilitate field trials in support of commercialization.

Here we propose the development of a catalytic system for the treatment of these gaseous byproducts which will decomposed volatile organics into harmless inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide and water.  These products may then be rerouted to the Life Support System for reduction to produce water (from CO2), and electrolysis of water to yield oxygen.  Feasibility of the catalytic methods will be demonstrated during the Phase I research.

Solar radiation is not a viable option for growing plants on the moon or on Mars for multiple reasons. On the other hand, lighting plants with electric lamps and rejecting the associated waste heat has energy costs that have driven NASA toward other options to provide food and fresh air to future Mars crews. The solution offered by this project improves upon the efficiency of a novel new light-distribution technology involving low-power, solid-state sources that emit specific-wavelength photons to match plant photoreceptors. The HELIAC lighting system consists of small individual ""light engines"" that provide a level of control precision far in excess of standard lamps. This precision enables lamp configuration to be adapted to species specific growth habits so that photons can be absorbed efficiently by all available photosynthetic tissues. HELIAC will also provide the capability to adapt spectral balance automatically to plant development stage. Finally, it will have the capability to automatically detect the proximity of plant tissue and power only adjacent light engines, thereby greatly decreasing power requirements, particularly during early plant development.","The production of edible biomass in closed or nearly-closed environments is essential for the future of long-term planetary exploration and human settlement on the moon or Mars. The proposed lighting system is well suited for use in large space-based applications. In addition to the potential for significant power savings over existing lighting systems, the use of solid-state lighting eliminates problems associated with traditional lighting in closed systems such as short operational life (requiring resupply), high mass and volume, limited control options, and safety concerns including high temperatures, glass envelopes, and toxic materials.","Controlled-environment agriculture profitability often is most limited by energy costs. Dense crop stands block overhead light from reaching the majority of lower leaves in closed foliar canopies, thereby compromising yield and requiring high light levels that are not absorbed efficiently. Light-distribution systems that are low power, relatively cool, that uniformly irradiate all leaves within a stand only with wavelengths most efficiently absorbed by photosynthetic tissue, and that 0automatically adjust emissions to target new tissues as plants grow in height or spread without wasting photons by lighting empty space will substantially lower energy costs of controlled-environment production and will improve profitability."

More over, due to the high transparency of the mesoporous silicon throughout a large part of the far IR range, such filters can be made for wavelengths far longer than those that can be addressed with conventional interference filter technology. They will considerably outperform filters based on metal meshes. Such filters are expected to impact astronomical, commercial, military and scientific communities in many filter applications. In Phase I, it is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method by fabricating porous multilayers with ultrahigh thickness and to evaluate a sintering technique to enhance environmental stability. In Phase II, optimized filters will be fabricated and their properties compared with design predictions.

SIDIP will be inexpensive and power efficient, with minimal mass, and will deliver digitally controlled, high-precision attitude control and in-space maneuvering through micropulses of regulated duration and frequency.  The SIDIP system is based on two key innovations:  development of a novel, MEMS-based periodic structure of subminiature microthrusters; and unique implementation of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology that POC has developed for processing Si wafers for precise micromachining of the hundreds (or more) of subminiature field emission electric microthrusters on a 1 in. x 1 in. Si microthruster plate (MTP).  SIDIP will remarkably increase the precision of in-space maneuvering, and improve attitude and orbit control.  NASA Earth Science missions will benefit from SIDIP, especially for miniatusre satellites in a cluster or constellation.  In Phase I POC will optimize the SIDIP system geometry, develop technology for micromachining silicon MTPs, and demonstrate technologies for fabricating pyrimids and oxidizing matrix channels.  In Phase II POC will demonstrate an engineering prototype SIDIP.","POC's Silicon Digital Propulsion system will have a wide range of NASA Earth Science applications.  It will support many drag-free Earth Observation Missions, which require ultraprecise attitude control, and will, for example, maintain submicron accuracy in relative position of separated elements of a large-array optical telescope.  SIDIP technology will also find wide application in satellite electrical potential control and mass spectrometry.","In addition to nanosat control, the SIDIP system will have applications in ion lithography, and in ion sources for nanofabrication; protein mass spectrometry; and nuclear research.  POC's initial market research indicates that the SIDIP system will have a particularly high commercial potential as an innovative technology for large-format field-emission devices; for large plasma TV screens, especially, it will reduce manufacturing cost, operating voltage, and power consumption, and will increase the brightness and resolution of the screens."

It will not provide adequate specific energy and cycle life for Earth Science missions. It will not enable the United States to reestablish its position of strategic technical advantage in portable energy storage. However, the next generation of secondary Li batteries is being developed in the US. It is based on lithium metal anodes and sulfur containing liquid cathodes. The sulfur-based cathode delivers a theoretical specific energy of 2450 Wh/kg, more than any other known cathode material of secondary cell. The Li-S battery needs advanced technology for improved stabilization of the Li anode in the corrosive environment of the liquid sulfur cathode. We propose a novel application of modern rocket fuel chemistry to create a self-healing, solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. Li-S cells equipped with this robust passivation will stably perform at 400 Wh/kg level for ~ 300 cycles. At 200 Wh/kg a cycle life of ~ 1000 cycles is expected. The good low temperature performance and excellent rate capability features of Li-S cell will remain intact.   These features are the next leap toward the advanced energy storage technologies required for Earth science observation platforms.","Advanced energy storage technologies for Earth science observation platforms that include traditional spacecraft, airborne platforms, such as piloted and unpiloted aircraft and balloons, terrestrial platforms, micro-spacecraft, and surface penetrators.","Li/S will replace Li/Ion in majority of commercial applications requiring portable energy sources, such as cell phones, laptops and pen tabs computers, camcorders, digital cameras. Since rate capability of Li/S cell (liquid cathode versions) is much higher than LiIon and is comparable with aqueous electrolyte systems, it will also penetrate high rate applications markets such as power tools. Aqueous electrolyte-based batteries, such as Ni/Cd and Ni/MeH, currently dominate power tools market. It is expected that the developed Li/S technology will penetrate this market. In this case one Li/S battery will be replacing four (by weight basis) counterparts."

ITN's innovative approach is to alloy CuInSe2 (CIS) with both aluminum and gallium bandgap widening elements in the chalcopyrite matrix to form CuInGaAlSe2 (CIGAS) for simultaneous optimization of the bandgap and material properties. Both Ga and Al will be used to take advantage of the alloy enhancing properties that each offers when used in moderation, while avoiding the detrimental issues when using too much of any one element to achieve the optimum bandgap of about 1.45 eV for a single-junction in the space solar spectrum. Furthermore, a recently available novel lightweight, flexible and transparent substrate will be used that was specifically designed to enable high-temperature CIGAS depositions as needed for the highest efficiency TFPV.  TFPV specific power of over 1500 W/kg at the blanket/module level would be achievable The novel transparent substrates would also enable additional power from bifacial visible light collection and lower temperature operation, from improved infra-red (IR) transmission, in addition to enabling TFPV fabrication by low-cost roll-to-roll processing.","ITN's proposed technology, potentially decreasing the weight of spacecraft solar power by 75%, would have broad impact on NASA spacecraft weight and launch costs. NASA applications would also benefit from a wide-bandgap PV device, as proposed, for better thermal stability, better temperature coefficients, and higher-voltage solar arrays.  Furthermore, the high specific power (W/kg) and ability of the proposed TFPV to be integrated into the balloon, high-altitude airship (HAA) or tent fabric, would enable balloon or HAA applications, in addition to modular and quick deploying tents for surface assets or lunar or Mars base power.  The high specific power and power density would also enable Earth and Mars unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) applications.","Two of the most important, near-term markets for high-efficiency flexible lightweight photovoltaics are spacecraft and aerostats/high-altitude airships (HAA). The target customers for this market are aerospace companies, defense, and communications industries. The largest market is in the evolving HAA industry, but there is also an opportunity in the well-established satellite community.  Market projections indicate that approximately 16.5 MW of flexible thin film PV power will to be launched for HAA's, and 1.0 MW of space PV power will be launched between 2007 and 2011. In the long term, as the costs eventually come down with manufacturing process improvements and economies of scale, the PV space/HAA product technology can be leveraged for the implementation of the low-cost monolithic tandem PV terrestrial product. The terrestrial PV market is projected to be a $163 ? 302 M (min and max estimates) per year market by 2010 for thin-film technologies in North America alone, with a compound annual growth rate between 16.1% and 32.3%."

These efficiency levels are on the order of 2 to 4 times those of thermoelectric conversion systems. The evaluation processes will incorporate an in-depth evaluation of the structural materials and fabrications techniques required to maximize convertor specific power while at the same time insuring high reliability and long operating life. Due to the unique operating characteristics of convertors of this size a proof of concept linear alternator will be developed and tested during Phase I.

In addition a scaling study will be performed identify optimal configurations over the entire power range of interest.","The proposed low power generating system, operating at power outputs in the range of 50 to 500 mW, has a number of potential NASA and US government agency applications. It provides small, robust stand-alone power systems for sensors and communication equipment integrated into single unit. The significantly greater efficiency of the proposed system will minimize the number of LWRHU, or related, heat sources dramatically reducing system cost and minimizing environmental concerns with the use of isotope heat sources. Extremely ""aggressive"" environments such as high external pressures, low temperatures, and chemically active sites represent areas of use of the proposed system. Another application is the use of the proposed system as the power supply for very small satellite systems that may find wider use in the future. The simplicity of the isotope heat source combined with the proposed MRSC convertor will yield high efficiency power supplied with long maintenance free operating lives.","While the radioisotope heat source generally is limited to space applications, the potential also exists that this type of small self contained power source could be used for terrestrial applications. While recovery of the device will be critical, applications such as underwater environmental monitoring in deep-sea areas or under ice in cold climates represents strong possibilities. In these cases the power supply would be directly coupled with the sensor package forming a compact self-contained unit.The advent of MEMS level combustion devices may also provide a long life, combustion driven heat source that could supply the necessary thermal energy for the low power MRSC system described in the proposed work. These combustors could be based on ""conventional"" combustion techniques yielding source temperatures well above those provided by the LWRHU configuration or utilize less conventional techniques such as low temperature catalytic reactions providing source temperatures in line with those of the LWRHU system. Application for such devices could include environmental monitoring, metering of remote / dangerous facilities (for example gas / oil wells) where non-conventional combustion techniques may have a premium and a wide range of self powered industrial and consumer products."

Our approach is innovative in three ways.  First, we propose a complete end-to-end system instead of a solution that addresses only a single step of the complex problem of accurately gathering, processing, and reporting of the data.   Secondly, we propose a system that is designed to minimize human interaction and manual data entry.  Thirdly, and possibly the most important part of this innovation, is that we propose both the implementation of multiple algorithms to perform the data processing, as well as an extensible software architecture which allows new algorithms to be incorporated into the system in the future.  This approach allows for the development of a dynamic system which can be extended in the future as better algorithms are developed.  Our proposal is relevant to topic E3.03 in that it provides for the efficient production of a DEM product from an active imaging system (LIDAR).

Traditional georegistration solutions in the geospatial, photogrammetric, and computer vision communities select a set of control features in an existing database and identify the same features in an incoming dataset. However, these registration algorithms are not robust due to variations in scale, resolution, and sensor characteristics, where the identification of control features becomes a complex and challenging process. Recent NASA sponsored innovations include Feature Analyst (FA) automation with a registration scheme that is along the lines of traditional tools (e.g. use few control features to co-register two datasets). Here, we propose a new approach based object configuration similarity.  Our solution - a departure from traditional approaches ? uses abstract spatial relations (e.g. three square buildings forming an orthogonal triangle with a river running between them) as matching features, and transforms the registration problem into a spatial similarity assessment problem. Our approach results in unparalleled pull-in range as coarse location data are adequate to support the recovery of registration information for a configuration.","NASA applications include the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Core System (ECS) Synergy Program, NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC), Remote Data Store (RDS).

However, the cooling requirements make them bulky and unsuitable to be incorporated into robust autonomous sensor systems. We propose to develop detectors with high detectivity that operates at or near room temperature in the MWIR (3 to 5 um) and LWIR (8 to 12 um) atmospheric windows. These detectors are based on the active regions with HgCdTe bulk alloy layer and a secondary HgCdTe bulk alloy layer, which serves as a sink for both the dark and background currents. Room temperature or moderately cooled operation of these detectors is achieved by suppressing the Auger and radiative recombination mechanisms. We will also incorporate in each pixel a dynamic skimming that will reduce the effect of dark and background currents while enhancing the dynamic range. Therefore, we are designing detectors that are read out integrated circuit (ROIC) friendly.  We plan to achieve these objectives by combining the advantages of the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) crystal growth technique, an innovative nonequilibrium device architecture, photon recycling concepts, dynamic dark current skimming, and optimized read out circuit that will increase the operating temperature. High quality HgCdTe layers (for infrared detection) will be grown on large area (3-5"") silicon substrates. This will make it possible to produce rugged, low-cost, large area focal plane arrays with higher operating temperatures and near-BLIP performance","Near room temperature FPAs will be  suitable for space-based spectroscopic applications. HgCdTe-based devices, with the advantages of small electron mass, high mobilities, and large electron saturation velocities have considerable benefits for a variety of new micro-electronic and optoelectronic applications, if near room temperature operation is achieved with a nonequilibrium mode of operation. As a consequence of negative luminescence at ambient temperatures, nonequilibrium devices cool their surroundings, thus creating the potential for a new application, ""radiation coolers"".","Near room temperature focal plane arrays will find enormous applications in military, space and medical imaging areas for infrared imaging. Another area where these detectors will find enormous application is in the automobile industry, for example as driver's navigation aids in nighttime and foggy weather conditions.

The advanced EP devices such as colloid thrusters are suitable for sub-mN thrust while electrostatic or electromagnetic thrusters are suitable for large deltaV missions where their higher dry mass is offset by higher specific impulse.Busek therefore proposes to develop a complete micro-resistojet system operating on ammonia or methanol delivering thrust up to 5mN, specific impulse approaching 300sec, impulse bit smaller than 1mNsec and power consumption lower than approximately 10Watts.

This opens the possibility of using inter-spacecraft forces and torques (such as those generated electromagnetically) as the primary means of control, eliminating the need for onboard propellant.  Eliminating the dependence on a non-replenishable consumable (propellant) in lieu of a replenishable resource (electricity) allows even aggressive maneuvers to be repeated without limit for as along as the other subsystems last.

The proposed filters offer unmatched levels of rejection within a very wide rejection band combined with a high level of transmission within the pass band that can be centered throughout the deep and far UV range. In addition, unlike common interference-based filters, the spectral position of the pass and rejection bands will not depend on the angle of incidence. The proposed filters will be light weight and may be manufactured cost-effectively in large quantities. In Phase I, it is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method by fabricating pore structures with different pore wall coatings and measuring the transmission and other optical properties.  In Phase II, optimized filters will be fabricated and their properties compared with design predictions.  Phase III will involve product design, fabricating filter structures to meet customers' physical as well as optical needs, and marketing and sales investments.","Deep and far UV imaging is a powerful technique to study auroral activity and compositions of atmospheres around solar system planets and moons. UV index forecasting, earth impact and other vital environmental information can be obtained. Available filters suffer from problems stemming from either a narrow band of high rejection or a wide band of shallow rejection, and degradation of the filter performance with the variations of angle of incidence. Problems with available UV transparent materials (moisture absorption, delamination) lead to difficulty in making robust or large area filters. The proposed filters can solve these problems and reduce costs.","UV filters are used for harmful UV radiation detection, water purification, proof-of-flame, water analysis, postal security systems, environmental monitoring, semiconductor lithographic instrumentation, medical analyzers and monitors (ophthalmology), high voltage corona detection and electrical spark imaging.

For direct detectors an input filter is required to define the receiver's frequency band and reject out of band energy. In the case of a heterodyne receiver, the signal band is defined by the back-end electronics, however, input filters are required to eliminate stray radiation that can saturate the mixer or create signal artifacts that degrade performance and prevent accurate calibration.

This is particularly true for secondary mirrors, as they are convex and thus require large-aperture optics to test them.  Subaperture stitching has the potential to provide accurate high-resolution maps of large-aperture aspheric optics without the use of dedicated nulls.  QED has already developed the subaperture stitching interferometer (SSI), which combines a vertical workstation with a commercially-available 4"" or 6"" interferometer.  Nanometer-level accuracies have been obtained on spherical optics by optimally compensating subaperture placement errors, as well as automatically calibrating for systematic errors such as reference wave error and distortion.  Non-null capability is enhanced since the individual subapertures have significantly less aspheric departure.  However, the system is currently only capable of testing up to 280 mm optics of mild asphericity.  This proposal focuses on innovations for leveraging these considerable benefits of stitching (high resolution, automatic calibration, and flexible aspheric testing) to larger and more aspheric optics.  Activities will include novel stitching strategies to calibrate for gravitational deformations, adaptive asphere calibration methods, specialised platform designs, and subscale testing.

The Phase 1 effort will focus on a feasibility study of two critical components of the system:  the thin X-ray windows required for the sample holder, and the mechanism for controlling the granular flow.  The Phase 2 R&D work will lead to a VSH brassboard prototype that can be remotely operated and interfaced to a planetary XRD instrument.","The proposed system will enable planetary X-ray diffraction instruments to produce high quality data without complex sample preparation.  It will be imbedded in a host instrument such as CheMin, the planetary definitive mineralogy instrument developed by NASA.  The reduced constraints on sample preparation and compactness of the system will allow fitting XRD capabilities on a broader range of landed platforms. The technology could serve a variety of other types of in-situ planetary instruments requiring delivery of powdered material.  It will also help in the implementation of remote XRD capabilities in terrestrial laboratories for the study of returned samples.","The proposed technique will find a range of applications in industrial and research laboratories as a means to automatically load powdered samples in XRD instruments for analysis or process control (cements, inks, pharmaceuticals, ceramics, etc.), or to characterize materials that cannot be ground to fine-grained size (explosives, pharmaceuticals).  It will also be essential to XRD instruments for field or remote analyses of hazardous substances, geological materials, etc.  The Vibrating Sample Holder could be produced as a stand-alone unit fitted to commercial instruments or as part of a complete system that takes full advantage of its unique capabilities."

A complete IR monolith, with novel construction, will follow in Phase II.  The viability of both the Phase I and Phase II constructs will be shown by detecting and analyzing interferograms for a monochromatic and a polychromatic source.  The analysis of that data will use Fourier Transform code written by the experimenters in Interactive Data Language (IDL).

The Phase II instrument will be available for further research","The SHS is far more robust than conventional interferometers, making it the ideal interferometer for space-based applications.  The missions of the Mars Exploration and New Frontiers Programs ? particularly the latter's Venus In Situ Explorer and Jupiter Polar Orbiter ? would be fertile ground for the monolithic SHS.  A SHS monolith would also mesh strongly with the Comet Surface Sample Return mission.  As the Solar System is explored, remote sensing of planetary, satellite, and cometary atmospheres and ionospheres will become very important.  The SHS is extremely well-suited to these missions of the coming decades.","The monolithic SHS is potentially a competitor to the FTIR or echelle-class spectrometers now used for environmental chemical detection and sensing.  It also can bring the advantages of interferometry (in terms of improved throughput and compactness) to realms such as computer-card-based spectroscopy, where grating spectrometers are now used.  These computer cards, featuring miniature spectrometers built directly onto their surface, are used in tasks ranging from diagnostic testing to portable spectroscopy to educational demonstrations and labs.

Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. proposes to build an automated, high-throughput instrument to measure changes in protein expression levels in single living cells during passage in a space environment. Commercial libraries of clones expressing GFP (green fluorescent proteins) fused to individual yeast proteins are available for the entire yeast proteome. We will test the feasibility of using fluorescence measurements of these chimeric fusion proteins as an indicator of changes in the expression levels of the endogenous proteins upon exposure to radiation. Our instrument consists of a continuous, multi-well, suspension culture bioreactor that provides yeast clones that are sampled in a microfluidic flow cytometer. Light scattering and fluorescent signals from the yeast particles under flow will activate an in-line cell sorter to collect cells of interest for follow-up analysis. Since the instrument is self-contained, has low power consumption and a small footprint, and uses fluidic based cell separation, it will be suitable for collecting single cell protein expression information in a space laboratory.","Although this instrument's initial use is to study the effects of radiation on yeast protein expression, it may be applied to study effects of a space environment on any cell line grown in suspension culture, including extremeophiles. Adherent eukaryotic cells attached to microcarriers could also be used. While it purports to measure protein levels, it could also be applied to other fluorescence-based assays including mutational analysis, directed evolution studies, and screening of radioprotective compounds. Ground as well as space-based applications are contemplated. Long-term, unattended experiments are permitted by the simplicity of bioreactor design and automation of the cytometric analysis.","Many commercial applications arise for this instrument which combines a continuous cell culture bioreactor and a microfluidic flow cytometer/ cell sorter, including drug testing, combinatorial analysis, and stem cell differentiation. The bioreactor component fills an unmet need for culturing multiple clones or different cell lines under identical growth conditions in limited volumes. The cytometric analyzer/sorter provides an economical alternative to large-frame, general purpose, cell sorters in markets where high-throughput, dedicated purpose, cell screening is required. Multiple wavelength fluorescence measurements may be easily accommodated by using Geiger-mode APD arrays rather than single element APDs."

Exposure to radiation damages DNA.  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are liberated, causing oxidative damage to DNA bases.  The major consequence of this damage is misincorporation of bases during replication, leading to irreversible cell damage, cancer or compromised cell function.  Oxidatively damaged genomic DNA is tagged at the lesions using specific antibodies, and the resultant DNA is scanned in a linear manner by our single molecule nanodevice.  The locations, amount, and type of lesions are recorded for each DNA molecule.  Megabase pair DNA is scanned by the reader in milliseconds, at ultra-sensitive single molecule detection limits.  The technology is highly practical based on our significant experiences in developing single molecule scanning technologies.  The potential nanoscale device and analysis speed create new possibilities for routine implementation.  This addresses a current unmet need since there are no existing technologies that allow comprehensive assessment of DNA oxidative damage.","Space radiation poses significant risks for human travel across the solar system.  Substantial new research and technology for understanding the susceptibility and sensitivity to solid cancer, immunological damage risks, and other health risks are required.  First, without adequate study of radiation effects to determine minimal thresholds for early detection of damaged cells, humans may be exposed to toxic levels of radiation without knowing it.  Second, the development of our assay allows the real-time measurement and monitoring of levels of DNA damage during space flight.  Third, new therapies that correct oxidative damage can be developed with a highly sensitive assay.","Drugs, environmental insults, and chemotherapy can oxidatively damage DNA, leading to irreversible DNA lesions.  The effects of DNA damage are cumulative, since cancer and other disorders require multiple genetic defects prior to manifestation.  First, there is significant opportunity for early disease detection, offering possibilities for timely intervention.  Second, the existence of our proposed assay offers a new platform for drug companies to develop approaches to reverse oxidative damage, potentially through the upregulation of DNA repair enzymes, such as the enzyme OGG, which has a major role in the prevention of reactive oxygen species-induced carcinogenesis."

AGATE, based on the proposing firm's patented MCSM control algorithm, is innovative in providing, for the first time, stereo-vision based precision control of the mobile base of the rover and the onboard robotic arm relative to a visually-specified target. This provides a significant advantage over current MER technology since the new system will automatically compensate for wheel slippage and kinematic inaccuracy in order to ensure accurate placement of the instrument relative to that target.  The algorithm will use the NASA-JPL standard CAHVOR stereo-camera model used on the Sojourner, Spirit, and Opportunity rovers.

The gashopper will first retrieve CO2 gas from the Martian environment to store it in liquid form at a pressure of about 10 bar. When enough CO2 is stored to make a substantial flight to another Mars site, a hot pellet bed is heated to ~1000 K and the CO2 propellant is warmed to ~300 K to pressurize the tank to ~65 bar. A valve is then opened, allowing the liquid CO2 to pass through the hot pellet bed that heats and gasifies the CO2 for propulsion. The hot gas is piped to a set of thrusters beneath the aircraft, allowing vertical takeoff, after which the gas is shunted off to a primary rearward pointing thruster to generate forward flight speed. The hot gas system  is also used for attitude control and main propulsion during landing. The advantage of the gashopper is that it provides Mars exploration with a fully controllable aerial reconnaissance vehicle that can repeatedly land and explore surface sites as well.","The gashopper enables greatly enhanced mobility for robotic Mars exploration vehicles.  However the gashopper pellet bed rocket system (PBRS) has many potential important commercial applications in space. Small PBRS thrusters using ammonia could be used for stationkeeping and reaction control system (RCS) propulsion for satellites, as they would provide a non-toxic alternative with comparable performance to hydrazine.  PBRS engines could also be used to great advantage to provide stationkeeping propulsion for the International Space Station employing waste CO2 from the life support system as propellant and the PBRS to provide thrust at a much higher level than possible using resistojets.","Another possible commercial application for PBRS technology is for rocket assisted takeoff (RATO) units for small aircraft. The PBRS engine can deliver large amounts of thrust, and because its propellant is CO2 it poses no danger of fire. A PBRS RATO system could be designed as a droppable integrated tank/engine units that would be heated on the airfield using local electric power. Such systems could enable the takeoff of aircraft that are forced to land on short airstrips in emergencies. Since such use of a RATO  would avoid loss of an entire aircraft, it could be priced high."

(MEI) and Colorado School of Mines (CSM) propose to develop an integrated hydrogen generator and purifier system for conversion of in-situ produced hydrocarbons to fuel-cell-grade hydrogen.  NASA is currently developing several In Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) Systems.  One technology commonly found in most ISRU scenarios is the use of the Sabatier reaction and water electrolysis to produce methane and oxygen.  Due to the various penalties of storing gaseous hydrogen on-board the rover, it is advantageous to carry methane instead of hydrogen and to have an on-board reformer to produce hydrogen on-demand for the fuel cell.  Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells hydrogen with very low carbon monoxide content (typically less than 10 ppm).  The proposed system will combine microchannel microreformer technology for hydrogen production with palladium membranes technology for hydrogen purification and separation in an integrated hydrogen production system, resulting in optimized size and energy efficiency.  This proposal will seek to establish the feasibility of using compact microchannel/membrane reactor systems to provide purified hydrogen for fuel cell power systems for applications such as robotic and crew transportation rovers.","The technology developed for the proposed Reformer System will serve in multiple future exploration missions.  The application is of direct use for any applications where mobile power is required, such as rovers and crew transport vehicles.  For instance, in the earlier precursor robotic missions, robotic rovers may be needed for automated ISRU plants, to transport materials being processed, etc.  In the later manned missions, the crew transportation vehicles may be use to aid extra-vehicular activities.","Advanced high-density hydrogen storage and generation systems have far reaching commercial importance.  Integration of such systems with fuel cells offer the promise of generating electricity and heat while offering several benefits relative to conventional generators including reduced noise, reduced emissions, high energy efficiency, and reduced maintenance.  As a widespread hydrogen fuel distribution infrastructure does not meaningfully exist, the challenges posed by high-density hydrogen storage create commercial opportunities for innovative product solutions.  Thus, a fuel processor with the capability to reliably generate high-purity hydrogen remains a necessary enabling component to realize practical commercial fuel cell systems."

Existing pathways to olefins and aromatics via methane exhibit low per-pass conversion.  Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can provide much higher conversion, but into a broad spectrum of products.  In contrast, it is possible to achieve high conversion and selectivity to specific olefins and aromatics via the proposed methanol pathway, with minimal net hydrogen consumption.  Interest stems from in situ resources utilization (ISRU) of planetary (e.g., Martian) resources to reduce mission weight and cost with enhanced safety.  Olefins and aromatics are attractive target species because of their high hydrogen leverage as well as their potential utility as fuels and feedstocks for polymers or other chemicals.  Phase I will consist of the following:  1) identify, prepare, and characterize the best potential catalysts for principal process stages; 2) test catalysts under representative conditions; 3) identify the best route for converting CO2 to olefins and aromatics; and 4) estimate potential performance of an integrated system.  During Phase II each process stage will be optimized, the stages integrated, and a working breadboard system designed and fabricated.","The technology developed in this overall program, if successful, would find use in the NASA ISRU portfolio in exploration of Mars and other planetary targets.  It would find particular use in the selective synthesis of fuels and polymer precursors and would help reduce net mission weight.  The ability to synthesize ethylene (and/or propylene) on Mars would enable a host of polymers and chemicals to be produced there.","Gas-to-liquids processes are becoming of increasing importance in commercial sectors because of high petroleum prices (and eventually, dwindling supply) and the need for technologies for better utilizing natural gas resources.  The catalysts and process developed in this overall program will find use in converting natural gas (including low quality natural gas) to readily transportable methanol and hydrocarbons and will, consequently, be of interest to natural gas suppliers and petroleum companies and refiners.  Additionally, the technology being developed will find use in the sequestration of CO2 in polymers."

This enables high temperature carbothermal reduction of silicon oxide yielding five times as much oxygen recovery from planetary regolith compared to hydrogen-based reduction systems.  COSRS is an in situ planetary resource utilization process that yields useful oxygen and metals by reducing the majority of metal oxides in undifferentiated lunar, asteroidal, and Martian surface materials.  The COSRS initially heats the materials to temperatures where the iron-bound oxygen combines with carbon monoxide, a strong reducing agent (reductant).  Simultaneously, the produced iron metal catalyzes the disproportionation of carbon monoxide to carbon and carbon dioxide. The temperature is then raised for carbothermal reduction of the silicates, producing carbon monoxide, which is recycled back to the first stage process, and silicon metal. The carbon dioxide created in the iron reduction/disproportionation step is processed with hydrogen in a Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) unit to make carbon monoxide and water. After electrolysis, the oxygen is stored while the CO is recycled to the reactor.","The COSRS is a potentially enabling technology for human Lunar exploration because it can produce the majority of the oxygen available in undifferentiated Lunar soil, or roughly five times the yield of hydrogen reduction technologies. This increased productivity eliminates the need to beneficiate the soil, thereby enabling automated lunar oxygen facilities that could produce return propellant prior to the arrival of the crew. This will greatly decrease the launch costs required to support the lunar base, and also enable long range exploration using ballistic hoppers employing Lunar oxygen.  The COSRS will also work on asteroids, Mars, and Jupiter's moons.","The integrated COSRS/RWGS/Carbothermal reduction system has an application to the production of pure silicon metal for terrestrial manufacturing of photovoltaics and electronics components.  The integrated COSRS/RWGS/Carbothermal reduction system also has future applications to the production of large quantities of oxygen, iron metal, and silicon metal from random lunar and Martian regolith for lunar and Martian bases, and could be used in the same way to allow useful metal production from very low grade ores on Earth.  Furthermore, the closed COSRS/RWGS system would enable the terrestrial production of iron and other metals without generating carbon dioxide greenhouse gas."

The IMISPPS combines the RWGS and Sabatier reactions in a single reactor to produce a useful high-specific impulse fuel (methane plus carbon monoxide) and water, which is condensed and electrolyzed to produce oxygen and hydrogen.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the Sabatier/RWGS reactor to react with Martian CO2 to produce more fuel, while the oxygen is cryogenically stored to provide oxidizer.  Some of the carbon monoxide is removed by cryogenic separation to increase propellant specific impulse. Carbon dioxide acquisition to feed the fuel reactor is accomplished using a lightweight freezer.  Use of the IMISPPS has the advantage of producing all the oxygen needed to burn the methane with only in a single catalytic reactor required.  In the proposed work, we will build a brassboard core of the IMSIPPS and demonstrate its performance and reliability.","IMISPPS provides a technology for producing methane/oxygen rocket propellant on Mars with the correct oxidizer to fuel ratio in a single reactor using the CO2 atmosphere of Mars as the primary raw material.  The leverage of the hydrogen imported from Earth would be at least 20, greatly reducing the cost and difficulty of sample return and human missions to Mars.  Operation of a single reactor would reduce the system weight and complexity compared to systems based on the Sabatier process and an oxygen production process.  Further processing of the methane and CO to benzene would increase the leverage to 53.","On Earth, the IMISPPS has applications in the area of carbon dioxide sequestration and processing to reduce the greenhouse effect.  For example, cement kilns emit CO2 in high concentrations amenable to separation and processing.  In conjunction with a renewable or nuclear power supply that generates hydrogen, the IMISPPS could be used to combine the hydrogen and CO2 to convert the hydrogen into a readily transportable form (methane) that easily fits into the existing energy infrastructure.  The carbon monoxide could be combined with hydrogen using the Fischer-Tropsch process to produce valuable hydrocarbon products, such as alcohols, olefins and waxes."

The system is capable of measuring neutron fluxes in the whole reactor's operation range, from a neutron flux of 10E0 n/cm2/sec up to a flux of more than 10E10 n/cm2/sec. In this way, a single instrument chain can be used instead of having different instrumentation for each of the operation ranges of the reactor (start-up, ramping-up, and nominal power) This is a clear advantage for space applications where mass, size, and power consumption constraints are of premium importance.

While a number of cryogenic refrigeration systems may be considered for such applications, none offers the same potential for low vibration, high reliability, and high efficiency as the pulse tube. The continuous-flow cooling loops are made possible by the presence of rectifying interfaces that convert the oscillating flow of the pulse-tube cryocooler into a steady flow of cold refrigerant gas that can readily be distributed throughout the volume of the dewar or over the surface of a shield, without need for a separate circulating pump.","The proposed dewar is well suited to many future NASA missions involving the transportation or in-situ liquefaction of cryogens.

Due to the high switching frequency capabilities of the SiC power switches, filter and magnetics components will also be reduced in size, thus further miniaturizing the MCPM building blocks.

One area where radiation shielding may be incorporated is in thermal insulation materials.  The design of habitation structures and exploration vehicles will require extensive thermal protection.  Combining the roles of radiation shielding and thermal insulation may be possible by using millimeter sized spheres in place of multi-layer insulation (MLI).  By manufacturing the spheres from materials known to provide radiation shielding, the complexity of a vehicle or habitation structure can be reduced.  An additional benefit of using spheres as insulation is the ability to operate in a weak vacuum such as the Mars atmosphere.  Thus, a sphere insulation design could also be used in the ultra-low pressure gas environment of Mars.  This project will involve the research and evaluation of materials most suitable for radiation shielding and thermal performance evaluation testing of multiple sample sizes in both vacuum and low pressure gas environments.","The development of this innovation is intended for use in the design of lunar habitation structures.  However, the successful development of this technology may lead to uses in other exploration systems developed within NASA.

The electric resistance of the coating can be easily adjusted by changing the composition and concentration of the inorganic conducting particles for a resistance required for antistatic applications (106-1010 ohm/sq). This new material system would overcome traditional drawbacks, such as the light scattering due to the aggregation of the inorganic particles, providing the high transparency and desired conductivity for many applications. Elimination of light scattering is achieved by dispersing transparent conducting particles into an optically matched polymer matrix. Moreover, the transparent and conducting particles are designed to chemically bond to the engineered polymer composite for excellent stability and reliability that are required in space environment applications. The process of applying this type of transparent antistatic film is as simple as applying paint, which would allow the application of these coatings to flexible and rigid materials suggesting potential even in very cost-sensitive applications.","Static build-up is particularly problematic in space vacuum environments.

The waste to energy converter will be specifically designed and engineered to efficiently convert onsite habitat crew waste into electricity and heat. The tight thermal integration of an SOFC to the gasifier will enable the operation of a sub-stoichiometric air gasifier at an elevated temperature (1000oC). At this temperature, the high levels of moisture inherent to habitat crew waste will function as an essential carbon gasifying medium, reducing the equivalence ratio at which the gasifier can operate with complete carbon conversion. By utilizing the moisture content of the food waste and the high temperature heat from the SOFC, the gasifier will operate with the addition of little or no air, generating producer gas that has not been heavily diluted with nitrogen.

DTI has demonstrated a technology that uses a rapidly scanned miniature LCD to produce images possessing much more resolution than the LCD itself.  It accomplishes this by illuminating different subregions of each pixel during each scan, producing an image made up of the subregions instead of the pixels themselves.  At present, custom made microdisplays with lens arrays embedded in the front glass are needed to focus light into the tiny pixel subregions.  This Phase I program will assess the feasibility of a novel type of lens array that can be mounted outside the microdisplay glass and still focus light into the tiny pixel subregions.  Such an element could be added to existing microdisplays after the microdisplays were manufactured, thus eliminating the need for custom microdisplays and allowing several off the shelf models to employ DTI's ultra high resolution technique at much lower cost.  Products made with these displays hold the promise of new benchmarks in image fidelity and immersion in VR and tele-operated systems.","Displays resulting from this technology, capable of producing near vision limited resolution across a very wide field of view, could be combined with today's multi thousand line resolution cameras to produce, for the fist time, true visual immersion and resulting increases in speed and efficiency for the operators of remotely controlled robots and vehicles.  Such displays could also accept input from computers to create extremely immersive virtual environments.  These capabilities would be extremely useful in many inspection, construction, exploration, and simulation/training activities performed by NASA, both in space and on planetary surfaces","The availability of head mounted displays with resolutions and fields of view that match that of emerging multi thousand line cameras would be a boon to almost any remote control robotic or vehicle driving application.  Combined with robotic technology spinoffs from programs like Robonaut, these displays could extend the benefits of high fidelity tele-operated systems to emergency departments, construction companies, mining operations, and warehousing.  Such displays would also find broad application in simulation and training activities.  Ultra high resolution head mounted displays would make simulation more practical for many commercial applications,. such as private aviation, medicine, driving schools, and entertainment."

The ""smart skin"" solution IFOS proposes is 2-D sensor based on the integration of high-sensitivity embedded Fiber Bragg grating (FBG), a custom engineered composite material - Nano Particle Material (NPM) ? and data interpretation and on-board decision-making.

The proposed approach for this effort is to use large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, ""stick on"" piezoelectric sensory nodes that are synchronized within a radio frequency network.  Each node will continuously monitor an accelerometer or acoustic emission sensor element for an impact event, such as the foam impact that caused the Columbia tragedy or an MMOD impact.  When a programmable threshold is exceeded, a low-latency signal acquisition circuit will capture the event as a digital waveform for post-processing and impact characterization.  In addition, autonomous collaboration and synchronization between nodes of the network will provide for accurate location determination through amplitude and time-of-arrival analysis.  The innovative signal conditioning circuit design is capable of operation in the micro-watt range on average while constantly maintaining the capability to process and acquire very high-frequency acoustic signals.  Such performance can provide operating lifetimes of 20+ years on a single AA battery, or unlimited operation from scavenged power sources such as solar or thermal gradients.","This system could benefit many current and future NASA space flight and exploration programs, including the Shuttle, ISS, and Project Constellation programs, or a Moon or Mars habitat, where the risk of MMOD impacts causing critical damage to vehicles or life support systems exists.

This fuel maintains a hydrodynamically rough surface to radically enhance convective heat transfer rate, and hence the fuel burn rate.  This is achieved by incorporating a particulate fuel material dispersed within a continuum phase polymer matrix.  The dispersed fuel material is chosen to transition from solid to gas much more readily than the polymer matrix, and with a particle size scale sufficiently large that the resulting surface voids provide a hydrodynamically rough surface.  Combustion of this fuel system thus creates local pockets in the polymer surface, where the particulate fuel is exposed, and maintains the rough surface structure as the dispersed particles are continually exposed.  Secondary effects include decreased phase change enthalpy of the mixture, relative to a conventional polymer fuel, and the potential for increased specific impulse by inclusion of high energy compounds as the dispersed phase.  This high burn rate fuel will enable increased propellant mass fraction in hybrid rockets, by decreasing the number of ports required to achieve the desired net fuel combustion rate.  It also simplifies the technology and retains the relatively high strength and good storage stability of polymeric fuels.","Specific NASA applications include next generation launch vehicles for low cost access to space, and safe propulsion systems for use with manned missions.","Commercial ventures are currently developing and utilizing hybrid propulsion for low cost launch applications, and for sub-orbital manned flights.

Many vibration signature analysis techniques use a key phasor signal to identify and detect critical vibration characteristics and fault signatures.  However, in many operational environments (e.g., SSME HPOTP), the tachometer measurement is not available usually due to its intrusive installation requirement or safety consideration.  For this situation, many powerful diagnostic analyses cannot be performed.  With our system, we over come this problem by utilizing a novel signal analysis technique called Pseudo Key Phasor (PKP) to reconstruct an equivalent 1/Rev PKP signal directly from a non-intrusive vibration measurement.  The resulting PKP signal enables the use of effective signature analysis to enhance diagnostic capabilities.  The applicable innovation is attributed to to effectively achieve non-intrusive health monitoring and diagnosis without intrusive tachometer installation.

The original propellant developed under Air Force SBIR contracts became know as ASPEN.  The start/stop capabilities were first demonstrated in end burning configurations that operated by feeding the propellant against stationary electrodes.  Continuing research by ET Materials led to a new family of ECESP propellants prepared as solution solid propellants.  These propellants provided higher performance than the ASPEN, but are more electrically conductive.  This feature was not as desirable as first thought because the electrode gap has to be much narrower to cause the propellant to ignite at the surface, which makes it more difficult to scale for larger motors.  The high conductance of the propellant makes it ideal for a MEMS application as the propellant can be cast in thin layers.  Since the propellant will only sustain combustion when electrical power is supplied stacked layers of the propellant could be ignited separately without causing ignition of neighboring layer.  This provides more versatility than similar MEMS designs utilizing conventional solid propellants.

Whereas the thrust and power densities of Hall and Ion thrusters are limited by space charge effects, MPD thrusters can process very high power levels while providing high specific impulse thrust.  MPD thrusters, however, have traditionally been plagued by poor thrust efficiencies.  These inefficiencies are due primarily to power lost into the anode caused by the Hall effect.

APTR propulsion is provided by utilizing a nuclear thermal reactor or solar thermal engine to heat a space storable propellant, preferably consisting of a volatile indigenous to the destination world, to form a high thrust rocket exhaust.  Candidate propellants whose performance, materials compatibility, and ease of acquisition make them worthy of examination for APTR propulsion of exploration vehicles include carbon dioxide, water, methane, and methanol.  An APTR utilizing indigenous CO2 propellant potentially offers high payoff to a robotic or manned Mars mission, both by sharply reducing the initial mission mass required in low Earth orbit, and by providing Mars exploration with unlimited mobility and global access.  Additionally, an APTR could give nearly unlimited mobility to asteroid or outer solar system probes, while one using methane or nitrogen propellant could enable a Titan sample return mission.  The APTR can also be used as the propulsion system for a high performance space storable orbit transfer system moving payloads from LEO to GEO or other orbits of commercial interest.  In this case, leading candidate propellants include methane, ammonia, and methanol.","APTRs have important commercial applications for satellites.  A reusable orbit transfer vehicle using a space storable APTR system with comparable performance to the 450 s available from the cryogenic H2/O2 Centaur would represent a major cost saving to commercial satellite delivery.  Small APTR engines powered by electrical heaters could be used for stationkeeping and RCS propulsion for satellites.  APTR propellants are much cheaper, safer, and easier to integrate than toxic hydrazine, and could offer twice hydrazine's specific impulse.  For a given RCS propellant allocation, this could double a satellite's useful life, resulting in a major saving to the satellite industry.","The commercial potential of APTR technology goes way beyond the APTR thruster market itself. The use of water or CO2 as propellant in a high temperature thermal rocket requires the development of high temperature oxidation-resistant coatings. The development of such ultra-high temperature protective coatings for APTRs would also create a technology that could play a vital role in the development of numerous types of high performance chemical rockets, and more than that, find abundant use in a wide range of high-temperature oxidizing-environment industrial applications on Earth as well.

The great distances, the intense radiation levels, and the physiological response to zero-gravity all supported the concept of using a nuclear rocket to decrease mission time.  These same needs have been recognized in later studies, especially in the Space Exploration Initiative in 1989.  One of the key questions that has arisen in later studies, however, is the need to utilize a nuclear fuel form that does not emit fission products into the exhaust stream.  Unlike the Rover/NERVA programs in the 1960s, the rocket exhaust in a current day nuclear rocket should contain no radioactivity. We will investigate a series of coated fuel forms that will inhibit fission products and actinides from diffusing out into the surrounding coolant.

Sierra Lobo, Inc. has found that through previous research involving conventional manufacturing techniques, two particular components common to all pulse tube cryocoolers contribute to approximately 50% of the cost.  In view of the February 24, 2004, Executive Order encouraging innovation in manufacturing related research and development via the SBIR program, the primary objective of Phase I of this research is to study and develop improvements to the existing pulse tube manufacturing process.

An even greater benefit is expected for the commercial application of pulse tube cryocoolers in facilitating the advancement of distributed high-temperature superconducting power systems.","The primary potential NASA application for large-scale pulse tube technology is the conditioning of propellants at rocket engine test facilities.  The engines tested at these facilities are typically designed for normal boiling-point temperature propellants.  At some test facilities however, propellants are temporarily stored at very high pressures.  This can cause the temperature of the propellants provided to the engine at the test stands to be higher than the temperature of the propellants provided to the engine during actual launch operations.  Minimizing or eliminating this temperature difference establishes a greater degree of confidence in the engine test results.","A key opportunity for large scale pulse tube cryocooler technology is use with high temperature superconductivity (HTS) devices such as motors, generators, transformers, and cables.  Such widely-distributed systems will require active cryogenic systems that are more efficient, reliable, and have lower capital costs than current off-the-self cryogenic systems.

The flexible routing provided by such a network layer would allow signal streams to be dynamically routed (and re-routed) between computational elements. This would allow software radio designers to build flexible, fault tolerant signal processing chains for many applications and hardware implementations. This is innovative because conventional IP implementations cannot meet the performance requirements (throughput, jitter, latency) of software radio data streams. The innovation of this research stems from the unique combination of software radio development requirements, advances in network and transport layer designs to support high-speed switching fabrics, and the inherent capabilities provided by IP.","The flexible routing provided by such a network layer enables new functionality in software radios, especially with regard to fault tolerance. The most efficient designs directly link components using high-speed buffers or buses. These designs do not provide the ability to dynamically reconfigure signal processing functions in response to hard failures or new external communications requirements. On the other hand, general-purpose network and transport layers do not meet the high speed I/O requirements of signal processing systems. This unique approach, if successful, would eventually provide an IP-based architecture that allows software radio designers to build reconfigurable signal processing chains.","The Phase I effort, if successful, will demonstrate the feasibility of combining high-speed IP streams with switching fabric to support software radio applications. This would give software radio designers the ability to build flexible, fault tolerant signal processing chains for many applications and hardware implementations. Currently, such solutions must be engineered on a system-by-system basis, which is extremely labor and cost intensive. In general, this work could increase the degree to which software radio designs can be reused, development cycles can be shortened, and costs can be reduced."

Space Micro has developed innovations for mitigating SEU and SEFI errors, enabling the use of very high-speed commercial DSPs with improved SEU tolerances (>1E-4 unrecoverable errors/day).  Time-Triple Modular Redundancy (TTMR) is a method of applying traditional triple modular redundancy on a single processor, exploiting the VLIW class of parallel processors.  SEFI is solved by a Hardened Core circuit, external to the microprocessor, which monitors the ""health"" of the processor, and when SEFI occurs, forces the processor to return to performance through a series of escalating events (interrupts, reset, etc).In Phase I we apply these technologies to COTS DSPs and also will extend the TTMR and Hardened Core architecture to reconfigurable FPGA arrays, with dramatically improved SEU/SEFI rates for Xilinx FPGAs.In Phase II we will provide SEU & SEFI hardened DSP plus FPGA product, with performance of 8,000 MIPS fixed point and 1.8 GFLOPS floating point (derated approximately 50% for improved SEU performance) while consuming less than 2 watts power, combined with an array of Xilinx reconfigurable FPGAs, providing approximately 7500 MFLOPS per FPGA.","Virtually all NASA space programs have a demand for rad hard or tolerant computers and processors.

The main advantages of the proposed approach is that it allows the spacecraft to utilize failed control components with degraded performance to the maximum extent, and to conduct health status test with minimum or no impact on the mission, all in an autonomous manner.  The  proposed approach  is innovative because traditional approaches typically abandon the failed component completely after the first sign of malfunctioning. Putting all the burden on the remaining components wear them down faster and shorten their useful life. Through the integration of accurate health monitoring  and control reconfiguration algorithms in a hierarchical architecture, the proposed approach adjust  the command signal to the failed component  according to its degree of degradation, with the shortfall distributed among the remaining undamaged control components.  This results in balanced utilization of all the available resources at all time, and increase the mission life of the spacecraft. During Phase II,  the developed algorithms will be integrated into an Autonomous Spacecraft REconfigurable Control System (ASRECS) prototype for NASA testing and evaluation.","The health monitoring and  control reconfiguration algorithms developed in this Phase I effort for spacecraft  control will be beneficial to a wide class space missions. Other control applications subject to model uncertainties due to component failures or system variations can also benefit from the proposed technology.  Current and future NASA space missions that can benefit from the proposed technology include Triana, MAXIM, and Kepler.  The capability to continue the mission under failure, as well as the cost saving and increased reliability of attitude determination and control system components, will be very attractive from the mission level perspective.","The control reconfiguration design for aircraft and UAV has been developed based on the idea of analytic redundancy control concept by leveraging off the remaining control surfaces to produce equivalent force and torque in the direction of the lost ones. However, control methodology that allows the aircraft to ``limp'' home under the underactuated control situation has not been closely addressed.  The autonomous underactuated control concept developed herein can potentially be applied to aircraft flight control systems as the backup mode that would significantly increase its safety and reliability beyond its current level."

Currently these engineers are limited to the use of big simulators such as the Space Station Training Facility (SSTF) for the ISS, which is costly to run and requires a scheduling of the facility a long time in advance. The targeted tool would fill the gap between the very limited validation done at their desktop (mainly peer review of the procedure) and the simulator run (where the procedures are tested in the very expensive training environment).This project has a number of innovative aspects, which will make the work of procedure developers easier and more consistent. Benefits realized from using a desktop based procedure validation toolset include the increase in safety, reduction of training costs, and improvement in procedure delivery time through early detection and resolution of errors.","Use of procedures is pervasive to all NASA organizations, and programs, whether they support on-orbit or ground-based operations, for crew use or as automated procedures, for payloads, sub-systems or for entire spacecrafts. In the coming years, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and the CEV will continue to depend heavily on complex procedures. Providing these programs with an advanced procedure V&V toolset on the desktop will provide a significant support for shortening the procedure development life cycle. A desktop validation tool has the potential to significantly reduce the number of SSTF runs and the number of procedure defects found during SSTF sessions.","The envisioned toolset can be applied to any complex system requiring an operational procedure as it also needs ways to be validated. Desktop based tool support for such system is currently missing. A tool that can be customized to different systems will be useful within DoD organizations using heavy equipment operating procedures, such as airplanes, tanks, transport equipment, or logistics support equipment. In the commercial arena, operational procedures are also being used in a broad range of areas, such as airplane checklist, power plant, refineries, and chemical plants operations.

This system will dynamically adapt a display to the optimal modality based upon an operator's workload.  As cockpits become more complicated, there is more data to be monitored by pilots in the normal operation of an aircraft.  Some of this burden has been lightened with automated systems, but the operator still has to be aware of which automated systems are operating at any given time, and their current mode.  Signals are presented to the pilots when these systems start, end, or are in effect, but these signals are often lost in the overwhelming amount of data the operators must attend.  A system that could present signals with the highest probability of being noticed by operators would help achieve the goal of ensuring that the right information is delivered at the optimal time and modality so that operators can act on the information.  Assuring that pilots are aware of the various states of the aircraft systems would lead, in turn, to greater situation awareness and safety.","We believe that a tool that can dynamically adapt to the current state of a cockpit system will help to improve safety through increased situation awareness (SA).

The approach will provide a valuable new systems analysis capability to complement current NASA approaches, and will address many of the goals of the X8.01 Technology-Systems Analysis and Infrastructure Modeling research topic.  In particular it will be useful for impact studies, risk/cost/benefit analyses, risk/uncertainty analyses, model integration, and Model-Based Design/Model-Based Engineering.","Performance and risk analyses of complex, multi-phase missions.Reliability analyses of systems with redundant and/or repairable components.Optimization analyses of system configurations with respect to cost and reliability.Sensitivity analyses to identify optimal areas for uncertainty reduction (i.e. testing or additional analyses) or performance enhancement.",The same applications are relevant for the following organizations:- U.S. Commercial aerospace businesses.- U.S. Department of Defense and DOD contractors- International organizations with similar roles.- Manufacturers of complex equipment systems for use in non-aerospace fields.

Every subsystem design decision has far reaching consequences that must be evaluated in a multidisciplinary fashion in order to assess the impact on the weight and the performance of the entire vehicle.  The disciplines which must be accounted and integrated during the design are: trajectory optimization, guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) technology, aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics, thermal-structural analysis, and thermal protection system (TPS) development.  Previous efforts in developing a collaborative or a multidisciplinary optimization process never considered how uncertainty in the atmospheric conditions, in the entry parameters of the vehicle, in the condition of the vehicle during entry, and in the performance of the TPS will influence the design and provide a risk assessment for a mission.  The proposed project will fill this void by developing a tool for multidisciplinary optimization under uncertainty (MDO-U) for entry vehicle design.  The proposed development will consider how uncertainties influence the modeling results of each discipline, and how uncertainties influence the interaction between disciplines and the optimal solution.  Finally, the new MDO-U design tool will compute the safety level for the optimum design.","Uncertainties due to manufacturing tolerances, material variability, the operating environment, and the state of the operating structure, are encountered in aircraft structures, launch vehicles, entry vehicles, and propulsion systems.  The ability to account for such uncertainties in all these different areas, during the design stage will be valuable.  Therefore, the MDO-U system will be useful to all NASA groups interested in designing space vehicles or aircraft.","Uncertainties due to manufacturing tolerances, material variability, the operating environment, and the state of the operating structure, are encountered in the automotive, the shipbuilding, the heavy construction equipment, and the defense industries.  The MDO-U system will allow engineers to account for uncertainties during the design of their products.  Thus, there is a great market potential for the outcome of this SBIR."

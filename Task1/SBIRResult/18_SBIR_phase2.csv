All three unsteady aerodynamic sub-systems can be obtained by applying the extended complex variable differentiation (CVD) technique to the complex version of FUN3D, referred to as FUN3D-CVD, to generate the numerically exact linearized unsteady aerodynamic forces. As a wrapper around the steady Navier-Stokes (N-S) solver of FUN3D for trim analysis with static aeroelastic effects as well as a wrapper around the complex unsteady N-S solver of FUN3D-CVD for generating the three unsteady aerodynamic sub-systems, OVERFUN can establish a very accurate time-domain plant model or frequency-domain aeroelastic equation of motion that can capture all essential flow physics on a statically deformed aeroelastic model. To showcase that the OVERFUN generated plant model can be directly adopted by the modern control law design schemes for control system design, a classical and a robust flutter suppression and gust load alleviation control systems will be generated for the Benchmark Active Controls Technology wing with trailing edge flap as input as well as with the upper spoiler as input. A twin-engine transport flutter model (TETFM) that was tested by the Boeing engineers in the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) will be selected as the test case to demonstrate the accuracy of the OVERFUN predicted aeroelastic solution for complex configuration by the validation with the TDT measured flutter boundary of the TETFM. The outcome of the Phase II effort will be a production-ready OVERFUN software system for commercialization in Phase III.","The proposed effort is highly relevant to on-going and future NASA fixed wing projects, which involve innovative design concepts such as the Truss-Braced Wing, Blended Wing Body, and Supersonic Business Jet. The proposed work will offer a computational tool to the NASA designers for early exploration of design concepts that exploit the trade-off between the passive and active approaches for mitigating the potential aeroelastic problems associated with those configurations.","The proposed discrete time state-space plant model generation can be applied to various flight vehicles including blended wing-bodies, joined wings, sub/supersonic transports, morphing aircraft, and similar revolutionary concepts being pursued. The proposed research will be needed for designing the next generation of civil and military aircraft to meet the stringent future performance goals."

In Phase 1, the framework for both equation-based and data-driven PROMs was developed and feasibility to introduce “engineering intelligence” to AE/ASE ROMs was successfully established. Carefully selected ROMs and intelligence algorithms were developed to accomplish autonomous PROM construction. It was verified that ROMs built under the guidance of intelligent algorithms enable unprecedented state consistence and computational performance. For the first time, data-driven ROMs with state consistence were developed in a broad flight envelope. Equation-based ASE PROMs were developed, and demonstrated >12X reduction in model size for control synthesis. In Phase 2, software will be further refined for enhanced performance and functionality. Genetic Algorithm (GA)-guided ROM algorithms will be improved in terms of search space exploration, meta-optimization, and state consistence. Adaptive sampling will be extended to multi-dimensional flight parameter space. Methods to integrate PROMs from separate domains, and sensors and controllers will be optimized to meet various needs in NASA. A modular intelligent environment will be integrated into NASA workflow for technology transition. The software will be extensively validated and demonstrated for automated ROM development, certification, and control design using flexible vehicles of NASA interest.","The developed technology will enable NASA to (1) determine critical flight conditions and guide CFD/ASE computation and flight testing; (2) enable real-time ASE simulation and flight control synthesis, and (3) develop advanced aerostructural control strategies.

Named the “Installed Ducted-Fan Noise Model” (IDFNM) and branching from Techsburg/AVEC’s recognized collaborative work in noise modeling for pusher propellers for defense and commercial customers, this tool will offer early-stage design support for installed ducted fan-rotor propulsion systems by capturing the aerodynamic unsteady loading and noise sources resulting from inflow distortion and unsteadiness – sources of significant importance for the emerging highly-integrated propulsion-airframe concepts such as boundary layer ingesting fans.  Phase I work positioned the team to use Ampaire’s first-generation, aero-efficient TailWind electric aircraft as a demonstrator for novel acoustic prediction tools.  Building on the Phase I upgrades to the existing NASA codebase V072, Phase II work will see targeted development of a reduced-order prediction tool for turbulence ingestion noise (TIN), a current technical gap in NASA/industry capability.  Leveraging extensive background in the field of turbulence ingestion from academic partners Drs. William Devenport and Nathan Alexander, this tool will derive inflow turbulence statistics by appropriate scaling of correlation functions as measured on four canonical geometries.  Combined with accepted blade response models and propagation via Green’s function to the far-field, the result will be a first-of-its-kind prediction tool accessible at low computational cost.  Milestones throughout the work will see the acoustic prediction tool validated in the state-of-the-art anechoic wind tunnel at Virginia Tech.   The deliverable of this Phase II work is the integrated low-order noise prediction software ""Installed Ducted-Fan Noise Model” which ultimately will be commercialized.","This SBIR targets a technical gap in the reduced-order acoustic prediction toolset of NASA/industry.

As such, there is a need for innovative technologies and methods for noise prediction to enable acoustic optimization of multi-stream, 3D nozzles to meet the noise goals for NASA’s N+2/N+3 aircraft. As part of the SBIR program, Spectral Energies in collaboration with University of California at Irvine (the team) proposed to develop a design tool for nozzles that include acoustics. During the course of the SBIR Phase I, the team has demonstrated a viable method for acoustic optimization of nozzles relevant to N+2/N+3 aircraft using RANS based methods. This method was demonstrated to optimize the thickness of the third-stream for reduced noise production. These results were verified experimentally and computationally. During Phase II, the team will continue to improve the optimization methodology by incorporating more first principle physics into the noise model and including more variables that can be used to optimize the nozzle for acoustics, integration/feasibility, and performance. The team anticipates that the design tool developed under this program will be at TRL 6.",The development of this design tool will be critical to the success of NASA’s ARMD focus area of “innovation in commercial supersonic aircraft” and help meet the goals of N+2 and N+3 aircraft. We believe that this technology is directly relevant to NASA’s Advanced Air Vehicle Program (AAVP). Incorporating our proposed design methodology into NASA’s toolbelt will allow for the development of advanced nozzles relevant to supersonic commercial aircraft that can meet the noise requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).,Aircraft noise is also an issue for DoD aircraft. The Office of Naval Research has funded multiple projects under its Jet Noise Reduction (JNR) program to develop methodologies for noise reduction. Our proposed tool would be useful for DoD and aerospace industry to develop quieter nozzles for future military and commercial aerospace vehicles.

Although eddy-resolving  CFD methods for computing high-speed jet noise are available, such methods are computationally expensive and are currently deemed impractical for use in a design optimization loop. On the other hand, the prediction of turbulence generated noise using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations provides a less accurate but more cost-effective approach for practical design problems, wherein the turbulence length and time scales needed to model the local noise source terms can be extracted from the RANS turbulence model solution, as performed by the NASA JeNo code. The objective of this project is to develop a tightly coupled practical RANS-based jet-noise aeroacoustic analysis and design optimization capability which can be leveraged by government and industrial customers to better understand and design efficient propulsion systems that meet well defined and accepted noise metrics. The approach consists of developing an exact discrete adjoint method for a tightly coupled RANS-acoustic prediction method in order to provide sensitivities for gradient-based aerodynamically constrained acoustic optimizations. This capability will be demonstrated on realistic nozzle configurations including single and dual stream chevron nozzles, and marketed to government and industrial customers in the aerospace industry.","The proposed technique will provide a novel tool for enabling the design of supersonic nozzles optimized for reduced far-field noise signatures. This is an important application area for NASA ARMD, since the acceptance of future commercial supersonic aircraft depends heavily on reduced environmental impact. The optimization approach will be developed in a modular fashion and will be easily transferable to NASA in-house RANS codes which incorporate an adjoint capability such as FUN3D.","The jet noise optimization capability will be incorporated into the simulation and design tools developed by Scientific-Simulations  and will be marketed to existing and new customers.

Given a water-tight surface triangulation of arbitrary complexity and a set of generating points (effectively cell centers), Stitch can efficiently compute the 3D clipped Voronoi diagram and output a mesh. This approach was demonstrated to be fast and scalable, as well as robust to complex geometry: an 11.4B cell mesh of the NASA HL-CRM was generated in 22 minutes on 43200 cores. Because the generation of the Voronoi mesh is already accomplished, the technical objectives of this proposal are focused on investigating and optimizing the details of how the generating points are spatially distributed. The quality of Stitch's meshes relative to decisions regarding the point cloud specification have yet to be fully characterized. Obviously the point cloud, essentially the spatial discretization of the domain, will  have a significant impact on solution accuracy. We will asses sensitivity with respect to several aspects of the spatial arrangement of the point cloud. Within the Voronoi-paradigm uniform isotropic cells, which can impart higher-moment conservation properties appropriate for turbulence, can be achieved by arranging the generating sites  with a structured lattice. The different unit cell topologies based on choice of lattice will be investigated. Additionally understanding these lattices at resolution transitions is of interest. Another focus is further development of anisotropic body-conformal mesh generation. Using only isotropic cells can introduce large cell counts in regions which could leverage anisotropic arrangement and retain fidelity for both wall-resolved and wall-modeled simulations. A final focus of this work will be to identify potential solvers that can benefit from and utilize the Voronoi meshing technology. This will characterize potential customers and the market for Stitch as a stand-alone product.","As a stand-alone product Stitch will provide high-quality finite volume meshes, which would benefit any solver utilizing polyhedral elements. One example could be NASA's LAVA flow solver. Stitch's ability to quickly and scalably generate uniform and isotropic cells as well as locally anisotropic topology make it an ideal candidate for scale-resolving simulation tools. CharLES, Cascade's low-dissipation multi-physics LES solver, currently leverages these meshes for accurate multi-physics and multi-scale simulations, which could benefit also NASA.","Consumers utilizing CharLES (e.g., gas-turbine sector of General Electric, aero-thermodynamics research at Honda, and fuel-injection research at Bosch) would benefit from the mesh efficiencies gained through this work. Furthermore, CharLES has been successfully applied to analyze problems of flow separation and control, emissions, aero-acoustics, fan noise, and aerodynamic performance."

The impetus for this work comes from advances in electronics and controls, and increases in electric motor power densities.  As these aircraft are integrated into the transportation system, they will encounter icing conditions that may challenge the design performance of these vehicles.  This effort will map a patented algorithmic icing detection scheme, previously developed for use on the Navy’s V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, to the propeller/rotor systems for this category of air vehicle, with extensions for using measurements on the electric motor itself to infer both icing level and icing growth during flight operations.  By focusing the detection filter to the lift/propulsion subsystem, the detection algorithm may be hosted directly within the motor control processor electronics, thus allowing for distributed icing sensing concomitant with such vehicle’s distributed propulsion configurations.  As these VTOL vehicles are dominated by lifting propeller/rotors, the determination of the level of icing on this important component for these aircraft will enhance safety and may be used for icing mitigation and/or vehicle flight guidance.  The proposed work plan includes an icing tunnel test demonstration of the technology on a representative lift/propulsion subsystem and culminates with flight testing of a UAS platform in a natural icing environment.","Support NASA’s strategic objectives of increasing safety, promoting growth in operations, particularly for low-carbon propulsion vehicles (ARMD’s Thrust 1 and 4). Enhance safety via improved icing detection on electric powered air vehicles. Extend icing accretion analysis toolchains for simulation of flight vehicles with distributed and disparate propulsion and lift systems.  Increase capability for self-aware vehicles with enhanced autonomy for mitigating off-nominal flight condition effects.","Provide in-flight icing monitoring on key lift/propulsion systems for personal/on-demand aircraft, as well as autonomous UAV systems.

One aspect of this problem is making seals that can function through a very large temperature range, perhaps up to 1000 °C or higher. Metallic springs essentially lose their ability to function at 600 °C or below. Silicon nitride compression springs have previously been evaluated by NASA and have been found to be capable of functioning throughout that temperature range, but lack the strength required for most applications. They undergo very limited deformation before failure. TDA will improve the feedstocks and modify the existing process for manufacturing ceramic springs. Through improvements to the grain structure, the resulting springs will overcome their previous limitations.","Ceramic compression springs are being developed so that scramjet engines’ high temperature seals can be preloaded. However, the high temperature – capable springs could also solve problems in the control surface and/or leading edge thermal protection system. These needs are particularly acute for re-usable hypersonic transports, including the descendants for the National Aerospace Plane. High-temperature springs with sufficient strength could also potentially be used to create a seal between the heat and the back shell of (re-)entry vehicles.","Many uses exist outside of NASA, including certain (single-use) air-breathing hypersonic weapon systems; the chemical resistance and high temperature stability of ceramic springs will allow new sealing options in many high-temperature industrial processes. Ceramic springs allowing seals between smaller, simpler pieces of tooling can cut costs by obviating the need for larger, more complex tooling."

Some of these changes include electrode expansion, electrode ruffling, dendrite formation, internal gas formation, and internal density changes. A key characteristic of these changes is that most of them occur prior to any external measurable parameter variation, such as in terminal voltage, surface temperature, or mechanical surface strain. Therefore, detecting internal cell structural and mechanical changes early and with adequate resolution has several benefits, including the prevention of catastrophic accidents sufficiently ahead of time, and the gathering of additional information that can be used to more accurately assess the health and life of cells during operation. We propose a novel approach that simultaneously detects and corrects these internal cell changes early and using hardware that can be permanently installed externally on the surface of a lithium-ion cell. Our approach enhances the safety and prognostics associated with lithium-ion batteries, and its reconstruction capability has the added benefit of rejuvenating a cell to extend its life. Finally, the proposed solution will be implemented on small, low cost, and low power hardware to ensure its seamless integration to existing commercial cells and systems.","It is estimated that the proposed system can have a substantial impact in the following NASA projects: Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) project, Flight Demonstrations and Capabilities (FDC) project, Transformation Tools and Technologies (TTT) project,  as well as the NASA X-57 prototype and other efforts where electric and/or hybrid-electric propulsion systems are being engineered at NASA.","Battery technologies are critical for renewable energy systems.

They provide step-by-step instructions for system check-out, experimental set-up, test plans, and responding to off-nominal situations. They also provide an electronic record of all test activities. As NASA  moves away from traditional paper procedures to more flexible electronic procedures, there is an opportunity for a more flexible and efficient electronic procedure review, approval, verification, and publishing process. The existing process, both at NASA and in commercial companies, is based on routing Microsoft Word documents with ""track changes"" turned on and obtaining physical signatures on cover pages. This process does not take advantage of new developments in on-line collaboration (e.g., systems like Google Docs) nor developments in automated verification of structured documents. The traditional procedure change management process also does not integrate with electronic procedure platforms creating silos of information.

The autopilot system will be able to learn from flight experience and develop intuition to adapt to a high level of uncertainties. To provide a high degree of assurance and make the learning autopilot system safe and certifiable, a conventional autopilot system is integrated based on a run-time assurance architecture.

Provable guarantees of the monitor and the controllers is provided using formal analysis. The hybrid flight control system has adaptability and intelligence of skilled pilots and is capable of performing complex analysis and decision making in real-time. An artificial neural network model is built and trained to mimic the performance of classical robust optimal controllers, extending robustness, adaptability and curiosity of artificial neural network controllers and integrating a Real-Time Assurance system.

Xwing’s proposed tool (Tracer) manages software requirements and traceability at all levels; from the system-level objectives and use cases to the software requirements, corresponding code and the test cases. Tracer enables stakeholders and engineers to identify bidirectional impacts of changes to requirements or system code. Xwing is currently developing capabilities for detect-and-avoid (DAA) for autonomous aircraft, and deriving and generating requirements based on DO-365. Those requirements were used as a Phase I test case for Tracer. The use case scope focused on tracking for detection of threats. The use case served to collect valuable usability experience and information, gather feedback and improve Tracer functionality. The work in Phase I was performed along two main workstreams: 1) development of the requirements tracing tool, and 2) refinement through implementation of a DAA use case. Phase II will continue these workstreams, and add a third : development of a framework for certification of AI-based systems. These certification frameworks will be applied to vision-based DAA, expanding on conventional deterministic DAA previously explored. The current certification process for avionics is not adapted to complex algorithms and to “AI-based” algorithms such as deep neural networks used in vision-based DAA. Despite their lack of explainability such algorithms can exhibit high performance. Xwing recognizes that such algorithms will enable the automation of functions where human judgement was previously necessary. It may also reduce the size, weight, and power required by some sensors. Frameworks added to Tracer in Phase II will help realize these benefits.","The Tracer tool, along with its application to DAA requirements and the extension to AI-based systems, supports the System-Wide Safety Project at NASA Ames Research Center. Since Tracer is a distributed tool, it has the potential to be a useful for any project where NASA is a stakeholder. Users of the tool could include a NASA program manager tasked with ensuring that requirements are met. Another opportunity is to build pre-packaged sets of requirements and test cases that are pre-approved for airworthiness, thus expediting new flight tests.","The Tracer software is intended for sale to manufacturers of aerospace who wish to achieve levels of certification for those systems, which may range from lightweight small UAS up to manned Part 25 aircraft. Other potential customers are manufacturers of different safety-critical systems (e.g., automotive, naval, medical) that have a strong software component (e.g., autonomous systems)"

UNIT avoids the need for costly physical noise collection networks and equipment. It enables early determination of aircraft noise impacts and likelihood of public acceptance in populated areas, which are critical to the feasible design of operating concepts for UAM and e-VTOL vehicles. There are three parts to the innovation: (1) the ability to calculate noise impacts in near real-time at any location, (2) the ability to model the noise produced by conceptual UAM and fixed-wing aircraft, and (3) the development of people-focused noise metrics that consider the movement of people throughout the day. UNIT is designed to operate in a real-time environment and provides inputs to flight path optimization algorithms to minimize noise impacts to shifting population densities during the day. It is highly relevant to NASA’s Subtopic A3.01 Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts, which cites “achieving high efficiency in using aircraft, airports, enroute and terminal airspace resources, while accommodating an increasing variety of missions and vehicle types, including wide-spread integration of UAS and ODM operations.” UNIT responds to the RFP area of “concepts for emergent risks,” since noise is a potential UAM showstopper due to the high frequency of ODM operations and public noise impacts. History tells us that communities are highly sensitive to noise. Public backlash to ODM/UAM and e-VTOL noise could thwart the concept and technology before it launches. NASA’s Parimal Kopardekar has stated that noise is one of the top three challenges for UAM. The results of our efforts will be useful to NASA’s current interest in enabling UAM through their ATM-X project and Grand Challenge research efforts, as well as being commercializable for airports, urban communities, and UAM operators.","The ATM-X Testbed can use our integrated UNIT software to produce real-time simulations to analyze the environmental impacts of future UAM e-VTOL scenarios, as well as non-UAM scenarios with conventional fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. UNIT can be used for planned flight demonstrations, such as the UAM Grand Challenge, and the ATM-X Initial UAM Ops Integration sub-project by supporting optimization of future noise-sensitive routes.

The desired result from this SBIR project is a multi-functional avionic system that is small and lightweight enough to be used on small UASs (sUASs), and capable of functioning with both the traditional ATCRBS/transponder position reporting system and the GPS-based ADS-B position reporting system.  It will have to transmit and receive on both ADS-B frequencies and be capable of responding with standard 1090 MHz Mode A/C information to interrogations from ATCRBS and TCAS. A highly desirable feature will be the ability to interrogate cooperative (transponder equipped) aircraft in “blind airspaces” where ATCRBS cannot reach.  This interrogation would primarily be intended for avoidance of collisions and could be relatively low power and short range while providing information to a pilot (onboard or remote) in time to avoid a midair collision.  Finally, because this system will mostly be used on sUASs and small GA aircraft, a low-cost design is highly desired. This SBIR demonstrates that advanced development of software defined radios (SDRs) has produced highly capable, multifunctional, miniature avionics suitable for all aircraft, including small UAS, and addressing the concerns and weaknesses of both ATCRBS and ADS-B position reporting systems.

Automated systems will be needed to perform turbulence hazard mitigation tasks currently allocated to humans.  Future operations will also involve new types of vehicles, especially distributed electric propulsion (DEP) VTOL vehicles, and a greatly increased density of operations in environments with unique turbulence characteristics, including the urban canyon.

Unless these decisions are explained in a human understandable form, the end-users are less likely to accept them and certification personnel are less likely to clear these systems for wide use. Explainable AI (XAI) is an AI algorithm whose actions can be easily understood by humans. Phase I of this SBIR developed EXplained Process and Logic of Artificial INtelligence Decisions (EXPLAIND)—a prototype tool for verification and validation, as well as in-operation explanation of AI-based aviation systems. We successfully used EXPLAIND to generate reliable, human-understandable explanations for decisions made by a NASA-developed AI algorithm used to detect aircraft trajectory anomalies. Controllers participated in cognitive walkthroughs of EXPLAIND’s explanation interface, which successfully explained the rationale behind one frequently detected anomaly type. EXPLAIND thus represents an important step towards user acceptance and certification of AI-based decision support tools (DSTs). In Phase II, we propose to build on the successful Phase I technology to create a commercial, licensable, universally-applicable, cloud-based AI explainability software platform. We pursue three thrusts in Phase II: (1) Operationalize EXPLAIND for aircraft trajectory anomaly detection applications, (2) Expand EXPLAIND to be a universal explainability approach and apply it to benefit other NASA XAI research programs, and (3) Apply EXPLAIND to non-aviation applications with significant commercialization potential: computer vision systems in self-driving cars, credit rating algorithms in the financial industry, and insurance claims processing algorithms in the health insurance industry.","EXPLAIND can benefit NASA AI algorithms used for (1) Aviation anomaly detection (for NASA System-Wide Safety project).

The Airspace Monitor combines data on weather, infrastructure state, traffic density, and aircraft positions and planned trajectories with predictive analytics on aircraft separations and conflict rates to infer the (hidden) risk state of the airspace. The Flight Monitor uses airline and aircraft-based data to evaluate potential aircraft risks from equipment state and certification, and the potential for pilot fatigue based on elapsed crew duty time and time of day.

All the data for the Airspace Monitor are publicly available and the module can be built and applied NAS-wide without restriction. All airline proprietary and personal data are contained within the Flight Monitor under direct airline control. The airline can access our airspace risk assessment monitor and combine it with its proprietary flight and personnel information to monitor its flights.

In the LSP, a solvent, such as an alcohol, ketone, or acetate is cooled to temperatures below -100 C, where it becomes an effective solvent for Mars atmospheric CO2. After absorbing 5 percent or more by mole CO2, the solvent is pumped to another vessel where it is heated to 30 C, releasing the CO2 at pressures of more than 1 bar. The clean warm solvent is then sent back to the absorption vessel, exchanging heat with the cold absorption column effluent as it goes. After the clean solvent is cooled to near the design absorption temperature in this way, a mechanical refrigerator is used to achieve the final temperature reduction. Advantages of the LSP are that it can operate continuously day or night without the need for mechanical vacuum roughing pumps, solid freezers, or large sorption beds, requires less power than other options, is readily scalable to high outputs, and that it stops all sulfur, dust, or non-condensable gases from reaching the ISRU reactor system. In the proposed SBIR Phase 2, an operating protoflight LSP unit meeting the full-scale NASA CO2 acquisition requirement needed to support will be demonstrated and its performance assessed.","The primary initial application of the LSP is to provide a reliable, low cost, low mass technology to acquire CO2 on the surface of Mars out of the local atmosphere at low power. Such a system can be used to enable human exploration of Mars, as well as a Mars Sample Return mission. The LSP is dramatically superior to current alternative methods of collecting Mars CO2 because its power requirement is much less. Compared to roughing pumps or solid sorption beds, the LSP can reduce CO2 acquistion power requirements by an order of magnitude.",The LSP could be used to separate CO2 from flue gas and other exhaust streams on Earth.  Once separated the CO2 could be used to enable enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The USA has hundreds of thousands of dormant oil wells that could be revived by using CO2 to pressurize them and lower their viscosity.  This will allow for a dramatic expansion of US oil production while combating climate change.

These concepts will be integrated into a protoflight Phase II design, which will consider and accommodate the microgravity environment necessary to operate the AOWG through startup, steady operation, and shutdown. This progression of development will lead to implementation in advanced human space missions.","AOWG system is key for human space exploration, converting organic crew wastes into clean water, a small mass of sterile inorganic residue, and clean gases suitable for venting from the spacecraft. The AOWG is targeted toward minimizing overall transit vehicle mass, which minimizes mass requirement for propellants and tankage. Waste mass reduction with water recovery is critical for life support and to reduce overall flight costs.","AOWG has applicability for terrestrial energy recovery, fuel and chemical synthesis from renewable resources, agricultural wastes, municipal wastes, and organic-containing wastes including paper and plastic. These organic-containing resources processed by AOWG methods produce syngas to convert into methanol or other fuels and chemicals using Fischer-Tropsch or other catalytic synthesis processes."

For the integration of EVVA with NASA’s next generation space suits helmet bubble, dynamically switching technologies are needed to provide tint-ability, radiation protection, and optimized transmittance. Giner proposes to develop an electrochromic space suit helmet bubble that would provide high optical contrast between its clear (transparent) and dark (opaque) states, tunable switching, and a control module that would allow for both user and ambient light control.

Specifically, advanced future propulsion systems require significant improvement in the upper temperature operating limit of composite materials. Carbon-carbon (C-C) composites exhibit unique properties on increasing strength with temperature but suffer from oxidation at temperatures above 550 C.  Over the years significant efforts in the oxidation protection of C-C composites  included internal inhibition, external coatings and sealants. The reliability of such oxidation protection system is greatly limited by the intrinsic risk of coating spallation.  On the other hand the internal inhibition by itself is incapable of providing sufficient substrate protection at high temperatures without the external coatings. Phase I results provided initial paradigm shift into the feasibility of internal oxidation protection system for 3500 F to 4200 F applications. This Phase II builds on very encouraging and insightful Phase I results and provides for a comprehensive, unique molecular level inhibition of the fiber, intrabundle matrix and interbundle matrix.  System chemistry will be optimized to offer NASA a plethora of opportunities in such demanding applications as extension nozzles and combustors offering max temp operation up to 4,200 F with the material system chemistry and molecular inhibition design enabling the composite based parts to experience very large temperature gradients and providing effective oxidation protection of the substrate. In short, the uniqueness of this molecular inhibition system, based on Allcomp’s provisional patent, eliminates the need for external coatings and sealants. By the elimination of the external coatings the huge coating spallation reliability problem will be solved offering a paradigm shift applicable not only to NASA propulsion applications but the plethora of other NASA applications, military, and commercial applications.","An inherently oxidation resistant molecular-inhibited C-C composites without the need of external coating protection capable for operating at temperature up to 4200 F can be easily scaled up at low cost for large extension nozzles, high temperature integrated combustor / throat/ exit cone, and advanced heat shields for NASA’s launch vehicles and re-entry vehicles.

Future NASA missions will require new technologies to further space exploration and delivery of high mass loads. Of particular interest is the development of reusable hot structure technologies for primary structures exposed to extreme heating environments on atmospheric entry vehicles. A hot structure system is a multifunctional structure that can reduce/eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system. Thus, there is a need for the development of new technologies to support the realization of low-cost, reusable hot structures applicable to atmospheric entry vehicles.  A key barrier is the requirement for the lightweight form to not only carry mechanical loads but also accommodate high temperatures (1000-2200°C), severe transient heating, and temperature gradients through the thickness.  Novel materials and associated fabrication processes are needed to balance the demand for structural cohesiveness with desired thermal properties required to protect structure interiors.

Our proposed system, Anomaly Detection via Topological feature Map (ADTM), will use Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based architecture to produce high-resolution clusters of nominal system behavior. What distinguishes SOMs from more common clustering techniques (e.g., k-means) in the ISHM-space is that they map high-dimensional input vectors to a 2D grid while preserving the topology of the original dataset. ADTM will use SOMs as the building blocks for a hierarchical case-based model of a system. Using a combination of case-based reasoning (CBR), clustering, and classification techniques, ADTM will detect, predict, and explain anomalies, and guide users in implementing effective mitigations. This approach provides the critical ability to handle previously unknown anomalies and faults. An additional feature of ADTM is the ability to cross-correlate subsystems in order to capture the cascading effect of faults from one subsystem to another, as well as discover latent relationships between subsystems.  Such analysis would significantly aid in the maintenance activities of NASA’s deep-space missions. ADTM will include tools to allow users to visualize the status of the system at various levels of granularity, configure and receive alerts about current or predicted future faults, and navigate the system models to trace root causes. The Phase I effort implemented prototype versions of ADTM’s SOM-based clustering and classification techniques. The prototype was successfully demonstrated on three real-world datasets from NASA and on one simulated dataset for a CubeSat.

Accordingly, during Phase II the FDM unit will be modified to meet ISS compatibility standards and a prototype of this unit will be developed. In addition, the composite architecture, fiber layup, and feedstock combinations down selected from Phase I will be further optimized to improve structural capability beyond what was already achieved during the Phase I effort. Advanced feedstocks will be further developed not only for enhancement of structural properties but also from the perspective of outgassing. The team recognizes that for a true structural part built on the ISS, it may not be possible to conduct comprehensive mechanical testing on ISS to validate the part itself. During Phase II, a comprehensive finite element modeling (FEA) approach will be undertaken to predict mechanical properties as a function of feedstock combination and composite configuration. This FEA model will be validated using extensive mechanical and fracture testing data. Such a validated model will be a useful tool to select feedstocks and composite architecture combinations prior to printing a part on the ISS. Sufficient testing of down selected feedstock combinations and composites will be conducted to develop at least an S basis design allowable. We also propose to pursue FDM printing of metallic parts and demonstrate the potential of using the same FDM unit to print both composite and metallic parts.

MIS has leveraged NASA SBIR support to create the first polymer additive manufacturing machines in space, develop a hybrid additive-subtractive metal manufacturing technology, and investigate the creation of large single-crystal industrial materials in microgravity. The next step in the industrialization of LEO is the formulation of base materials, such as specialty glasses, that can be refined into higher value products in microgravity. The Glass Alloy Manufacturing Machine (GAMMA) is an experimental system designed to investigate how these materials form without the effects of gravity-induced flows and inform process improvements for commercial product development. While focused around creating fluoride glass preforms (glass cylinders that can be pulled into fiber optic cable), the system can also be used to melt a host of glass compositions, experiment with different dopants, and start the process of creating larger and higher quality glasses aboard the ISS. The initial system development focuses on remelting glass materials originally created on the ground and quantifying differences with ground control experiments. MIS plans to continue this technology development to fully design a system capable of several different experiments for optimizing glass quality in microgravity. These experiments will include processing the constituent powders into samples, using containerless processing to remove potential impurities in the preforms, varying gravity levels through use of a centrifuge, and other experiments which can only be performed on the ISS platform.","Exotic optical fiber is useful in many different applications such as lasers, spectroscopy, and high-grade sensors.

NASA and commercial entities are in need of advanced methods that allow for rapid analysis of complex optimal trajectory problems, so that the most informed decisions with regard to mission design can be made at an early stage in the planning process. This includes having a solver that can intelligently search the large problem space, do so quickly, and with a great enough level of fidelity to ensure that the trajectory can be continued to a flight fidelity level. Advanced optimization tools for the low-thrust multibody problem do not currently exist, yet this regime is seen in numerous mission designs. In Phase I, CUA demonstrated that the solution approach taken by DyLAN produces significant results, finding unintuitive optimal solutions rapidly and without the need for the user’s oversight. During Phase II, CUA will improve the global and local optimization capabilities of DyLAN, so that a wider breadth of problems can be solved and brought to higher physics fidelity. These internal improvements will complement DyLAN’s proposed ability to harness NASA’s open source GMAT and CSALT tools for additional capabilities; including the ability for export into GMAT. These features will provide a mission analysts with the capability to extend or continue any interplanetary solution with ease into a multibody domain. The parallel computing capabilities of DyLAN will be further extended, so that larger search spaces and more difficult problems can be solved quickly.

Of particular interest to this NASA solicitation is the transformative potential of quantum technology in the realm of communications. Furthermore, transmission of quantum information over arbitrary distances raises new possibilities in sensing, networked clocks, and distributed quantum computation. The entanglement distribution at the heart of all these applications relies on the same underlying “quantum repeater” technology. ColdQuanta’s objective in this Phase II SBIR is to produce a critical enabling quantum repeater component: a long-lived quantum memory that is strongly coupled to optical fields for storage and recall of single photons. During Phase I, ColdQuanta investigated generation of atomic ensembles with ultra-high optical density (OD>100) for generation and storage of quantum information because high OD is critical for attaining high memory efficiency.  However, the residual atomic motion in the Phase I ensemble results in dephasing of the quantum memory on a timescale of several microseconds, rather than the many milliseconds required for long-range quantum networking.  Nevertheless, the Phase I study demonstrated ColdQuanta’s ability to produce high OD ensembles of cold atoms to boost memory efficiency. The remaining task, proposed for Phase II, is to modify the Phase I atom ensemble generation scheme by trapping the atoms in an optical lattice, which limits residual motion and therefore motional dephasing allowing memory lifetimes up to 0.3 seconds to be observed. Development and fabrication of the photon-coupled quantum memory system in Phase II will be highly efficient because the system can be produced by minor modification of ColdQuanta’s existing DoubleMOT commercial product, which comprises the vacuum cell, magnetics, and optics needed to produce cold atom ensembles.","While the explicitly stated NASA application of interest from the solicitation is in quantum communication, the proposed technology enables distribution of entanglement between remote locations which introduces new possibilities not only in quantum communication (long-range secure communication over unsecured channels) but also in quantum networked arrays of clocks (for improved stability, accuracy, and security) and sensors (for example, extension of telescope interferometric baselines improving measurement angular resolution).","An important open question in practical quantum computing is scaling existing systems to vastly larger numbers of qubits than have been demonstrated today. Among the promising candidate solutions to this scaling problem is the idea of employing distributed quantum computing, which extends the achievable size of quantum computing systems in a manner analogous to multi-core classical computing."

As such, it can be used to monitor spatial and temporal changes of minor molecular atmospheric constituents in the lower troposphere.  The filter is designed for observing water vapor from orbit.  An accurate assessment of global water vapor distribution is key to more precise modeling of climate feedback from clouds and improved weather forecasting.","The primary application is the provision of fast frequency tuning for space based lidar systems.

Two very successful cryogenic prototype devices at WR-10 (75-110 GHz) were designed in the Phase I effort. The measured insertion loss at 77 K is 0.3 dB and the isolation is greater than 25 dB across the band. In the Phase II program we propose to develop a line of cryogenic isolators optimized for cryogenic temperatures operating in every waveguide band from WR-15 through WR-5.1 and to deliver prototype devices at each band to NASA. We will also design cryogenic isolators for the WR-4.3 and WR-3.4 bands. These components will fill an unmet need and find immediate application in many cryogenic systems now being developed for NASA missions. Cryogenic cycling puts mechanical stresses on the constituent parts of the isolators that can ultimately lead to premature failure. Part of the proposed research is to identify and mitigate potential failure mechanisms so that the isolators can reliably withstand multiple cryogenic cycles over the lifetime of the device. This task is accomplished through sophisticated thermal stress modeling as well as repeated cryogenic cycling of the isolator assemblies. A WR-2.8 (260-400 GHz) isolator designed in the Phase I will be assembled and tested. This isolator will be the first of its kind at this frequency. A novel line of MMW voltage variable attenuators (VVA) will also be developed. The VVA’s utilize the Faraday rotation effect in a similar way as the isolators, but with a variable magnetic bias field instead of a fixed saturated magnetic field. Initial investigations indicate that the effective attenuation range should be at least 1-35 dB in the WR-10 band. NASA researchers at JPL have expressed their interest in these devices.","NASA develops many sensitive cryogenic detection systems including millimeter-wave and terahertz sources, detectors and receivers for NASA’s Submillimeter Missions such as Marvel, VESPER, MACO and SIRICE.

The curvature will improve measurement quality and volume utilization by allowing the detector to conform to the physical geometry of the instrument. For example, an instrument may view the space environment in 360 degrees of azimuth with cylindrical symmetry. In this case, a cylindrical MCP may be used to exploit the instrument housing geometry to simplify either direct particle detection, or detection of secondary electrons that provide timing signals. Where secondary electrons must be detected, the compatibility of the curved MCP with the instrument geometry may be used to shorten electron flight paths, and consequently reduce high voltages needed to steer secondary electrons to their MCP target. Additionally, continuous, curved MCPs can relieve structural mounting complexity and the consequential vibration mode complexity. The MCPs will be made by bending glass capillary arrays, then applying thin films to provide the functionality of a microchannel plate electron multiplier. This two-step approach makes possible nearly any shape for an MCP. Another benefit of this approach is that the microchannels will always have the same angle relative to the surface normal at any location. This will make the detection efficiency the same for all particles with normal incidence at any location on the MCP. A similar approach can be used for simple, lightweight collimators. Microchannels can be oriented perpendicularly to the surface, and the curve made to fit the symmetry of the entrance system. A carbon foil may be added to the surface of the collimator to provide a secondary electron for timing measurements. Although the cylindrical nature of the microchannels introduces some specular reflection from the interior of the channels, this approach offers the benefit of mechanical simplicity and light weight for a collimator application.","The curved MCP or collimator may be used in any spaceflight particle detection instrument, to improve volume utilization and measurement quality. These are instrument-enabling benefits for instruments in the CubeSat environment, as well as instruments in mass-constrained deep space missions.","The curved MCP may be used for terrestrial mass spectrometers, cylindrical beam monitors, or MCP-photomultipliers for compact cylindrical geometries, in which flight path uniformity from source to detector is critical for photon timing."

(MEI) proposes to develop high temperature, solid state sensors to monitor carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) in the Venus atmosphere.  A harsh environment chemical sensor array suitable for measuring key trace species in the Venus atmosphere has been developed by MEI under a recent SBIR program. Currently there are no demonstrated chemical microsensors suitable to measure the two most abundant species (CO2 ~ 97% and N2~ 3%) in the Venus atmosphere at high pressure and high temperature conditions (CO2 and N2 exist as supercritical fluids near Venus surface). The proposed amperometric and potentiometric sensors are compatible with silicon carbide (SiC) electronics under development for Venus chemical sensing instruments, complementing recent and ongoing efforts to support Venus atmospheric analysis. Future missions which may descent through the atmosphere and operate on the surface of Venus measuring the composition of the atmosphere would benefit from this new capability to accurately measure small variations of N2 and CO2 concentration. Phase I of the program focused on design and demonstration of the sensor material systems and sensing capability.  Prototype sensors were fabricated and tested in relevant laboratory conditions, demonstrating the technology to TRL 4. In Phase II, the CO2 and N2 sensors will be coupled with electronics to meet the needs of key applications of interest.  For planetary use, SiC based electronics being developed by MEI under the Hot Operating Temperature Technology (HOTTech) program will enable operation of chemical sensors for extended periods on the surface of Venus.","In addition to monitoring the CO2 and N2 concentration in the Venus atmosphere, the sensor can be used to monitor CO2 and N2 in the Mars atmosphere, as well as support of Mars in situ resource utilization (ISRU), such as capture and pressurization systems for capture, concentration and utilization of CO2 from the Mars atmosphere.",Monitoring CO2 generated in molten carbonate cell anode and consumed in cathode enables controlling CO2 addition to make up deficiencies. N2 is used to protect cell components.  The carbon sequestration and CO2 recovery markets have an unmet need for CO2 sensing and trace nitrogen detection.

INSPECT incorporates two extraction columns integrated into a microfluidic platform for the separation of a broad range of Class I (non-polar organics), Class II (polar organics) chemicals, thus reducing interference and lowering detection limits by providing more refined (or pre-separated) and concentrated samples to on-board analytical instruments. As stated in a recent paper, ``…with any analytical system, the accuracy of sample analysis is only as good as the sample that is delivered to the analytical instrument."" This is especially holds true for samples in complex chemical environments that either contain high levels of molecules that interfere with the analytical instrument or contain chemicals that can react with target analytes. To mitigate these problems LMT proposes to carry out separations with small extraction columns that borrow technology from solid phase extraction, reversed phase chromatography and traditional column chromatography technology. Our system not only will increase the resolution and sensitivity for life-detection techniques but will use low power, low volume and low mass, which are inherent traits of a microfluidic system. The method outlined above is an improvement over other extraction-type systems that require large volumes of volatile organic solvents for sample concentration, separation and delivery. Moreover, the modular nature of INSPECT will allow it to be compatible with several analytical instruments currently being used and developed at NASA including CE, MCE, GC, Gc-MS, HPLC, IC, LDMS,UV spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy.","The INSPECT technology provides innovative sample processing technologies for the purpose of improving the resolution and sensitivity of life-detection measurements. Specifically, we have targeted environmental samples from Ocean World bodies with water, but this module may also be adapted to process soil samples for environments such as Mars with the incorporation of a preliminary extraction step. The INSPECT technology provides innovative collection and concentration of samples for delivery to a variety of analytical instruments.","The INSPECT technology can also be adapted to monitoring specific chemical concentrations on Earth. This will be important for environmental monitoring near crude oil deposits to detect small leaks before they become large ones.

Vector vortex waveplates (VWs) appear to be capable of providing best performance compared to other mask technologies due to their structure as thin film coatings of continuous texture that minimizes light scattering noises and wavefront distortions even for high topological charge values. The nature of VWs as half-wave phase retarders provides opportunities of having high diffraction efficiency in a broad band of wavelengths in different parts of spectrum, from UV to IR. The pathways of reaching the ultimate performance features of VWs have proven elusive so far due to the great multitude of fundamental and technological factors influencing them. The Phase 1 study allowed us to identify architectures overcoming tradeoffs of contrast vs bandwidth, and relating those to manufacturability and tolerances. The unique knowledge gained in the Phase 1 on fundamental and technological issues of developing high contrast VWs will be used to setup fabrication and optical characterization systems adequate for meeting tolerances and specifications required for coronagraphs. The development will address technologies of multilayer liquid crystal polymers with precisely tuned intrinsic alignment and retardation. The fabrication systems would be enhanced with high precision coating, alignment, and curing systems in fully controlled environmental conditions, and with automated key processes for quality and yield. Direct contrast characterization systems in large dynamic range would complement high precision special test equipment with custom built opto-electronic systems.","Coronagraphs, Ultralight high efficiency optics and electro-optics for space instrumentation, Deep space optical communication, Solar sails","Optical communication, Optical tweezers, Quantum computing, Image processing systems, Microscopy, Laser beam control systems, Photoactuated polymers, Displays, Anti-counterfeiting taggants"

Wavefront control for such telescopes will require small-stroke, high-precision deformable mirrors (DMs). The proposed innovation is a segmented microelectromechanical DM that can be used in NASA test beds as a surrogate for segmented PMs, or to compensate wavefront errors of PM segments in future NASA programs. The project directly addresses NASA’s SBIR General Solicitation, Focus Area 10: Advanced Telescope Technologies, under the Science Mission Directorate Subtopic S2.01, which calls for a deformable source to simulate the telescope front end of a coronagraph undergoing deformations. In the proposed work, an objective is to develop a DM having an array of hexagonal mirror segments, each supported by an array of underlying electrostatic actuators. Such a device could be used to actively compensate topographical errors in a PM. The proposed device has no hysteresis and uses an all-silicon design that is intrinsically stable and insensitive to environmental distortions. The plan of work builds on a successful Phase I project that demonstrated concept feasibility. It includes fabrication of DM segment arrays, use of an ion beam figuring process to planarize DM mirror surfaces, and demonstration of active control of segment topography. The outcome of this project will be a device that can reduce telescope shape errors to <10nm RMS in NASA test beds used for development of future space-based observatories.",Segmented deformable mirrors that are suitable for correcting surface figure error and stability in primary telescope segments and serving as a primary mirror array surrogates in telescope testbeds have a few NASA applications.

Telescopes used for astrophysics, exoplanet, and planetary studies require picometer stability over several minutes to hours. Building large support structures with picometer level stability is a challenge with currently available materials due to their brittle nature in the case of Zerodur and ULE or their requirement to have tight thermal control in the case of SiC or carbon fiber composites. ALLVAR Alloys offer a new material solution for thermally stable structures. They exhibit negative thermal expansion and can compensate for the positive thermal expansion of other materials to stabilize a telescope.

In Phase I of this effort, Ozark IC showed, through a laboratory demonstration, that NASA’s JFET-R technology can continuously run a stepper motor for over 1,000 hours of operation at 470oC.  In parallel, Honeybee Robotics demonstrated that its TRL-6 level Venus motors are capable of being used in a stepper configuration to achieve the required auger needs for a Venus drill. What remains for Phase 2 is to fabricate a combined motor control chipset, assemble modules, and demonstrate the combined motor and electronics operating together at the Venus surface temperature.   The motor and drive electronics will then be tested at Venus temperature and characteristic measurements including power and torque will be monitored using HBR’s high temperature motor characterization system.  500 hours of operation is targeted for this effort.","NASA applications include Venus landers and atmospheric probes, health monitoring of jet, rocket and ion engines.  For Venus a drill has been proposed for New Frontiers missions for a Venus lander.  The proposed chipset and stepper motor can meet the needs of the auger for such a drill as well as provide support for actuation and mobility in future missions.","Energy Exploration – Enhanced geothermal and deep-well ocean drilling and monitoring Military/Aerospace – health monitoring and control of jet engines and turbines Automotive – health monitoring and control of internal combustion engines, exhaust systems, and emission controls Industrial- combustion and emission controls Science - (Terrestrial) High temperature manufacturing processes"

The silicon carbide motor controller will be designed and fabricated to operate at extremely high temperature and high radiation environments, beyond the reach of a typical silicon-based motor controller. To demonstrate a successful SiC motor controller, we will fabricate SiC power devices as well as SiC gate drivers. At the component level, we will characterize their electrical and physical properties. Simultaneously, we will design and fabricate SiC CMOS integrated circuits such as control logic and timing circuitry. At the board level, will minimize gate driver parasitics, EMI and noise issues, as well as detect and mitigate faults. At the module level, we will design a proof-of-concept SiC motor controller, operable at high temperatures, and will test the controller’s electrical and thermal performances under a wide variety of loading conditions. At high temperatures, silicon has an abundance of intrinsic carriers, resulting in a loss of junction control and preventing proper device operation. For bulk silicon electronics, the threshold beyond which device control is lost is approximately 175C. Our SiC CMOS technology has been shown to operate at high temperatures as high as 500C. Ultimately, our proposal addresses a niche application that cannot be addressed by silicon.  This is achieved by combining our high temperature and radiation tolerant silicon carbide low voltage integrated circuit technology, with a silicon carbide based power device. Specifically, our proposal focuses on high temperature capable designs in order to meet the power requirements for robotic science probes and instrumentation.","The proposed technology has the potential to extend the exploration capabilities and survivability of robotic systems in harsh environments such as those present on the surface of Venus and in the atmospheres of gas giants. Venus lander missions call for systems that operate above 400C, beyond the reach of silicon. The high temperature tolerant ICs and power devices that we design and fabricate offer a solution for extending operational capabilities and mission lifetimes.","Our SiC IC and power solution for space applications offers the same weight reduction and efficiency gains for other spacecraft, and therefore we expect the outcomes of this proposal to benefit the larger community including private satellite and space companies such as SpaceX. Additionally, terrestrial high temperature applications such as drill monitoring would benefit from this as well."

Contamination Control and Planetary Protection requirements focus on both forward and backward contamination from such bodies where a number of acceptable processes have been developed for sterilizing spacecraft hardware and sample return materials. In particular, for backward contamination control, NASA has shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide is an effective method for sterilizing samples and surfaces. However, for long duration exploration missions, stored hydrogen peroxide solutions lose their efficacy. To ensure an effective vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization process for return trips, Skyhaven Systems, LLC proposed to develop a miniaturized vapor hydrogen peroxide generator that produces this sterilant in situ using only water and DC electrical energy. With this approach, surfaces and sample return materials can be effectively sterilized during sample collection using a NASA approved sterilant.","This vaporized hydrogen peroxide system is directed towards NASA’s needs for contamination control and planetary protection. Integrating this peroxide generator into sterilization system will enable an effective sterilant to be produced for long duration missions where stored hydrogen peroxide is not feasible. Further, the oxygen and water breakdown products from the sterilization process can be reclaimed minimizing expendable losses.",Commercial opportunities for the hydrogen peroxide generator may be directed toward medical equipment sterilization. Integrating this generator into sterilizers will enable fresh hydrogen peroxide to be generated overcoming storage concerns that can lead to a loss of efficacy over time.

We propose to leverage past observations of the ability of electrospray ionization to capture and concentrate polar or polarizable trace species without damage, and combine that knowledge with recent discoveries in developing a hypervelocity ice-gun for NASA studies aimed at ice grain capture simulations. The phase I effort will focus on using the ice gun we created under prior NASA support, and add a cold plasma curtain to pre-charge an incident ice grain, and couple a novel electrospray element that we believe will enable in-situ organic analysis capability previously unattainable on board a spacecraft using existing NASA mass spectrometer hardware. Incident ice grain impacts into aerogel create a rearward plume of water vapor that may contain a high percentage of trace organic species. Using a cross-current electrospray source, these species may be charged to form multiply charged ions capable of being interrogated in-situ using a mass analyzer, while preserving aerogel impact samples for a return mission.","The proposed technology offers a new means to employ mass spectrometry in a life finder mission, because with the creation of multiply charged ions rather than singly charged species, existing mass analyzers can be employed to look for the presence of organic molecules, without increasing analyzer upmass, size, or power requirements. This proposal negates potential loss of valuable samples entrained in aerogel. NASA can now perform in-situ organic analysis of incident ice grains in near real-time, and have samples retained for a return mission.","For Non-NASA applications, the technology being offered in this proposal include the potential for new methods of ambient pathogen capture and soft ionization for mass spectrometric analysis. In addition, other applications may include non-organic polar molecule charging suitable for thin layer deposition, chip fabrication, and other semiconductor uses."

InSAR interferogram stacks with available ground truth of the phase due to ground deformation will be used to train a generative model that can be applied to other datasets. Automated spatial–temporal analysis of InSAR stacks to yield a high fidelity estimate of surface deformation remains as a challenging problem.  Spatio-temporal analysis tools for InSAR stack processing already exist on various platform, however are mainly the purview of researchers. With the advent of both increased quantity and quality of InSAR sources there is a dual need to (1) handle the big data problem of very fast revisit InSAR that covers the entire globe, and (2) make products more accessible to decision makers and industry. Existing methods and tools used by earth scientists to detect and mitigate the atmospheric anomaly that effects the time of flight of backscattered radar generally yield results with compromised fidelity and often require further interpretation or, if possible, correction that involves heuristics or incompletely modeled dependencies. Instead we will minimize multiple loss functions, inferred from the statistical properties of the training set, to train a generative network to reconstruct the deformation map without the atmospheric effect with high fidelity. The input would consist at least of the stack of raw interferograms and an initial estimate of the deformation map (done with new or existing tools) and will be modular to be able incorporate other information, e.g. weather data. The proposed work includes the development of a Deep learning Enhanced Fidelity InSAR Toolkit (DEFIT) that will be trained and tested on relevant datasets. This can be used for the development of new tools or to augment capabilities of existing tools.","This technology would be useful for many Earth science and meteorological oriented NASA missions involving changes in terrain, biomass, weather and climate.  Dynamic digital elevation models can be produced and updated daily allowing for near real-time surface level monitoring. This has applications in climate science. Also high fidelity spatio-temporal analysis of fast revisit InSAR data to track changes in the Earth’s surface and atmosphere would help in the zenith dry delay correction of GPS signals.","The DOD wants improved remote sensing capabilities for surveillance and monitoring missions.

This size makes them difficult to acquire, store, transmit, analyze and use. Hyperspectral imagers (HSI) are also costly and complex, taking significant time or portions of a focal plane to acquire each spectral band. In addition, orbital HSIs are susceptible to radiation damage and inaccessible for repairs, making any damage long-lasting. In this effort, we will be using advanced algorithms for compressive sensing using inpainting and machine learning to develop a compressive sensing enhanced HSI system. Our Phase I results have shown that we can achieve a 1% subsampling rate with maintaining high quality imagery with minimal loss. This new system allows for over an order of magnitude improvement in the frame acquisition speed of existing detectors at a high compression ratio. The approach will automatically compress all images obtained by the level of sub-sampling used to form the image, reducing transmission and storage costs significantly, even without using additional lossless data compression before transmission. In order to demonstrate the ability of these methods to provide these benefits, Sivananthan Laboratories will apply them by fabricating a new CS-enhanced HSI system. This leverages the wide range of IR detectors that the company, and its sister companies EPIR and Episensors, have pioneered over the last 20 years. We propose to develop new hyperspectral sensors that will intentionally subsampled data that will be recovered using computational imaging with learned representations. By multiplexing the input signals, and randomly selection spectral bands using an acousto -optical tunable filter we can leverage subsampling directly into higher signal-to-noise levels, and better resolution.","This technology can be applied to both existing hyperspectral imaging systems and those being developed. The approach can be applied to both division of time and division of space systems, maintaining resolution while reducing capture time and noise. Additional applications are available in robust data compression for storage and transmission over long distances. This approach also provides fault tolerance, system recovery and image enhancement for fielded imagers with lost pixels.","Commercialization will come in two forms: CS enhancement of existing technologies and through selling complete imaging systems as built in functionality. Hyperspectral imaging systems are used in many applications including chemical and biological detection, manufacturing, environmental surveys of CO2, pollution, and leakages."

This will include improvements to address FM metrics for failure response/recovery, and will be linked to ongoing efforts to implement FM Metrics and to overall system autonomy, but targeting SMD science missions and their unique goals. The proposed effort will result in a novel capability that incorporates the “Recovery” aspect of FDIR within TEAMS® and enables FM Visualization of design architectures, which then links to a clear and concise set of FM metrics to minimize mission risks to desired levels. TEAMS® can leverage built-in modeling features for performing FM Architecture Design Assessment, such as Fault Trees and FM Metrics related to Failure Detection and Isolation. Switches in TEAMS® models facilitate their use in multiple system modes. This feature will be leveraged to enable Recovery Loops across multiple scenarios. The proposed effort seeks to aid the visualization and assessment of FM design for system(s) in multiple usage scenarios by utilizing existing capabilities and introducing new capabilities to TEAMS® for the computation and evolution of relevant FM analyses.

The resulting product will integrate and document in one framework Fault Management (FM) design processes, models and products. The IMFSD covers FM requirements definition, design specification, analysis, validation-and-verification (V&V), and documentation. This provides the connection of the associated processes and models to the corresponding elements of the host space system model-based design. The integration of FM development life-cycle processes is achieved by means of a “design development, documentation, and assurance case” (D3AC) logic structure hosted within the IMFSD software platform, which provides active connectivity among all elements of the FM design, and with the evidences produced to demonstrate compliance with FM design and operations goals, and with the derived requirements. In view of expected spacecraft-autonomy evolutions for which expanded FM operational capability and analytics will be needed, the IMFSD, in addition to established FM models like Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, includes, or links to, logic-dynamic models and AI decision / action selection models – e.g., Dynamic Flowgraph Methodology, Markov Cell-to-Cell Mapping Technique – that can extend FM analysis into the time-dependent-logic domain. Other potentially applicable state-of-the-art models from the field of machine-learning, like Bayesian Belief Networks, Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Influence Diagrams, are also evaluated and demonstrated for evolutionary inclusion in the IMFSD. Once demonstrated for NASA applications, the IMFSD will be transferable to the design of FM for the high-autonomy commercial systems that are presently being developed in the aeronautical and road transportation fields. This provides a path for commercialization efforts that will be initiated during Phase II.","The IMFSD workstation, hosted on a commercial MBSE platform, integrates in one environment the Fault Management (FM) design of NASA space systems, and is also applicable to aeronautical systems, manned and unmanned. Its ability to support the convergence of FM and AI functionality makes the IMFSD especially well suited to support the design of autonomy in space systems.","The IMFSD can support risk-scenario management, fault management, and safety analysis of autonomous vehicles of many kinds, i.e.: driver-less automotive road vehicles; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); commercial space vehicles; commercial aircraft; marine vessels and probes.

Such predictions are extremely challenging, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are considered to be the most promising tool for achieving them. Our interactive and highly automated MHD modeling framework, CORHEL-AMCG, will allow users to routinely model multiple observed CMEs in a realistic coronal and solar-wind environment and to propagate modeled CMEs to 1 AU. CORHEL-AMCG is designed to account for the complexity of pre-CME configurations, the slow initiation of CMEs, and their interaction in the corona and interplanetary space. By modeling the magnetic as well as the dynamical evolution of CMEs, CORHEL-AMCG can predict the negative Bz component of the interplanetary field arising from the CME, which is the primary driver of geo-effectiveness. These advances will make CORHEL-AMCG particularly useful scientifically and constitute a major step towards operational space-weather forecasting. CORHEL-AMCG will be delivered to the CCMC by the end of Phase II.  Our vision beyond Phase II is to transition CORHEL-AMCG into an operational forecasting tool.

However, in a microgravity environment, acquiring vapor-free cryogenic liquid propellants from supply tanks and then transferring them to receiving tanks is very challenging. To address this challenge, Creare developed a robust, lightweight hybrid Liquid Acquisition Device (LAD) with screened channels for cryogenic propellants. The hybrid LAD has a novel configuration enabled by Creare’s unique fabrication processes. Creare’s LAD employs a hybrid capillary structure to position the residual liquid in a tank to optimum locations to maintain liquid supply for the LAD screen surfaces, and thus enhance the expulsion efficiency. Creare’s innovative fabrication process reliably maintains the pore structure of the screen near bonding joints with its support frames. The lightweight support frames provide mechanical support for the screen to withstand launch vibrations. In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility and performance benefits of our approach through designing, fabricating, and testing a proof-of-concept screened channel. In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate a laboratory-scale hybrid LAD and deliver it to NASA for further evaluation.","The technology developed in this project will enable reliable spacecraft refueling in a microgravity environment. Creare’s lightweight LAD will enable almost all the propellants in the supply tank to be transferred to a spacecraft engine, and thus significantly reduce the effective launch cost of spacecraft. The technology also has applications as phase separators in two-phase bio and chemical reactors, as well as in fluid management for two-phase flow thermal management and power systems.","The technology developed in this project has applications in propellant acquisition systems in commercial spacecraft, and gravity-insensitive aircraft fuel supply systems. The capillary structure fabrication technology developed in this program will also have many applications in terrestrial two-phase thermal management systems."

It employs, among others, a very small planar scandate cathode as electron source. This is a revolutionary cathode technology only recently perfected by e beam inc. It is capable of delivering over 350 ma of discharge from an emitter area only 0.012 cm2. Efficiency in discharge is measured to be > 70 ma/watt of input power. This innovation avoids conventional hollow cathode keeper geometries, which are too expensive, use too much power, and are difficult to miniaturize. The Phase I scandate cathode ran about 1000 hours in CW discharge at 350 ma with no drop in emission or functionality. We also offer a planar barium oxide cathode at very low cost for low budget CubeSat projects. Also, we offer a series of iridium-based cathodes for use with corrosive propellants such as iodine. We plan in Phase II to continue developing cathodes and keeper geometries. We plan to retrofit these into very small Hall and ion thrusters and test them. We will continue life testing Phase I cathodes and initiate new life tests. There is a great need for thrusters on CubeSats for attitude control, positioning, orbit raising/lowering that are efficient and low cost. CubeSats have become the great enabling technology for low cost space science projects.

Tungsten, with its many unique characteristics, plays an important role in nuclear reactors including for the nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) engine.  The refractory metal, however, still has a number of shortcomings which still need to be addressed.  These include a high ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT), low ductility and poor fracture toughness, low machinability and fabricability, low-temperature brittleness, radiation-induced brittleness, and a relatively low recrystallization (RX) temperature compared to its operation temperature.  The use of W above its RX temperature interminably can be unsafe because its mechanical properties decrease in such an environment.  Low-temperature brittleness also imposes restrictions on the application of W as a structural material.  And, given its high hardness, high brittleness, and poor machinability, W parts can be very costly and time-consuming to manufacture.  Past efforts to increase the ductility of W were primarily directed on alloying, grain refinement, extreme working, area reductions, impurity reductions, and heat treatments.  While ductile W currently exists in wire form (e.g., filaments) through extensive working and area reduction, this approach is clearly not practical for applications where bulk size parts are needed.  Thus, a compaction deformation method under both controlled pressure and temperature along with compressive and shear deformation in a hot die system will be demonstrated here to ""ductilize"" W.","This program should result in higher performance, more affordable manufacture of very high temperature hot zone structures and components such reactor fuel elements, radiation shields, hot gas path nozzles, and thrusters for diverse spacecraft and rocket propulsion systems including the nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) engine made from more ductile bulk tungsten.

The device utilizes two-phase heat transfer and novel geometric features that adaptively (and reversibly) adjust the view factor in response to internal pressure in the radiator. The radiator folds into a closed shape to minimize the view factor when cold, and opens up to maximize the view factor when heated. Prototypes demonstrated in Phase I prove the feasibility and highlight the advantages of a two-phase radiator over shape memory alloy technologies.  Structural and thermal simulation studies confirmed the viability of the concept. At low temperatures, the view factor of emissive surfaces of the radiator to the heat sink is near zero, so the only heat lost is that which is emitted from the insulated outer surfaces of the radiator. The flexible section of the radiator is an elastic envelope enclosing a saturated working fluid. When the temperature of the radiator increases, the corresponding increase in vapor pressure generates a net force on the interior walls of the envelope which causes the elastic walls to bend so that the structure opens and the view factor increases. The increase in view factor reduces thermal resistance of heat rejection which enables inherently passive thermal control. Additionally, the entire structure of the radiator consists of cavities filled with saturated fluid acting like heat pipes, so the radiating surface will be nearly isothermal, achieving a radiator panel efficiency near one. In Phase I, modeling and prototyping indicates that the baseline geometry proposed can achieve a thermal turndown ratio of 37:1.","The NASA roadmap is looking for radiators with turn-down capabilities greater than 10:1 The proposed vapor pressure driven variable view factor radiator shows great potential in advanced spacecraft thermal control by reducing the complexity and cost of variable view factor radiators.

In this data, significant process phenomena are accurately measured and easily identified, such as spreading defects, rogue particles that have been sintered to the part’s surface, distortion, surface roughness variation, and virtually any geometric feature.  Of particular importance is the measurement of powder layer condensation and uniformity. This data serves as input to a model that generates feedforward information to adjust process parameters, resulting in better prediction and control of key material properties such as residual stress and density. In Phase II the team will further improve the sensor and test the feedforward model.  After fine-tuning the modelling capability for stress and distortion, mechanical testing will be conducted to validate model performance and determine the effect of defects (measured with the profilometry) on mechanical performance.  The result will be real-time determination of part quality by a modelling tool that integrates profilometry-detected defects into the performance predictions. This novel data will then be used to feed and validate a fast-feedback look-up table (generated by inverting the feedforward model), for layer-to-layer laser parameter adjustment during builds.  Next, a new design of the profilometry sensor will be completed to make it very compact (a few inches) so it can easily be added to OEM AM machines.Then the research team will implement a new sensing technique (with the same hardware) to record video-rate, measurements, at nanometer precision, of thermal expansion and shrinking during the melting process, thereby facilitating novel and powerful analysis of residual stress and/or delamination formation.  Finally, the research team will demonstrate the whole sensor/modelling package on a NASA geometry of interest.","Applications include any system that wishes to use AM parts in critical areas, including: Rocket Engines: The SLS program heavily utilizes AM.  These components can be very large and require long build time, experiencing failed builds is painful. Deep Space Exploration: Research on Stirling engines is heavily interested in AM and engine components must be reliable Material development: High quality in situ data, like this profilometry, may be useful for investigating process phenomena during the development stages of new AM materials.","Applications include any system that wishes to use AM parts in critical areas, including: Department of Defense supply chain: DoD suppliers aim to build an ever-growing list of critical parts that must have adequate process validation and documentation for the digital twin.

For example, ceramic based Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) are being applied to rocket engine components such as combustion chambers, injector face plates, and nozzle extensions to allow higher temperature propellants to be used, which results in increased performance.  In addition, TBC materials are desired for re-entry and hypersonic vehicles that will experience both space and atmospheric conditions.  All of these systems rely on the low thermal conductivity and emissive properties of the ceramic topcoat to minimize heat transfer.  However because of the thermal expansion mismatch between the ceramic topcoat and underlying metallic structure, special care must be taken during joining.  The Phase I results showed advanced plasma spray additive manufacturing techniques can be used to produce ceramic based TPS/TBC materials on metallic substrates and the ability to successfully modify critical properties such as reflectance/emissivity and thermal conductivity through rare earth oxide additions were demonstrated.   During Phase II, the most promising TPS materials will be optimized and extensive ground based testing will be performed.  Samples will also be produced for testing on MISSE-13 and MISSE-14, and these samples will be compared to the ground test results to determine any detrimental effects from space exposure.  At the conclusion of the Phase II effort, critical space exposure data will be available for a broad range of advanced TPS materials for different substrates and applications, which is needed for the safe development of future NASA missions such as long duration space travel, space stations, lunar habitats, re-entry and hypersonic vehicles.","NASA programs where the technology can be directly inserted to replace state-of-the-art TPS/TBC materials to improve performance and margin of safety include the Commercial Crew Program (CCP), Rapid Analysis and Manufacturing Propulsion Technology (RAMPT), and Hypersonic Technology Project (HTP).

Thin-film polymers are used in many spacecraft applications including multi-layer insulation, sunshields for thermal control, deployable structures, solar sails, as well as flexible solar arrays.  Materials on exterior spacecraft surfaces are subjected to extremely harsh environments composed of photon and charged particle radiation, thermal cycling, impacts from MMOD, and Atomic Oxygen (AO).  Many applications that could benefit from using a thin polymer film are restricted from their use since many currently available materials do not meet durability or packaging requirements.  This proposal defines research that will develop a new material capability for NASA and deliver samples for MISSE-FF testing needed to qualify the material for NASA missions and commercial applications. During Phase I, NeXolve incorporated a PTFE structure within the CORIN®XLS polyimide to provide an AO-resistant polymer film with flexibility, tear resistance, and durability far exceeding current state of the art materials.  Phase I also resulted in development of a new lab scale manufacturing method to form the CORIN® XLS/PTFE composite with improved tear resistance.  The composite materials exhibited substantial increases in elongation properties and tear strength compared to baseline materials.  The elongation of the composite films increased by as much as 700% compared to baseline material.  An increase in tear strength of the composite compared to the baseline CORIN® XLS film was as high 1000% depending on the composite construction.  Phase II seeks to develop a continuous manufacturing process for the CORIN XLS/PTFE composite that will allow commercial scale production.  The Phase II research also seeks to advance the TRL of the material from 5 to 7 by utilizing the MISSE-FF platform.","Specific NASA missions that would benefit include the proposed Kon-TikiTechnology Demo, Solar Polar Imager(SPI) and GeoStorm space weather monitoring.  There are a number of proposed NASA missions that would be improved by incorporation of CORIN® XLS/PTFE into the sunshields.

They will need to manipulate their environment in complex and useful ways - carrying objects, using tools, and assisting crew.  NASA’s humanoid robots have highly dexterous end-effectors, but developing software to fully utilize such hands remains a challenging task.  Grasping strategies are highly dependent on object models and localization.  Environmental obstacles or the object's intended use can strongly influence how best to grasp it. Previously with NASA, TRACLabs developed CRAFTSMAN, which supports robot-independent task descriptions, although grasp strategies are robot-specific.  Here, we extend CRAFTSMAN to handle grasping as a task-informed behavior.  This new system, called ADAMANT, will connect to other CRAFTSMAN software nodes to help find the best option for acquiring an object.  The result will be a robot grasping interface that produces more robust robot behaviors while reducing the cognitive load on remote robot operators. The ADAMANT system uses sensor and/or model data in addition to a task description to develop a ranked list of potential grasps for an object, using user-selected grasp metrics.  These different grasps are explored in the context of the complete task to arrive at the strategy most likely to succeed. In Phase I, we demonstrated that we could describe tasks in terms of the effect on the object, rather than just a sequence of waypoints for a manipulator and gripper.  In Phase II, we will fully incorporate this object-centric idea into CRAFTSMAN, allowing the user to define tasks without a specific manipulator/gripper in mind.  The ADAMANT system will automatically figure out at run-time the best way to grasp an object given models of the hand and models (or sensor data) of the object. This work will make it easier for NASA to use robots in conjunction with pre-existing operational procedures, and has many applications to industrial robotics.","This work is immediately applicable to NASA robots such as Valkyrie, SPDM, SSRMS, and even Astrobee. Future NASA robots will perform repair tasks on satellites or the Deep Space Gateway, and caretaker robots will maintain dormant facilities. Robots will also assist humans on tasks such as habitat construction or surface exploration. The proposed system, integrated with CRAFTSMAN, will greatly improve the capabilities of these robots and facilitate the authoring and supervision of their tasks.","TRACLabs has an existing R\&D partnership with major automotive suppliers to integrate CRAFTSMAN into their plants. The first installation went live in September 2017 and operates continuously. The proposed research will be immediately applicable to their stated goals of deploying flexible workcells world-wide.

Busek’s BET-300-P thruster is under active development as a precision reaction control system (RCS) which will provide orders of magnitude improvements over state-of-the-art alternative attitude control systems (ACS) for CubeSats/small-spacecraft. The low inertia of CubeSats combined with vibrational disturbances and resolution limitations of state-of-the-art ACS presently limit precision body-pointing and position control. Busek’s electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder (NASA ST-7) spacecraft, demonstrated control of a proof mass location to within ~2nm per root Hz over a wide band. The BET-300-P, enhanced by exploitation of its high-speed dynamic response in this program, seeks to extend that success to small spacecraft platforms. Passively fed electrospray thrusters are highly compact, including fully integrated propellant supplies, and are capable of ~100nN thrust precision with 10’s of nN noise. Thrust can be accurately throttled over >150x, up to a scalable maximum of 10’s to 100’s of uN.  While typically operated in largely continuous states they are unique in that emission can be electrically stopped/started at ms time scales. Thus, extremely low impulse bits may be achieved over very short durations. In Phase I pulses as short as 1ms permitted throttling from <0.1uNs up to 100’s of uNs. These traits, combined with >750s specific impulse, and thereby low propellant mass could enable these systems to replace traditional reaction wheel ACS and high-propellant mass cold gas systems; enabling milliarcsec control authority for CubeSats versus the present arcsec level SOA. Phase II will regimentally advance the technology by first performing detailed investigations of critical phenomena and then applying those results towards a rigorously tested engineering model thruster.","Ongoing NASA mission studies include the BET-300-P for attitude control, formation flight and positioning of small spacecraft. Specific benefiting applications include deep-space missions, astronomy, solar-system observations, laser communications and space situational awareness. Mission durations are extended by increased wheel desaturation capacity. Improved body pointing would augment stability; permitting lower cost/complexity realization of existing needs and enabling new objectives.","High-precision small-sat propulsion systems are an enabling technology with numerous applications. The virtual elimination of vibrations while superseding reaction wheel precision is a competitive advantage. Precision pointing/positioning capabilities of the BET-300-P system are otherwise unavailable. Potential customers include international partners (eg ESA), the DoD and commercial EO missions."

This SBIR [Z8.01 Small Spacecraft Propulsion Systems] points out that although there are currently many technologies for propulsion systems, the miniaturization of these systems for small spacecraft is a particular challenge. While cold gas or pulsed plasma systems support small Δv applications, modules that can provide more demanding maneuvers still need development. NASA seeks complete propulsion system solutions (thrusters, valves, propellant, sensors, electronics, etc.) capable of full-scale flight demonstration on 27U, 12U, 6U, or 3U CubeSats in support of deep space and/or swarm topology missions. Of particular interest are propulsion system solutions offering long life, reliability, and minimalistic use of CubeSat resources (power, energy, volume, and mass), while delivering propulsion capabilities that meet requirements. AASC has met these goals with its innovative, electric propulsion thruster (MPT) that has no moving parts, uses solid propellant (non-toxic stable metals such as Mo, Nb, Pd and many others), is compact (fits into 3U CubeSats, and is modular, so scalable to 12U, 27U and even larger platforms. The simplicity of the system and relatively low manufacturing cost make the MPT highly attractive to the CubeSat market. The technology has matured from TRL-4 to TRL-6 during the Ph-I effort. During Ph-II, we intend to take it to TRL-9 by launching into space and gathering operational data during positioning and attitude adjustment maneuvers on a 100kg satellite.","The MPT architecture lends itself to use on all NASA satellites in the 5 kg -250 kg category. Pathfinder (INSPIRE) is one example. The MPT could suit that mission, if a window of opportunity presents itself. NASA also plans to launch Lunar IceCube, a public-private partnership that will send a tiny CubeSat (Dec 2019) to do water-ice prospecting from an elliptical orbit around the moon. Lunar IceCube, Lunar Flashlight, BioSentinel and NEA Scout are part of a movement to employ cost-effective CubeSats for deep-space exploration.","1000s of satellites (5 kg -80 kg) might soon be in LEO. Imaging satellites that today are launched into higher than 500km to avoid rapid burn-up, would offer higher resolution and faster refresh rates at lower altitudes but would need propulsion. The MPT (compact, no moving parts, solid fuel) is ideal for these satellites and in custom designed arrays, could be useful for larger satellites too."

Rideshare restrictions to propulsion systems often limit CubeSats to the non-optimal orbits into which the primary mission delivers them, and leaves them unable to maintain their orbits.  This curbs CubeSat adoption into commercial, persistent Earth science, or interplanetary missions.  ExoTerra’s Modular Xenon Micro Electric Propulsion System is a high-impulse propulsion system that enables CubeSats to alter or maintain their orbits and to perform affordable, targeted science missions throughout the inner solar system.  The proposed integrated system provides 4-33 mN of thrust and 36-53 kNs of impulse at an Isp from 700-1500 s using a micro-Hall Effect Thruster, and can package in 9U of volume to meet the tight constraints of CubeSats.  Variations of the system can provide over 100 kN-s of impulse.  The propulsion system consists of the Xenon propellant and distribution system, a high efficiency PPU that is radiation tolerant to 100 krad, the Halo thruster and a thrust vector controller.","Potential NASA applications include interplanetary CubeSat missions with a need for non-toxic, high impulse and thrust propulsion systems.  With this capability, NASA can send CubeSat missions to the Moon, asteroids, comets, Venus, Lagrange points, or Mars. The scalability of the propellant system design makes it applicable for a wide range of spacecraft sizes and mission architectures.","Exoterra’s Xenon Micro EP System provides orbit raising, inclination change and maintenance for commercial microsats.  Commercial satellites can reach their working orbits using a smaller, simpler, and lower-cost SEP main propulsion system.  The system can also be used in an SEP-based upper stage for the burgeoning small launch vehicle market, delivering microsats from LEO to GEO orbit or beyond."

This approach leverages previous NASA and commercial investments in the CLCT and can enable mission adoption within the next 5 years.

PermiAM will enable increased design simplicity for AM injectors and reduced development costs through improved face cooling and improved combustion stability. Phase I demonstrated successful use of PermiAM in multiple materials for rocket engine injectors. A full scale proof of concept ground test will be demonstrated by the end of Phase II.","PermiAM material is aligned with NASA Technology Roadmap needs TA1.2, TA2.1, and TA12. Masten is currently focusing on the propulsion elements of PermiAM with direct applicability to small satellite launch vehicles, upper stage engines, and planetary landers in support of the NASA CLPS program. For SLS, the RS-25 and RL10 use a coaxial injector with Rigimesh face. As AM build volumes increase it will be possible to replace the expensive and complex rigimesh injector with an AM version to lower the cost of heavy lift space access.","For aviation it may be used to improve the performance and reliability of commercial jet engines.

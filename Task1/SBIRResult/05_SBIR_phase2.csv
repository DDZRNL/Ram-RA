The system includes an L-band RF transceiver-sensor package, which continuously transmits Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) compatible beacons to alert other cooperative aircraft and ATC (Air Traffic Control) ground stations regarding the aircraft's position and intent.  In addition, it uses the reflected beacon signal as a radar signal to detect and track any non-cooperative targets within its effective range.  A multifunctional RF transceiver serves as both the primary radar and secondary surveillance radar (SSR).  The phase I effort has successfully demonstrated the concept of this technology in three areas: (1) Adding phase modulation to the 1090 ES carrier and proving it still complies with ADS-B waveform standard, (2) Coherent pulse compression for ranging (3) 3D angular estimation using TCAS-like circular antenna array and using innovative digital beamforming and spatial spectrum processing.  In the phase II effort, we will work with commercial partners to build a 'brassboard' system and perform a series of system evaluation tests.","The proposed technology will directly serve NASA's Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Technologies (IIFDT) program, especially for external hazard detection, as the proposed system provides see-and-avoid functionalities to handle non-cooperative air-traffic.Another NASA related application for this sensor system is UAV collision avoidance. The proposed research will add the ability to see and avoid both cooperative (transponding) and non-cooperative aircraft to UAVs.  Such capability is crucial to providing military services and industry with sustainable, flexible UAV operations, sufficiently robust to safely deploy whenever and wherever needed.","The proposed collision avoidance radar is a novel approach to achieve a low cost modification to existing aircraft avionics which will enhance safety and promote the JPDO NGATS initiative for adoption of ADS-B in the NAS.  We estimate the commercial market for airborne collision avoidance radar to be potentially worth tens of millions of dollars as several manufacturers produce ADS-B avionics over the next 15 to 20 years. If the GA community and AOPA succeed in the removal of Mode C transponders after ADS-B implementation is mandated along with the installation of UAT avionics in GA aircraft, then it would be reasonable to expect that the FAA and commercial market will look to modify Mode S/TCAS equipped aircraft for collision avoidance radar capability such as we have proposed.","Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Microwave/Submillimeter; Pilot Support Systems; RF"

Cumulative cracks at critical loading and high stress areas, if not detected and repaired in time, may lead to catastrophic failure. Traditional methods such as Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) and eddy current are limited to point-by-point measurement and are very time consuming. Disassembly of the engine is required for each inspection, which in turn may cause maintenance induced problems. We propose a wireless in-situ ultrasonic guided wave health monitoring approach. It applies light, thin, high temperature leave-in-place ultrasonic guided wave circumferential patch transducers around the root of the disk, and a pair of innovative tube antennae that wirelessly couple the transducers to the inspection instruments. Guided waves travel in the disk for crack inspection, and the inspection could be done even when the disk is rotating. Phase I results clearly demonstrate that the guided wave is very sensitive to tiny cracks on a rotating aluminum disk, and the tube antennae worked well. The envisioned system can inspect a relatively large area, has minimal effect on the rotor performance, instantaneously provides reliable and quantitative data such as crack location and severity level, and minimize and eventually eliminate the need for structural disassembly.","It was reported that one-half to two-thirds of the maintenance costs of a turbine engine is attributable to the repair and replacement of the hot section high-value parts. The efficient and reliable in-situ DNI method addressed in this proposal will greatly facilitate fault detection and condition assessment of the turbine engine, and hence make possible condition-based maintenance instead of scheduled teardown inspection. The proposed system is applicable to gas turbine engines of both military and commercial aircraft, and other turbine engines. The technology is novel by itself and will have many practical applications in other structural diagnostics and prognostics applications. NASA applicationsThe ability to detect and characterize defects in an early and accurate manner is always critical for reducing cost and improving safety for many NASA systems such as propulsion system, aircraft frames and wings, etc. At the end of Phase II, we will have a small, light weight, low cost, low power consumption and robust system with both hardware and software integrated together for various defect detection and localization. The success of such a system will enhance aviation safety while reducing the need for unnecessary scheduled maintenance.","In-situ health monitoring and fault diagnosis is equally important for many military and commercial systems such as aircraft, automobiles, trains, home appliances, nuclear reactors, etc. The system can either perform continuous monitoring for the critical high strength components or switch on-off when needed.",Aircraft Engines; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors

These parameters would be used to identify certain cloud conditions that pose airborne icing hazards to aircraft.  The innovation is a new capability for measuring cloud properties that would consist of a small optical probe flown on an expendable weather balloon. Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the IR-based approach. A series of tests were conducted in an environmental test chamber to demonstrate the overall detection capability. The proposed Phase II will continue development and calibration of the sensor package and integrate it into a commercially available balloonsonde system for evaluation testing in the atmosphere.",The proposed in-situ expendable sensor package will improve aircraft safety by predicting when and where icing hazards exist.  This is particularly advantageous to general aviation and to commuter aircraft which are most susceptible to icing accidents. This research is in support of NASA's goals to improve safety of flight by developing instruments that provide advanced warning of icing conditions. NASA conducts atmospheric studies using instrumented balloons that fly from just a few hours to over 100 days.  A light-weight sensor that measures cloud content would be a useful addition.,"In addition to deployment in a balloon launched radiosonde, this detector would be extremely valuable for light aircraft flying in clouds at low altitudes, which do not currently have weather radar. The cloud property information is also important to the atmospheric research community, NOAA and other weather services.

Once the sensors are installed, long wires for power and data must be routed through to a central data collection location where several large off-the-shelf electronic components reside, adding weight, cost and increasing the probably of introducing noise or faults into the testing system.  All of this necessary infrastructure leads to prohibit the use of some types of sensors and limit the total number of sensors used so save on time, cost, complexity and resources.  During the course of this Phase II SBIR research, Metis Design Corporation (MDC) proposes to develop a standardized data acquisition hub for aircraft testing sensors dubbed a ""sensor-logger"".  The sensor-logger would essentially serve as a durable sensor infrastructure node capable of autonomously facilitating local testing for multiple sensors of various types.  Controlled wirelessly by PC or PDA, data could be displayed in real-time, or logged internally for up to 40 hours.  The second half of the proposed research would then tie together the sensor-logger with the Phase I research, developing a power-replenishment device to attached to the sensor-logger to extend its operating capabilities.  Finally both devices will be flight tested in true aircraft environments.","Key factors to the device marketability is its versatility; the ability not only to be integrated into new applications, but also retrofitted into existing system.  There are several areas of potential NASA applicability.  The first is for experimental aircraft programs.  This device will give the ability to collect more data, with less complexity cost and risk to the testing program.  Next, another important aerospace market would be for expendable launch vehicles (ELV) to help facilitate launch/no-launch decisions.  Of probably greatest importance, this device could be a key technology for reusable launch vehicle (RLV) for quick turn around times, to avoid lengthy manual tear down inspections.  Long duration spacecraft, such as satellites and deep space exploration vehicles, could also benefit from cheap, simple and light monitoring systems for launch or deployment.  Lastly, these devices would also be useful for various components of the space station to help guide wear and maintenance.","Beyond NASA space applications, there exists a broad commercial market for a reliable sensor infrastructure system.  MDC has had prior work with the NRO, who would use this technology for DoD ELV's.  UAV's would also be good platforms since they may be stored for long periods of time before being deployed.  Airlines that chose to use these systems would be able to reduce the number and time of required inspections, which would also give them the opportunity cost to capture profit due to more up-time.  In this capacity, MDC has currently sold more than 400 prototype sensor systems to Boeing (commercial and military air), Honeywell and GE for aircraft application evaluation.  Once SHM technologies have been proven in aerospace applications and have been around long enough to reduce their cost of implementation, systems such as these will likely be utilized in many naval, automotive and civil infrastructure applications soon thereafter.",Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Energy Storage; Highly-Reconfigurable; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Power Management and Distribution; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Testing Facilities; Ultra-High Density/Low Power

Many of the specific conditions and events of interest to airline maintenance are not being monitored by automatic systems, and some events are being identified through a subjective determination by the aircrew.  This subjective determination can result in both maintenance being performed unnecessarily and maintenance not being performed when needed.  AeroTech will develop a multi-tier, Quantitative Condition Alerting and Analysis Support (QCAAS) system for aircraft that will in real-time, automatically downlink to maintenance personnel, reports on the occurrence of specific conditions and events (e.g. loads exceedance).  The reports will be displayed on a web based, ground station network.  The system will also track individual aircraft's exposure to particular in-flight conditions allowing airline personnel to tailor maintenance programs to individual aircraft.  By providing quantifiable data in real-time, operational decisions can be made to minimize the impact and maximize the benefits of on-condition maintenance.  The QCAAS system will be comprised only of software that can be implemented on most current fleet aircraft, keeping costs low, minimizing the time to market, and therefore maximizing the likelihood of industry adoption.","This system will directly support the Aviation Safety Program's focus of protecting and preventing damage to aircraft due to abnormal operations and system failures, and can be directly applied to two research thrusts of this program: 1) Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM), part of whose focus is development of computationally efficient tools for in-flight prognosis of aircraft health, self-awareness of airframe issues, mitigation of airframe failures, and the development of preventative and adaptive systems for in-flight operability and informed logistics and maintenance; 2) Aircraft Aging and Durability, whose focus is detection and mitigation/management of aging-related hazards of civilian and military aircraft.

The specific areas of need addressed by this project relate to fusion of sensor-based diagnostics with degradation models, management and propagation of uncertainty, autonomous model updating, and practical considerations such as reducing data volume and storage requirements. The algorithms developed in this project represent the generalizable aspects of predictive prognosis; the only application-specific portions are the fault model and the diagnostic signal processing. The Phase I work successfully demonstrated the basic features of the prognosis algorithms using data for several bearing fault examples. In Phase II, Sentient will develop these algorithms into a complete, full-featured prognosis architecture. Application-specific fault models and diagnostics for a NASA relevant application will also be developed in Phase II, and these will be used to demonstrate the complete Phase II prognostic system. Sentient will leverage extensive test data available from other closely related projects to thoroughly evaluate the new prognostic algorithms. This data includes studies of bearing cage instability phenomena conducted in a unique space environment test rig. Combined with the new prognosis algorithms, this will be directly applicable to help understand and predict recent bearing anomalies observed in the CMGs of the International Space Station.","During Phase I Sentient signed a separate contract to assist with analysis of telemetry data and ongoing CMG bearing anomalies for the ISS program. One of the ISS CMG bearings failed catastrophically after approximately 18 months of operation, and while there is some concern that the other CMGs might also fail unexpectedly, there are many aspects of bearing operation in this environment that are not understood. The ISS program is interested in algorithms, models, or test data that can provide insight into the cause of the anomalies, and information on how to best operate the CMGs in the future to maximize their useful life.

Propulsion source noise is the major contributor to the overall noise level. The noise generation mechanisms for a typical turbofan engine are complicated, which makes it a significant challenge to identify the noise sources. Each engine component, such as fan, compressor and turbine, can generate both broadband and narrowband noise. Particularly, the fan noise, more specifically the interaction of the rotor with the downstream stator, is important due to the trend towards the development of civil aircraft turbofan engines with higher and higher by pass ratios. Nearfield acoustical holography (NAH) refers to a process by which the noise sources and the resulting sound field can be reconstructed based on sound pressure measurements taken on a surface in the neighborhood of these sources. Thus, the development and application of appropriate generalized acoustical holography (GAH) system by extending NAH to handle arbitrary geometry and complex noise sources, novel measurement and data processing methods, and innovative inversion and regularization techniques will conceptually allow the identification and ranking of complex turbomachinery noise sources that are otherwise difficult to characterize. This system will also enable the use of more effective active and/or passive noise control measures by providing useful information that is impossible to obtain by direct measurements.","The source identification system developed at the end of the proposed Phase II project will enable the identification and ranking of tonal and broadband turbomachinery noise sources, and the visualization of three-dimensional sound field. The information generated can be subsequently used to reduce the radiated noise associated with turbofan engines, rotorcrafts and advanced propeller aerodynamic noise. The adaptation of the system will also enable source identification and subsequent noise reduction in applications such as aircraft and helicopter cabins.","The proposed system can be adapted for the resolution of a wide range of problems such as internal combustion engine exhaust noise, low frequency radiated noise by industrial systems like vacuum pumps and forced air blowers, and automotive interior noise. There are many other situations in automotive, aerospace, heavy equipment and consumer product industries where the noise generation and interaction mechanisms are complex and as a result the applications of noise control procedures are not effectively performed. The proposed GAH system can be extended to identify these noise sources that are otherwise difficult to characterize.",Aircraft Engines

AFN originates from complex interactions of turbulent flow with airframe components that are extremely difficult to compute efficiently and accurately. In Phase I the feasibility of an innovative generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) approach as a computational aeroacoustics (CAA) tool was evaluated.  A subgrid scale (SGS) with wall damping was introduced into the GLBE to enable large eddy simulations.  GLBE results on wall turbulence statistics compared well with direct numerical simulations and experiments. The GLBE approach, which uses multiple relaxation times, was significantly more stable than, and as computationally efficient as, the more common single-relaxation time LBE at high Reynolds numbers. It was also computationally competitive with finite-difference methods on single processors, but GLBE had the major advantage of scaling near-linearly on large parallel computers. GLBE computations also accurately reproduced the tonal frequencies for cross-flow over a single, and a pair of cylinders, and feedback-generated tonal frequencies for flow over cavities, which are CAA benchmarks for AFN.  With feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, further developments of GLBE, including innovative use of wall-layer models, dynamic SGS models, improved boundary condition implementation and grid refinement strategies in Phase II would enable simulations of very high Reynolds number CAA problems of complex geometry with high fidelity. The GLBE approach developed will then be interfaced to an existing far-field acoustics prediction code to efficiently address AFN in configurations of interest, including high-lift systems and landing gear.","The proposed GLBE approach for computational aeroacoustics will be applicable for high Reynolds number flows over structures with complex geometrical shapes. These include noise prediction from airframe structures such as landing gear, flaps and slats during take-off and landing. The approach is also well suited for acoustic analysis of aircraft internal systems. In addition to prediction of noise, the computational package would also be applicable to computational fluid dynamics of low Mach number flows in aircraft systems.","The potential applications include prediction of noise from a variety of transportation systems, e.g. automobiles and trains, and HVAC systems. For accurate prediction of noise generation in such systems due to turbulence-structure interactions, the same technology as that for AFN is required. Current commercial packages cannot adequately handle the unsteady turbulence field which requires a high degree of parallelizability and capability to represent turbulence by dynamic models in complex geometries. The extended GLBE approach would be developed to handle these issues and could penetrate this market rapidly.",Airframe; Structural Modeling and Tools

The virtual shaping and separation control technology can be used to control the size and extent of extremely large separation bubbles to virtually shape the aft recovery region of the airfoil.  The system uses a novel pressure porting technique that requires no external air source to produce a pulsed tangential jet in the separated region capable of partially or fully eliminating the presence of the separation bubble.  The novel pulsed jet system was shown to produce equivalent results to continuous blowing using approximately a 42% lower jet velocity and 87% lower momentum coefficient.  The virtual shaping of an extended run NLF section could offer radical performance enhancement in the form of increased lift-to-drag and maximum lift.  Additionally, the system will produce a wing design enabling a hinge-less, full-span virtual shaping capability, which can be used for pilot reactive roll control, span load tailoring, and gust load alleviation.

Los Gatos Research's novel sensor instrumentation offers a number of advantages including sensor compactness (0.2mm x 0.2mm x 10mm), lightweight (few grams), remote data acquisition capability, low-cost, and low power consumption. The inherently reliable lock-in laser demodulation technique permit simultaneous measurements of strain, temperature, and acoustic fields with high resolution and high sensitivity.  In Phase I, we have demonstrated feasibility by building a prototype instrument  capable of measuring static and dynamic strain, temperature, and ultrasonic waves using a lock-in laser demodulation technique and a fiber Bragg grating array sensor network.  In Phase II, LGR will deliver to NASA a rugged, compact, multi-channel instrument optimized for vehicle health monitoring studies including strain, temperature, and crack monitoring with high precision, high resolution, and high sensitivity.  This dedicated prototype will include an integrated microcontroller, operate unattended, and address the power and stability requirements unique to in-flight studies.","Optical fiber technology provides significant advantages for advanced aerospace platforms because they are lightweight, immune to electromagnetic wave interference, rugged, and do not produce short circuits or ground loops.  Therefore the development of high sensitivity fiber optic sensors has the potential to increase reliability, enable lower cost, and facilitate more effective health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation of NASA's advanced aircraft and spacecraft components and systems.  The Bragg grating array sensor device LGR has demonstrated and proposed to further develop for Phase II will greatly enhance NASA efforts to develop state-of-the-art, compact, low-cost, waveform-based, quantitative strain and ultrasonic wave sensing technology for load, temperature, corrosion, and crack monitoring of advanced structures.","Advances in high-resolution, high sensitivity, and large dynamic range load and ultrasonic wave sensing technology has immediate applications in civil engineering for monitoring cracks, corrosion, and fatigue in steel and concrete structures such as bridges, freeways, and buildings.  High frequency ultrasonic signal detection method development can be utilized in ultrasonic testing, medical imaging, and other non-destructive testing technology.

Unlike Pitot-static and other pressure-based devices, which experience serious limitations in accuracy, pneumatic lags, and frequency response in thin upper atmospheres and at low speeds, FASS will measure airspeed all the way to zero knots and flow angularity to a fraction of a degree with practically zero-lag. It will perform equally well at sea level as well at high altitudes and even in the thin Martian atmosphere with relative immunity to EMI and RFI. Calibrated hot-film gages could also be used to simultaneously obtain total temperature. FASS addresses important flight-operation and flight research problems that have crucial impact on vehicle performance, stability & control, structural loads, and pilot action. FASS will permit direct integration with aircraft avionics systems including conventional instruments used for pressure, temperature, and density measurements. Hot-film gages are coated to withstand harsh environment and for protection from rain and ice. FASS is developed both as a stand-alone probe and as an embedded, non-intrusive system. Applications include aerospace and ground vehicles, submarines, ships, and measurements in the atmosphere, ocean, and in internal flows.","All NASA flight-testing R&D applications, from low speeds to supersonic speeds. FASS can also used for flight in Martian environment. The hardware and software methodologies developed in the project will also allow NASA to use the technology to determine the leading-edge stagnation point location at a number of span stations of rigid and flexible wings. Such an approach could be used  for in-flight determination of unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments generated by lifting surfaces, to develop advanced methods for the determination of stability and control parameters, and to develop advanced closed-loop active flow control systems for improved vehicle performance, safety, and ride quality.","FASS has many military in aerospace applications similar to NASA. In addition, FASS could be incorporated in missiles and weapons to monitor and control their trajectory. Ground vehicles like tanks require real-time data on local flow conditions (speed and angularity) to apply proper corrections before the release of ammunition. FASS could be extended to underwater applications for submarines, ships, and boats using waterproofed hot-film gages. The underlying technology could be used to develop mass flow meters for fluid transport, semi-conductor, and food processing industries.","Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Aircraft Engines; Attitude Determination and Control; Control Instrumentation; Fluid Storage and Handling; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Pilot Support Systems; Renewable Energy; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Testing Facilities"

In addition, AGRP automates or advises resource assignments, improving efficiency while reducing workload.  In Phase 2, we propose to continue development of the AGRP tool through four work areas.  First, we will complete the map and Resource Allocation displays.  We will also complete the algorithm to automate resource allocation decisions and integrate it with the displays.  The resulting AGRP prototype will be evaluated operationally.  We will also extend the Phase 1 work to develop a block out time predictor, which would have tremendous application and benefit in other traffic management systems.  In Phase 1, we proposed an architecture in which applications such as AGRP can subscribe to receive SMS data via a standardized interface.  In Phase 2 we will complete the specifications for and implementation of this interface, which will replace the existing SMS client-server communication.","The outcome of this project may be divided into two parts ? enabling infrastructure and the AGRP tool.

The enabling infrastructure consists of a documented and published interface standard for receiving data from and providing data to an SMS server, along with the modifications to the SMS server to support this service.  This outcome is applicable to the FAA's vision for SMS in the NAS and includes research into predicting aircraft block out times.

In doing so, the FAA will facilitate receiving air carrier information which benefit the FAA's goal of providing safe and efficient traffic flow.  Several air carriers currently use information from the Surface Management System (SMS) to improve the efficiency of their ground operations without any automation explicitly designed for this purpose.

These requirements differ from standard computer image processing requirements since storage space, processing speed, and power constraints differ between PCs and satellites. To facilitate use of satellite images in applications such as image analysis, dissemination, storage and retrieval, etc., a method is needed to convert images to a widely supported format. Since lossy formats lose information, too many transcodings, poorly performed transcodings, or transcodings between poorly chosen formats will degrade image quality, sometimes making them useless. Images such as military photos and deep space objects require high quality, so it is desirable to avoid or minimize loss during transcodings. NASA has requested software transcoding from the CSSDS Image Data Compression recommendation to JPEG2000 (J2K) with minimal image degradation. In Phase I Cybernet demonstrated mathematically that the wavelets used in the CCSDS format can easily, quickly, and accurately be transformed to the JPEG2000 format. This mathematical proof was implemented in a GUI software tool.  For this Phase II proposal, Cybernet Systems Corporation will create a robust, end-to-end solution for transcoding CCSDS images to widely supported formats for dissemination, using mathematical techniques developed during the Phase I. This will be done in four stages. First we will evaluate or implement production level CCSDS, in order to provide users with an easy to integrate, small, fast implementation of this image compression standard. Second, we will create a toolset for optimal conversion to other image formats, including J2K, minimizing transcoding error. Thirdly, since J2K allows a lot of choice for encoding, we will create an optimal J2K encoder tailored for CCSDS images. Finally, we will integrate these toolsets into existing systems as needed.","The technology developed, a CCSDS Image Data Compression to JPEG2000 conversion tool, would be useful throughout NASA for converting space images to a more widely supported format, while still retaining as much of the image quality as possible. This PC based tool could be incorporated into any ground location that needs to receive satellite and probe images in the CCSDS and send them to other agencies, news outlets, and scientists in a format more suitable for use.","Cybernet has a range of image based products, from gesture guided weather software used on television networks to graphics toolkits for terrain visualization, and the competency we gain from work on the JPEG2000 format would benefit our core products.

Phase I demonstrated achievable XNAV accuracy, developed a preliminary source catalog, constructed an XNAV error budget, and laid out potential implementation options for XNAV, focusing on an Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point mission.  Brighter, less stable, non-traditional X-ray sources were also considered for possible XNAV application with promising initial results, especially for formation flying applications.  Taking advantage of concurrent XNAV efforts at DARPA to the maximum extent possible, Phase II will develop and validate XNAV algorithms via a simulation which will be targeted for integration with Goddard Space Flight Center's GPS Enhanced Onboard Navigation System (GEONS) software.  The error budget will be developed in more detail to support the algorithm and simulation work.  XNAV holds great potential for NASA as an enabling technology for fully autonomous interplanetary navigation and could provide a significant mission enhancement as an adjunct to the Deep Space Network (DSN) and ground based navigation.","There are several promising NASA applications for XNAV, including missions beyond Jupiter as an enabling technology for autonomous navigation, potentially providing improved performance over standard DSN tracking capability for very far missions.  Examples include the Pioneer Anomaly mission or 500 AU mission.  XNAV provides fully autonomous interplanetary navigation capability, potentially reducing the demands on DSN for increasing tracking requirements for future missions.  XNAV can supplement DSN service and enhance DSN navigation performance.  XNAV can also provide a backup navigation capability for manned and unmanned near-Earth, lunar, and Mars missions.  Further, it can provide higher redundancy for manned missions.","The primary non-NASA XNAV applications would be to provide primary or secondary navigation services for DoD missions.  For MEO, GEO, HEO, and even cis-lunar missions where GPS has limited availability, XNAV can provide primary autonomous navigation capability.  In addition, XNAV could provide an essential backup navigation capability for missions which normally rely on GPS but have a need for continuity of operations in the event of loss or denial of GPS.  These applications are being actively studied through DARPA's XNAV program, and the Microcosm team has strong ties to that program.The near-term potential is limited for traditional commercial missions (e.g., GEO Communications).  Many system providers are interested in the potential of autonomous station-keeping, the cost, complexity and immaturity of XNAV make it unlikely to be attractive for the commercial market in the near term.  This may change after XNAV matures sufficiently and is demonstrated on orbit.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; High-Energy; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

The proposed virtual sensor test instrumentation will enable a cost effective remote testing and health monitoring through wireless sensor network. Mobitrum anticipates the following applications that NASA will benefit from the proposed technology: (1) Data analysis, processing, and visualization for Earth science observations, (2) Rocket engine test, (3) Remote test facility management, (4) Field communications device for spatial data input, manipulation and distribution, (5) Sensor, measurement, and field verification applications, (6) RFID for identification and tracking, (7) Condition-aware applications, (8) Location-aware applications, (9) Biometric identification applications, (10) Data collaboration and distribution applications, and (11) Wireless instrumentation for robotic manipulation and positioning for audio and visual capture, and real-time multimedia representation.","We believe the smart sensor will have tremendous potential for commercial market. That is because global revenues for smart pressure, flow, force/load, and temperature sensors with signal conditioning amplification capability collectively totaled about $3.4 billion, according to the latest market survey. Mobitrum expects smart sensor technology will enable more home applications for energy control and security monitoring provided by Internet service providers as value-add services such as (1) Home control, (2) Energy management for cost saving, (3) Security (intruder detection), (4) Safety (sensing), (5) Utility ? remote meter reading, (6) Building automation systems ? real-time monitoring and control of security and surveillance systems, alarms, HVAC, etc., (7) Manufacturing and distribution ? industrial automation using RFID, and (8) Health care ? wireless monitoring equipment.","Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Architectures and Networks; Attitude Determination and Control; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Biochemical; Biomedical and Life Support; Biomolecular Sensors; Computational Materials; Computer System Architectures; Control Instrumentation; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Database Development and Interfacing; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; Electromagnetic Thrusters; Expert Systems; Feed System Components; General Public Outreach; Gravitational; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; High-Energy; Highly-Reconfigurable; Human-Computer Interfaces; Human-Robotic Interfaces; In-situ Resource Utilization; Instrumentation; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Intelligence; K-12 Outreach; Large Antennas and Telescopes; Manned-Manuvering Units; Metallics; Microwave/Submillimeter; Mission Training; Mobility; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Optical; Particle and Fields; Perception/Sensing; Pilot Support Systems; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Portable Life Support; Power Management and Distribution; Production; RF; Radiation Shielding Materials; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Development Environments; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Structural Modeling and Tools; Substrate Transfer Technology; Suits; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Teleoperation; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures; Thermodynamic Conversion; Thermoelectric Conversion; Tools; Training Concepts and Architectures; Ultra-High Density/Low Power; Waste Processing and Reclamation; Wireless Distribution"

The survey mission will use radio interferometry techniques to create RF ""images"" of the surveyed area.  These images will show the locations of all RF activity within an area.  While an area is secure, a set of images will be captured and averaged to establish the nominal RF baseline for that area.  Once the baseline is established, real-time RF surveys will be instantly compared to the nominal baseline to detect the existence of RF spectral anomalies.  The TDOA and RI techniques used to establish the RF images will determine the precise location of any spectral anomaly source so that it can be quickly and cost effectively identified and mitigated.","There are a number of potential NASA applications for Soneticom, Inc.'s RI and TDOA system: Range Surveillance would be a primary use for the RI/TDOA system.  An RI enhanced TDOA system will greatly increase the speed and efficiency of insuring a clear and safe range by quickly identifying and locating any sources of radio emissions.  The system will identify inadvertent emissions such as a boater who has wondered into a secure area as well as intentional hostile threats like someone attempting to jam or intercept communications.Interference Mitigation is a problem that the RI/TDOA system will help resolve by locating sources of interference that are a potential threat to launch operations. Personnel Tracking RI/TDOA system could potentially be adapted to locate or identify NASA personnel during operations.  Personnel could wear a small RF beacon that the RI/TDOA system could use to track their whereabouts during critical operations or improve security by identifying people in areas who do not have proper access.Asset Tracking- the RI/TDOA system could potentially be adapted to track certain assets as described above or it could be used as a pseudo passive radar to track and locate objects (equipped with a small RF beacon). For instance, the space shuttle solid rocket boosters could be tracked during reentry and recovery.","Interference mitigation around commercial airports is a problem that the RI/TDOA system could help resolve by locating sources of interference that are a potential threat. Uninterrupted communications between flight crews and ground operations is critical to the FAA's mission of safe flight operations. Personnel tracking in prisons and correction institutions can be accomplished with the RI/TDOA system by placing RF beacons on inmates and tracking individuals' movements and whereabouts.RF Surveillance along US Border could significantly improving the border patrols responsiveness to potential illegal border crossings.Survey ? Due to the unique ability of the RI technique to identify multiple targets on the air concurrently, this technique could be utilized to identify subscriber density in areas where people tend to congregate, leading to  more optimal deployment of consumer communications infrastructures like cellular and WiMax.   Knowledge of this information in real-time could also lead to improved traffic management.RF Emitter enforcement ? Current federal laws which regulate the use of RF emitters on board aircraft, around high explosives, etc. are very difficult to enforce given current techniques. These are very similar to the goals of NASA.  The RI approach could be used to verify that all cellular phones are turned off prior to departure or that there are no intentional or unintentional emitters sharing the frequency with an explosives detonator.","Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Computer System Architectures; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; High-Energy; Highly-Reconfigurable; Human-Computer Interfaces; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Power Management and Distribution; RF; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Development Environments; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures"

However, significant degradation occurs when imaging through the Earth's atmosphere.  The subsequent effects of poor image quality range from inconvenient to dangerous depending on the application.  In Phase I, EM Photonics developed a prototype solver based on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology capable of enhancing long-range images and videos by compensating for atmosphere induced distortions.  This solver was built on an FPGA-platform and thus offered a significant performance increase over traditional, software-based approaches.  In Phase II, we will extend this prototype to process incoming video streams in real-time for a variety of formats, including the high-definition version used by NASA.  The resulting device will be light-weight and low-power and can be integrated with current video collection, viewing, and recording equipment.  This device can be used to process data as it is collected (in real-time) or from previously recorded imagery and deployed with camera systems or in data centers depending on the application.  Additionally, since this processing unit is built on FPGA technology, it can easily be extended to perform a variety of other tasks such as compression, encryption or further processing.","NASA collects massive amounts of long-range imagery for range safety pre-launch, tracking objects after launch, and observing objects in space.  Because these applications require imaging through the atmosphere at great distances, many times the imagery collected is blurred and detail is lost.  By utilizing the device developed in this project to enhance imagery, NASA officials will have access to additional information for a variety of key decisions.  During launch, added level of detail provides the ability to make more informed ""go"" or ""no go"" decisions.  When tracking rockets or the shuttle, enhanced imagery allows for more detail on pieces that may fall from the craft during flight.  Accounting for atmospheric effects will also improve the quality of all imagery taken of space-based objects from Earth.  All applications at NASA that require long-range imagery can be improved by rapidly enhancing the collected data.","Due to the increasing need for accurate long-range imagery in a variety of fields, we have identified numerous applications that could benefit from this technology in the government and private-sector ranging from law enforcement to the study of natural phenomena.  Specific applications include vehicle monitoring and identification, remote site monitoring, underwater imaging, border patrol, perimeter security, costal monitoring, long-range wildlife photography, and airport security.  We envision deploying the solver both as a standalone box (as will be developed in this project) and integrated directly with camera and imaging system manufacturers.  We have already identified several commercial vendors with interest in this technology and will be providing them demonstrations of the system developed during Phase II.","Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Highly-Reconfigurable; Optical; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Ultra-High Density/Low Power"

The primary emphasis in Phase I development was the implementation and real-time demonstration of the sensor fusion algorithms that combined the output from a MEMS gyro and the ARS-14 resulting in a HYSENS that exhibits a bandwidth of DC to 2000 Hz and NEA of less than 0.1 rad rms (0.5-2000 Hz integration bandwidth), thus meeting the requirement specified in the SBIR SOW. The HYSENS has first applicability in optical Inertial Reference units for used in Free Space Laser Communication. The HYSENS-based IRU, or HIRU, that is proposed for the Phase II effort will result in the state of the art in compact optical IRUs.  The significance of the HIRU innovation is that the HIRU will escalate the state-of-the-art in small, precision optical IRUs by virtue of minimal mechanical envelope, low mass, high performance, both in jitter mitigation and Inertial Attitude Knowledge (IAK), and power dissipation. In addition, the HYSENS was designed from the onset to be highly modular and flexible by virtue of the sensor fusion algorithms and computational architecture to allow rapid integration of higher performance MEMS gyros into future versions of the HYSENS.","The primary NASA application for HYSENS/HIRU is in Free Space Laser Communication Systems, e.g. the Mars Laser Communication Demonstrator and its follow-on.  The HIRU has the potential of becoming the baseline optical IRU to aid in virtually all satellite-based laser communication terminals.  Because of the DC response of the HYSENS, the HIRU could also become a common component in NASA spacecraft attitude control systems (ACS).  NASA earth and space observation satellites, and high altitude sensor aircraft that require jitter mitigation for LOS stabilization, and precision pointing would also directly benefit from HYSENS/HIRU as will large telescopes.  All of NASA's remote sensing applications requiring sub-microradian LOS stabilization would benefit from HYSENS/HIRU.","Potential non-NASA applications for the HYSENS/HIRU include DoD space-based applications such as TSAT and MAWFEA.  Both of these systems require precision LOS stabilization and pointing as will systems incorporating laser communications between aircraft, ships and moving ground platforms.   UAV surveillance systems and high energy laser defense systems such as the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL), Relay Mirror Program, and Airborne Laser (ABL) are also potential applications.  Aside from the LOS stabilization function , Non-NASA applications for HYSENS/HIRU would include DoD and commercial spacecraft Attitude Control Systems (ACS) because of the Inertial Attitude Knowledge (IAK) capability of HIRU.

However, these advances have not been paralleled in the performance and availability of single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on similar design and materials platforms.  Moreover, the limited work that has been done to date has been focused on optimizing devices for telecommunications wavelengths in the vicinity of 1550 nm, and there has been even less effort towards devices for use at 1064 nm.  For this SBIR program, we propose to apply innovative design concepts for the development of high performance SPADs optimized for 1064 nm applications.  In particular, we will implement novel bandgap and electric-field engineering approaches to tailor the SPAD avalanche gain properties to realize higher single photon detection efficiency while maintaining the very low dark count rates that are made possible by optimizing the absorption region design for the detection of 1064 nm photons.  We will apply design concepts that we have innovated during Phase I of this program (as well as in the course of developing state-of-the-art 1550 nm SPADs) that involve optimization of the device electric profile for photon counting as well as epitaxial layer compositions.  These efforts will culminate in 1064 nm large area detectors (with active area diameters up to 500 um) that demonstrate feasibility in meeting NASA performance targets including 50% detection efficiency, bandwidth of 500 MHz, saturation levels of 50 Mcounts/s, and non-gated operation.  We will also use the detectors developed to deliver linear SPAD arrays for use as photon-counting line-scan imagers.","There are two primary NASA applications for the high performance InP-based 1064 nm SPADs to be developed during this proposed SBIR program.  First, free-space optical communications to support space missions requires receivers based on single photon detection, and improved SPADs developed in the context of this program will benefit NASA efforts to demonstrate and deploy high-speed laser communication links between spacecraft and earth terminals. Second, active remote sensing optical instruments require higher performance SPADs to improve the performance of existing direct detection doppler lidar systems that make use of aerosol backscattering at 1064 nm.  These detectors will benefit general lidar applications including systems for measuring atmospheric properties such as wind and weather patterns, air pollution, and general trace gas analysis.","There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications that will benefit from the development of high-performance large-area 1064 nm SPADs.  Range-finding and ladar applications present opportunities that encompass both single element detectors for remote sensing and ranging and high performance photon counting detector arrays to obtain three-dimensional imaging.  Just as NASA is pursuing free space optical links at 1064 nm, commercial FSO systems will be able to leverage improvements realized from the development of large area 1064 nm SPADs for photon-starved free space links such as those required in satellite communcations.  As with NASA remote sensing applications, there are commercial applications for improved SPADs in various types of lidar systems for measuring atmospheric properties such as wind and weather patterns, air pollution, and general trace gas analysis.  Finally, high-performance photon counting capability in the near-infrared is desirable for the detection of low light output fluorescence, photoluminescence and photoemission processes.  Fluorescence techniques are widely used in biomedical applications, and the availability of higher performance SPADs at 1064 nm will be critical to enabling techniques at this wavelength.",Laser; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Perception/Sensing; Photonics; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials

This addresses a key technology gap for planetary studies, mainly how to acquire and prepare complex cryogenic samples of astrobiology interest for in situ analysis while meeting challenging mass, volume and power constraints. The proposed sampling system is designed to collect surface samples at Titan's 94K (-179C) cryogenic temperatures using two different miniature probe designs, one for collecting atmospheric aerosols, dust or particles, and another for surface penetration. The samples, which are presumed to include hydrocarbons, nitriles, tholins and other materials, can then be thermally processed by vaporization, thermal desorption or pyrolysis to prepare them for chemical analysis by GC/MS, GC/IMS or other techniques.  Our Phase 1 results have demonstrated feasibility for developing a miniaturized cryogenic sampling inlet system with sampling probes weighing on the order of 100g with a peak power consumption of 20 watts or less. Because vaporization, thermal desorption or pyrolysis heating would only be required for a few seconds during each chemical analysis duty cycle, we project average power usage at a fraction of a watt.","Future Titan missions are likely to employ Montgolfiere aerial vehicles for mobility, severely limiting payload due to their dependence on buoyancy in the atmosphere. Our Phase 1 results demonstrate that it should be possible to develop the proposed cryogenic inlet system with combined vaporization, thermal desorption and pyrolysis capability at a mass on the order of 100g, only a few percent of the mass of the Aerosol Collector Pyrolyser system of the Huygens probe.  Since mission concept planning for a future aerial vehicle for Titan already includes a GC/MS instrument, the addition of Thorleaf Research's proposed cryogenic inlet system with sampling probes could significantly enhance mission capability with little impact on payload mass. With our modular design approach, this system can also be adapted for NASA Space Exploration Initiative needs, such as monitoring for microbial contaminates in space habitats and process monitoring for the extraction of planetary resources.","Analysis of commercial instrumentation markets shows that two of the three major growth areas for analytical instrumentation are real-time analysis and environmental monitoring, with projected annual growth rates of more than 15%. Our modular design approach for the cryogenic inlet system with sampling probes will help make it adaptable for in situ thermal processing of samples, including pyrolysis, for scientific and energy exploration applications.

Its hermetically sealed, monolithic, space-qualified design will ensure the survivability of LIBRA through launch and extended operation on planet surfaces. In Phase I, POC demonstrated the feasibility of LIBRA by assembling and testing a proof-of-concept tabletop (0.020 m^3 sensing head; 0.025 m^3 power supply) prototype with a technology readiness level (TRL) of ~4, capable of up to 5 m standoff detection and identification of inorganic, organic, and mineral samples, including compounds associated with the origins of life, of interest to NASA solar system exploration missions. In Phase II, POC will optimize the system design and develop and fabricate a fully functional LIBRA prototype system to meet the needs of NASA solar system exploration programs.  Prototype test data will lead to an engineering design for a space-rover-operable prototype.","In the LIBRA system NASA will have a versatile, compact, rugged, low-cost system that can be deployed on multiple planetary exploration missions and exploratory platforms for rapid in situ material and elemental analysis.  The standoff capability enables it to analyze solid, liquid, and gaseous samples with no firmware changes.  No single system offers the capability for such a large variety of geochemical analyses today.  This system will have applications in terrestrial geochemical analysis for NASA's earth science programs.  Its standoff capability can be used for process control feedback in space manufacturing operations.  The high specificity low false alarm rate system will benefit contamination monitoring in space and terrestrial habitats.  The ability to identify organic compounds will make this system an invaluable tool for biochemical analysis in space.  Its ability to detect and identify almost any chemical will result in replacement of a number of chemical analysis instruments with a single LIBRA system, which will reduce space, weight, and power consumption in space habitats.","The LIBRA system will usher in a new generation in standoff chemical detection. Although ideally suited for testing solid geochemical samples, the system can be adapted for liquid and gaseous sample testing as well.  LIBRA can be applied to field detection and analyses for environmental, medical, and homeland security applications.  The compact system is a portable, user-friendly package, capable of performing laboratory-quality analysis. Military applications of the LIBRA system will include any program that has a use for standoff spectroscopy; the LIBRA can be incorporated, for example, by the Special Operations Command into their suite of chemical/biological detection tools for forward theater troops.  It can be added to the sensor suites of UAVs such as Global Hawk to determine the compositions of objects.

The success of this mission, called VISE (Venus In-Situ Explorer), is reliant on the development of effective thermal insulation solutions capable of protecting spacecraft for extended periods of time from the extreme heat and pressure associated with the lower atmosphere of Venus.  Materials intended for exterior application must also be inert towards the sulfuric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid present.  Aspen Aerogels, Inc. proposes to continue its development of aerogel composites intended for thermal and chemical protection to a Venus spacecraft.  During the Phase I program, we fabricated several aerogels with inherent thermal conductivities below 40 mW/m-K.  In Phase II, we propose to optimize the synthesis through systematic changes in gelation, extraction, and pyrolysis conditions.  Furthermore, we will demonstrate thermal conductivities of 100 mW/m-K at 500 C under 90 bars of CO2 pressure.  Lastly, methods for fabricating aerogel composites into complex shapes will be investigated along with system level design including attachment to the Venus spacecraft.","The outstanding thermal stability of  these aerogel composites will allow use in the thermal protection of spacecraft subjected to high heat loads or the extremely low temperature of deep space.  Heat shields composed of this flexible low density material can protect spacecraft during aggressive orbital entry (aerocapture/aerobraking) while imparting a significant mass savings over conventional ablative heat-shields.  The extreme hardness of these aerogel composites should also provide protection from high velocity impacts from micrometeriods, as well as thermally insulating equipment against the frigid temperatures of deep space.

The analyses conducted in Phase I indicate that the baseline concept will provide a lifetime of approximately 35 earth hours (while also managing a continuous 150W load from the scientific equipment) with a 100kg mass savings compared to a system employing the same thermal management system with a titanium pressure vessel.  The Phase II effort will focus on refining the concept; designing, manufacturing, and evaluating a subscale prototype.","The primary applications for this high temperature and high pressure probe design technology are limited to NASA probes being sent to Venus or deep atmospheric probes to giant planets.  This thermal management concept could be applied to landers for other planets as well.  Mercury, for example, has a day side temperature of approximately 470oC with little to no atmosphere.  It would, upon initial inspection, appear straightforward to modify the current thermal management system to perform effectively on Mercury.  The lack of a high pressure atmosphere would reduce the load on the pressure vessel, further reducing the mass of the system.  Likewise, the gas back-fill system becomes less complicated, if required at all.  Project Prometheus is seeking radiators capable of operating at 1000 K1 and may face similar needs for lightweight insulating systems.","While the system may have limited application, the components included within the program have great relevance here on earth.  The use of lightweight moderate and low temperature insulation may find use in defense and commercial flight vehicles.

In Phase 1, we developed a model that predicts an optimum InGaAs bandgap (adjustable during epigrowth) for the operating temperature and 1100C blackbody GPHS spectrum of ~0.7eV, made sample devices, and tested temperature coefficients to confirm the model and measured data agree (e.g. model predicts ?1.7mV/C for Voc vs. ?1.8mV/C for data). In Phase 2, we will perform five iterations of a model, design, epitaxially grow, process, and test cycle. Data from each cycle will be used to improve the next design. Testing will include both radiation, temperature stability and accelerated life testing. Before program completion, we will survey NASA and commercial space power contractors for needs and make samples of the best design to distribute among space power contractors as a step toward generating interest and commercial sales.","Deep space missions to the outer planets may use radioisotope heat sources to supply power to the probe. Thermoelectrics have been used in the past, and thermophotovoltaic technology has been proposed as a higher (~3X) efficiency replacement for these thermoelectric converters.","Uses for a radiation-hard high-operating-temperature cell technology are somewhat limited, but ""quiet"" power on nuclear-powered naval vessels are another area where this technology may see application.",Nuclear Conversion; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics; Photovoltaic Conversion; Power Management and Distribution; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Thermoelectric Conversion

This instrument will be a fully autonomous, stand-alone, remotely operable all fiber-based spectroscopy sensor capable of measuring gases in a Martian environment.  The proposed prototype sensor includes the novel use of hollow photonic crystal fibers, which further enables accurate measurement of even small samples of gas.

Only certain enantiomers are useful as drugs for the human body.  Raman optical activity (ROA) provides stereochemical information down to the bond levels.  Many biomolecules like proteins and DNA can be studied to understand their structural chemistry and structure related dynamics.  These methods do not require material in the crystalline form and hence can be very useful tools.However, ROA signals are even weaker than the Raman signals.  Using an important biomolecule, we have demonstrated in Phase I that ROA can be enhanced using nanoparticles.  Not only did the ROA ratio increase by two orders of magnitude, the measurement time reduced from several hours to 10 seconds.  Phase II work will focus on enhancing ROA signals in different subspecies of biomolecules, namely amino acids and proteins, and developing the appropriate colloidal chemistry.  Use of nanoparticles is known to enhance Raman signals by several orders of magnitude.  Our goal is to achieve similar gains in ROA signals by using a sensitive detection system in combination with improved surface enhanced chemistry and microfluidics-based single-molecule detection techniques.  This will result in improved precision of measurement and shorten measurement time.","NASA's main interest in determining helicity of biomolecules is for extra-terrestrial life research programs.  Indication of prevalence of L or D type biomolecules, their structure and isotope identification, can lead to useful clues of life existence elsewhere in outer space.  Surface enhanced Raman optical activity (SEROA) tool will be very useful, especially for unknown biomolecules whose racemic mixtures cannot be easily identified and separated by phase separation techniques.  Moreover, trace identification to the order of parts-per-trillion, or structure identification when crystalline structure is non-existent, are also some of the important issues that ROA can address.  This instrument can also be useful for marine researchers who study life processes in deep underwater thermal vents.  Sensitive Raman measurements with reduced measurement time will be of immense help considering the difficulty in obtaining access to samples.  Real-time studies could become possible with the use of appropriate underwater fiber probes with nanoparticle coated films.","Research can lead to better methods to measure and quantify Raman optical activity (ROA).  This technique can augment X-ray diffraction to provide structural information of a biomolecule, which is of prime interest to biomedical researchers and those developing drugs or cures to fight diseases.  Many chemical and drug industries employ spectrometer systems to measure circular dichroism.  So far, the focus has been on measuring electronic or linear dichroism on a large number of molecules due to the ease of measurement.  However, with ROA, a single molecule can be studied.  Other benefits include not having to rely on phase separation techniques, which are not easily available for every molecule.  Our efforts will pave the way for obtaining improved ROA signals using existing spectrometers with little modification.

Integrating antenna elements and related electronics onto flexible substrates, however, poses significant challenges.  To our knowledge, there exists no technology that can incorporate a variety of electronic/sensor materials onto large-area flexible substrates to create flexible and conformable circuits in an economical and reliable way.  The majority of the limitations stem from processing techniques.  Mesoscribe Technologies, a high tech start-up from SUNY-Stony Brook, proposes to apply a breakthrough new direct writing technology to meet the objectives set-forth in the NASA SBIR topic S2.06 Advanced Flexible Electronics.  This technology is based on revolutionary advances to modern day thermal spray materials processing enables deposition of wide range of electronic materials onto large areas at low processing temperatures and, for most part, requires no post-processing.  The Phase I effort focused on demonstrating proof-of-concept to deposit conducting microstrip lines and sensors on flexible substrates.  The Phase II program will be focused exclusively on developing a Direct-Write-Thermal-Spray based large-area patterning capability that is based on roll-to-roll processing to fabricate large-area antennas on flexible substrates, focusing, in particular, on JPL's L-band membrane-based active phased array radar.","The development of a large area, flexible phased array antenna will provide enhanced capabilities for NASA's Earth science remote sensing applications and future missions to the Moon, Mars, Titan and Venus.  Electronically steerable L-band antennas will enable detection of surface and subsurface topology and the increased aperture will enable repeat-pass interfermetric Synthetic Aperture Radar missions to be conducted at higher altitudes.  Antenna fabrication on flexible membrane structures is critical to reduce mass, launch vehicle stowage volume, and overall cost in comparison to rigid radar systems.  A variety of potential applications may result from this technology, if developed to fruition.  Applications include: space-based radar systems, unfurlable antennas to minimize volume on space flights, very large area antennas (10?100+ m2) for long-distance and low-signal detection, conformal antennas on space craft and space structures, rectifying antennas (rectennas) for microwave power transmission, power harvesting and sensors, and harsh environment (space) sensors.","Applications for flexible electronics have wide-spread appeal within the Department of Defense and consumer electronics industry.

Phase 1 demonstrated the capability to robustly model uncertainty during early design.  Phase 2 will build on the Phase 1 work by 1) Implementing the PBA technology in Excel-mediated computing tools, 2) Fashioning an interface for these tools that enables fast and robust elicitation of expert knowledge, 3) Initiating the development of a library of such elicitations, 4) Demonstrating the application of the tools, interface and library in an interactive, distributed-computing environment, 5) Developing case studies, and 6) Creating tutorial documentation.  Important applications of these new tools include the ability to rapidly and rigorously explore uncertainty regarding alternate designs, determine risk-based margins that are robust to surprise, and incorporate qualitatively described risks in quantitative analyses.  This suite of capabilities is not currently available to systems engineers and cannot be provided by more traditional probabilistic risk assessment methods.","The primary application envisioned for the extended PBA technology at NASA is the analysis of uncertainty and risk in subsystem, system, and mission design in an Integrated Concurrent Engineering environment like the IDC at LaRC.

The key innovation, which was used for creation of these gratings, is based on patented technology of production of high efficiency volume diffractive elements in photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass on which OptiGrate has an exclusive license from the University of Central Florida. The significance of the innovation is that volume diffractive gratings in PTR glass have diffraction efficiency more than 95% and resolving power up to 20,000 in spectral range from 400 to 2700 nm. These gratings have 25 mm-long standard aperture with possibility to increase it up to 50 mm with the spectral resolution less than 50 pm. This, to the best of our knowledge, exceeds parameters of all comparable gratings worldwide. Moreover, as a result of Phase I project performance, a combination of high resolution Bragg grating with Fabri-Perot etalon provides additional increasing of spectral selectivity and enables the further increasing of spectral resolution power. This approach will be used for development of narrow band filters for detection of O2 (766 nm), H2O (935 nm), CO2 (1571 nm) and CH4 (1650 nm) with spectral width well below 1 nm (100 ? 200 pm), aperture 25 mm, throughput exceeding 90% in both reflecting and transmitting geometries. An additional task in Phase II would be a development of a scanning technology within a narrow line about 100 pm with resolution in the range from 1 to 10 pm. Aperture 25 mm, selected radiation should be focused to a photoreceiver of about 200 um.","Besides the direct goal of the development of High Resolving Power Volume Diffractive Gratings for 400-2700 nm Spectral Range in PTR glass, Phase II of this project will emphasize commercial potential of diffractive optical elements recorded in PTR glass. Potential NASA commercial applications are in the fields of high-resolution spectroscopy, narrow-band filtering for detection of different chemical agents, spectral scanning with sub-Angstrom resolution, remote sensing and targeting, range finding, spectral sensing and other NASA based applications where diffractive optical components are the key elements. In general words, those narrow-band holographic elements will provide dramatic increase of signal-to-noise ratio for almost any types of transmitters and receivers which work in visible and near IR spectral regions. Moreover, such devises will enable a breakthrough in multiplexing/demultiplexing processing for dense multichannel systems of optical communication and monitoring.","The main area of interest of DoD government agencies and private laser and semiconductor companies is focused on spectrally and angularly controlled diffractive beam deflectors, beam steering elements, mode selectors, incoherent and coherent beam combiners for both solid-state and semiconductor lasers, adjustable attenuators and beam splitters for laser beams. It is clear that the range of PTR technology applications is significantly wider that those mentioned above. OptiGrate is committed to develop these various applications and successfully bringing them to the commercial markets in a cost effective manner. It is important that wide applications of PTR Bragg gratings with high spectral resolution power and their combination with Fabry-Perot etalons will dramatically decrease their manufacturing cost and make their application more feasible.","Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Biochemical; Ceramics; Composites; Control Instrumentation; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; High-Energy; Large Antennas and Telescopes; Laser; Mission Training; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Power Management and Distribution; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Testing Requirements and Architectures"

Properties of gratings are determined by available fabrication means ? which have not changed substantially in 50 years.  Modern photolithography, now approaching nanometer resolution, may revolutionize the way many gratings are made and, through greater design flexibility, how gratings function. Over 1011 pixels, each smaller than 100 nm and collectively spanning areas of multiple centimeters, can be addressed individually with nanometer-scale absolute positioning accuracy by modern lithographic tools, thereby making it possible to create gratings with virtually any desired line curvature, variable line spacing, length and thickness ? features largely beyond traditional fabrication means.  LightSmyth Technologies proposes to leverage these state-of-the-art photolithographic patterning tools to design flat imaging gratings that combine dispersive grating function with one- and two-dimensional focusing.  Importantly, diffractive, aka holographic, focusing may have substantially lower aberration in low f-number or high incidence angle configurations.  Line spacing and curvature do the focusing. This design and fabrication strategy will be applied to the development of gratings for NASA's NEXUS effort and other advanced grating products of value to NASA and the commercial markets ? all of which leverage on the innovative fabrication platform LightSmyth brings to the diffractive market.","The proposed technology represents an innovative approach to creating aberration-corrected imaging gratings on flat substrates, as well as variable line spacing gratings with arbitrary line spacings and curvature. The Phase 2 effort aims at developing diffraction grating for the NEXUS spectrometer based on this approach, which are expected to provide superior performance and lower cost compared to traditionally fabricated mechanically-ruled curved-substrate gratings. The developed technology will be applicable to a wide range of NASA projects, and is expected to uniquely address the grating requirements of the Constellation-X project, EUNIS (Extreme Ultraviolet Normal-Incidence Spectrometer) of GSFC, RAISE (Rapid Acquisition Imaging Spectrograph Experiment) of the Southwest Research Institute and SUMI (Solar Ultraviolet Magnetograph Investigation) of Marshall Space Flight Center by replacing traditional holographically and mechanically ruled gratings with the proposed computer-generated lithographically-fabricated diffraction gratings. After additional development, the technology will also yield gratings for visible and infrared spectroscopy for other NASA projects.","The compact aberration-corrected imaging diffractive elements to be derived from the present effort form the basis of spectrometers and spectrographs for the UV, visible and IR ranges.

Non-MEMS DMs meet some NASA requirements, but require high actuation voltages, have low actuator densities, and do not scale readily beyond a few thousand actuators. MEMS DMs offer natural scalability, but do not yet meet the stringent precision and stability requirements for space telescopes.  Prior to this Phase I work, very few researchers have focused on extremely precise characterization of MEMS DMs.  Technical advances achieved in this Phase I improved open-loop positioning accuracy from nearly 100 nm rms to an impressive 8 nm rms. Stability measurements showed performance as good as 0.21-1.17 nm rms in an uncontrolled open-access laboratory over a 15-minute span. Including high-frequency noise sources not captured by Phase I optical measurement techniques but known to be present on the DM segments, this rises to 5.6 nm rms. Noise source analysis conducted in Phase I shows that stability to <0.2 nm rms is feasible. Phase II will implement the improvements necessary to attain <0.3 nm rms stability and resolution. These improvements include: 1) reducing known noise and drift sources identified in Phase I and tracking remaining measured but unknown noise sources; 2) increasing resolution to 0.14 nm rms through enhancements in drive electronics initiated in Phase I and optimizing the DM design to utilize the full dynamic range of the electronics; 3) improving optical quality of the Iris AO DM segments to 1-3 nm rms;  4) testing resolution and stability of the prototypes; 5) expanding reliability testing that started in Phase I and 6) investigate the effects of operating in vacuum.","The Iris AO precision deformable mirror (DM) and adaptive optics (AO) technology is a key enabling component in a host of future NASA missions.

We propose a next-generation portable, ultra-stable, lightweight and highly versatile light source based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs).  Recent advances in LEDs include higher power, efficiency, and a wider range of wavelengths (from UV to IR).  These advances, coupled with LEDs' inherent suitability for electronic feedback stabilization, make them excellent candidates for more compact and power-efficient calibration sources. During Phase I we showed that we can implement light sources with the desired characteristics, using current technology.  We identified and tested LED devices, measurement and stabilization techniques, and physical configurations.  In Phase II we will build prototypes and implement a program for test and evaluation, and refine the design based on test results.  At the conclusion of Phase II we will be ready to produce and sell a commercial version.","Potential NASA customers include virtually all earth remote sensing missions currently on-orbit and those planned for future launch. These include the EOS project and its established field validation efforts and NPP whose field validation program is being defined.  Specific satellite sensors include SeaWiFS, MODIS Aqua and Terra, and VIIRS. Among terrestrial applications, the extensive AERONET and SolRad-Net networks would also benefit. The approach and technology developed in this project could also potentially be applied to airborne and satellite radiometers for performing on-board self-calibration checks.","All the potential NASA customers have counterparts in other countries.  Examples include field validation related to satellites launched by the European Space Agency, France, Korea, Japan, India and Argentina, and aerosol/flux networks associated with AERONET in Canada, France, Australia and elsewhere. Other US Government agencies with related applications include the Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, National Science Foundation and NOAA. Our innovation would benefit almost any governmental and non-governmental users of field radiometers, for example in agriculture and aquaculture, both for research and for commercial production.",Optical

These nonlinear interactions can cause rapid variations in power as the frequency or input power are tuned, including nulls and power surges that can damage individual components. Today, these problems are mitigated in three ways; i) mechanical tuning or bias adjustments, ii) laborious tweaking of each component in the chain until acceptable system performance is achieved, or iii) reduction of the system bandwidth and/or power specifications to avoid the most dramatic effects. However, each of these ""solutions"" either fundamentally limits the electrical performance of the terahertz source or dramatically reduces the ease-of-use of the system. This proposed effort represents the first systematic study of the complex interactions between cascaded nonlinear multiplier stages, with the goal of developing new multiplier and system designs that will reduce these unwanted effects. The resulting terahertz sources will achieve greater reliability, efficiency, bandwidth, and ease-of-use. In addition the new design rules will greatly reduce system design cycles and enhance manufacturability, thereby reducing costs. The knowledge gained through this research will be used to achieve vastly improved terahertz sources for NASA's atmospheric and radio astronomy missions; as well as a wide range of emerging commercial applications such as imaging systems for security screening and industrial process control.","This research will enable the development of more reliable, powerful and frequency agile terahertz sources for use as local oscillators for terahertz heterodyne receivers. The terahertz frequency band has been described as the most scientifically rich, yet unexplored region of the electromagnetic spectrum; primarily because of the wealth of molecular resonance lines that occur between 100 GHz and 10 THz. These resonances allow scientists to study the chemistry and dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere, molecular clouds in star forming regions and the atmospheres of other planets. NASA leads the world in the use of terahertz technology for the study of atmospheric chemistry and astrophysics from aircraft, balloons and spacecraft. As a specific and important example, according to Dr. Eric Jensen of the NASA Ames ""Clouds are the largest source of uncertainty in computerized global climate models"" and the terahertz frequency band is optimal for studying the effect of clouds on the energy balance in the atmosphere. Several planned and proposed missions will benefit from this research, including the SIRICE instrument to study Earth's atmosphere, atmospheric probes for Venus and Mars, and future radio astronomy missions that will inevitably follow the launch of Herschel. The Phase 2 research will result in the delivery of five highly integrated and reliable multiplier chains that will be useful for local oscillator system development and as breadboard prototypes for the SIRICE mission.","Once a suitable technology base is established the terahertz frequency range will be as useful for scientific, military and commercial applications as the microwave and infrared bands are today. Scientific applications of terahertz technology include chemical spectroscopy, radio astronomy, plasma diagnostics, biomaterial analysis, electron spin resonance, and diagnostic instruments for particle accelerators. Terahertz applications related to national defense include compact range radars, covert communications systems, imaging systems, and chemical, explosive and bioagent scanners. Biomedical researchers envision the use of terahertz imaging and spectroscopy for the real time analysis of skin diseases such as skin cancer and rapid chemical analysis of patient's breath and other biological gases. Potential large-scale commercial applications include portal security imagers and scanners, medical diagnostics for clinical use, last-mile data links, and industrial process control.",Microwave/Submillimeter

Radars for such applications operate in various frequency ranges depending on one or more specific needs extending all the way from UHF to millimeter-wave (MMW) frequencies.  Radars today rely on phased-array antenna for beam forming and beam steering, and, in most cases today, the arrays are built with a large number of transmit-receive (T/R) modules made of amplifiers, phase shifters and duplexing switches.  Microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMIC) technology enables integration of those T/R module functions into a single MMIC chip, which, in turn allows compact implementation of phased array antennas with thousands of radiating elements. A typical T/R module consists of several circuit components that need to be optimized to achieve optimum module level performance.  These components typically include a low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), switch, phase shifter and attenuator. This Phase II program will lead to a development of a 35 GHz T/R MMIC delivering output powers in the transmit path  of 30 dBm with an associated PAE of greater than 40% and at the same time exhibiting a noise figure of less than 2.5 dB in the receive path. While beyond the specific MMIC mentioned, this Phase II SBIR will make significant contributions in MHEMT device characterization and the commercialization of  MHEMT technology.","These T/R MMICs can be used in active microwave sensors such as wetland and river monitoring, and atmospheric radar.","MHEMT technology is a most promising technology for millimeter wave low noise amplifiers, switches, attenuators and power amplifiers and thus the integration of these functions into T/R MMIC modules.

Conventional LHPs usually have one capillary pump (evaporator) to acquire waste heat from a heat source.  Recent efforts have focused the development of LHPs that contain two or more evaporators.  Even though two-evaporator LHPs performed very well, the volume of each compensation chamber (CC) became much larger than that of the single-evaporator counterpart.  The reason was that all but one CC would be liquid-filled during normal operation.  The one that was not liquid-filled had to be large enough to accommodate the system liquid expansion at maximum temperature.  As a result, LHPs with more than 3 evaporators were not feasible for practical applications simply because the CCs became prohibitively large.  In the current research, the CCs of a multiple-evaporator LHP were capillarily-linked.  In other words, the CCs always contained a mixture of liquid and vapor (two-phase), allowing the loop to operate with a much smaller fluid charge.  Consequently the required CC volume was also reduced.","As electronic devices place ever-increasing demands not only on power requirements but also on packaging technology to reduce size and weight.  As a consequence, high performance thermal management technologies, especially high heat flux cooling, have to keep up with the heat dissipation needs.  High power electronics are employed in applications ranging from all electric vehicles to radars (both space-based and terrestrial).  Examples of high power electronics are power converters, switches, motor drives.  In addition, recent advances in laser technology impose a tremendous increase in heat flux requirements of laser diodes.  Unless a high heat flux cooling technology such as the proposed cooling concept becomes available soon, recent advances in power electronics cannot be realized.","The cooling technolgy is also applicable to provide thermal management of the avionics and electronics in military vehicles.

Our innovation is a novel, vacuum-compatible, durable, heat-conduction interface that employs carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays directly anchored on the mating metal surfaces via microwave plasma-enhanced, chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).  By directly anchoring the CNTs to the metal surface, the joint conductance is substantially increased over current TIMs due to the elimination of thermal contact resistance at the metal surface-TIM interface.  During the Phase I project, we demonstrated thermal resistance values of approximately 35 mm2 K/W at a contact pressure of 0.7 MPa in testing at Creare for a direct-deposited, CNT-based, thermal interface on copper substrates. Using this approach, our team partner has demonstrated thermal resistance values as low as 8 mm2 K/W, demonstrating the remarkable potential of this innovation.

In the proposed work, a series of TE devices will be fabricated from solidified NQD films formed from colloidally synthesized NQDs using consolidation and second phase precipitation. The increase of ZT, is dependent on quantum confinement of electrons and holes, as well as the phonon dynamics and transport of the materials. If the size of a semiconductor is smaller than the mean free path of phonons and larger than that of electrons or holes, one can reduce thermal conductivity by boundary scattering without affecting electrical transport. Although charge transport in thermoelectricity is almost monoenergetic (energy levels within a few kT around the Fermi energy), heat transport by phonons is broadband over the Brillouin zone. The significance of the opportunity is the ability to colloidally-manufacture, high performance, conformal, thin film TE materials, free from the lattice and other constraints of MBE growth.","The sensitivity, reliability, linearity, and stability of electrical and optical components are critical to NASA missions and are reliant on proper thermal management. Thermoelectric (TE) coolers can be used to chill spaceborne infrared detectors, and regulate the temperature of computers and other electronic gear; however, the widespread use of TE components is presently limited by their inefficiency and cost. Thus, this research is highly significant to NASA. Proven feasible, this technology can have a significant impact on the thermal control technology for future instruments and NASA space platforms. New thermoelectric materials will make a dramatic difference for NASA's next-generation instruments that demand increased efficiencies and reduced power budgets.

Development undertaken during Phase I resulted in a robust, fully functional set of modules that are capable of processing large volumes of data and allow for accurate crop detection, area estimation, and crop acreage change assessment with minimal user intervention. The prototype algorithms were tested on a range of test sites, sensors, crop types, and crop conditions.

Extremely large spacecraft would be required to provide the aperture sizes and focal lengths that are needed for certain science missions; the size of these spacecraft would prevent them from being launched cost-effectively with existing launch vehicles. However, several satellites functioning together in tight formation can create a synthetic aperture or array that mimics what would be possible with a much larger vehicle.

The NRE cost per hybrid can be as high as $100K per unique design, and the total NRE charge for hybrids in a complete ion or Hall engine PPU could easily exceed $1.5 million dollars. The recurring cost per hybrid is considerable lower than the hybrid design cost. The NRE when amortized over many units becomes more palatable and PPU costs can be made to be acceptably low.

When a short occurs the main supplies are then deactivated. Next an auxiliary power converter is switched into the circuit by mechanical relays. The auxiliary supply, which is capable of producing large currents, cleans the flake through a process of evaporation.

Currently a few power devices based on SiC technology have been demonstrated and commercialized. Therefore, an opportunity exists to develop and demonstrate a SiC power inverter, showing the system-level impacts of using commercially available SiC power devices compared with an Si-based inverter, and addressing the related technical issues/risks of implementing SiC technology. Following a successful demonstration of the concept feasibility in Phase I, Phase II research will fully develop, demonstrate, model, and characterize a three-phase all SiC inverter. The inverter will be constructed through the integration of several supporting technologies including circuit design and device paralleling, high temperature packaging and thermal management, high temperature gate based on SOI technology, and other passive components. In the Phase II, the underlying technical issues that govern the fabrication and performance of this SiC inverter will be addressed, and its technical/economical benefits will be analyzed.  By implementing technology developed, a high-efficiency, compact SiC inverter technology can be anticipated for potential NASA and other applications.","NASA applications will include energy storage, renewable energy, nuclear power, electrical drives. The use of the high temperature packaging and operation of SiC power modules for its power electronics equipment will bring about the benefits of increase in power density, reduction in heat sink requirements (thus smaller size and mass), and higher frequency operation that also results in lower mass for the filters and transformers. In addition, the capabilities of handling higher voltage and current requirements yet with smaller die sizes is also appealing to reduce NASA's missions operation and launch costs. This high temperature, radiation hardened SiC-based power conversion system will find extensive applications in space explorations for various power management and distributions.","The development, demonstration, and integration of high-performance, lightweight, compact SiC-based inverter will be directly applicable to the military, transportation, energy, aerospace and other commercial sectors for various power management and distribution. Targeted applications include electric drive, distributed energy resources, and energy storages.

Fault Tolerant Electronics Supporting Space Exploration (FTESSE) creates an electronic design paradigm using reprogrammable FPGAs to create swappable Circuit Object Blocks (COBs) ? analogous to software objects ? for the first time enabling redundancy on a micro-scale. The result is an increased tolerance of point failures by several orders of magnitude over traditional approaches. In the FTESSE approach, FPGAs are partitioned into COBs (groups of gates), each performing a specific function. Bad areas can be mapped like the bad sector data on a disk drive, enabling COBs to be placed in areas of working gates to recover system performance. Hardware tested during Phase I verified point failures could be introduced into an example circuit and corrected. As in the Phase I model, circuits to be monitored reside on a Slave FPGA, and a Master FPGA monitors outputs of all COBs, sensing faults and mapping non-working gates on the Slave FPGA. The Master is a rad-hard, triple mode redundancy (TMR) FPGA, but the Slaves need not be, opening the doors to higher performance applications while maintaining high levels of fault tolerance.","Reconfigurability will benefit all missions by providing orders of magnitude more tolerance of point failures in electronic systems, including graceful degradation of electronic systems upon further unexpected damage (e.g., that incurred at launch, those from micrometeorite impacts or high-radiation environments, etc). Examples of electronic systems benefiting from this design approach are radios, flight computers, and other systems demanding the highest reliability. The requirements of moon-base missions and interplanetary travel ? beginning with the Mars exploration missions ? are daunting. Not only are these much longer in duration, thus increasing the likelihood of failure because of operational time alone, there will also be powerful contention over the allocation of resources and inevitable compromises that reduce the availability of spare parts. A self-diagnosing, self-repairing system will go far in insuring the success of these bold ventures.","Current Military systems use various devices to destroy or damage sensitive or valuable equipment if capture is imminent. Another approach would be to use stealth via reconfigurability, effectively cloaking the hardware by reconfiguring it to perform an entirely different function than its military application. Imagine a military radio that, if captured, would simply generate random tones! Other systems benefiting include today's aircraft, which depend on high-reliability fly-by-wire systems. Critical infrastructure systems such as power plants, electrical transmission and distribution systems, financial networks and homeland security-related systems depend on 100% availability of electronic systems. Life support electronics systems are vital in our hospitals' operating rooms. Inaccessible systems, difficult to reach to perform service, may have financial motives to adopt a reliable system; and in case of failures, they can report so that repairs to a diminished but still functional system can be scheduled for repair at the most convenient time.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Highly-Reconfigurable; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Suits"

Existing data transfer systems based on passive backplanes are slow, power hungry, hardly reconfigurable, and feature high latency, limited expandability, and low radiation tolerance. During Phase I, our company has proven in computer simulations the basic concept of a radiation tolerant switching fabric backplane with reconfigurable serial interfaces. During Phase II, the company proposes to develop a functional prototype of a novel, radiation-tolerant, switching fabric with user-programmable interfaces that support either Space Wire or the company's proprietary multi-level interconnect solution. The patent-pending multi-level interconnect technique provides improved serial point-to-point link functionality including lower latency, higher speed and lower power consumption. It eliminates the requirement of the second information channel utilized in Space Wire's data-strobe encoding scheme, which can be instead used as a redundant channel to improve the system's fault tolerance. The unprecedented reliability of the developed system-on-chip is guaranteed by utilization of inherently radiation-tolerant SiGe hetero-junction bipolar transistors in proprietary circuit structures that are specifically hardened to single-event effects.","The successful accomplishment of this project will result in the development of a compact radiation tolerant ASIC or MCM, which will revolutionize intra-spacecraft system development for near-Earth and deep space exploration.

The switching fabric's software-reconfigurable interfaces will not only speed-up the system's design and assembly process, but will open the way for the implementation of a true Plug-and-Play architecture and in-situ hardware adaptation. This is extremely important for the realization of future innovative concepts for space exploration over the next decade.

The microcontroller incorporates asynchronous-to-synchronous and synchronous-to-asynchronous interfaces (wrappers) using an IBM SiGe 5AM process.  The complete asynchronous microcontroller was successfully simulated using temperature calibrated models to -230 ºC.

The approaches include the use of (a) high-efficiency, 3-phase, dc-dc converters to minimize cooling requirements, mass, and parts count and maximize reliability and efficiency, (b) modularized and standardized sub-system design and fabrication techniques to accommodate power output scaling and re-configuration for specific ion thruster designs without the need to re-qualify hardware, and (c) attention to cost and manufacturability issues that will allow the implementation of electric propulsion systems on future NASA missions without the hidden costs of ""hard-to-build"" and ""hard-to-scale"" designs that are currently available.","The primary market for this technology is for space power conversion where low cost power processing is required.

The proposed fuel is a ceramic-ceramic (CerCer) composite of mixed uranium-refractory carbides such as (U, Zr)C or (U, Zr, Nb)C in a matrix of refractory carbides that mostly include transition metal carbides such as ZrC, NbC, TaC, and HfC. Due to its low neutron absorption cross-section, ZrC is the primary refractory carbide of choice. Replacing ZrC with higher temperature refractory carbides such as TaC and HfC could further improves the high temperature performance of CerCer fuels. However, higher neutron absorption cross-section penalty for Ta and Hf could potentially offset the performance enhancement gain. Due to complete containment and encapsulation of mixed uranium carbide in zirconium carbide matrix, the proposed CerCer fuel could be conveniently fabricated to different geometrical shapes such as solid block prismatic, twisted ribbon, pebbles, wafer, or square lattice honeycomb. Considering the operational parameters for the NT/BP systems, it is reasonable to argue that the proposed CerCer fuel concept could set the upper material performance limits while providing more flexibility in the geometrical design of the fuel.","The success of the proposed Phase II research program will result in the development of a new nuclear fuel with optimum performance characteristics for use in NTP and Bimodal Propulsion systems. The main idea behind the development of the uranium-carbide CerCer design is to come up with a fuel that features the highest performance potential in the areas including operational temperature margin, stability in hot hydrogen, retention of fission products, and mechanical properties. The uranium CerCer fuel systems possess fundamental physical and chemical properties well above the state of the art carbon based fuels and cermets. Considering fundamental materials properties as we have known them, the proposed uranium- carbide CerCer uniquely combines all the right properties to make the best and most robust fuel for the NTP and Bimodal Propulsion applications. Potential applications for NASA include the use the new fuel in high power orbital transfer vehicles for movement of commercial assets in space.","The innovative CerCer composite fuel has potential for making a revolutionary and tangible impact on commercial nuclear power operation in the world. All six technology concepts identified in the Generation IV Technology Roadmap are being pursued by the United States and its Gen IV International Forum (GIF) partners would require the development and use of advanced high temperature nuclear fuels to meet program goals.

The CEV application also needs it to withstand typical launch environments.

Full and efficient utilization of NSRL requires the automation of precise sample positioning and sample exchange that is otherwise performed manually at the cost of hours of beam time, compromised biostatistics and risk of personnel.  The device and system will consist of eight sample holders providing an environmentally controlled enclosure.  Samples to be irradiated will be translated into the ion beam, one at a time, within the controlled environment.  Samples to be accommodated include, but are not limited to, cell cultures (multiple containers), small animal (flies, worms, fish) cultures, mice, rats and small samples of shielding or electronic materials.  Operating software will be compatible with that in use at the irradiation venues, specifically NSRL, and will be used to establish environmental control settings, to record environmental conditions, and to control and record the insertion of samples into the ion beam.  Stray doses to samples in waiting will be less than 0.001 of the dose delivered to exposed samples, and measures are included to minimize neutron flux within the sample chamber assembly.  Total and neutron doses will be measured. Three objectives will be met in Phase II research: (1) implementation of user requirements (determined in Phase I) in a final design to be subjected to Critical Design Review (2) construction and testing of a complete sample management system at SHOT, and (3) installing the final prototype product at NSRL and placing it into use for the benefit of the user community.","Potential NASA applications are well-defined in the call for ""Ground Based Heavy Ion Accelerator Research Support Equipment"".  Space radiation health research requires the study of model organisms and cells exposed to high-energy, highly charged (HZE) particle irradiation.  The model radiation beams are available at a small number of venues internationally and specifically at NSRL at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  For the efficient exposure of these specimens, including laboratory rodents, the proposed robotic environmentally controlled sample holders and changers are needed to minimize the exposure of personnel to background radiations in the cave and minimize beam time required per experiment. Improved efficiency and biological statistics will lead to improved reductions of uncertainty in space radiation health.","Potential non-NASA applications include three avenues of commercialization that SHOT intends to implement: (1) About a dozen facilities are in use or planned at which space radiation health research and/or particle radiotherapy research requires the study of model organisms and cells exposed to protons or HZE particle irradiation. SHOT intends to use its sales force to address this need by marketing the proposed innovation in the international particle radiobiology community.  (2) Radiation oncology research groups that use large, expensive hospital radiotherapy equipment constitute a secondary market that may be larger than the primary market.   As in the case of NASA applications, the proposed robotic environmentally controlled sample holders and changers are needed to minimize the exposure of personnel to background radiations and minimize beam time required per experiment. (3) The robotic technology developed for cell culture management will be translated into terrestrial laboratories through strategic corporate partnerships, one of which is currently being negotiated by SHOT.",Biomedical and Life Support

During the Phase I, microwaves were very efficiently coupled to a single-phase flowing water stream using an antenna based microwave sterilization chamber that rapidly heated water to temperatures well above normal autoclave conditions.  Microbial sterilization was demonstrated for single and mixed cultures of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including Bacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic spore former utilized to validate autoclave sterilization.  Novel ultrahigh temperature sterilization processes eliminated chemical sterilization requirements for external connections, and more significantly, inactivated endotoxins, a major MGW purity requirement.  These attributes results in an extremely low ESM, MGW generator that will meet autonomous medical care needs for MGW aboard manned spacecraft, or Lunar and planetary habitations. A fully functional computer controlled prototype capable of producing MGW from NASA potable water without expendables will be developed during the Phase II.  To achieve these objectives, a compact controllable microwave power generator will be mated to an optimized sterilization chamber producing an energy efficient MGW generator without the need for expendables.  Characterization of system performance and ESM will provide the basis for future NASA development decisions.","The NASA application of the advanced microwave based medical grade water system will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future long duration exploration objectives such as a Lunar mission, Lunar base, Mars transit or Mars base.  The primary application will be in support of medical and experimental use of pharmacological preparations, which must be reconstituted on-site.

In the plasma reactor, formation and deposition of solid phase elemental carbon was shown to be far less problematic than for current methods of catalytic methane decomposition in fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors.  This new technology has strong potential for continuous hydrogen production over extended time periods, with minimal maintenance and operator intervention.  Microwave plasmas produce extremely high temperatures localized within very small volumes, resulting in low overall power requirements. Microwave plasmas also produce minimal thermal effects on downstream piping and other system components. These features provide the basis for a small, light, and low power method for hydrogen reclamation. By recovering all of the hydrogen which is lost as methane in the Sabatier reactor, the requirement for production or resupply of hydrogen is reduced to the absolute minimum.","The NASA application of this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future long duration exploration objectives such as a Space Station retrofit, Lunar Outpost, Mars transit or Mars base.

The concept of a 'Hydrogen Economy' has been widely recognized as an excellent means to combat global warming induced by the atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide.  In the Hydrogen Economy, clean-burning H2 is substituted for CO2 generating fossil fuels (petroleum and coal). However, the ability to do so is entirely contingent upon the development of economical means for hydrogen production and storage.

Any such technology demonstrated on the moon will then be ready to support the transport of humans to Mars and their eventual surface exploration efforts.  Paragon Space Development Corporation is proposing an innovative, efficient and practical concept that utilizes Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) for the next generation electrolysis/Sabatier subsystem to enable 100% oxygen regenerative air revitalization systems (ARS). The concept is innovative because it safely eliminates handling of hydrogen, works irrespective of gravity and pressure environments with no moving parts and no multi-phase flows, and requires no expendables while being compact with minimal impact on mass.  This innovation is directly relevant and essential to our current mandate set by the President to return humans to the moon and in doing so develop technologies that will enable our exploration of Mars.The significance of the proposed Phase 2 SOE development effort is that it offers the very real possibility that life support systems could close the oxygen loop such that oxygen supporting consumables required to produce oxygen need not continually be delivered from Earth.","SOE technology can use lunar or Martian resources to produce oxygen for propellant or life support consumables (needed in the event of leaks or airlock losses).  SOE to produce oxygen from the Martian CO2 atmosphere is an obvious and easily employed technology choice.  Subsequently, SOE can be miniaturized for Martian Portable Life Support Systems where an astronaut can ""breathe"" the CO2 atmosphere through the SOE device.  On the moon, SOE can be used to extract oxygen from conveniently either CO2 or H2O, byproducts of different lunar regolith reduction processes.  Thus, SOE development will have a large impact on NASA's missions.","Stand-alone SOE oxygen regeneration systems, like those proposed for an extraterrestrial base, could be placed in underwater research facilities, submarines, high altitude flying crafts or emergency bunkers in the event of terrorist attacks.  Hazardous material handlers, rescue personnel or other professionals performing in extreme environments (i.e., EPA, DOD, Homeland Security, Mine Safety and Health Administration) would benefit greatly from a self-contained oxygen supply system that requires no supply of consumables.

Optimized fiber batteries will be integrated into prototypes relevant to anticipated NASA missions. Successful completion of the Phase II will lead to an engineering demonstration unit that powers a distributed sensor under conditions that are compatible with anticipated missions. Additional integrated power pack designs such as composites based on fiber batteries will be also evaluated. The lessons learned in this effort will establish guidelines for effective development and transition of future generations of MFF into EVA systems and other applications.,"NASA's mission demands systems that provide advanced functions within extremely small volumes and with very little mass. This is the nature of space flight in general, and is especially true for EVA systems where everything required to sustain and protect an astronaut and to enable productive work in challenging space environments must be combined in an easily-stored, multiple-use, man-portable assembly. The challenge has been intensified by the Vision for Space Exploration's commitment to human missions to Mars which will demand drastic reductions in the mass of EVA systems and in their demand for expendable resupply materials.MFF offer an attractive path to meeting this challenge in several ways. By making structural fibers functional, they offer the opportunity to combine functional components and the structures that enclose, and support them, making the mass do double duty. In addition, they allow the creation of flexible functional components making them easier to integrate and store within tight system and vehicle constraints. Although the demand for and relevance of MFF are immediately evident in EVA applications, they offer similar benefits in many other space systems as well. Their potential flexibility makes them an especially attractive means of adding function to systems like the inflatable antennas, habitats, rovers, etc. considered in many advanced mission concepts.","The desire to create clothing that increases the user's ability to interact with the environment without sacrificing comfort, style, or functionality also has many applications in commercial markets. The growth of wearable electronics for health monitoring, communications, or entertainment functions also require power and comfort control that could benefit from the proposed technologies. One can imagine similar integration of functions for military markets where MFF are integrated into tents, micro air vehicles, high altitude air ships, tactical satellites and other remote sites that require power for communications and data management.",Composites; Energy Storage; Manned-Manuvering Units; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Portable Life Support; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Suits; Wireless Distribution

ADA has subcontracted Colorado School of Mines (CSM) to provide expertise in fire scenarios in NASA's spacecraft; Spraying Systems for their expertise nozzle development, optimization, testing, and commercial manufacturing; and Pacific Scientific HTL Kin-Tech Division as a commercialization partner with expertise in flight qualified hardware.  This team will work to develop the FWM fire extinguisher which was proven to extinguish fires in phase I.FWM is a proven fire suppression technology with the ability to extinguish large fuel fed fires, as well as, small electrical fires. Unlike sprinkler water systems it does not damage structures, and unlike CO2 or Halon fire extinguishers it has only inert chemicals water and nitrogen, so it is not a health hazard, environmental hazard and easily scrubbed from the air with dehumidifiers when used in spacecraft. This new extinguisher's innovative design has the capability to discharge in any orientation, and has been dubbed the Universal Discharge Orientation System (UDOS). During Phase I the UDOS system was capable of extinguishing fires in both normal vertical positions as well as upside down.  During the Phase II efforts the system will be evaluated to extinguish fires in any 360 degree orientation. The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a FWM fire extinguisher which can be commercially manufactured and is capable of extinguishing both large open fires and enclosed electrical fires with minimal water usage.","On a per-unit-mass basis, water is as effective as Halon 1301, the agent currently used in the Space Shuttle. In addition, water is more effective for surface and deep-seated fires than CO2, the agent selected for the ISS fire-extinguishing systems. [Wickham, R.]. The UDOS concept features nitrogen as the pressurant gas to deliver water and to assist in the atomization process. Since both fluids are available on board spacecraft, the system can be recharged during the mission, so that a discharge event does not require cancellation of the spaceflight. Water is also non-toxic, non-corrosive, readily available in spacecraft for multiple uses, and can be recycled. The current fire suppression technologies are toxic for the environment (Halon) or for human breathing (TVL=5000 ppm CO2). Both of these suppressants require extra equipment to scrub the chemicals from the air. Agent cleanup for nitrogen and water may be achieved with dehumidifiers in the ventilation system.","This unique technology has the capability to protect any system from fire that has limited space requirements, limited supply of water, low weight requirements, sensitive equipment or artifacts, necessity for minimal site or area disturbance, and restrictions on use of chemicals. The Phase I work and related investigations have identified potential non-space applications including : defense and space applications, museums, military vehicles, storage lockers, passenger ships, civil aircraft, machinery spaces and turbine enclosures, recreational boating and offshore drilling applications, heritage/historical sites, hotels, restaurants, computer rooms, and electronic equipment areas, underground subway systems and tunnels, residential homes, hospital and healthcare environments, and trains and buses. ADA Technologies is exploring the first three options through research contracts with the Air Force to suppress oxidizer fires on specialized aircraft, discussions with the Smithsonian regarding protection for delicate structures, and discussions with the US army regarding protection for vehicles during combat missions. We estimate a total market size on the order of tens of thousands of units, which could have a dollar value in the range of 8 to 9 figures.

In Phase II POC will advance/optimize AIVNC components to build a fully functional AIVNC prototype to reduce CQ noise by >30 dB, satisfying NC 40 requirements for NASA crew quarters.","As an effective means of controlling structural/acoustic noise, POC's AIVNC adaptive active control technology will have many NASA space applications in addition to habitat noise suppression.  The AIVNC system can be incorporated, for example, into acquisition, targeting, and pointing stabilizers to reduce structural and acoustic noise/vibration, including aerodynamic noise such as future civil tiltrotor noise, both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft noise for UAVs, space-based mirrors, high-altitude balloon experiments, and advanced high-energy lasers.","Our AIVNC technology can address a wide range of large, exceptionally rich, and diverse markets in the aerospace industry, including cancellation of cabin and cockpit noise and fuselage vibration.  Because of its flexibility and adaptability, an intelligent active control system based on AIVNC technology can be implemented into any noise or vibration controllers.  It will suppress aeroacoustic noise in civil aircraft and exterior noise during takeoff and landing, and reduce fan discharge noise propagation.",Airframe; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Controls-Structures Interaction (CSI); Multifunctional/Smart Materials; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Pilot Support Systems

This proposal concerns a technology to simultaneously reduce the microbial count (MC) and total organic carbon (TOC) content of biological water processor (BWP) effluent. This technology is based on an advanced oxidation process using an on-demand oxidizer generator, which does not require consumable chemicals. Phase I feasibility studies successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for the reduction of both TOC and MC of the BWP processed water. Independent evaluation of the technology at a well known technological university successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the process for minimizing the RO membrane fouling. The residual disinfectant and reduced TOC in the treated effluent minimize fouling the RO membrane and water lines. In addition, reduced TOC lowers the load on equipment downstream to the BWP, enabling a reduction in the equivalent system mass. In the Phase II project, a prototype will be fabricated and evaluated for its ability to reduce TOC, MC and extend RO membrane life in a technological university having a small scale water reclamation system similar to that at NASA-JSC. The GEN I unit developed will be delivered to NASA-JSC.","One of the highest priorities of a regenerative life support system is to recover and process spacecraft wastewater to provide clean water, which is essential for the crew well being. The proposed compact TOC and MC reduction module can be integrated into the water reclamation systems on board the International Space Station, spacecrafts, and future planetary and lunar habitats, to make water reclamation  more effective. Lynntech's technology will lower secondary processing system (SPS) load and biofouling of various surfaces in contact with the residual oxidant remaining with the waste water treated using the TOC and MC reduction module, enable scaled down SPS size, increase RO membrane lifetimes, reduce SPS consumables, and lower the equivalent system mass. In addition to treating bioreactor effluent, hydrogen peroxide generated in-situ can be used for a variety of disinfection applications within spacecraft, space stations and future planetary habitats. Other NASA applications include providing a portion of the processed water from the TOC reduction module (containing minerals and residual nutrients while microorganisms are controlled by residual H2O2) to hydroponic crop systems for improved food self-sufficiency in future planetary or lunar habitats. A third application is for production of disinfecting water for surfaces within the other extra terrestrial environment.","Non-NASA commercial applications include incorporation into water treatment and supply plants, portable field water treatment units for use during camping, hiking, fishing and outdoor activities, and in-home water treatment units.  The proposed system can be used in a range of wastewater treatment applications. These include the destruction of organic contaminants in wastewater from: textile industry, tanneries, municipal water treatment plants, chemical processing industries, pesticides manufacturers, and any other industry that uses organic chemicals that require disposal. Another important market segment is as a point-of-use (POU) application for water treatment in the residential, commercial, and medical sectors, where Lynntech's device will provide comprehensive protection against disinfection byproducts (DBPs, organic material partially oxidized and chlorinated by a chlorine-based oxidation) and disease causing microorganisms. A third market segment for this technology is in the production of pyrogen-free water in the medical industry for use in hemodialysis units, irrigation of operating rooms, pharmaceutical industry (intravenous drug delivery), and hydroponics industry.",Waste Processing and Reclamation

Commercial silicone coatings with improved mechanical, thermal and physical gas barrier properties are needed for a broad range of space, military, and commercial applications.  The phase I program has demonstrated that addition of small amounts of nanostructured additives enhances tear strength, tensile strength, and hardness without significantly degrading other important properties, thermal stability, puncture resistance and air permeability of commercial silicone coatings.  It was also shown that properties of coatings are strongly correlated with the chemistry and composition of nanostructured additives. The significance of the Phase I innovation is that commercially used coating formulations were utilized as the starting material, making it easier to be adopted in practice. Success in Phase I has enabled us to put together a strong Phase II team, composed of commercial silicone coating applicators, an airbag assembly developer, and a large supplier of silicone coating formulation. The focus of the Phase II program will be to develop nanostructured additives for several different types of commercial silicone coatings to meet their specific application needs.  Additionally, nanostructured additive technology will be scaled up, and prototype airbags will be fabricated.","While silicone coatings are used in a variety of space applications, we have focused on the Airbag application because of the impending need for new airbags for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).  The airbags will be made of coated fabrics, and NEI's nanostructured additive will enable a stronger and more tear resistant coating on the fabrics, thereby allowing the use of lighter and thinner fabrics and coatings.  In addition to airbag applications, inflatable fabrics for escape ramps, habitats, and lightweight structural components would benefit from NEI's nanostructured additive.","By the addition of small amounts of NEI's engineered nanostructured additives, improvements in relevant mechanical properties of commercial silicone coatings can be substantially improved.

The new technology offers diverse capacity to design, manufacture, and self-assemble periodically folded sheet material.  The range of materials includes many customized core materials for laminated panels, cellular habitat walls, structural beams, parabolic reflectors, and efficient truss systems that can be packaged ideally as a roll of sheet material and deployed in space by inflation or passive radiation.  The algebraic linkage conditions on the deployment of a folded structure forms an over-constrained system of equations.  The deployment kinetics are only possible due to engineered relationships between the neighboring facet geometry, and globally requires a uniform angular change in fold extension across the pattern.  This implies that fixing an individual fold angle fixes all of the fold angles in its neighboring region.  If the fold angles are all made rigid, then the entire structure is highly over-constrained and forms a very robust truss system.  The goal is to introduce the technology by demonstrating the diversity of folding architectures that can be directly applied to deployable space structures, and by developing the associated design and simulation software to transfer this know-how to the engineering community.","The proposed research will explore a comprehensive list of potential applications for this innovative materials technology including deployable structures, habitats and in situ manufacturing.  This technique will permit the merger of the deployable structure with the surface covering that has been folded to reduce its storage volume.  Essentially, the structural frame and the skin become one and the same.  Folded materials can be integrated into space structures as rigid panels, box beams, I-beams, large rings, large cylinders, and large tori.  The key logistical advantages include structures that transport in a compact, low volume configuration; assemblies that self-deploy; and elements that can be easily manufactured in space.  Deployment strategies can be designed and controlled through the manipulations of the mathematical algorithms that describe the folding patterns.  Other applications include stretchable fabrics, self-assembling nano-devices, self-correcting parabolic dishes, and self-healing multi-laminate flexible cloth for space suits.","Kraft paper cores based on these folding techniques could yield a superior product to corrugated cardboard.  Multi-layer paper blocks could replace Styrofoam for use in space-filling and shock absorbing.  For aerospace, the folded materials could improve upon existing honeycomb cores which are used throughout any aircraft in the floors and airframe.  In the civil infrastructure, doubly periodic folded steel sheets are stronger than comparable corrugated structures, and will significantly improve concrete floors.  For aging bridges, the deteriorating concrete decks will be replaced by lightweight composite structures.  For the transportation industry, aluminum or steel folded tessellations in flat laminated panels could be used for high strength but lightweight truck beds or automobile floors, to give resilient strength to the frame while also serving to dampen the overall vehicle vibrations.

We propose to develop an e-beam source to meet the restrictive cost, weight and reliability requirements attendant to commercial passenger aircraft and manned space exploration.  The key to this transition is to replace the thermionic cathode electron emitter with a carbon nanotube (CNT) field emission cathode. During Phase 1 we completed a design of an e-beam system suitable for maintaining air purity for an enclosed four men space station.  The system is compact, light weight and will fit readily in line with an air conditioning duct.  In Phase II, we will detail the design, and build a prototype of the e-beam system. That e-beam source can also be use for decontaminating small widely distributed pollution sources, such as small paint shops, gas stations, and restaurants.","E-beam technology is highly effective in both purification and sterilization.  A CNT cold cathode based electron beam system would be particular suitable for space applications because it is rugged, light weighted and compact in size, in comparison with a thermionic e-beam system.  Direct NASA applications includes: a) purifying air in lunar and planetary exploration bases, orbiting space stations and long duration space missions; b) eliminating toxic products from, or, enhancing chemical reactions in space based manufacturing; and c) sterilization of material to be returned to earth or taken to space from earth. The e-beam requires only electricity that is available from either solar or nuclear batteries that are available power sources in space.

And, following further development, the IFF will be able to replace conventional PEMFC systems in satisfying the special requirements of transportation applications, including passenger cars (50 kW and up).",Energy Storage; Power Management and Distribution; Renewable Energy; Wireless Distribution

The sprayable insulation based on aerogel forms an aerodynamically smooth, uniform coating with better cohesion and lower thermal conductivity.  Aerogel sprayed insulation has shown in Phase I better thermal performance than polyurethane spray-on foam insulation at similar or lower areal densities. Application of thinner layers of insulation combined with greater material resistance to cracking and debonding will eliminate the generation of in-flight debris. Minimization of volatile gas blowing agents and organic components will reduce gas expansion through intracellular pressures and reduces the risk posed by shedding events during ascent.  The proposed sprayable insulation can render future space transportation systems safer and more reliable.  Addressing lower temperature requirements of the thermal protection system, lightweight hybrid aerogel sprayable compositions will be developed. Hybrid aerogels with various dopants will be synthesized for better compatibility with the binders or organic foams.  For the most stringent thermal and mechanical loads silica aerogel? silica foams will be developed as sprayable insulation.","STICT would replace some of the spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) products used on launch vehicles employing cryogenic propellants.  In this application, it would exhibit higher thermal performance and mechanical durability than competing systems.  Most importantly, it would minimize in-flight debris shedding, thereby improving the safety and reliability of US space transportation.  The sprayable insulation can also be sprayed onto cryogenic feeding pipelines, elbows or other systems necessitating thermal protection and are difficult to insulate otherwise.","In addition to benefiting the NASA space flight program STICT will fill application needs in commercial markets. STICT will compete against polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams.  Subsea oil and gas pipelines, fuel cell systems, and LNG transport ships will benefit from adopting STICT insulation.  The foamed plastic industry is the fastest growth potential area for insulative materials.  This market is carried by the non-residential construction market (nearly 50%), followed by miscellaneous applications, residential construction, and industrial and HVAC equipment.  The industry is experiencing growth in advanced technology application, such as Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) and Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs).  Although these markets are relatively small, they are experiencing rapid growth from their small initial base.",Thermal Insulating Materials

Phase I of this effort (NASA contract #NNM06AA56C) demonstrated a significant reduction in structural performance following exposure to various combinations of the aforementioned environments. This reduction in structural performance would seriously compromise the structural performance of any composite structure to be utilized in deep space applications. The data proposed in this effort would be extremely useful to NASA in what might be used in the upcoming CEV andCONSTELLATION missions.The aerospace and the commercial communities have shown significant interest in using filament wound COPVs for cryogenic applications. In addition there is serious consideration for using COPVs in deep space exploration which would sustain significant radiation exposure and possible impact damage. Constituent raw materials and existing COPV designs have not been characterized for the coupled effects of these applications and as such the safety margins for these applications are undefined. Therefore, the reliability of such usage is unknown.","NASA applications for the research proposed herein would include the following:? Cost efficient cryogenic storage vessels.

J-MSC assertions are a UML-based system-level formal specification language. In phase-I we demonstrated J-MSC assertion and distributed assertion specification and monitoring. In phase-II we will construct an editor, code-generator, and run-time monitor for J-MSC assertions and for distributed assertions. 2.

RV of J-MSC assertions for system verification combined with statechart-assertions for the component level. ? RV of distributed assertions.? System-level  white-box ATG of UML controller models and assertions: white-box ATG for a plurality controller modules and for a plurality of controller instances.?

On the other hand, existing tools and techniques for robust and scalable software verification are primarily component-level. In fact, the prevailing NASA organizational approach separates Matlab modeling from embedded-software development and verification, with separate teams working on those respective issues. Robust system-level verification that is also combined with Matlab environment data will provide significant improvement to the level of NASA's system and software safety in two respects: (i) raising the level of specification and verification from the component-level to the verification-level, and (ii) real-life Matlab environment models created by the Matlab modeling team will be usable in conjunction with robust formal methods for the verification of embedded software.","Time Rover's component-level, UML-based, modeling, specification, RV, and WBATG, are already commercially successful.

It addresses the difficulty of communicating highly technical information among specialized engineering groups so that the concept of operations illustrated by the storyboard accommodates the consideration of context of use, user task performance, and effective application of new technologies.  This difficulty is especially pronounced when the user's tasks are unusual (space operations) and the technology to support the task is novel (autonomous software with which humans interact and monitor).  Communication is enhanced by focusing on the common language of storyboard sketches and related categories of information describing them.  The storyboard tool will help authors manage versions of storyboards to track alternate approaches for human task support and to maintain libraries of storyboards from previous systems.  After assisting with the creation of storyboards and refining them in concurrent engineering sessions, the tool will assist in translating the storyboard information into data forms importable by analysis tools used by NASA systems engineers.","Since most new NASA systems can benefit from storyboards and prototypes, the storyboard tool can provide valuable assistance to a large number of NASA system acquisition projects.  Particular attention will be paid to Exploration Systems projects because of the principal investigator's association with an ongoing NASA study of tools to support human factors engineering participation in the early systems analysis for Exploration Systems. Consequently, the storyboarding tool should be particularly applicable to Exploration Systems early analysis activities.

ISAPA is innovative in that it is centered on a ""person-in-the-loop"" approach to automation. While ISAPA executes procedures, it asks the user for confirmations, decisions and allows the user to easily override. To increase situational awareness, the aid clearly presents, through notifications and advanced visualizations, what is being performed. The second major innovation is ISAPA's intuitive authoring tool which enables controllers (without programming skills) to build new and modify existing semi-automated procedures using drag-and-drop graphical widgets. As space station construction progresses and procedures change, authoring utilities allow the straightforward updating of procedures. ISAPA also supports gradual procedure automation, allowing flight controllers to migrate a manual procedure towards automation as confidence is gained. The system will integrate with existing mission control center systems, specifically: ""Thin Layer"" for sending commands, ""Information Sharing Protocol"" for receiving telemetry, and use official formats, such as ""PRL"", for persisting procedure data. ISAPA will also include a simulator to assist in the validation process of procedures. During Phase I, Stottler Henke developed a prototype of the ISAPA execution tool, authoring tool and simulation tools while constructing two sample procedures based on real-life controller procedures. During Phase II, Stottler Henke will develop a full ISAPA system ready for integration into the ISS MCC. Special emphasis will be placed on compliance with NASA ground console software certification. ISAPA technologies from the Technology Taxonomy are Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interfaces from the Information section.","The proposed technology will help NASA create and use intelligent job aids that help ground controllers perform ISS complex procedures more quickly, with fewer errors.  As the technology is accepted, ISAPA could be applied to other NASA domains: it can help crews carry out a wide range of procedural tasks such as payload operations; medical operations; and equipment maintenance, diagnosis, and repair.  Its extensible architecture will enable integration of application-specific software to support gradual or immediate procedure automation of diverse tasks.","The proposed technology will also be targeted toward satellite operations, Naval ship operations, maintenance, and damage control and could also be used by corporations to help their employees, customers, suppliers, value-added resellers, and other partner companies carry out procedural tasks such as performing common tasks using software or hardware products or manufacturing equipment; and maintaining, diagnosing and repairing equipment.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Human-Computer Interfaces; Software Development Environments; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

This project established the feasibility of a tapered optical fiber-based sensor (TOFS) that can be fitted into narrow orifices of plumbing junctions to detect the leakage of cryogenic fluids such as hydrogen. Complete reversibility and response/recovery time of less than 30 seconds for the hydrogen sensor were demonstrated in Phase I. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirmed that the sensor suffered no degradation upon soaking in liquid nitrogen (LN2, 77 K). Tests with LH2 will be conducted in Phase II. The underlying sensor technology will support NASA goal of reducing vehicle and payload cost, and increase safety of operations by measuring hydrogen in real-time and in situ.  A prototype device will be engineered, field-tested and delivered to NASA in Phase II establishing technical maturity approaching TRL 6.  InnoSense LLC has received a strong endorsement letter from a major Aerospace company in support of the project. InnoSense LLC has also received Phase III follow-on funding commitment totaling $500,000 from commercialization partners. An engineering team having 80 person-years of cumulative experience in developing commercially viable products has been assembled for this project.","NASA and its contractors will benefit from this project.  Currently, Mass spectrometer (MS) is widely used on and around launch vehicles to detect hazardous gas.  An MS can detect gases with ultrahigh sensitivity, specificity, and speed. MS requires a skilled operator, an air-conditioned room, vibration free environment, and frequent calibrations.  Samples are brought to the instrument creating a time lag for leak detection. During intense solar activity, an MS can experience an ""overload"" condition, leading to a possible malfunction at a critical time. The real time and in situ measurement capabilities of the TOFS system will complement mass spectrometer.  TOFS will also be able to phase out MS for exploratory missions. The entry market for the hydrogen sensor includes the spaceport facilities. Hydrogen is stored and transported in pressure vessels or transmitted by pipeline to the point of end-use. Being a very small molecule, hydrogen is prone to leakage through seals and joints, and even through the pipeline material (hydrogen-induced embrittlement). This leakage creates an explosive atmosphere for concentrations between 4% (v/v) ? the lower explosive limit (LEL) and 74.5% (v/v) ? the upper explosive limit (UEL) at room temperature and pressure. Early detection of hydrogen leakage, therefore, is of extreme importance for reasons of safety, reliability, and economy.","Other applications for downstream market entry include: (a) Stationary fuel cells, (b) Vehicular fuel cells, (c) Portable fuel cells, and (d) Process control industries.  InnoSense LLC recognizes that each application holds potential for successful market entry, and we plan to pursue these markets.  The hydrogen sensor market is still emerging.  The transition from fossil fuel into a hydrogen economy could push the $120,000,000 market today into annual sales as high as $1,800, 000,000 by 2010 for hydrogen safety sensing according to current available estimates.  Hydrogen feed stock sensors, needed to manage gas flow and purity, will further increase the demand for sensors. Consulting the Thomas Register, a business directory, we have identified 119 companies in North America engaged in the production, storage and transportation of hydrogen gas. These companies would be our potential customers for the downstream market. The hydrogen economy represents a growth market, and at present, there is no market leader. New customers and competitors are expected to enter the market constantly. Because TOFS incorporates innovative technology, we expect our market penetration to be slow initially.  Over a five year period, we expect our market share to be 60% overall.","Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Aircraft Engines; Airlocks/Environmental Interfaces; Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Biochemical; Biomolecular Sensors; Ceramics; Chemical; Combustion; Composites; Computational Materials; Control Instrumentation; Cooling; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; Energy Storage; Expert Systems; Feed System Components; Fluid Storage and Handling; Fundamental Propulsion Physics; High Energy Propellents (Recombinant Energy & Metallic Hydrogen); Highly-Reconfigurable; Human-Computer Interfaces; In-situ Resource Utilization; Instrumentation; Launch Assist (Electromagnetic, Hot Gas and Pneumatic); Launch and Flight Vehicle; Microgravity; Mission Training; Mobility; Monopropellants; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Perception/Sensing; Photonics; Photovoltaic Conversion; Pilot Support Systems; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Portable Life Support; Power Management and Distribution; Production; Propellant Storage; Renewable Energy; Reuseable; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Simulation Modeling Environment; Sterilization/Pathogen and Microbial Control; Structural Modeling and Tools; Tankage; Telemetry, Tracking and Control; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures; Tethers; Tools; Waste Processing and Reclamation"

The second innovation is the thruster's capability to operate with both gaseous and liquid propellants.  This innovation enables greater system flexibility that is inherent in the capacity to function over a much wider range of operating conditions. Orion has been approached by several prospective customers concerning affordable, reusable thrusters. In the current commercial market, this does not exist and the commercial sector cannot afford traditional propulsion solutions. For this reason, Orion started developing a thruster that offers the following features:? Provides an affordable solution as compared to what is currently available? Uses a different manned approach since it is reusable? Uses a modular design, which allows for the robust inspection and replacement of parts? Uses green propellants and capitalizes on in situ propellant production? Provides greater system flexibility since it operates with both liquid and gaseous propellantsNot only does the gas/gas operation of the thruster attract companies such as t/Space and Bigleow Aerospace, but its liquid/liquid operation broadens this customer base and makes this design applicable to NASA programs such as the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).","NASA's ambitious Exploration Initiative will demand significant advancements in propulsion technology for both main and reaction control applications.  Our oxygen/methane thruster will provide a significant advancement in the area of RCS technology.  We see this thruster finding applications for a number of exploration missions such as RCS for trans-lunar system architectures, station-keeping, and Mars exploration programs which take advantage of in-situ propellant manufacturing.  This thruster effort will demonstrate advances in multi-phase propellant operation, and improved overall reliability.","While applications for NASA programs are manifold, the potential for Non-NASA applications appears to offer even greater potential. The rapid growth of the nascent commercial space sector will continue to expand in the coming decades. This industry can be even more demanding in terms of technological advancement, and for an even wider range of propulsion applications. Furthermore, the development schedule for commercial applications will be much shorter. For these reasons, we believe that the development of our oxygen/methane thruster will put us in a good position to meet the needs of the commercial sector.

Injector designs are a critical component of robust thrust chamber assembly designs since they impact combustion chamber instability and its transient response.  Inadequate injector designs have been the cause of major failures during engine development of all earlier liquid rocket systems including the SSME; the root cause for this may be attributed to the use of relatively simple empirically based, one-dimensional tools in the design process that are incapable of identifying localized failures driven by three-dimensional geometry and physics effects. The proposed three-dimensional, CFD tool will focus on rigorous modeling of the mixing and combustion processes in cryogenic liquid-gas injectors that operate in the trans-critical and sub-critical regime and exhibit strong non-linear sensitivities to real fluid thermodynamics, as well as turbulent mixing effects.  The advanced models developed will permit improved predictions of combustion chamber mean heat flux and localized peaks, as well as lay the foundation for predicting unsteady response of the injector and its coupling to the feed system dynamics.","The product at the end of our Phase II effort will be a high-fidelity, numerical simulation software (CRUNCH CFDREG code) that would predict the performance of cryogenic liquid-gas injectors, provide design support by supplementing current empirical tools, and facilitate trade studies/ sensitivity analyses of advanced propulsion concepts.  Our product addresses core needs of NASA such as the development of the upper-stage J2-X, and the lunar descent module.  These systems will be required to throttle down to very low-power levels spanning trans-critical and sub-critical regimes where current design tools are unreliable.  The proposed tool would significantly enhance current capabilities and provide accurate simulations of injector performance and heat transfer characteristics in an efficient manner so as to be useful within a design cycle timeline. The technology developed here would directly impact analysis of the injectors used in the J-2X gas generator system as well as the main injector for the TCA.","The commercial market for our product is very large and includes the broad market of injectors for diesel engines, gas turbines and other industrial combustor applications. In addition to these traditional markets, commercial space ventures ranging from space transportation systems (COTS) for the international space station (ISS), to low-cost satellite launch systems are getting an infusion of venture capital and would be receptive to accurate simulation tools. The primary market of the diesel engine is large and includes marine engines, trucks and automobiles, as well as heavy industrial engines. With rising energy costs, a primary concern for these companies is the design of newer more efficient injector systems that provide improved mixing and combustion, and the technology being developed here for high-pressure, regimes would be directly applicable.

This innovative design will meet launch volume constraints and satisfy terminal aerobraking requirements. The approach will focus on transpiration cooling of a flexible material and employs preceramic polymers and active filler technologies as key features of the TPS design. The major hurdle to inflatable aerobrakes becoming reality is the development of a lightweight and structurally flexible TPS. Alternative designs have focused on complex multilayering to increase the effective emissivity of the material, whereas Andrews Space will focus on reducing the thickness, thus decreasing the overall system mass. By combining well understood materials with an innovative, flexible, transpiration cooled TPS, a realizable inflatable aerobrake system has been developed which shows up to 56% mass savings over traditional, rigid aeroshells and 23% over other leading designs.","Once inflatable aerobrake technologies are well-understood and an integrated system flight-tested, such an aerobrake could become the design of choice for further use on Earth and Mars missions,  maintaining the best combination of design margin, usage flexibility, weight, and cost.  Single-use aerobrakes can be used for return of ISS cargo modules to the Earth's surface as well as for crew return.  They can be used for the deceleration of payloads to Mars and other planetary surfaces.  Aerobrakes can also be used for Earth and other planetary orbit capture, with potential multi-use capability in those modes.","Outside of NASA, reliable and capable aerocapture will be needed for commercial cargo return to Earth or for hardware return for refurbishment.  As on-orbit business opportunities grow, so will the need for recovery and return capability. An additional need is for return of end-of-life spacecraft and launch vehicle stages from LEO, allowing reuse of stage or spacecraft hardware.

These models are critical for assessing aerodynamic characteristics including reaction control systems (RCS) influences and for designing thermal protection systems involving both ablating and non-ablating materials.  A hybrid approach unifying continuum CFD and rarefied DSMC flow solvers will be developed that can handle both higher altitude continuum flows, i.e. 60~85km, with embedded rarefied zones such as the base/near-wake region as well as higher altitude rarefied flows with embedded continuum zones such as RCS jet plumes. The proposed model will automatically separate continuum and rarefied regions into distinct computational domains employing a unique methodology demonstrated in Phase I to construct hybrid interface surfaces for complex three-dimensional geometries.  The model will incorporate RCS jet and advanced ablative models and will provide consistent nonequilibrium thermochemical modeling between the CFD and DSMC solutions.  This methodology provides a more efficient and accurate tool than provided by continuum CFD or DSMC alone and provides the flexibility to address a wide range of vehicle and system designs.","The new software to be developed in this program directly supports the design of aeroassist and planetary entry vehicle systems, providing improved accuracy over existing software. As such, it will serve to reduce design costs and produce more reliable designs. Specific NASA programs supported include Constellation which involves a number of LEO and Lunar return missions based on CEV, COTS which provides manned and unmanned service to and from ISS, and New Millenium which involves a number of planetary entry and sample return missions including technology demonstrations. Since the hybrid software builds upon existing DSMC software (DAC) now used by NASA and its contractors, the resultant product will have overall features which should facilitate its widespread usage as ascertained in discussions with key personnel at varied NASA Centers.","The resultant software for analyzing higher altitude problems is of widespread interest to DOD and their contractors, as well as to commercial firms involved in satellite station operation, contamination effects and nano-processes.  We are presently involved in DOD programs where such hybrid technology is of interest for RV discrimination (MDA), for plume/divert jet signature predictions (AF/MDA), and for sensor/seeker window blinding/contamination by divert jets on interceptor missiles at rarefied altitudes (Army).

Fabrication of modular components yields fabrication savings associated with large production volume and automated integration and test.  In-space assembly permits staged deployment on an as-needed, as-afforded basis.  It also decouples stowed launch geometry from deployed operational geometry.  The SWARM concept uses formation flown spacecraft, containing multiple universal docking ports, to dock with modular elements and maneuver them to dock with other, similar elements.  In the process, systems can be assembled that are much larger than what can be fit or folded into a launch vehicle fairing, or what can be launched on a single vehicle.  Furthermore, such modularity will allow jettison of failed components, upgrade of obsolete technology, and amortization of design costs across multiple missions.  In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for a simplified telescope assembly on the flat-floor at MSFC.  In Phase II, we will develop the hardware and software elements necessary to demonstrate, on a flat-floor, the modular assembly and reconfiguration of systems representative of trans-planetary spacecraft and large telescope assembly.","Clearly the prime commercial application for the SWARM system is for modular spacecraft system development within NASA's scope of activity.  The SWARM system is wholly novel in its capabilities and flexibility for multiple operational regimes, including terrestrial laboratory testing, parabolic flight aircraft, and spaceflight, making it a relevant development product for the evaluation of operational strategies and design of modular spacecraft and self-assembling systems capable of on-orbit servicing, maintenance and reconfiguration.","This product would have immediate relevance to developers of intelligent modular spacecraft systems, who could purchase a series of modules to assemble a complete spacecraft bus model or, at a lesser scale, component elements (e.g., docking ports).

By integrating the MSI protocol converter technology with the ABET Technologies Digital Current System, MSI can provide a network with standardized attachment nodes that carries data and power on an Intelligent Power/Data Ring (IPDR).The IPDR network, which can host a variety of data protocols, currently implements a high speed SPA-S (SpaceWire) core to support the AFRL PnP efforts. It enables full PnP modularity reducing spacecraft integration and test to a few days.  Since the system is implemented with a common set of nodes for every interface instead of custom cards in a card cage, the hardware costs are dramatically lower as well, only 40-60% of comparable centralized systems. Using commercial Ethernet parts integrated into the existing IPDR node processor and interface boards successful proof of concept testing was performed during Phase I.  The transfer of Ethernet data frames was demonstrated into the IPDR ring via a peripheral Ethernet device, from one IPDR node to another, and finally back out of the ring to the external Ethernet device. Figure 1 shows the setup of the final node-to-node Ethernet communication test. Although this testing verified the fundamental functionality of Ethernet communication on the IPDR ring avionics, there is significant effort remaining to mature this into a flight worthy avionics architecture .

The only practical source for these materials is the decomposition of lunar regolith. Described herein is an innovative plasma reduction technique for the production of gases and metal powders. This technique is characterized by its high temperatures and rapid quenching. During Phase 1, silicon, iron, and magnesium in crystalline form were produced using the plasma reduction technique.  Based on the analysis of captured gas samples and the fact that metallic species were produced, oxygen was also evolved as a result of plasma processing.  During Phase 2, the plasma techniques developed during Phase 1 will be optimized.  Techniques to separate and collect pure oxygen from the regolith and the processing gases will be developed. Steps will be taken to reduce the power requirements needed for plasma reduction. Additional metals such as aluminum, titanium, and calcium will also be produced by varying processing parameters.  Precise measurement of particle temperature and velocity will be performed and correlated with processing parameters and thermodynamic calculations so that these objectives can be met.","NASA applications for the technology include production of metal powders for in-situ fabrication and oxygen for life support, habitat use, hydroponics, and propulsion.  Applications for the metal powders that will be produced include, but are not limited to, solar cells, photovoltaics, rapid prototyping feedstock, radiation shielding, and structural applications.

The drive has been designed to meet the operating requirements of for an Apollo?class Lunar Rover. A drive geometry optimization study was conducted establishing that a 30-to-1, two-row, four planet multi-roller drive offers the best balance between size, weight, simplicity, motor operating speed and operational life. The drive can function without the use of liquid lubricants and will be able to operate at very cold temperatures and over a wide range of temperatures by using low wear, high friction solid lubricant materials.  Liquid lubricants currently used in gear drives tend to become too viscous to flow at low temperature and too thin to lubricate at high temperatures.  Because these drives use no liquids, ""oil free"" traction drives will not encounter the problems associated with the changing oil viscosities of liquid lubricants which will enable them to operate reliably over a wide range of temperatures.  Also contamination of the lunar soil will not be a problem because there is no liquid to vaporize or leak.","Current drive systems available for space applications use gears with various configurations of ""teeth.""  These gears must be lubricated with oil and must have some sort of a lubricant supply system.  Oil poses problems for drive systems used on planetary surfaces such as; evaporation, freezing, degradation, contamination of and contamination by.  We propose to develop lightweight, oil-free traction drives (roller drives) that will be an enabling technology capable of operating under the extreme conditions found on planetary surfaces and that will provide low energy loss and long operation lives.  These drives will provide an alternative to harmonic drives (the current state of the art drives), which will not be able to be operate at very cold temperatures unless the oil is heated. Traction drives will be able to be used in all types of machinery used on planetary surfaces such as: lunar rovers, construction equipment, processing plants, in a radiation environment, etc.","The smooth torque transfer, zero backlash, compactness and low noise characteristics of traction drives make this innovation potentially applicable for a wide range of commercial devices which require extremely smooth torque transfer, precision, high speeds, or operation in severe environments (e.g. under-seas, extremely cold temperatures, etc.).  The military can utilize them in nuclear submarines, for desert applications or for equipment operating at extremely hot or cold temperatures.  Also, if these drives can be produced more simply by the use of non-metallic materials or lightweight easily machined metals with ceramic coatings, the cost to manufacture these drives will be substantially reduced; thus increasing the potential for their use in commercial applications.

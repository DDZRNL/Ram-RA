Most space missions require the use of specialized--computationally limited--radiation tolerant hardware, which in turn depends upon specialized flight software (FSW). This is as true for robots as it is for the ISS or Gateway. Because of this specialization, FSW has traditionally been developed via “clone-and-own” processes, where software from a previous mission is copied and adapted. This requires time- and money-intensive design changes that are prone to errors. Similarly, it is difficult to parallelize development, or to share components between organizations, despite the fact that many common elements exist across space missions,An alternative approach, increasingly accepted by the space-flight community, suggests that developing and sharing component-based, reusable software will facilitate the number, scope, and innovation of space missions. This will require that complex robot and flight software is developed through the use of a common framework of shared libraries and tools. In the Phase I of this work, TRACLabs and the JHU/APL investigated the role of ROS2 in flight systems and how it might be integrated with NASA’s cFS to leverage the advantages of each. In Phase II, we propose to develop a toolkit of utilities that can help FSW developers to integrate ROS2 into their missions. We call this the BRASH (Bridge for ROS2 Application to Space Hardware) toolkit.

The ELAS Concept provides: JATO-like (Jet Assisted Takeoff) electric-powered boost on takeoff and climb out, descent and landing speed reduction, steeper approach angles, and improved low-speed margins and handling qualities. ELAS can be added to an existing airframe or built into the wings as original equipment. It can even be designed as retractable when not in use. Rather than the EDFs being used to solely add thrust, ELAS also provides a dramatic increase in lift by increasing the speed of the air over the top surface of the wing, a form of upper-surface-blowing.This work is built on earlier successful projects combined with recent advances in distributed electric propulsion. The distributed, small electric ducted fans alter the airflow over the wing in ways not possible with two internal combustion engines (the Custer channel-wing) or multiple large turbines (the Boeing YC-14 and the NASA QSRA).Further, ELAS can provide improved low-speed aircraft control through both the increase in maximum lift and stall angle, and differential power distribution. Command of the power distribution has the potential to reduce loss-of-control (LoC) during critical low-speed periods and provide improved handling qualities during gusts.While there is a big push to develop eVTOL aircraft, ELAS offers a much shorter path to near-eVTOL capability. This claim is supported by the following Phase I findings: 1) A variety of small aircraft equipped with ELAS can takeoff and approach/land with near-helicopter-like profiles. 2) Can be attached to existing aircraft or built into new aircraft: lower acquisition and recurring costs than eVTOL. 3) 50%-100% more range with more payload than comparable eVTOL. 4) next-gen battery technology is not required. 5) Uses Off-The-Shelf hardware.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Potential applications within NASA include humanitarian aid delivery via aircraft requiring STOL capability; development of a low-cost aerial vehicle for exploration and transportation with acquisition and operation costs less than many unpiloted vehicles currently in use; and ELAS applications for advanced off-field capability with piloted, optionally-piloted, and unpiloted CubCrafters aircraft.

The tool will include a Power Balance (PwB) method solver, a full-wave three-dimensional solver, and a multi-conductor transmission line solver. The full-wave solver will include a rigorous mode and a sub grid mode. With the rigorous mode, the entire geometry will be meshed at the same fidelity, which was demonstrated to be feasible during the Phase I contract for fairings measuring 5 meters in diameter by 15 meters long up to 15 GHz. The sub grid mode will provide an option where the user can mesh part of the problem with a finer mesh and the rest of the problem at a coarser mesh. The results from the sub grid region (i.e., the finer mesh region) will drive the larger part of the problem while still capturing reflections from structures located inside the sub grid region. This capability will allow the user to trade off accuracy and run time when so desired. The full-wave solver computational engine will be ported to run on graphical processing units (GPUs). This hardware acceleration will allow for faster solution time and larger problems that can be solved with the full-wave tool. A series of measurements will be performed with a representative rocket fairing structure. Measurements performed will include shielding effectiveness, electric field distributions, antenna-to-antenna coupling, and antenna-to-cable coupling.

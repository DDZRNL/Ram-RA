Consequently, they will need to perform more tasks and a greater diversity of tasks. A critical resource for meeting these challenges is greater reliance on robots that can operate with more autonomously [NASA Roadmap TA4]. Greater robot autonomy will require astronauts to manage remote robots operating concurrently with humans. Such management requires the astronaut to plan the activities of one or more robots, direct the execution of the resulting task sequences, and adapt plans when problems or opportunities occur.TRACLabs and CMU propose to develop software for visualizing and comparing exploration plan alternatives and change effects (xPACE) to help crew adapt robot plans quickly and effectively. This software will compute plan figures of merit that provide insight into the effectiveness and risks of plans. It will provide displays using these figures of merit to compare plans from different perspectives and reveal plan strengths and weaknesses. The software also will support modifying plan parameters to improve figures of merit. This software will be designed for evaluation with NASA technology for building robot plans, specifically the IRG Exploration Ground Data System planning software.The proposed software has relevance to more immediate robotic missions operated remotely by humans, such as the Resource Prospector. It is expected that robot plans for tele-operations also will require adaptation during robot operations in response to discoveries or situational challenges. The xPACE software can improve the remote operator's ability to produce safer, more effective plans when re-planning during operations.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed xPACE software has relevance to both near-term and long-term NASA human-robot missions. Near-term, the human operator will tele-operate the robot from a remote location, as proposed for the Resource Prospector mission. For such missions, xPACE improves the remote operator's ability to quickly produce safer, more effective plans when replanning during operations. Longer term, the crew will manage robots operating more autonomously. Such management requires the human operator to plan the activities of one or more robots, direct the execution of the resulting task sequences, and adapt plans when problems or opportunities arrive. For such missions, xPACE can help crew compare plans from different perspectives to reveal plan strengths and weaknesses. The software also will support modifying plan parameters to improve plan effectiveness and reduce plan risks.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Unmanned Vehicles (UVs; air, ground, and underwater) are used increasingly in military operations. As the number of vehicles and variety of missions increases, planning for the coordination of multiple remote robots becomes more important. TRACLabs is developing the Autonomy Management Platform to integrate autonomous planning technology with PRIDE electronic procedures for coordinating groups of UVs for the Navy. The proposed xPACE software would complement this effort by providing tools to help soldiers understand the effectiveness and risks of the plans produced by automated planners.TRACLabs has a multi-year contract with an upstream oil and gas business to develop electronic procedures for drilling automation, with the goal of commercializing a suite of products for these industries. The proposed xPACE software could be integrated with PRIDE procedures to deliver a new product for building and revising procedures used to automate drilling operations.

With recent advances in computer science technology, turbulent multiphysics modeling and high fidelity algorithms, current applications are poised for coordinated integration into a computational framework that offers realistic simulation of propulsion system fluid dynamics. MSU has recently implemented a hybrid 4th order skew symmetric flux in the Loci/CHEM multiphysics CFD solver. The new scheme has exceptionally low dissipation properties for vortical and acoustic signal propagation on both structured and unstructured meshes and offers excellent potential for analysis of acoustically driven propulsion system combustion instabilities. Simulation of large scale systems, however, is further complicated by the need to model unsteady turbulence effects. MSU has also recently employed the very promising dynamic hybrid RANS/LES methodology with the new low dissipation scheme to demonstrate significantly improved resolution of fine scale unsteady turbulence structures. For highly stretched boundary layer meshes, however, both implicit and explicit time integration schemes are problematic for thin boundary layers. Fortunately, dramatic performance improvements are possible through a novel hybrid explicit-implicit time integration scheme that uses the implicit treatment for fluxes constrained by the explicit stability limit and the explicit scheme elsewhere. Since the explicit method is more than an order of magnitude cheaper than the implicit scheme, the potential speedup could be a factor of ten. Thus the proposed computer science, turbulent multiphysics and high fidelity integrated framework can realistically expect to enable propulsion system DDT&E and production cost reductions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This technology will provide NASA with an efficient, robust multiphysics propulsion modeling and prediction tool that is built on coordinated advances in computer science, multiphysics modeling and high fidelity algorithms. The research product will provide enabling engineering and scientific technologies to model and predict acoustically driven propulsion related flow problems while reducing development, test, evaluation and production costs. Potential enhancements include improved two phase flow combustion models, enhanced droplet/turbulence interaction modeling, variable real fluids transport properties, expanded thermodynamic databases and extended model validation. The proposed computational tool is also applicable to water spray systems for suppression of rocket launch and test stand acoustic energy.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The growing trend toward coupled multiphysics analyses is opening significant new markets as more difficult problems can be addressed using advanced computational techniques.

Our analysis software can also be applied to such varied commercial applications as coal, natural gas and food processing systems.

Suite A, Louisville, KY 40207 - 3436",(270) 331-1116,3,4,"TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (Limit 2000 characters, approximately 200 words) NASA recognizes the importance of conservation, smart utilization and reuse of resources for their deep space missions to address the need for regeneration of air, water and waste with highly reliable systems to reduce mission payload. Additionally, energy for life support and other systems needs to be obtained from renewable energy sources or waste streams. In order to address NASA's requirements of harnessing renewable energy and utilizing waste heat, IOP Technologies and Vanderbilt University propose to design and develop advanced TEC cathodes based on diamond films synthesized on flexible metallic substrates. These cathodes can not only leverage solar energy on Mars by using solar concentrators, but also use wasted thermal energy from other power sources to augment power generation. This technology can provide an efficient way of converting thermal energy into electrical energy. Studies have shown that TEC can approach total energy conversion efficiencies within 90% of the Carnot limit.As part of the proposed efforts in this STTR program, metal foil substrates such Molybdenum will be used to grow diamond thin-films in microwave plasma enhanced CVD (MPECVD) system. Diamond properties such as microstructure, electrical conductivity, quality, grain size and size distribution can be varied by adjusting the MPECVD growth parameters. The selection of diamond as the rugged and efficient emitter material is based on the excellent material properties such as negative electron affinity, low work function (less than 2eV), wide band gap (5.45eV), highest thermal conductivity (~5x that of Cu), highest Young?s modulus (~5x that of 306 stainless steel), inherently radiation hardened, highest breakdown voltage (~10 exp7 V per cm). Preliminary results from IOP research show a maximum output power of ~1mW per sq. cm at less than 100 torr pressure of hydrogen was achieved using a Diamond/Mo TEC Cathode and can be increased to 100mW per sq. cm.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The advanced Diamond TEC cathodes being developed as part of the proposed program can support NASA's goal to harness renewable energy and waste heat for deep space missions, such as that to the Mars. Such a technology can leverage solar energy using solar concentrators and waste heat produced from other systems, and thus creating a more self-sustaining power generation option at remote locations as well as on transportation vehicles.These diamond TEC cathodes are ideally suited for integration with Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) as a power generator. SOFCs consist entirely of solid-state materials, allowing for quiet, vibration-free power production for extended periods of time with little to no maintenance. Unlike low-temperature fuel cells that can be fueled only by pure hydrogen, SOFCs can reform numerous hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas (methane) that is available in abundance on Mars, and due to their high operating temperatures, making it an attractive prospect for NASA. SOFC power generation process is extremely efficient, achieving more than 50% efficiency when converting natural gas to electricity.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Through the combination of our highly promising Thermionic Energy Conversion (TEC) research with existing Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) technology, which has the potential to reliably supply DC power at 1/20th the cost of purchasing from the existing AC electrical grid. It has the flexibility to be fueled by numerous gaseous species (including widely available natural gas), and will produce lower greenhouse gas emissions per kWh than existing large-scale power generation technologies. Such a system will serve the needs of the United States military which often establishes temporary bases in regions lacking reliable power supply. The TEC-SOFC system can provide a reliable, highly portable power generator allowing for easy delivery and deployment that can utilize a wide variety of fuel sources, including JP-8, the standard U.S. Military fuel at high operational efficiency to lessen fuel resupply needs. Another possible group of customers include our electrical utility companies, such as TVA, by offering a viable alternative to the current organization of the nation's centralized, highly interdependent electrical grid. By using TEC-SOFC power generators and integrating them into several smaller, distributed, DC micro-grids would create a power system that would be virtually invulnerable to a disaster. Additionally, shifting to DC power is highly feasible and would lead to higher efficiencies due the lack of AC-DC conversions.",Conversion,,Vanderbilt University,"PMB 407749, 2301 Vanderbilt Place, Nashville, TN 37240 - 2433",(615) 322-2400,Sustainability in Space is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The algorithms fuses the acquired Mastcam stereo images at different wavelengths to generate multispectral image cubes which can then be used for both anomaly detection and rough composition estimation from relatively longer distances when compared to LIBS instrument. To address the challenge in the stereo image alignment, we propose a two-step image registration approach. The first step consists of using the well-known RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) technique for an initial image registration. The second step uses this roughly aligned image with RANSAC and the left camera image and applies a Diffeomorphic registration process. Diffeomorphic registration is formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is solved with a step-then-correct strategy. This second step allows to reduce the registration errors to subpixel levels and makes it possible to conduct reliable anomaly detection and composition estimation analyses with the constructed multispectral image cubes. Finally, in this framework, we provide a set of both conventional and state-of-the-art anomaly detection and composition estimation techniques to be applied to the generated Mastcam multispectral image cubes for guiding the Mars rover to interesting locations.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Our system can be used in NASA's existing and future planetary rover missions.

It can be also used by military for surveillance and reconnaissance that utilize multiple cameras with different views to the same scene. Another important field that our technology can have an impact is the biomedical field.  In some biomedical applications, sequential imaging techniques are commonly used to detect changes in the spatial distribution of various molecules and biological materials. As an example, multispectral imaging is used to detect hemoglobin, melanin; narrowband imaging is used for cancer detection; multispectral fluorescence imaging is used to indicate molecular targeting in flexible endoscopy. All these techniques need to acquire multiple images of a sample at different wavelengths and/or polarization states in order to construct a complete spectrum for each pixel. However, the acquisition of a stack of multispectral images may take several hundred milliseconds or longer, depending on the exposure time of the camera, the number of wavelengths required and the switching time of the filter. Even though this time difference is small, the camera and the tissue may change position due to the patient's breathing. This then creates a problem since the multispectral image stack must be precisely aligned in order to extract information. Our technology might be helpful to address this challenge.","Data Processing; Image Processing; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Perception/Vision; Ranging/Tracking; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",,University of Tennessee,"Min H.

The combination of PCKAï¿½s extensive dynamic modeling experience, Purdueï¿½s work in electromechanical systems analysis, and GridQuant and Elequantï¿½s development of the HELM algorithm uniquely positions the team to create this technology. HELM is a novel algorithm that solves the powerflow equations of electric power systems using a direct, constructive procedure. It was originally derived for terrestrial power grids and is now being applied to dc spacecraft power systems. The Phase I effort will focus on three technical objectives. The first is to provide a formal definition of the mathematical framework for the hybrid modeling capability. The second objective is to define a software architecture for its implementation. Lastly, the third objective is to demonstrate the capability on an aircraft electrical propulsion system. The test system is anticipated to be a variable-voltage/variable-frequency ac electrical propulsion system that PCKA is currently investigating with NASA as part of a Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS) effort. Another alternative is the Hybrid Gas Electric Propulsion (HGEP) Projectï¿½s NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT) system, which PCKA is also currently modeling. Some potential applications for this modeling technique include some of these applications include 1) efficient contingency analysis, 2) model-based control, 3) system identification and monitoring, and 4) analysis of pulsed loads.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The most immediate NASA applications for this technology are the NASAï¿½s CAS and NEAT programs. While one will likely be selected as the testbed system for the Phase I, the other is similar in nature, and PCKA has existing models for both systems, which would ease transition of the modeling capability. The technique could also be applied to the Exploration Augmentation Module or International Space Station power systems, both of which are dc systems based on solar arrays with battery energy storage. These systems were modeled by PCKA under a prior NASA SBIR Phase II effort. In short, the proposed modeling technique is applicable to a wide range of electrical power systems and could be applied to virtually any NASA spacecraft or aircraft design. As the technology matures, its mathematical origin would allow it to be applied to other types of dynamic systems as well.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) While the proposed effort is focused toward N+3 generation aircraft electric propulsion systems, other types of power systems can take advantage of the modeling architecture. The underlying mathematical formulation can be applied to essentially any type of power system. One example is instance terrestrial microgrid based systems that incorporate renewable energy sources (such as military operating bases or large office buildings). It should be noted that these systems can be either ac or dc in nature; however, the overall modeling environment and control structure can be largely the same. In fact, the initial focus on aircraft electrical propulsion systems (that combined ac and dc) will set the stage for this technology to be rapidly applied to other systems. Another application with large potential impact is traditional power grids. While load flow solvers such as HELM are used for daily planning and unit commitment, transient simulations are typically too computationally intense for short-term decision making. Analysis based on transient models is performed weeks or months in advance with estimated load profiles. The proposed hybrid modeling capability could provide a more efficient framework with which to incorporate transient modeling into short-term analysis of power grids.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Distribution/Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",,Purdue University,"155 South Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907 - 2114",(765) 494-6117,Power Systems for Hybrid Electric Propulsion is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To achieve desired efficiencies, extremely tight tolerances are often imposed between inducer blades and shrouds or other system components which sets up strong interactions that influence both the aerodynamics and the structural performance of blades and vanes. These transient interactions, including rotor-stator interactions (RSI), can deform the blades and significantly impact the vibrational and acoustic characteristics of the engine, greatly reduce the efficiency, and even lead to blade or vane failure. Current production design tools for turbomachinery do not account for the coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) physics associated with these phenomena. This STTR effort will develop and deliver a multidisciplinary design tool for advanced turbomachinery components to account for FSI phenomena and enable more accurate modeling of systems and subscale demonstrators. CFDRC will supplement the NASA massively parallel Loci framework with highly accurate and efficient integrated FSI capabilities to enable better understanding of critical turbomachinery problems in liquid rocket propulsion systems that defy conventional predictions. Loci will be enhanced to enable constrained deformations in moving overset grid systems to support prediction of structural response and fluid-induced vibration in rotating components. Phase I will demonstrate improved modeling fidelity and provide great insight into FSI phenomena in turbomachinery, and Phase II will bring the complete predictive capabilities to production for detailed investigations into advanced turbomachinery for liquid rocket propulsion systems.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed development of a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) tool provides a unique opportunity to optimize design, realize additional system efficiencies, reduce weight and/or cost, and increase part life in future generations of liquid rocket engine (LRE) designs. A fully-coupled FSI tool has a large number of other applications in the NASA launch vehicles propulsion systems including: (a) prediction of rocket launch-induced fluctuating pressure loads and structural response; (b) prediction of water suppression system interactions with ignition over pressure (IOP) accurate prediction of acoustic environment; (c) prediction of vehicle buffet during ascent, (d) fluid-thermal-structural coupling of rocket engine nozzles; (e) FSI in nuclear thermal rockets; (f) prediction of self-generated dynamics of fluid delivery pipes with deformable bellows; (g) liquid propellant tank breathing due to liquid interaction with the flexible tank shell; and (h) design of new generation POGO accumulators with bellows separating liquid and gas phases.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The developed FSI analysis tool will provide accurate high-fidelity aerothermoelastic analyses for dynamic loads for turbomachinery, inducer, delivery pipes, and valves.

The situation is akin to the one faced by the first waves of people brave enough to explore new continents during the course of human history. Limited by the capabilities of their ship or caravan on a long journey, their fate was inevitably tied to their ability to learn, adapt, and use their new environment and its resources as quickly as possible. The planned In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) can yield tangible benefits for NASA pioneering missions currently studied under the Evolvable Mars Campaign. Robotic explorations have now established the wide distribution of water in the Martian subsurface with large variations in concentrations and geological contexts (ice-rock mixtures, polyhydrated minerals). Mining and processing Martian water-bearing minerals may prove key to the ultimate success of long stays on Mars via life support and chemical synthesis of methane ascent fuel and oxygen. The prospect of exploring, developing, and exploiting mineral reserves on another planetary body evokes many technical and economic challenges, which often lead to decision paralysis in strategic planners willing to consider ISRU in deep-space missions.

(PSI), in collaboration Purdue University, proposes to develop a novel launch propulsion technology for rapid insertion of nano/micro satellites (~ 5-50 kg scale) into low earth orbit, with the potential to lower the current state-of-the-art launch stage cost by a factor of two. The technology employs a propulsion scheme comprising a storable liquid oxidizer and a unique solid fuel with excellent mechanical and thermochemical properties. The propulsion scheme was initially developed by PSI under DARPA programs for applications to in-space thrusters integrated in a consumable-structure spacecraft. The proposed application of this scheme to launch vehicle stage technology will result in low-cost, mass-efficient launch systems and will reduce the technical development risk for NASA. The fuel used is commercially available as an inexpensive engineering material. The oxidizer is commercially available as a low-cost, industrial chemical. Both have high density, are green (halogen and nitrogen free), and their chemical reaction has a high specific impulse. The oxidizer storage, handling, transportation, and loading operations are simpler and safer compared to cryogenic or toxic propellants.

The intent of this project is to develop a fully robotic system for building landing pads on planetary bodies. The system will excavate in-situ regolith, sort rocks according to needed particle sizes, and layout a carefully designed landing/launch pad apron to lock in the small regolith particles. To that extent, Honeybee/MTU propose to design and build a robotic tool to perform the following 3 actions: Pick up or excavate rocks, sort the rocks in three size ranges, and deposit said rocks in three layers with the purpose to stabilize the fine regolith in the secondary apron zone of Lunar and Martian landing pads for repeated landings and take-offs.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA applications include building landing pads on planetary surfaces covered in regolith such as for example Mars and the Moon. Rocket thrust during landing or take off can damage not only surrounding infrastructure, robots and astronauts but the launch vehicle itself.Several subsystems developed under this project will also be beneficial to in Situ Resource Utilization (e.g. extraction of volatiles such as water for fuel H2/O2, drinking water, and Oxygen). In particular, a mining rover would be applied to mining resources, while sorting technology would be needed to remove (as opposed to collect) rocks above certain size. Size sorting for ISRU is extremely important since large rocks cannot be processed in the ISRU reactors nor cannot be used for 3D printing applications.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Non-NASA space related applications would include mining of resources for commercial gain. As such, companies such as Shackleton Energy, deep Space Industries, Planetary Resources, and even SpaceX would take advantage of this technology. Non-NASA/non-space applications could include robotic fabrication of temporary helicopter pads and airplane landing strips in desert environments such as Somalia for bringing humanitarian aid. Robots could be air-dropped ahead of the resupply airplanes or helicopters to construct needed landing zones.",Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Heat Exchange; Metallics; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Verification/Validation Tools,,Michigan Technological University,"1400 Townsend Drive, Houghton, MI 49931 - 1200",(906) 487-3253,Regolith Resources Robotics - R3 is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Nanohmics, Inc., proposes teaming with researchers at the Catholic University of America (CUA) to develop a real-time spectrometer that demonstrates photonic integrated circuit (IC) interferometric capabilities for the first time in the MWIR spectral band, and achieves extremely low size, weight and power (SWaP). The Nanohmics/CUA team proposes in Phase I to design and fabricate a proof of concept (PoC) photonic IC spectrometer operating in the MWIR, with TRL 3. Laboratory testing of the Phase I photonic IC device will strengthen the scaled-up photonic IC spectrometer prototype design for Phase II. The CUA research partner will perform finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling and simulation. In Phase II, the team will fabricate and test the scaled-up photonic IC spectrometer prototype, achieving TRL 6. The photonic IC spectrometer uses an array of interferometers that are microfabricated on the IC to output a real-time spatial interference pattern that is similar to the spectrograph obtained via time-scanning in Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) such as Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR). However, the photonic IC spectrograph is instantaneous and obtained by an instrument with no moving parts, similar to a class of devices called a spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS). A stack of photonic IC spectrometers acts as a one-dimensional (1D) imaging array and performs hyperspectral imaging for remote sensing and other applications. Wavelengths in the MWIR range (~3-5 micrometers) will allow the use of common microfabrication techniques and materials, which will keep costs low. Our expertise in developing planar waveguide structures places Nanohmics in a unique position for fabricating photonic IC spectrometers.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed miniaturized photonic IC spectrometer will be well-suited to spacecraft integration due to extreme low-SWaP, low cost and no moving parts. A miniaturized, chip-scale spectrometer will help achieve the science goals of missions using small satellite systems, such as CubeSats and SmallSats, to exploit extensive molecular signatures diagnostic of earth and planetary atmospheres and surfaces, mineral features surfaces of rocky bodies, and volatile emission from primitive bodies (e.g., comets). Nanohmics proposes the integration of its low-SWaP real-time photonic IC spectrometer technology into CubeSats and planetary missions, including telescope assemblies used for work being done at NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). Monolithic spacecraft can also benefit from the reduced SWaP-C of the photonic IC spectrometer. The photonic IC stack achieves a 1D array of spatial pixels, useful for push-broom hyperspectral mapping. Further miniaturization can lead to expansion to a 2D array with real-time hyperspectral imaging capabilities. The core photonic IC spectrometer technology can also be developed into a range of other device. For example, the photonic IC spectrometer can be developed into a lab-on-a-chip that can be used as an in-situ instrument or sensor for applications such as planetary missions, astronaut health monitoring, and landers/rovers for point-spectroscopy.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Leveraging our on-going commercialization and sales of high-performance optical instruments and other photonic technologies, we plan to rapidly commercialize our proposed photonic IC spectrometer. This low-cost, low-SWaP technology will be valuable to government (including Department of Defense), commercial, and university R&D, for cost-effective Earth and planetary science applications. Most of the NASA applications stated above are possible non-NASA commercialization opportunities as well. A small spacecraft or aircraft can perform valuable remote sensing spectral analysis using a photonic IC spectrometer operating in the MWIR or LWIR spectral bands. For example, the photonic IC spectrometer can be used by the USGS Spectroscopy Laboratory in its effort to map different characteristics of Earth. Military vehicles/sensors can monitor surroundings for situational awareness, such as disturbed earth or other indicators of possible enemy activity. Such remote sensing exploits the fact that molecular species of interest have diagnostic vibrational bands in the 1-10 μm infrared (IR) spectral region, approximately the mid-wave IR (MWIR) and the long-wave IR (LWIR) spectral bands. The proposed photonic IC interferometer can be rapidly commercially produced with the help of the Integrated Photonics Institute for Manufacturing Innovation (IP-IMI).","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Detectors (see also Sensors); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Image Analysis; Infrared; Long; Multispectral/Hyperspectral",,Catholic University of America,"620 Michigan Avenue, Northeast, Washington, DC 20064 - 0001",(202) 520-1620,Photonic Integrated Circuits is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

DSMs, which include constellations, formations and clusters, have already been employed and have been proposed for several future space science missions. The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is a current Solar-terrestrial Probe mission comprising four identically instrumented spacecraft flying in a relatively close formation to study the Earth?s magnetosphere. Although they open up new science frontiers and new possibilities for satellite design, constellations will be limited if their operations costs scale with the number of satellites. A key enabling technology for future DSMs will be their ability to operate with a level of autonomy to leverage the capabilities of a standard-sized team of satellite operators to safely operate a fleet of satellites. Our innovation is the development of a cFS App suite, called the Distributed Automation Suite for Heuristic Execution and Response (DASHER), which extends the current state of the art in onboard automation for spacecraft flight software. The main component of DASHER is a mission manager that can execute science observation and engineering plans intelligently. DASHER uses a common planning language to intelligently execute plans.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) There are a number of distributed spacecraft missions identified in the NASA Decadal Survey and they will be very expensive to operate without a higher level of automation than the current spacecraft state of the art.

Traditionally, imaging spectroscopy systems are not only heavy but also large in order to accommodate the long path lengths needed for spectral separation. There are several varieties, such as push-broom and scanning imaging spectrometers, but hyperspectral framing cameras are still relatively rare and are often untenably bulky. However, framing cameras place fewer restrictions on platform motion and can complete their data acquisition more rapidly, which allows more time and power to be dedicated to other instruments. A chip-scale full-frame hyperspectral imager would provide the ideal balance: small, light, no moving parts, low power requirements, and suitable for numerous mission architectures.Nanohmics, teaming with Dr. Hewagama at the University of Maryland, proposes to develop a chip-scale hyperspectral imaging technology as a commercial solution for ultra-compact UV-VIS hyperspectral cameras for smallsat and CubeSat applications. The technology will provide spectral dispersion orders of magnitude smaller and lighter than grating or prism options with full spatial-spectral registration.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The measurements produced by the chip-scale hyperspectral imager will enable surface reconnaissance and characterization in support of planetary probes or sample return from asteroids, moons, and comets. Spatial and spectrally-resolved scattered light provides ice particle size distributions and compositional analysis, and gives insights about resurfacing events and water cycle processes. A framing camera enables movies of fast processes, including auroras and lightning, without requiring additional platform motion for each frame (allowing other instruments to remain focused) and provides spectral analysis for composition and aerosol size analysis. Search for organics and biomarkers through spectral composition analysis helps focus mission resources on the right areas and samples without changing color wheels. A framing camera enables movies of transient processes, including fluid phenomena like geysers.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The low-cost offering will help the technology enter the international commercial, military, and industrial markets.

Recently, a new type of electro-filtration system designed to convert thermal power into purified water from salt water (or other ionic pollutants) has been demonstrated in the lab. The system is based on a bi-phasic nanoplatelette form of the compound MoS2 (Molybdenum disulphide). Specifically engineering a single film of hexagonal MoS2 that transitions into tetragonal MoS2, one of which is hydrophobic and one strongly hydrophilic, liquids such as water can be moved through the film. When this film is placed in a thermal gradient, a thermoelectric voltage is established that can be used to thereby remove ions within the water as it exits the material system. So the entire system is powered through the Seebeck effect and for small samples this has been shown. In this program we will attempt to demonstrate a scaleup of the concept using a small canister the size of a writing pen. When one end is dipped into the water the thermal gradient between that end and the one in air, caused by differences in the convectivity, will power the exchange of ions and purify the water for drinking.

A material and processing system is needed that allows the design, infusion, and cure of composite repairs without the current roadblocks imposed by ovens, autoclaves, and expensive tooling. VARTM processing of custom repairs allows freedom in design and minimizes the specialized tooling required for patches and straps that are prefabricated apart from the structures needing repair. CRG's no-oven, no-autoclave (NONA) composite processing technology enables the fabrication of high-performance composite parts without the limitations imposed by autoclaves and ovens. NASA originally funded CRG to develop the materials and processes for the manufacture of large, single-piece space launch structures. Building on that activity, CRG proposes NONA repair of composite structures. In this concept, NONA resin is introduced to a scarfed surface and dry fiber via VARTM processing and undergoes complete cure without additional heat input. NONA offers the opportunity to repair PMC structures on-site without the use of large capital equipment. The University of Dayton Research Institute will conduct the scarfing and evaluation of test materials. The resin consists of common aerospace epoxy components, but it is formulated to achieve complete cure in a matter of hours without additional heat input. The two-part epoxy system uses its own chemical energy to propel itself through a complete cure. It provides good strength, chemical resistance, and thermal performance up to 350 deg. F. CRG envisions a mobile fleet of NONA composite technicians that can perform repair activities at manufacturing sites around the world, restoring functionality to damaged structures and tools, minimizing impact on plant operations and production.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Supporting NASA's Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers, this project's technologies directly address requirements for simplified but effective repair techniques for Space Launch System composite fairings, skirts, and tanks.

These objectives are achieved by using Random Finite Sets statistics theory to solve the multiple object tracking problem. The swarm formation localization problem can be formulated as estimating the local intensity function of targets in the near field and developing probabilistic control strategies to track an expected localization state space configuration. Work will focus on developing estimation and control algorithms that can utilize simple measurements range and bearing angle to other units, and also determine the local environment using feature measurements. Three major tasks are proposed for the development of swarming space vehicle estimation and control: Random Finite Set Localization, Random Finite Set Formation Control, and Bayesian Collective Decision Making. Algorithm development in Phase I will extend to a Hypothesis Density Filter and Sequential Monte Carlo Hypothesis Density Filter, Motion Model, Estimation techniques, Landmark SLAM using these techniques, Behavioral Distribution Control, Cyclic Distribution Control, and multiple decision making estimation models.

It is the coupling of these three well developed and understood processes that is novel and offers a significant advantage over state of the art (SOA) spacecraft water processing systems. The Integrated Water Recovery Assembly (IRA) will reduce consumable consumption by removing the need for hazardous chemical pretreat and likely eliminate the need for aqueous-phase treatment now used to reach potable standards. It will also significantly reduce waste generation and increase material recycling by converting carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen species into useful products such as H2O, N2, and CO2. IRA will be less complex, require fewer consumables, be more robust, and more sustainable than SOA systems. IRA will also produce a concentrated and dried solid waste stream that is always contained and that will consist of salts and residual organic matter. MABR and NWP have developed as independent subcomponents for human spaceflight wastewater processing but their unique attributes have not been optimized to function together as an integrated wastewater recycling system. Neither is individually capable of producing potable water, but combined with gas phase trace contaminant control, we propose that IRA represents a significant advancement over SOA of the art spacecraft wastewater processing systems. In summary, the innovation we propose is to combine and optimize all three stages into a novel integrated system capable of processing habitation wastewater and producing clean water for all habitat needs.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Paragon's commercialization strategy for the development and incorporation of IRA into NASA's next microgravity or planetary habitat is summarized as follows:Technical Maturation - First and foremost a successful Phase I STTR must be completed. We must demonstrate improvement over SOA spacecraft wastewater recycling and we must identify a clear path towards inclusion into NASA's next human exploration vehicles. The Phase II effort must mature IRA and deliver a functional prototype that quantifies performance and advantages.Market Development - The primary near-term market for IRA is NASA's Human Spaceflight program. Paragon actively engages with NASA through funded technology development efforts such as proposed here, flight hardware production contracts to Lockheed Martin (Orion) and Boeing (CST-100), and through active participation of industry conferences and workshops. We believe the most promising near-term opportunity to inject IRA into an operational systems is to demonstrate a Phase III system at ISS in the 2020 timeframe. Demonstration at ISS would pave the way for IRA to be integrated with the exploration habitats that will ultimately be developed for NASA.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Potential Non-NASA aerospace customers include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital-ATK, Bigelow, & SpaceX.

Paragon is well positioned to incorporate IRA into their technical solutions as we have recent and ongoing work with entities such as this. In addition to aerospace applications, development of a highly regenerative and simple wastewater recycling system has numerous terrestrial applications, including disaster relief, remote military base support, and the deployment of green building hygiene water recycling systems. Paragon has the experience and technical capabilities and skills to mature IRA to flight in partnership with TTU and to market it for aerospace and terrestrial applications. We recognize it is essential to foster and develop business relations with customers, suppliers, and key subcontractors. To that end, we continue to develop a solid supplier base and have established working relationships with Research Institutions such as TTU that bring with them critical skills and capabilities of their own.","Biophysical Utilization; Characterization; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fluids; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment",,Texas Tech University,"911 Boston, Box 41023, Lubbock, TX 79409 - 1023",(806) 834-6575,Sustainability in Space is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

IFOS will work with Stanfordï¿½s Center for Design Research to develop a robotic prospecting tool with fiber-optic based haptic sensing (dynamic force, vibration, temperature) and capability to detect water, volatiles, metals, and organic compounds. A tool with in-situ analysis capabilities will allow preliminary prospecting to decide what samples are most worthwhile to collect, enabling sampling of a much larger area than one could afford to do otherwise. The prospecting tool will provide a basis for telegeology, where a field geologist can replay haptic display information it gathers.

This distributed satellite architecture, with large numbers of agents, comes at the cost of extensive mission planning and computational complexity, and greater risk of collisions. As mission profiles scale up to hundreds of agents, there is an exponential increase in the system complexity needed to both plan and control satellite swarm activity and ensure it operates safely in the environment densely populated by other agents.Aurora Flight Sciences and the MIT Space Systems Lab propose a novel and comprehensive swarm coordination and planning tool that will allow ground-based operators to provide high level mission goals, and observe and re-direct swarms of spacecraft in LEO as the autonomy dynamically plans and executes complex multi-agent missions. The proposed effort combines elements of autonomous, dynamic, multi-vehicle coordination and path planning to meet mission objectives, facilitates close-proximity operations by integrating sensors and software for collision detection and avoidance, and allows high-level human-in-the-loop control of critical mission performance by implementing a Human-Swarm interface. Phase I focuses on developing and simulating discrete elements of the conceptual tool, leveraging powerful task allocation and path planning algorithms that Aurora has developed over the past several years, coupled with MIT's autonomous collision detection & avoidance and human swarm interfaces.

This ambitious mission is enabled by Busek's iodine-fueled BIT-3 RF ion propulsion system that can deliver ~1mN of thrust and ~2200sec of total Isp with 65W nominal input power. With 1.6kg of solid iodine propellant onboard, the BIT-3 thruster will provide AstroCube approximately 3.1km/s of delta-V maneuverability to rendezvous with the target, Asteroid 2001 GP2, during its next closest Earth approach in October 2020. The 6U CubeSat platform is chosen due to its low cost and ease of access to ride-share opportunity on GEO-bound upper stages, as well as on the upcoming NASA SLS demonstration missions. The AstroCube mission will leverage a unique deep-space 6U CubeSat bus with ion propulsion, currently being co-developed by Busek and Morehead State University (MSU) under NASA's Lunar IceCube flight program. The proposed mission will encompass several technology innovations, including compact science instruments and autonomous CONOPS, which are the focus of this Phase I development. A rad-tolerant, 1/4U sized camera-Lidar device will give AstroCube ""eyes"" to survey the asteroid and help with proximity navigation. Due to the asteroid?s weak gravitational field, the spacecraft will be required to use real-time depth image processing and its ion thruster to navigate around the asteroid during final approach to a low stationary altitude. Once such close proximity is reached, a 1U sized neutron spectrometer will be activated to characterize the abundance of hydrogen, which would indicate presence of water ice, by detecting slow-moving neutrons as they scatter off the asteroid's regolith from the bombardment of cosmic rays.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The AstroCube mission will be the first to utilize the MSU-Busek deep space 6U CubeSat bus with ion propulsion as an ""off the shelf"" product, signifying a rapid return of NASA?s current investment in such technology. In addition to demonstrate the spacecraft's ability to reach deep space destinations, the proposed instrument payloads will be crucial for NASA's CubeSat-class exploration missions in the future. Exploring our solar system with low-cost robotic/scout vehicles as precursors for human or science missions will benefit from these technology advancements. AstroCube's revolutionary iodine RF ion thruster enables CubeSats to fly beyond earth orbit and can be used in close proximity operations. The ultra-compact, 1/4U sized camera-Lidar will push the state-of-the-arts envelope by giving ""depth vision"" to CubeSats.

Being able to combine embedded sensing with distributed networks gives us the additional potential to further benefit many systems and sub-systems in the aerospace industry including launch vehicles, ground test equipment and spacecraft. These remote distributed sensor networks need to be flexible to the needs of different types of data, environments and configurations. Highly flexible solutions will support the widest variety of sensors, power methods, communication protocols and real-time processing algorithms.Angstrom Designs proposes a modular, embedded, intelligent sensor network comprised of a network of sensor nodes, to maximize flexibility. Each system node contains three modules: sensor, communications and power. We propose to develop sensor modules to gather and condition signals including heat flux, acoustics and electric fields to compliment existing temperature, pressure and strain measurement hardware. Communications modules will transmit sensor data via high-frequency, high-bandwidth, low-power network technologies. Power modules will supply power to the node through the use of battery, solar or scavenged power. Phase I prototype system nodes will be smaller than 5 cubic centimeters (cc), and after miniaturization, nodes will likely be smaller than 0.5 cc. Additionally, radiation hard versions of many of the components will be available for possible flight missions. A central processing gateway receives data from the sensor network, provides real-time processing of the data and reports raw and processed data to test engineers and software via standard network interfaces. Research partner, the Pennathur lab at UCSB, adds expertise and capability in advanced power harvesting, micro- and nanofluidic based sensors.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Highly modular, remote sensors are of interest to many NASA tests and missions. Real-time data from sensor networks reduces risk and provides data for future design improvements. For example, sensor networks on a vehicle body can give measurement of temperature, pressure, strain and acoustics. This data is used in real time to determine safety margins and test anomalies. The data is also used post-test to correlate analytical models and optimize vehicle and test design.Because these sensors are small and low mass, they can be used for ground test and for flight. Sensor module miniaturization will further reduce size, mass and cost. Small sensors can be placed in formerly inaccessible locations and can wirelessly provide new insights on system behavior. Wireless remote sensors can be used for thermal, structural and acoustic measurement of systems and subsystems and also provide emergency system halt instructions in the case of leaks, fire or structural failure.Other examples of potential NASA applications include 1) measuring strain in test structures, ground support equipment and vehicles, include high-risk deployables, 2) measuring temperature, strain, voltage and current from power storage and generation systems and 3) measuring pressure, strain and temperature in pumps and pressure vessels. There are many other applications that would benefit from increased, real-time sensing in remote, hard-to-test locations.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) There are many potential commercial applications. As with NASA, the commercial sector would benefit from data that shows real time performance, gives greater test safety and correlates models to enhance design. Angstrom Designs is very familiar with the deployable solar array market, and solar array structures designers could use sensor arrays for many applications, including 1) measuring strain in structures to verify design models, 2) measuring loads and strain in ground support equipment (GSE) to determine GSE effects on ground testing and 3) measuring sensor position and acceleration to determine deployment dynamics. Similar examples exist in flight and ground test for many of the components of spacecraft, from power systems to structures to pressure vessels to propulsion systems.Additional sensing capability will benefit the largest GEO-communications satellite and the smallest CubeSat. Every spacecraft has critical systems and subsystems that, given additional sensing, could be made more efficient, more reliable and safer.

Commercial spaceflight, deep space flight, and satellites require smarter, smaller, and lower power dosimeters. There are a number of instruments with flight heritage, yet as identified in NASA's roadmaps, this technology does not lend itself to a viable solution for active dosimetry for an astronaut, particularly for deep space missions. The proposed solution is an instrument that will provide dose distinguished by the type of particle, where tissue or physical damage is dependent on the energy and mass of the radiation. This is accomplished by advancing technologies developed by RMD and COSMIAC that will provide a comprehensive assessment of the radiation environment, as the instrument determines the dose for different particle species. Using RMD's advanced scintillation materials, low-power digitizers, and COSMIAC's digital signal processing, a compact dosimeter will be developed for intravehicular and extravehicular activates, as well as a space weather monitor for satellites.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Under the existing 2015 NASA Technology roadmap for Human Health, Life Support and Habitation Systems, real time dosimeters are explicitly needed for intravehicular and extravehicular activities.

To address NASA's need for space-hardened planetary entry, descent, and landing (EDL) and proximity-operations sensors, a low-cost, high-pixel-density avalanche photodiode detector array technology will be developed that is sensitive in the 0.9-μm to 1.7-μm spectral range and when operated at room temperature, can achieve nearly noiseless avalanche gain, allowing for near-single-photon sensitivity. In Phase I, a series of detector structures will be grown, fabricated, and tested. The performance of the detectors will be used to predict performance of the arrays when coupled to low-noise readout integrated circuits. Single element devices coupled to low-noise amplifiers will be used to validate the predictive models.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Missions to solar systems bodies must meet increasingly ambitious objectives requiring highly reliable soft landing, precision landing, and hazard avoidance capabilities. Robotic missions to the Moon and Mars demand landing at predesignated sites of high scientific value near hazardous terrain features such as escarpments, craters, slopes, and rocks, require large-format LADAR with high resolution. Other applications include: hazard avoidance, navigation, docking, LIDAR, and optical communications.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The discovery of increasing uses of and diverse applications for LIDAR data has led clients to press LIDAR providers for more accurate data with better classification results. With better accuracy, it will be possible for LIDAR providers to create new and improved methodologies, thereby improving their ability to deliver quantifiable data. Currently, the top three global uses of LIDAR data are: 1) topographic mapping; 2) flood risk assessments; and 3) watershed analysis. Natural resource applications in geology, water, and forestry are expected to increase in demand, and hydrology / flood applications will continue to grow, as well as power utility applications. In addition to these top-three expected growth areas, other applications include automobile collision avoidance, autonomous navigation, and others.","3D Imaging; Detectors (see also Sensors); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",,University of Dayton,"300 College Park, Dayton, OH 45469 - 8803",(937) 344-3921,Navigation and Hazard Avoidance Sensor Technologies is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

We will demonstrate an instrumented end-effector that will be capable of enhanced perception through observed and controlled contact. This approach requires: (i) a network of sensors capable of capturing the highly compliant state of the soft robot and high resolution tactile sensors for multi-point contact, (ii) integrating these sensors with a core embedded system capable of processing large arrays of sensor data and (iii) development of algorithms that can extract state/tactile information to serve as high frequency feedback to the control system.The goal of this STTR is to transfer the promising technology of elastomeric sensors from the Purdue Faboratory's research setting into a commercial product. These sensors present a solution to the remaining piece of the puzzle of how to manage and leverage the additional degrees of freedom of Pneubotics' compliant systems. Towards this goal, Otherlab will serve as the commercial expert with a deployable platform. We will provide requirements and specifications for the sensor design as well as insight into integration challenges and cost constraints. The Faboratory will serve as the experts on liquid-embedded elastomeric sensors, optimizing the design and fabrication methods to serve the commercial applications. The full system demonstrations proposed in this Phase I are feasible because we will exploit the Pneubotics' manipulators and gripper designs that Otherlab has developed through government grants (NASA, DARPA), commercial partners, and private funding.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Future NASA missions will increasingly rely on advanced robotic systems to enable effective space exploration. In particular, longer and more complex operations require new technologies which have increased autonomy to free-up ground control resources and astronauts' time. Perhaps most importantly these robots must be capable of robustly operating in unstructured, natural environments with ever changing conditions. A critical part of this reliability comes from developing platforms that can tolerate interaction with their surroundings. Pneubotic manipulators derive their structure and actuation from pressurized fluid, which allows for control over stiffness, force generation and deformation of the manipulators. This qualities make these soft robots perfectly suited for space exploration missions were planetary rovers are equipped with soft robotic manipulators capable of identifying and manipulating both heavy debris and delicate samples by actively matching their compliance to the given task. Similarly the light-weight, compliant nature of the Pneubotic technology makes them safe for performing collaborative tasks with astronauts.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The mobile material handling sector is a large near-term market where industrial robotics have already established the precedent for the use of robotic automation but are incapable of addressing mobility needs. The remaining limitation for soft manipulators to enter this market is robust and high throughput grasping of wide variety of objects. The STTR work will address this challenge by using contact to quickly identify box edges and position the end effector relative to the target. Multi-point contact and force control will be utilized to ensure a secure grasp.A key piece to bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States is incorporating automation into an agile manufacturing line with the goal of shortening product-development cycles and augmenting worker productivity. However, the problem with traditional robots is that they fall short in meeting the needs of agile manufacturing because of cost, weight, and task limitations. Utilizing soft robots in manufacturing operations requires end-effectors capable of establishing safe and controlled contact to create a closed structural loop, significantly reducing the need for high cost sensors and actuators traditionally required to achieve high positional accuracy and stiffness. This interaction which will enable sub mm-scale tool positioning using light-weight, low-cost robots.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Contact/Mechanical; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Man-Machine Interaction; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Perception/Vision; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Teleoperation",,Faboratory at Purdue University,"585 Purdue Mall, ME 2147, West Lafayette, IN 47907 - 2088",(765) 494-2219,Information Technologies for Intelligent and Adaptive Space Robotics is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This type of structure is advantageous in that it is not limited to the diameter of the launch vehicle and can therefore provide a greater volume of living and work space. Unlike conventional metal structures, however, softbody inflatables require support members to maintain their desired shapes. Despite their robustness, the webbings strain due to the internal habitat inflation pressure and resulting stress. To measure the relatively large strains that occur in the webbings during the inflation of model habitats used during the design process, pin or clip-on extensometers are used, but the pins damage the material and are unacceptable. Strain sensors directly integrated into or onto low-strain webbing fabrics like Dyneema, Vectran would allow the determination of webbing loads during the inflation process as well as during the use lifetime of the habitat. Such webbing-integrated elongation sensors would have two primary uses. First, they would be used to determine and map mechanical loads during the inflation process to insure that the habitat attains proper design form. Second, in the long-term, they would be used to monitor the gradual creep of the webbings that must be balanced by inflation forces to maintain proper figure.The purpose of the proposed program is to address this specific NASA need - to develop fabric extensometers that can be built into habitat webbings during their manufacture and used to measure loads during inflation and long-term use. To that end, NanoSonic will build on its Metal Rubberï¿½ (MRï¿½) technology to create fabric sensor materials that are electrically conductive and mechanically flexible, tailored to the required performance metrics of the structural webbing materials.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In addition to expandable space habitats, such elastomeric large strain sensors have other direct aerospace applications, such as the measurement of strain on high altitude airships and balloons, spacecraft fuel bladders, and space-based deployable flexible radars, photovoltaic arrays and antennas.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The materials developed under this NASA STTR program have extensive non-NASA commercial applications including flexible radome structures, dwellings for polar or desert-based scientists, and even hyperbaric chambers for health clubs or hospitals.","Airship/Lighter-than-Air Craft; Contact/Mechanical; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nanomaterials; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Polymers; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures",,Virginia Tech,"302 Whittemore, Blacksburg, VA 24061 - 0000",(540) 231-3362,Increasing Predictability of Softgoods Material Behavior for Inflatable Space Structures is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The mission has a target launch date of 2022, and its primary goal will be to search Europa?s icy surface for evidence of life that may persist within the ice shell or subsurface ocean. The Europa lander study specifically recommends a combination of a mass spectrometer and a Raman spectrometer to investigate Europa's habitability. Current flight prototypes, by design, existing planetary Raman instruments cannot detect organic compounds on Europa down to the required 1 ppb. We propose to build and critically test the in-situ Spectroscopic Europa Explorer (iSEE), a next-generation prototype of a compact, arm-mounted Raman Spectrometer. iSEE utilizes an innovative combination of light source, adaptive spatial coding optics, and detector. It integrates a high-performance signal processor and data processing algorithms that enable unprecedented measurements: in-situ chemical identification and quantitation of complex organic compounds, including pre-biotic compounds; biomolecules; minerals; and volatiles. iSEE also provides sample context, including ice composition, crystallinity, and ice phase distribution. Our project is responsive to 'T8.03 Detection technologies for extant or extinct life for use on robotic missions.' Our Phase I R&D will develop and integrate key subsystems of iSEE and evaluate its performance using standards and natural samples, particularly with respect to the detection of organic compounds and biomarkers. We will demonstrate the feasibility of iSEE to perform quantitative analysis of organic content, minerals, and volatiles at or < 1 ppb in solid matrices.

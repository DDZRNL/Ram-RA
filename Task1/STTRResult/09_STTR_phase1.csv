During in-flight conditions, this system is able to not only provide the status of information such as regarding the flight envelope, but also make accurate diagnostic and prognostic statements of aircraft subsystems. Real-time capabilities are enabled using intelligent algorithms and advanced techniques to provide both time and frequency localization of data. As such, the health management system is able to provide information quickly enough as to monitor an aircraft subsystem in a highly dynamic environment and to make statements regarding anomalies as well as future problems. A key enabling technology is newly developed low-power sensors that offer significant advantages over traditional sensor methods. In addition, automated reasoning technologies to improve sustainability, increase identification of system degradation, and enhance scientific understanding include data fusion, and advanced decision-making, among others. With this system, a comprehensive image of the system/subsystems, and in particular, the structural components, is provided in real-time.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The Advanced Structural Health Monitoring System (ASHMS) will directly support a host of NASA's information technology and health monitoring requirements.

With most aircraft there are combinations of airspeed and angle of attack where the boundary layer at least partially detaches from the airfoil. Reducing boundary layer detachment will increase lift and reduce drag. This will reduce fuel consumption saving money for the operator and improving control for the pilot. Two methods are known to improve boundary layer attachment: heating the air and supplying acoustic pressure at an airspeed and airfoil shape dependent frequency. Carbon nanotubes can be used to produce heating elements as thin as a layer of paint. Because they are thin they can be heated and cooled hundreds of times per second. This combination means that carbon nanotube heating elements can be thermoacoustic speakers to both heat the air stream and generate the appropriate acoustic frequency to maximize boundary zone attachment.All system components have been demonstrated individually achieving TRL 2. Phase I will demonstrate multifrequency sound generation on surfaces in a wind tunnel using nanotube heating elements, and achieving TRL 3.Phase II will include medium seals wind tunnel tests verifying the effects and achieving TRL 5.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) One of NASA's functions is developing and demonstrating new flight technologies for both military and civilian use.

Sensing of these CFFs across flight regimes involves numerous challenges such as a wide temperature/pressure range from subsonic to hypersonic flows. Tao Systems, Mesoscribe Technologies and Virginia Tech propose to develop a novel direct-write sensor architecture for the in-flight measurement of skin friction and heat flux that is survivable to temperatures exceeding 1000 deg.

As a consequence, this technology will extend the utility of CFFs for aeroservoelastic control from subsonic to supersonic and hypersonic flows, as well as provide test information from experiments in flight.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The primary target application of the proposed innovation and associated products and services (IAPS) is the current and next generation reusable launch vehicles, whose safety, reliability and efficiency are mission critical factors that involve informed trade-offs in a complex interaction between aerothermodynamics and aerostructures. The IAPS can be used to improve safety/reliability margins, obtain better estimates on performance predictions based on quantified flow characterization, e.g., location of boundary layer laminar-to-turbulent transition, with significant impact on the design of the thermal protection system. It has even been asserted that the uncertainty in transition location for some hypersonic vehicles can result in an uncertainty of 20\% in total vehicle weight, which is then compensated only by heavier thermal protection systems.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) A potential non-aerospace commercial application of the IAPS relates to requirements where heat flux/skin friction would be usefu: e.g., for fire monitoring/control. Some examples of such applications are: safety of naval ships (to monitor the heat flux from weapons systems to adjoining areas and vice versa). A matrix of heat flux sensors covering an area will determine how much heat is penetrating/leaving a room, and the skin friction sensor can determine the level of air flow. These two parameters can provide much more information to determine if there is a fire and the rate at which it will expand.

The used GHe is vented into the atmosphere, is non-recoverable, and costs NASA millions dollars per year. Helium, which is non-renewable and irreplaceable once released into the atmosphere, is continuously consumed by rocket test facilities at NASA centers such as KSC, SSC, and CCAFS at a rate of more than 6.6 Mscf per year. This use is projected to increase to more than 10 Mscf by the year 2018, assuming the same inefficient and costly operating procedures and facilities continue to be used. Given the decrease in the world's supply of helium, NASA is heading toward to an economic, operational, and programmatic disaster. New and highly innovative approaches are required to drive down launch operation life cycle costs. Scaling-up of existing systems to meet an increased demand of helium is not an option. Our team, Sierra Lobo, Inc. and University of Hawaii at Manao, proposes the use of PEM fuel cells to remove most of the impure oxygen and hydrogen in the helium gas stream.

Another potential NASA application is to generate power and water using fuel-cell-powered impurity reactant with inner helium gas on Lunar surface landing vehicles efficiently. The Lunar landing vehicle consists of a great amount of residual oxygen and hydrogen in the propellant tanks pressurized with gaseous helium. The current design concept is to use residual oxygen and hydrogen to power the fuel cell to generate electrical power and water.

Readings taken in the robot's surroundings can be overlaid on terrain maps to improve human understanding. 3D visualization, however, focuses a controller's attention on what is happening in the vicinity of the robot. The effectiveness of visualization at centering attention on the robot means that information not spatially linked to that view could be missed.

The notification software produced in Phase II will be immediately useful for future analog robotic field tests where VERVE provides 3D robot visualization. Our separation of notice construction from notice presentation should ease integration of the notification software with other 3D visualization software that NASA might use in the future.

In such multi-robot operations, it is essential to shift the user's focus when another robot outside the current field of view requires attention. Thus the proposed technology for notification should be directly applicable to remote supervision of military robots. The separation of notice construction from notice presentation should ease integration of the notification software with whatever 3D visualization software is used by the military.

Supercapacitors that utilize an aqueous electrolyte are limited to a maximum voltage of 1 volt due to the decomposition of water. Methods used to increase voltage include use of an organic electrolyte, which introduces additional complexity, cost and undesirable environmental concerns, or to use an asymmetric or hybrid configuration, with two different electrode materials. Supercapacitors that utilize MnO2 and carbon as the electrodes have been developed. However, due to changes in the MnO2 while cycling the capacitor to 2 volts, the MnO2 will change over time and lose its ability to cycle. One method around this problem, reported in the literature, is to charge the capacitor to 1.5 volts, resulting in reduced power and energy storage. In this Phase I program Giner, Inc. will demonstrate a novel solution to this problem by modifying the MnO2 positive electrode through the use of magnetic microparticles dispersed throughout the electrode structure.

Small improvements in the RPS performance, weight, size, and/or reliability can have a dramatic effect on the scientific capability of the vehicle and the overall mission costs. Radioisotope Thermophotovoltaic (RTPV) energy converters are a particular type of RPS that directly converts the heat produced by a General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) to electrical power using a specialized Photovoltaic (PV) cell. A key element in an RTPV system is the power conversion electronics system that efficiently converts the low-voltage current from each PV cell into useable, stable bus voltage for powering spacecraft systems despite issues such as non-uniform illumination, PV cell degradation, and decay of the GPHS source. In this project, Creare and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) propose to develop an advanced, multi-channel maximum power point tracking module (MPPT) that is optimized for RTPV systems. The converter will provide stable output voltage from a 16-cell PV array that, when coupled with advanced PV technology of the RTPV system, will provide high system efficiency. In Phase I, we will design a prototype power tracking module, which will be fully characterized for conversion efficiency. We will also assess the impact of this new MPPT on the overall RTPV system design and performance.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Exploration missions that extend much beyond the earth's orbit around the sun are severely limited by the amount of power that can be generated by conventional solar panels. Radioisotope power systems are, therefore, required to enable flagship missions to the outer solar system and in some cases to the inner solar system (e.g., the lunar poles). RTPV systems offer the potential for high specific power and high efficiency, both of which can lead to vehicles with more science capability at lower cost and lower launch mass. RTPV offers the potential reliability and low vibration of a static conversion process like thermoelectrics with efficiency approaching that of dynamic systems like Stirling and Brayton energy converters. RTPV could, therefore, be a viable alternative for any NASA exploration mission requiring an RPS.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Radioisotope power systems are used for a number of military applications. RTPV based systems would be a viable alternative to the current thermoelectric-based systems. There is also current interest in small nuclear powered batteries based on RTPV.

TPV with combustion-based heat sources has long been considered for a number of industrial and consumer applications. The technology developed on this project would have potential application in many of these systems if a commercial TPV system were ever marketed. Most likely, this would be a low power energy scavenging application(s) (e.g., self-powered sensors).",Nuclear Conversion; Photovoltaic Conversion; Thermodynamic Conversion; Thermoelectric Conversion,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 - 4301",(617) 253-5694

An important component of CFD simulations is mesh generation, or discretization into polygonal or polyhedral cells, of the domain being analyzed. The overall computational cost and accuracy of simulations depend heavily on mesh quality  the size, shape, and structure of the cells. Another important aspect of CFD simulation is that solutions are achieved iteratively, with each subsequent pass decreasing error and increasing solution accuracy. Grid adaption uses output from the last simulation to improve the mesh for the next. FUN3D is a CFD simulator developed at NASA that requires both a tight integration with mesh generation software for grid adaption and the generation of high aspect ratio cells (i.e. 10,000:1) to accurately capture dynamics around boundary layers.Current meshing methods use the well known advancing front or Delaunay algorithms, and the user must often perform multiple manual inputs and interactions to generate a mesh of sufficient quality. Ideally, a meshing module would subdivide complex designs and perform grid adaption automatically, with little or no human intervention.

Ciespace anticipates the first commercial application within NASA is with the NASA CFD simulator, FUN3D. Ciespace will work closely with the FUN3D team, meet their requirements and help them to solve difficult CFD problems in a more automated fashion. Because there are several additional CFD simulators within NASA, each targeting different problems, the proposed work could be extended to meet their requirements as well. In addition, products from Ciespace's meshing portfolio could be used inside of other physics based simulators at NASA - those performing crash, impact, warpage or other types of nonlinear analysis. To date, customers using Ciespace products have realized significant savings though increased automation, decreased outsourcing cost and decreased product design time.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Ciespace has emerged as a successful advanced meshing software provider to the electronics and manufacturing industries.

While imaging systems at terahertz frequencies (0.3 to 3 THz) have been demonstrated for 2D imaging of similar materials, they have not yet demonstrate full 3D volumetric imaging. To meet this need, LongWave Photonics proposes to use high-power, low-frequency terahertz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) developed at MIT, to demonstrate 3D imaging using Laser Triangulation. By using high-power QCL sources, large signal to noise ratios (SNRs) are attainable, resulting in resolution of subtle defects at fast scan speeds. The shorter wavelengths emitted by QCLs, 60 to 250 µm, allow high lateral and depth resolution. The feasibility of a second system based on Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography will also be explored using a recently developed tunable THz QCL from MIT. In addition to the benefits of high SNR, this technique allows sub-wavelength depth resolution. The current generation of QCLs are compatible with a cooling package that is <1 Kg, with <100 W power consumption. Phase II work will package a second generation of QCLs in a compact system to meet NASA's portable 3D NDT needs.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed Terahertz QCL based 3D Imaging system will be valuable in characterizing the voids and delaminations in materials used in the Constellation program (e.g. urethane based foams, silica based composites, etc). The high depth resolution enabled by this system will also allow measurement of thin non-conductive polymer layers, such as paints and compositions to verify thicknesses and integrity.

Advances in CFD methods and parallel computing have provided NASA the core flow solvers to perform these simulations. However, the ease of use of these flow solvers and the reliability of the results obtained are a strong function of the technologies used to discretize the domain. Many applications involve solutions with highly anisotropic features: boundary layers, shear layers, wakes, shocks etc. Efficient resolution of those features motivates matching the mesh resolution/anisotropy to the solution's anisotropy but, in the more challenging applications, the location and strength of those features is difficult to precisely estimate prior to solution. Currently available meshing tools are not capable of producing and controlling the required initial meshes, nor adapting the mesh to match evolving anisotropic features. This project will combine Simmetrix Inc. expertise in the development of meshing components for flow simulations, and Rensselaer's Scientific Computation Research Center expertise in the development of adaptive mesh control technologies, to provide NASA the mesh generation and adaptation technologies needed. New techniques will be developed to create highly anisotropic semi-structured and unstructured meshes suitable for CFD simulations with high Reynolds number flow features (e.g., boundary layers, bow shocks, free shear layers, wakes, contact surfaces). Techniques to adapt these meshes based on mesh correction indicators will be developed to enable fully automated adaptive simulations.

The proposed Phase I effort seeks to design and fabricate a ion thruster discharge chamber with an equivalent beam area of a 50-cm-diameter cylindrical ion thruster with the capacity to fill the 7 to 25-kW void that currently exist for ion thrusters. The overall effort (Phases I and II) will advance the TRL level of the discharge chamber for the 50-cm thruster by understanding and optimizing the discharge chamber.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) EDA is committed to developing spacecraft propulsion related systems such as the 50 cm ion thruster. EDA is uniquely qualified to advance this technology rapidly through initial prototype development and qualification due to its experience in flight hardware. The PIs of this proposed project have first-hand experience with commercial EP devices having assisted three major aerospace engineering firms with thruster (and associated electronics) qualification and one in the design of a new flight engine. EDA also a solid relationship with the spacecraft propulsion divisions at Aerojet and Busek, all of whom have developed flight-ready EP engines. The technology under development here has numerous applications in the area of electric propulsion, supporting those current and future NASA missions with high power requirements.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) High power ion thruster propulsion technology is also enabling for DOD customers as well as commercial satellite interests for orbital transfer applications. The appeal of the system to non-NASA customers has been heightened through the availability of high power solar arrays. The coupling of such arrays with high power, efficient gridded ion is indeed mission enabling. In this respect, there would be likely benefits for both government satellites as well as commercial satellite markets.",Electrostatic Thrusters; Fundamental Propulsion Physics; Solar,,"University of Michigan, Division of Research, Development, and Ad","Room 1058; 3003 South State Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 - 1274",(734) 764-1976

Efficiency enhancement will be achieved by the introduction of InGaP quantum wells within the active region of the wide-gap base material. The introduction of these nanoscale features will enable harvesting of low-energy photons that are normally lost by transmission through the wide bandgap material. Successful completion of the proposed work will combine the high-temperature, radiation-tolerant wide-bandgap material with current-enhancing nanostructures to produce a high efficiency space solar cell capable of operating at higher temperatures suitable for near-sun missions. This achievement can result in significant cost savings as active cooling of PV systems would be unnecessary with this technology.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Successful completion of the Phase I and II of the proposed work will result in a photovoltaic cell having an elevated temperature efficiency that significantly exceeds performance available in the marketplace today. State of the art concentrator cells are nominally limited to 120oC, whereas this work is expected to demonstrate high-temperature solar cells that exceed GaAs response above 300oC. Such a cell may have significant impact on power system designs for inner-ring planetary and solar missions by simplifying the cooling system design for the solar array. Upon achieving this goal, Firefly plans to license the technology to one of the major US space solar cell manufacturers, Emcore or Spectrolab. Firefly will continue to work with this entity during technology transfer and ongoing R&D. Firefly personnel have a strong track record of bringing innovative technical projects to the marketplace.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) While not directly aligned with space power generation, the InGaP/GaP quantum well system has the potential to emit visible light efficiently. Therefore, it is envisioned that the development of an InGaP/GaP quantum well system may lead to advances in understanding for QW-based LEDs, with the significant advantage of a transparent substrate as an integral part of the epitaxial structure. Visible LEDs represent a significant commercial opportunity and should this technology demonstrate a competitive advantage in the LED industry, Firefly is poised to license the technology.",Beamed Energy; Energy Storage; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics; Photovoltaic Conversion; Power Management and Distribution; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Renewable Energy; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials; Solar; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety,,Rochester Institute of Technology,"One Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623 - 5603",(585) 475-2480

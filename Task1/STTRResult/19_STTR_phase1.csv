The high launch costs of fresh water to space and environmental health of crewmembers are the two major factors for water reclamation and reuse. Urine is expected to contribute approximately 81.4% of human wastewater in space. Therefore, wastewater treatment systems for spacecraft must address urine wastewater recycling. In addition, each of those three sources will have a variety of contaminants.Improving the reliability of water recovery capabilities will most directly benefit future long-duration human missions beyond LEO by reducing the amount of spare equipment and emergency supplemental supplies of water that must be launched from Earth to ensure crew survival and mission success. A secondary benefit of increasing water recovery is the reduction in volume of residual brine that must be stored or somehow disposed of.Therefore, the Nanomatronix and UALR team seek to develop thermally partially reduced graphene oxide membrane-based filtration systems to overcome the issues discussed above. As a one atom thick two-dimensional (2D) carbon sheet, graphene has attracted great attention. As a graphene derivative, graphene oxide (GO) presents a plethora of exciting and promising properties.

Small urban aircraft may utilize Distributed Electric Propulsion along with advanced structural and electric motor/storage technologies to achieve the necessary flight capability. However, these aircraft utilize propellers or fans to achieve the necessary thrust, with attendant community noise issues. We propose to suppress perceived noise, especially during takeoff and landing in urban areas, by limiting the formation of vortical structures near the propulsor tips and trailing edges.Tip vortices are common for airfoils, best illustrated by aircraft wings. The pressure difference between top and bottom creates a secondary flow, with a resulting vortex that increases noise and reduces lift. Winglets are effective in countering this effect. However, rotating airfoils – propellers and fans – cannot utilize winglets. Instead we propose to limit the secondary flow and tip vortex by utilizing thin, surface-mounted plasma actuators placed near the rotating blade tip.SurfPlasma Inc. is a world leader in plasma actuator technology, having developed boundary layer control devices for many applications, including technology effective in the control of high speed air flows, relevant to aircraft propulsors even at low vehicle speeds. Also demonstrated is a technique for providing the required voltage to rotating systems.

For missions to the surfaces of Mars and the Moon, mission planners will require increasingly autonomous guidance systems that support fast, efficient, and agile surface route planning. These navigation systems will rely on access to accurate and regularly updated maps of surface landmarks. In a recent pilot study (Wronkiewicz et al.

Our method could generate accurate crater maps five orders of magnitude faster and at 10x better resolution than the best manual identification efforts. This result suggests we should further explore methods of autonomously generating surface feature maps as a way to reduce the amount of manual effort needed to chart other bodies in the solar system.We propose building the tools to efficiently map surface features across both the Moon and Mars. Specifically, we will achieve two main technical objectives: (1) create an open-source, cloud-based, reusable software product that can rapidly apply ML algorithms across large image datasets (e.g., satellite images covering the Moon and Mars) and (2) generate publicly available impact crater maps encompassing the entire surface of Mars and the Moon at ten times better resolution than is provided by existing catalogs. We will open source both the software and data products to encourage future research applying ML for planetary-scale mapping.

Integrated photonics have the potential to greatly impact NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) because of the reduced SWaP and cost. Various applications, from sensing to high speed communications, can benefit from integrated photonics. Current astrophotonic spectrometers have a limited operational bandwidth of ≤ 200 nm, channel spacing of ≥ 1.5 nm, and a limited linewidth of ≥ 0.15 nm. These devices also have large optical loss, relatively large footprints, and require off-chip detection. Lynntech proposes an integrated photonic crystal spectrometer with on-chip photodetection. This device will offer improvements in all the categories above, as well as, on-chip photodetection, multimode input, and spectral filtering.

Germicidal UV-C disinfection using mercury-based lamps is a widely used technology that has numerous safety and reactor configuration disadvantages. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are mercury-free alternative and other advantages are making them competitive and a lower cost alternative for disinfection (e.g. lack of warm up time, tunable radiation, long life of use). However, a crucial technology barrier of LED disinfection is the small surface area that emits irradiation, which necessitates arrays of many LEDs within even the smallest reactor, and thus has been a major limitation to their adoption. We propose a means of increasing the irradiation area of LEDs by >100x through the development of side-emitting optical fibers (SEOF), essentially creating UV-C germicidal flexible glowsticks which can be bundled together with tens of optical fibers delivering light from a single LED. Currently only visible light SEOFs are commercially available. To overcome this wavelength dependent barrier, we recently discovered a nanotechnology-based solution to achieve side-emission from optical fibers in the UV-C range. This is achieved by coating an optical fiber in a new and novel way using shape-, size-, and surface chemistry modified silica nanoparticles that create light-scattering centers on the surface of the fiber. The coated fiber is then overlaid with a UV-C transparent polymer that protects the fiber and prevents nanoparticle release into water and allows germicidal light to enter the water.

Nanohmics, Inc., and Andrea Alù’s group at the City University of New York propose to develop ultrathin, light-weight, high-transmittance optics based on microfabricated gradient metagratings. A metagrating is an array of polarizable metamaterial particles with a period comparable to the optical wavelength. By spatially varying particle geometries, a microfabricated metagrating lens can focus light with minimal optical aberration and diffraction-limited precision. Because of their extremely low size and mass, metagrating optics will be ideal for sensors, imagers, and optical communication applications in probes and other SWaP-constrained space vehicles. Initial development will center on transmission-mode beam shaping optics that can be used in space-based remote sensing or optical communication subsystems. In Phase I the team will demonstrate the feasibility of a high-transmittance metagrating beam shaping optic by designing, microfabricating and testing a small proof-of-principle metagrating lens operating at wavelength ~1.55 µm, with TRL 3. Phase I laboratory test results, and modeling and simulation, will strengthen the design for a larger, polarization-independent, beam shaping prototype to be fabricated in Phase II. The Phase II prototype will advance to TRL 5 and be laboratory tested and made available to NASA for independent testing. The proposed metagrating prototype will be fabricated using CMOS-compatible materials and standard microfabrication techniques to reduce costs and provide a rapid route to commercialization for beam shaping and other light-weight optics. Longer term, the team proposes the integration of the metagrating technology into planetary missions as part of NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), including for SWaP-constrained scientific exploration of Earth and other objects in the Solar System.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Smaller and lower-cost spacecraft for exploration of Earth, the planets, and other Solar System objects require imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication subsystems with small size, weight and power consumption (SWaP).

Monitoring long-term creep allows the statistical estimation of the remaining lifetime of the webbing material, and it is important that this estimate be significantly longer than the required mission lifetime of the inflatable. NanoSonic's Metal Rubber material may be formed into either sheet materials that may be dimensioned into discrete creep extensometers, or into yarn that may be directly woven into webbings during their manufacturing. For NASA, discrete creep extensometers may be applied where needed on existing habitat webbing, or built into the webbings during habitat production. Other similar NASA applications that require the measurement of strains without interfering with the performance of devices include use in 1) landing airbags such as those used on Mars rover landings, 2) atmospheric decelerators such as HIAD and SIAD, 3) high altitude atmospheric research balloons used on earth and elsewhere, 4) high altitude airships, 5) EVA space suit and glove fabrics and bladders, 6) inflatable UAVs, and 7) aerostats.

In particular, longer and more complex operations require new technologies which have increased autonomy to free-up ground control resources and astronauts' time. Perhaps most importantly these robots must be capable of robustly operating in unstructured, natural environments with ever changing conditions. A critical part of this reliability comes from developing platforms that can tolerate interaction with their surroundings. Pneubotic manipulators derive their structure and actuation from pressurized fluid, which allows for control of stiffness, force generation and deformation of the manipulators. These qualities make these soft robots perfectly suited for space exploration missions were planetary rovers are equipped with soft robotic manipulators capable of identifying and manipulating both heavy debris and delicate samples by actively matching their compliance to the given task. Similarly the light-weight, compliant nature of the Pneubotic technology makes them safe for performing collaborative tasks with astronauts.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The mobile material handling sector is a large near-term market where industrial robotics have already established the precedent for the use of robotic automation but are incapable of addressing mobility needs. The remaining limitation for soft manipulators to enter this market is robust and high throughput grasping of wide variety of objects. The STTR work will address this challenge by using contact to quickly identify box edges and position the end effector relative to the target. Multi-point contact and force control will be utilized to ensure a secure grasp. A key piece to bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States is incorporating automation into an agile manufacturing line with the goal of shortening product-development cycles and augmenting worker productivity. However, the problem with traditional robots is that they fall short in meeting the needs of agile manufacturing because of cost, weight, and task limitations. Utilizing soft robots in manufacturing operations requires end-effectors capable of establishing safe and controlled contact to create a closed structural loop, significantly reducing the need for high cost sensors and actuators traditionally required to achieve high positional accuracy and stiffness.

The data is also used post-test to correlate analytical models and optimize vehicle and test design. Because these sensors are small and low mass, they can be used for ground test and for flight. Sensor module miniaturization will further reduce size, mass and cost. Small sensors can be placed in formerly inaccessible locations and can wirelessly provide new insights on system behavior. Wireless remote sensors can be used for thermal, structural and acoustic measurement of systems and subsystems and also provide emergency system halt instructions in the case of leaks, fire or structural failure. Other examples of potential NASA applications include 1) measuring strain in test structures, ground support equipment and vehicles, include high-risk deployables, 2) measuring temperature, strain, voltage and current from power storage and generation systems and 3) measuring pressure, strain and temperature in pumps and pressure vessels. There are many other applications that would benefit from increased, real-time sensing in remote, hard-to-test locations.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) There are many potential commercial applications. As with NASA, the commercial sector would benefit from data that shows real time performance, gives greater test safety and correlates models to enhance design. Angstrom Designs is very familiar with the deployable solar array market, and solar array structures designers could use sensor arrays for many applications, including 1) measuring strain in structures to verify design models, 2) measuring loads and strain in ground support equipment (GSE) to determine GSE effects on ground testing and 3) measuring sensor position and acceleration to determine deployment dynamics. Similar examples exist in flight and ground test for many of the components of spacecraft, from power systems to structures to pressure vessels to propulsion systems. Additional sensing capability will benefit the largest GEO-communications satellite and the smallest CubeSat. Every spacecraft has critical systems and subsystems that, given additional sensing, could be made more efficient, more reliable and safer. These systems could benefit in design, ground test and, potentially, flight operations. Additionally, sensing of ground test equipment can validate the impact of GSE on test results.","Acoustic/Vibration; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Conversion; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Pressure/Vacuum; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Thermal",,The Regents of the University of California,"342 Lagoon Road, Mail Code 2055, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 - 2055",(805) 893-5197,Embedded Intelligent Sensor Systems is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Specifically, STF-ArmorTM provides multi-functional protection within EPG lay-ups. STF-ArmorTM has excellent resistance to puncture, dust infiltration, ballistic and MMOD threats combined with superior flexibility, as compared with conventional textile materials.  Phase I results showed that STFs meeting outgassing and thermal requirements increased the standard force to puncture Orthofabric by 198% with only 10% added mass and no change in flexibility.The properties of STF-ArmorTM textiles are beneficial to a number of NASA applications beyond EPGs. STF-ArmorTM can potentially improve the MMOD resistance when used as a layer within the shell of an inflatable space habitat. STF-Kevlar can potentially replace conventional Kevlar and improve MMOD resistance in a stuffed Whipple shield for spacecraft protection.

The dust repellant coatings investigated in this Phase II research can potentially serve to limit contamination by materials on the suit, which may also find use in chem-bio suits used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and in handling toxic powders more generally. Firefighting gear is another potential market for the STF-ArmorTM materials developed in Phase II. Similar to the EPG dust problem, small soot particles from fires can penetrate deep within the fibers of firefighting suits where they are difficult to wash out and can release toxic chemicals over time. Firefighters and law enforcement protective clothing can also benefit from the improved puncture properties of the STF-ArmorTM materials.

The Decadal Survey outlines several missions that make use of DSMs to enhance their science return. DASHER enables DSMs many ways, including decreased operational costs, more efficient science returns, increased robustness, enhanced flexibility and responsiveness, handling of mission complexity, and enabling new mission concepts. DASHER decreases operational costs by automating routine and tedious tasks and allowing the mission ground crews to focus on more critical and science enabling activities. The DSMs identified by the Decadal Study are the potential future customers of the DASHER. DASHER improves the robustness of DSMs because it can continue providing services even under off-nominal conditions. This feature enables goal-oriented operations where the operators communicate high-level goals and the on-board system adapts to accomplish the goal based on its actual state. Advanced mission concepts also become feasible with DASHER including highly responsive Earth Observation constellations or swarms of small satellites. These types of missions would be cost prohibitive without a high-level autonomy like DASHER. As a future part of the NASA cFS library of applications, the software developed under this project will give mission designers greater flexibility in designing solutions for scientific puzzles.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In recent years, several commercial multi-satellite systems have been proposed including the OneWeb and Planet Labs constellations. OneWeb plans on providing global internet access while Planet Labs provides Earth imagery. These and other proposed constellations will all make use of autonomy to reduce operations costs. A general autonomy system like DASHER could make headway into markets like these, especially if it had a successful flight heritage. Commercial companies generally have standardized operations procedures that lend themselves well to automation. The fact that DASHER is built on the open source cFS platform that provides a multi-satellite infrastructure is also a beneficial feature for commercial customers. Emergent would market the DASHER Suite in these markets as licensable software. The Department of Defense has for some time recognized the vulnerability of their large, monolithic satellites. The fact that these satellites are critical to the national defense makes them tempting targets to adversaries and efforts to reduce their exposure have included discussions of disaggregation, or splitting the payloads up into clusters of smaller satellites, and the related concept of distribution, which is the spreading of services over multiple identical satellites. The DASHER Suite could be used to reduce the operations cost of disaggregated or distributed satellite systems.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Process Monitoring & Control; Sequencing & Scheduling,,University of Pittsburgh,"1238 Benedum Hall, 3700 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 - 0001",(412) 624-7400,Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSM) Technology Framework is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The superior thermomechanical properties of our fuel are attractive for lighter propulsion systems as structural containment requirements are lowered and additional liner/insulation materials are unnecessary.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The non-NASA applications for the proposed launch vehicle stage technology include Air Force, Navy, and National Reconnaissance Organization missions to insert nano satellites into LEO over a range of inclinations and to in-space propulsion, where high thrust at moderate impulse is required. The commercial sector and educational institutions would also benefit from a substantially lower cost access to low earth orbit. The superior thermomechanical properties of the fuel will produce lighter propulsion systems for all applications.",Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster,,Purdue University,"155 S.

Spatially and spectrally resolved scattered light provides ice particle size distributions and compositional analysis, and gives insights about resurfacing events and water cycle processes. A framing camera enables movies of fast processes, including auroras, lightning, and rotating bodies, without requiring additional platform motion for each frame (allowing other instruments to remain focused) and provides spectral analysis for composition and aerosol size analysis. Search for organics and biomarkers through spectral composition analysis helps focus mission resources on the right areas and samples without changing color wheels. A framing camera enables movies of transient processes, including fluid phenomena like geysers.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The low-cost hyperspectral technology will have a significant opportunity in the international commercial, military, and industrial markets. For example, agricultural industries can benefit from crop health monitoring, environmental protection groups can monitor chemical dumping and cleanup, medical applications can improve measurement of biomarkers, military surveillance applications can benefit from spectrally-resolved target identification, and industry can improve quality control with low-cost in-line spectral analysis of manufactured goods.",Detectors (see also Sensors); Infrared; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Radiometric; Visible,,University of Maryland,"7809 Regents Drive, College Park, MD 20742 - 5141",(301) 405-6269,Technologies for Planetary Compositional Analysis and Mapping is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

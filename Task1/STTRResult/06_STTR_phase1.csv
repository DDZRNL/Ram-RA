Omega Optics and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) propose to design and prototype photonic crystal (PC) based NIM optical components for space telescope and beam scanner applications. ""Coating"" metallic gratings on the surfaces of a polymeric photonic crystal NIM device will enable the strong coupling of surface plasmons with the PC based NIM, which may significantly enhance the capability of NIMs in device applications. With such plasmon-enhanced photonic crystal NIMs, Omega Optics and UIUC are particularly interested in building optical components such as NIM coating for chromatic aberration correction and NIM based field-of-view expander. The proposed optical components promise deployable form, reduced system dimensions, and lightweight single element optical devices with performances comparable to high cost multi-element design. They may also provide excellent noise-filtering capabilities for some space applications. Overall, NIMs offer the potential for paper-thin, deployable, complex lens structures, thus promising a breakthrough in optical devices and structures.To prove the feasibility of the proposed idea, optical components will be designed and fabricated during Phase I for proof-of-concept demonstrations. A fully-packaged device prototype will be developed during Phase II.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The proposed photonic crystal based NIM devices can be utilized in a broad range of telescopes, lidars, and/or laser beam scanners in space. For example, the NIM coating for chromatic aberration correction can be utilized to replace multi-element complex lens systems in some telescopes.  The NIM based field-of-view expander can be utilized for mapping telescopes, target-tracking lidars, and wide-angle beam scanners for their capability to collect large solid angle of light.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The advantage offered by plasmon-enhanced photonic crystal NIMs will certainly impact a broad spectrum of space and commercial imaging and optical coating technologies.

The ability to detect and quickly locate and mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety of any long duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or a proposed lunar base or mission to Mars.  Current NASA protocol for finding a spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional microphone, similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the 40 kHz airborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak turbulence.  However, known limitations exist regarding the use of airborne ultrasonic emissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft environment because the downstream side of the leak occurs into the vacuum of space, creating reduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel.  Blockages of the transmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by structural components, avionics, and equipment racks also limit the detection range of such systems.  An alternative approach that we propose is to monitor the spacecraft structure itself---the pressure vessel skin---for leak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a flexible and modular electronics package with fully integrated surface sensor arrays, data acquisition electronics, and radio frequency communication capabilities.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The NASA program with the most risk due to Micro-meteor / Orbital Debris (MMOD) is currently the International Space Station, due to the prolonged exposure on-orbit and the large surface area of the orbiting habitat.  For this reason, it is particularly important that the system be able to be installed easily in a retrofit manner behind closeout blankets in easily accessible areas.  Additionally, it must be fully self-contained, requiring only minimal data interfaces to the ISS for data transfer to the crew and ground controllers.  Although the risk to the Shuttle from MMOD is largely considered to be due to the RCC panels of the Wing Leading Edge and Nose Cone, significant risk is still present in the pressurized portions of the vehicle.  Additionally, such a system could be used to monitor for leaks in the airlocks and other sealed vacuum interfaces.  As part of the Orion Program, NASA will attempt to increase safety by an order of magnitude over the current Shuttle vehicle.  MMOD is a major source of risk for the Shuttle, and will continue to be a risk for the Orion, despite its improved MMOD shielding.  The proposed system could likely be fully integrated with the Orion avionics systems, providing continuous monitoring of the entire structure while requiring only minimal vehicle resources and launch mass, as well as very little maintenance.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Beyond the direct application of the proposed technology for detecting leaks to vacuum in pressurized space vehicles, significant opportunities exist within the more broad application field of applying PZT sensor arrays to Nondestructive Evaluation.

Unfortunately, this will not be acceptable for lunar and interplanetary missions where resupply is difficult.  We can greatly reduce the water consumption by radiating most of the heat load to space.  However, a radiator rejects heat at a relatively constant rate, whereas the heat generation rate depends on the workload.  Without a way to match the heat removal rate, the astronaut could alternately suffer both heat exhaustion and frostbite.  Therefore, TDA Research, Inc. proposes to regulate the heat rejection rate with a freezable heat exchanger.  In Phase I we will conduct tests to show that the heat transfer rate can be self-regulated from high to low heat loads and vice-versa.  Our research institute partner, Portland State University, will design zero-g loop heat pipes to transfer heat from the heat exchanger to the radiator.  In Phase II we will design and build a full-scale freezable heat exchanger and lightweight radiator and evaluate its performance in an environmental vacuum chamber.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  A freezable radiator to accommodate the 9.1% expansion during freeze will provide thermal system control to space-based systems (both manned and un-manned).  Our freezable radiator is lightweight and quickly responds to changing environments or metabolic loads; both freezing and thawing as needed.  Further, the technology can be readily scaled to applications other than Portable Life Support, such as spacecraft, space-based stations and lunar / Mars stations.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The largest and nearest term commercial applications are the use of freeze tolerant tubing on earth.  These earth-based applications include sprinkler systems and potable water supply in homes and commercial buildings.  This market is potentially very large and virtually un-tapped because of the lack of a viable freeze tolerant tube.  The Insurance Institute for Property Loss Reduction says frozen pipes have cost the insurance companies in the USA $4.2 billion in damage to insured homes and buildings over the past decade.  The savings in insurance rates alone could more than offset the cost to the user, who would have the added benefit of not having valuables destroyed by water damage and their lives disturbed during repairs of the water damage.",Portable Life Support,,Portland State University,"P.O.

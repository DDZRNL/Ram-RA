The combination will create a closed loop in which the model suggests process parameter settings for test builds and the sensors provide feedback to the model. This creates a powerful tool for iterative process development far faster than is currently possible by standard simulation methods and accessible to a wide range of potential SLM innovators who are not simulation specialists.The key innovation will be the development of a simple set of empirical equations that relate SLM process inputs to actual build results. This is accomplished by a combination of finite element simulations and verification experiments whose process parameters are selected by a design-of-experiments methodology. The resulting easily calculable empirical functions (a.k.a. the fast predictive model) will replace arduous simulation and undirected trial-and-error as methods of SLM process development. A user-friendly interface will be written that links the fast predictive model to sensorized SLM chamber to allow easy, rapid and flexible SLM process development. The simplicity of the system, and relatively low cost of the SLM chamber will allow large numbers of new innovators and industries to enter the field of SLM and develop novel processes that meet their application needs, as well as help solve specific problems of NASA interest. Phase I activities include 1) development of the fast predictive model, 2) development of a control algorithm and user interface linking the model to the SLM chamber, and 3) demonstration of the integrated system for rapid development of novel SLM processes.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The technology developed under this STTR will enable rapid development and optimization of SLM processes. The experimental process development chamber can be configured to simulate existing commercial SLM machines, and thus process developed with the proposed system can be exported to these machines (which are not themselves well designed for process development). This supports the goals of the SLM laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center as well as participation of the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate in the Materials Genome Initiative. Implementation of the fast predictive model technology can improve the processes for SLM manufactured parts. This impacts a number of space platforms and terrestrial applications too long to list. Of particular interest to NASA is the use of in-process monitoring to verify build quality. Because the proposed system has in-process monitoring built into the process development methodology, it has a high likelihood of developing processes of which NASA engineers can be confident and for documentation of process quality can be compiled.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Aerospace commercial applications have high overlap with NASA applications including strong interest in fabrication of rocket engine components and a variety of other light-weighted structures.Apart from a desire for faster SLM process development, the commercial market also has a keen interest in in-process monitoring and closed loop process control. The use of feedback from in-process sensors both to develop the fast predictive model and conduct rapid process development entails concepts and techniques that are closely related to in-process control. (I.e., in-process control is essentially continuous, real-time, in situ process development.) Thus it is likely that fast predictive models, as developed under this project, can be implemented to facilitate or enable closed loop process control.Finally, we note that a key goal of this project is to provide a system that will make SLM process development accessible to a large number of new innovators and industries, allowing them to enter the field and create a wide range of applications that are currently unidentified.",Analytical Methods; Launch Engine/Booster; Metallics; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Thermal,,Wright State University,"3640 Colonel Glenn Highway, Dayton, OH 45435 - 0001",(937) 775-5143,Experimental and Analytical Technologies for Additive Manufacturing is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This technology will fulfill the ever-growing mission demands of the CubeSat and NanoSat market by enabling dedicated launch for 5-6 kg class payloads. Comparable launch vehicle stages in this size class are not currently commercially available. The proposed green-propellant system will have significant advancements over alternative technologies in cost, safety, and mission capability. During Phase I, the development team's objectives include preliminary design of an upper stage and the test fire of a demonstration prototype. This innovative stage is designed such that it can integrate directly into NASA Marshall's NanoLaunch 1200 architecture.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The availability of a dedicated CubeSat launch vehicle will provide NASA a solution for low cost payload insertion for their in-house CubeSats such as IceCube or FireFly. The proposed propulsion solution will offer a significantly higher degree of mission flexibility than is possible with rideshare delivery methods. The specific stages proposed for development would also be ideally suited for integration with current NASA launch vehicle efforts, such as NASA Marshall's NanoLaunch 1200. Either as an integrated component in this vehicle, or as part of another commercial package, the proposed launch vehicle stage will provide NASA the capability to expand programs for universities and research institutions such as the CubeSat Launch Initiative.This solicitation and proposed technology aligns with NASA's 2014 Strategic Plan Objective 3.2, providing access to space.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Since 2000, there have been several hundred CubeSats launched, adding value to a variety of commercial, research, civil, and military applications.

This increase in demand has created a backlog for CubeSats for ride along markets. This backlog, as well as the ever growing capability of CubeSats has created a market for dedicated CubeSat launch vehicles.Potential non-NASA customers include universities, small businesses, and research institutes. A number of universities have active CubeSat development programs that would benefit from having a dedicated launch vehicle. The proposed innovation is also an ideal solution to responsive space challenges.Additional commercial applications exist for the proposed 4th stage beyond that of a dedicated launch vehicle upper stage. The stages' compact size allows it to be used as a secondary payload post-deployment propulsion system on many launch vehicles. This will give CubeSats and MicroSats significant delta-V capabilities when launched as a secondary payload.","Exciters/Igniters; Fluids; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Prototyping; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine",,Utah State University,"4100 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 - 4100",(435) 797-2775,Affordable Nano/Micro Launch Propulsion Stages is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This system is offered herein as large area panels that may be seamed via RF welding with our space partner, ILC Dover, to form inflatable habitat bladders. This superior class of low Tg polymers exhibited ultra-low air and H2 permeance (0.31 cc/100in2?Atm?day - post triple cold flex) before and after being subjected to the harsh, triple fold (180?) cold flexure (-50 ?C) test.

The proposed detector is based on the novel mercurous halide materials, Hg2X2 (X=I, Cl, Br). The mercurous halides are new wide band-gap semiconductor detector materials that can provide radiation detection with low cost, high performance and long term stability. Despite years of research, no explored room temperature semiconductor detection candidates can satisfy all three features simultaneously. At Brimrose, we have successfully developed the growth procedures for high quality Hg2X2 crystals for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) imaging systems. Recently, we have been able to engineer our growth process toward gamma radiation detection and have demonstrated initial encouraging detector response from Hg2I2 to both gamma and alpha particle incident radiations. The focus will be on the material engineering aspect of the detector material itself (i.e., crystal growth and post growth processing), as well as on the detector fabrication and system design.

No current compact sensors have the tolerance for liquid water that is specifically required for portable life support systems (PLSS). Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will develop a luminescence-based optical sensor probe to monitor carbon dioxide, oxygen, and humidity, and selected trace contaminants. Our monitor will incorporate robust CO2, O2, and H2O partial pressure sensors interrogated by a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The sensors will not only tolerate liquid water but will actually operate while wet, and can be remotely connected to electronic circuitry by an optical fiber cable immune to electromagnetic interference. For space systems, these miniature sensor elements with remote optoelectronics give unmatched design flexibility for measurements in highly constrained volume systems such as PLSS. Our flow-through monitor design includes an optical sensor we have already developed for PLSS humidity monitoring, and an optical oxygen sensor, both of them based on a common IOS technology. In prior projects IOS has demonstrated a CO2 sensor capable of operating while wet that also met PLSS environmental and analytical requirements, but did not meet life requirements. A new generation of CO2 sensors will be developed to advance this sensor technology and fully meet all NASA requirements, including sensor life. The totally novel approach will overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art luminescent sensors for CO2. Additional sensors will be developed to monitor trace contaminants often found in the ventilation loop as result of material off-gassing or crew member metabolism. IOS has established collaboration with UTC Aerospace Systems to produce prototypes for space qualification, and will conduct extensive testing under simulated space conditions, ensuring a smooth path to technology infusion.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Advanced Extra-Vehicular Activity systems are necessary for the successful support of the International Space Station beyond 2020, for future human space exploration missions, for in-space microgravity EVA, and for planetary surface exploration. In collaboration with NASA personnel, IOS has identified several needs and potential applications of multiparameter probe sensors, particularly for space suits. These include the International Space Station (ISS) Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), the Orion-derived Launch Entry Abort (LEA), and future Advanced EMU development. The ISS EMU requirement is the highest priority, because problems have been reported in the CO2 sensor in use under conditions of liquid water condensation, and because solving problems reported in the CO2 scrubber system require a humidity sensor capable of withstanding water condensation. NASA guidance and the participation of UTC Aerospace Systems will ensure that the prototypes resulting from this project are compatible with the ISS EMU PLSS system.

The Lofted Regolith Sampling (LoRS) architecture is based on advanced astrodynamics and autonomy that is robust to target-body uncertainties and is adaptive during operations. The LoRS architecture is based on several key phases that ultimately lead to a thorough characterization of the target body and collection of multiple samples while avoiding complex and highly unpredictable landing requirements. The first phase of this characterization is the estimation of the body's gravitational field and remote sensing of the NEO surface. After sufficiently characterizing the body, the second phase of the proposed architecture is to disturb material on the surface of the small body such that it is lofted into orbit about the body. This disturbance can be initiated with a variety of chemical explosions, kinetic impactors, or other forces which will be evaluated during the proposed effort. The third phase is to remotely characterize the lofted material to identify key attributes such as size and composition. The fourth phase of operations is for the orbiting spacecraft to approach a specific portion of the debris field and collect physical samples from the NEO. Once samples have been collected in orbit, the vehicle can further evaluate the samples on-board, identifying key constituents etc., and return this information to terrestrial scientists.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The LoRS architecture will directly support infusion into NASA science and exploration programs that seek to characterize and obtain materials from asteroids and/or comets.

In particular, energetic particles from SPEs associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) constitute a highly dynamic and penetrating radiation environment that may adversely affect not only beyond-Low-Earth-Orbit missions, but also aircraft avionics, communications, and airline crew/passenger health. It is crucial to develop a capability to forecast SPEs and their effects on systems to guide planning of mission-related tasks and to adopt risk mitigation strategies for personnel and equipment.In this project, CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) propose to develop a comprehensive modeling capability - SPE Forecast (SPE4) - comprising state-of-the-art modules that individually address important aspects of the overall problem, integrated within a novel Python-language-based framework. SPE4 will include: (a) the MAG4 code for probability forecasts of flares/CMEs, and resulting SPEs, based on SDO/HMI magnetograms, interfaced to (b) the PATH code for transport of emitted particles through the heliosphere, interfaced to (c) Geant4-based transport calculations for particles through geomagnetic field modulation and atmospheric interactions (in low-Earth orbits), to finally yield spectra of SPE-induced energetic protons and heavy ions (and secondary particles) as a function of time and location. In Phase I, we will develop an SPE4 framework prototype, demonstrate automated execution and information flow between different codes, and validate against data for a known event. In Phase II, we will collaborate with Vanderbilt University to interface the resulting particle spectra with downstream codes to calculate single-event effects in electronics. The SPE4 framework, interfaces, and procedures will be optimized for rapid ""event to effects"" predictions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed effort is aligned with the goals of NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) program that is focused on developing a predictive understanding of solar activity and its effects on Earth and space-based assets. The newly developed and validated ""event-to-effects"" modeling capability will be synergistic to the strategic capability models available to the scientific community (e.g., via the Community Coordinated Modeling Center  CCMC - at Goddard/GSFC). In fact, the MAG4 solar activity forecasting code within the overall SPE4 package is already (individually) available from CCMC. With the subsequent emphasis on linking with codes to calculate effects in electronics, optimizing SPE4 interfaces and calculation procedures, and continued validation, this project will also focus on transition towards operational use. This effort also addresses objectives outlined in NASA's Human Research Roadmap and OCT Technology Roadmap TA06  Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems, specifically, the sub-technology area of Radiation, including Space Weather Prediction and Protection Systems. The SPE4 software will specifically address the limitations facing mission operational planning in terms of forecasting the occurrence, magnitude, and all-clear periods of SPEs. The SPE4 framework will also support interfaces to other downstream codes for radiation effects calculations (e.g., to analyze and design effective shielding materials).","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Dynamic variations in the high-energy, highly-penetrating solar particle environment can adversely affect aircraft (especially near the Poles), cause navigational and GPS equipment interference, disrupt spacecraft electronic systems, and cause disruption/equipment failure in communication systems. For DoD agencies and commercial entities with space-based or high-altitude assets, an efficient and accurate predictive capability for the radiation environment at desired locations or along preset trajectories, and resulting effects caused in systems (electronics, materials), will be a significant aid to mission planners for scheduling tasks and to adopt risk mitigation strategies for equipment. Changes in the Earth's ionosphere due to SPEs can modify the transmission path and even block transmission of High Frequency (1-30 MHz) radio signals. These frequencies are used by amateur (ham) radio operators, commercial airlines, and government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Defense. Terrestrial applications such as electric power transmission systems can be affected by SPE-induced changes to the geomagnetic field leading to blackouts. Induced stray currents leading to corrosion in above-ground oil pipelines (near the Poles) is another concern. In all these cases, a predictive capability for SPE-induced radiation spikes can help equipment managers intelligently manage operations and prevent catastrophic failures.","Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",,The University of Alabama in Huntsville,"301 Sparkman Drive NW, Huntsville, AL 35899 - 1911",(256) 824-2657,Space Weather is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

A high sensitivity optical absorption technique known as wavelength modulation spectroscopy will be used in the sensor.The system will be light weight (<1 kg), low power (1 W), and fast (minimum 1 Hz measurement rate). The specifications of the proposed multigas sensor will provide reliable gas concentration measurements to ensure extended operation of the PLSS during extravehicular activities (EVA).

Since any computational optimization process relies on simulation models for identifying the impact of design changes in meeting performance expectations and improving metrics of goodness, it is essential that the uncertainty quantification of these models is captured by the optimization. Fuzzy Logic (FL) provides a systematic approach for introducing linguistic articulation of mental perception into a mathematical framework. In the proposed project the FL approach will be used for introducing in an automated multidisciplinary optimization process the human judgment and the expert opinion associated with the credibility of the modeling and simulations (as stated in the NASA-STD-7009) which are utilized for making decisions. The proposing firm has developed a Decision Support Toolkit (DS Toolkit) which can be used for multidisciplinary design and for balancing many multiple competing performance objectives. The multidisciplinary analysis is done automatically due to specialized algorithms and capabilities which are embedded in the DS Toolkit; both discrete and continuous design variables can be defined. The proposed research will develop the ability to consider the credibility of the models and of the simulations which are used for evaluating the performance requirements and the performance metrics during the analysis. A Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) capability will be developed for this purpose. The membership functions in the FLS will be reflecting the credibility scores assigned by subject matter experts to each one of the eight credibility factors of a simulation. The rule bank in the FLS will capture the expert opinion of the decision makers on how the credibility of the simulations will influences the decisions which are made by the optimization process.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed research will offer a new approach for multidisciplinary optimization that does not exist in any form in any of the current commercial or open source codes. It will offer a new capability to NASA Programs for conducting optimizations while accounting for uncertainty quantification associated with the credibility of models and simulations. Subject matter experts will be able to identify the credibility of each simulation which is used in the optimization by grading each one of the eight credibility factors prescribed in NASA-STD-7009. Decision makers will be able to provide their input in linguistic format on how to interpret the credibility scores when making design decisions. At that point it will also be possible to consider how critical each decision is to the success of a mission.

Examples applications include Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, communications relay systems, and environmental and atmospheric sensing. The requirements for HALE aircraft dictate that they have very high lift-to-drag ratios, and are extremely lightweight, resulting in high aspect ratios with significant structural flexibility. This results in a dynamically nonlinear vehicle with highly coupled rigid body and aeroelastic structural dynamics. Atmospheric turbulence and gust loading of substantial variance can significantly impact the performance of HALE aircraft. Due to the vast importance of gust loading on these lightweight aircraft platforms, Systems Technology, Inc. and the University of Michigan propose the development of the Disturbance Observer for Gust Load Alleviation (DOGLA) where the gust loading will be actively estimated and subsequently rejected. DOGLA will be implemented on a nonlinear HALE aircraft model in conjunction with a robust primary flight control design. Both the disturbance observer and primary flight control designs will be implemented within a novel gain-scheduling framework to address nonlinear dynamics and varying flight conditions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) DOGLA falls under the NASA Aeronautical Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), which in 2014 announced six research thrusts.

The proposed innovation also supports the ""real-time, system-wide safety assurance"" and ""ultra-efficient commercial vehicles"" research thrusts. In terms of specific ARMD programs, DOGLA applies to: 1) the Fundamental Aeronautics Program wherein DOGLA provides an advanced technology to improve performance of current and future air vehicles; 2) Aviation Safety Program wherein the technology supports assurance of flight critical systems and assurance of safe and effective aircraft control under hazardous conditions; and 3) the Aeronautics Test Program wherein the technology can enhance test operations of new, novel technology demonstrators including the NASA Global Hawk HALE and the X-56A.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) DOGLA has application to the worldwide aircraft manufacturing industry of both manned and unmanned aircraft, with focus on HALE aircraft.

It is particularly important for intelligent and adaptive (autonomous) space robotics software, since the nature of autonomy is such that many behaviors in deployment will never be seen before, without extensive testing. The primary approach to testing such systems at present is manual testing, which is expensive, time-consuming and, most importantly, often ineffective. The best alternative to manual testing is automated generation of test cases. Current automated test generation tools are mostly academic prototypes. Many simply produce unit tests over all methods of a Java program, and have a single algorithm for testing. The most successful automated test generation efforts for real-world large systems have been custom work of experts with deep understanding of the application. At present, such experts using automated test generation end up writing the system in the language of the software under test, with little tool support. Such systems are brittle and cost prohibitive. Much labor is duplicated due to lack of tools. We will develop a full-featured language and tool chain for automated test generation development, based on the open source Template Scripting Testing Language (TSTL). We will produce a commercial prototype version based on TSTL that supports efficient C and C++ automated test generation and code verification. We will provide developers with prototypes of sophisticated test generation algorithms and fully documented example test systems on which to base their own efforts. The products of Phase I will be a revised TSTL language standard, a prototype tool for producing test systems for C and C++ code, prototype implementations of highly effective automated test algorithms, and documented examples of testing systems using TSTL.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Testing of complex software systems is a major activity in almost all NASA missions, particularly those involving unmanned autonomous robotic systems. These tools can be applied to improve the effectiveness and re-usability of NASA software testing systems, while reducing labor costs (or enabling more effort in test development with the same labor). The language chosen for implementation is C, the primary language of development of real-time embedded robotics systems at NASA. Use of automated test generation is a long-standing goal of NASA software development efforts, with major research initiatives at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NASA Ames Research Center that we expect to be potential early adopters. The design of our system is informed by experience with building test automation tools for major NASA missions, so the applicability of the tools is likely to be high.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Complex software systems require effective testing, especially as the everyday world increasingly relies on ubiquitous embedded software, and with the emergence of autonomous systems (like self-driving cars) as near-future possibilities. In addition to cyberphysical systems that have an impact on safety, many software systems have potential security problems with a high economic cost. Effective automated test generation is one of the most effective ways for companies faced with potentially disastrous software bugs to mitigate the risk of software failure. The tools developed in this project can provide a cost-effective way to apply more sophisticated testing techniques and improve software reliability without having to hire automated software testing experts. The languages chosen (C and C++) are widely used in embedded software systems, and are also the languages in which much security software is written (e.g., the recent Heartbleed and Goto Fail security flaws were C code errors), so effective testing tools for C/C++ are a driving commercial need.

Current methods for CFD modeling rely on general materials properties to determine fluid structure interactions. This introduces uncertainty when modeling extreme conditions, where materials degrade and properties may change as a consequence. This also limits the use of CFD as a modeling tool to assist in material selection and specification. CFDRC in partnership with Sandia National Laboratories proposes to develop a computational materials model to simulate degradation of a ceramic matrix composite material under the high temperature, high velocity flow conditions of the propulsion environment. The objective is to provide a computational tool to assist NASA in the selection and optimization of propulsion system materials and to predict material degradation and failure throughout the service life in extreme conditions. During Phase I the team will demonstrate a mesoscale materials model based on peridynamics, a theory of continuum mechanics that can describe fracture and defect progression at the level of the microstructure. Peridynamics provides a theoretical framework to dynamically simulate fracture and mechanical erosion at the mesoscale, where properties such as tensile strength and toughness are affected by features of the microstructure and composite design. The proposed modeling scheme use CFD to establish the thermal-mechanical stresses imposed at the boundaries of the structure. Peridynamics simulations will be used to determine the evolution of the macroscale properties as a function of microstructure, damage and boundary conditions.

MEDSEM will simultaneously measure X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Backscattered Electron Spectra, Optical Spectra and Mass Spectra. Caltech will transfer to CL the microfabrication technology for vacuum-encapsulating, electron-transmissive SiN membranes, the key enabling component without which MEDSEM would not be possible. Caltech will also transfer the results of electron-optic simulations performed for optimizing the MEDSEM instrument configuration.The 12-month Phase I effort will be aimed at demonstrating the proof-of-principle for MEDSEM via an experimental setup made up of mostly commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts: miniature electron sources, an x-ray detector and a double-chambered test setup. High-energy electrons will be generated in the first, evacuated chamber, and these electrons will pass through the Caltech-fabricated SiN membrane into the second chamber (maintained at Martian ambient pressure), to strike planetary analog samples thereby generating characteristic XRF. The XRF spectra will be captured by a COTS x-ray detector which is present in the second chamber. Contingent on a successful, follow-on, Phase II effort, the proof-of-principle experiment will be expanded to demonstrate the remaining simultaneous measurement modalities, namely the acquisition of Backscattered Electron Spectra, Optical Spectra and Mass Spectra. Microfabrication of the fully-integrated, field-emitter array of miniaturized electron probes will be pursued during Phase II.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) MEDSEM satisfies NASA's stated need for new and innovative scientific measurements for in situ planetary exploration. To date, although miniaturizing scanning electron microscopes has been a ""holy grail"" for developers of planetary instruments, an in situ electron microprobe instrument has never flown. Once successfully demonstrated, MEDSEM would be a strong candidate for planetary instrument payloads for NASA's future landed missions, as described by the National Research Council Committee on the Planetary Science Decadal Survey for future NASA missions from 2013  2022. According to the Decadal Survey, primary planetary targets for landed missions include the moon, Mars, Venus and Europa.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In the field of materials science and engineering outside of NASA, there is a great need for capable, field-portable instruments that are rugged and reliable. As with NASA missions, size, weight and power consumption are of concern for humans transporting these instruments into remote locations for geological studies, environmental monitoring and oil exploration. An added concern is the overall cost of the instrument, especially for widespread acceptance and use. A successful MEDSEM instrument would open up numerous applications in the educational arena. At both the K-12 and college level, MEDSEM could be used for science demonstrations as well as for hands-on experimentation and research in chemistry, solid-state physics, geology and materials science laboratories. Although MEDSEM cannot match the spatial resolution of terrestrial laboratory instruments such as scanning electron microscopes (mm vs nm), still it could serve as a rapid screening device with the ability to answer basic composition-related questions. MEDSEM's primary advantage, of course, is its ability to simultaneously make multiple, different measurements on the samples being studied in ordinary room air. It is anticipated that MEDSEM will continue to evolve as an instrument, incorporating the latest advancements in micro- and nanotechnology.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods",,Caltech,"1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, CA 91125 - 0001",(626) 395-3339,Technologies for Planetary Compositional Analysis and Mapping is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This work will develop a machine learning framework for long-range prediction of both surface and subsurface terrain characteristics that: (1) indicate the excavation-value of the material and (2) describe how hazardous terrain is to a robotic excavator. Factors influencing importance include the mineral composition of the material and the presence and concentration of volatiles. Terrain hazards will include loose terrain that could cause wheels to sink or slip as well as the presence of surface and subsurface rocks that would inhibit excavation. This work will develop technologies for long-range terrain mechanical characterization and volatile prediction with high spatial coverage. Ground penetrating radars and neutron spectrometers provide reasonable accurate estimates of subsurface composition and volatile accumulation; however, they are limited in sampling range and area. Cameras and LIDAR will instead be used to measure reflected radiation, temperature, and geometry at long range with a wide field of view. From these measurements, the thermal properties and spectral reflectance curves of the terrain will be estimated, since both are correlated to terrain composition and traversability. These properties, along with geometry, will be fed into a machine learning framework for prediction of terrain characteristics. Priors will be generated based on data from orbital satellites.

Infrared thermography can also be used to accurate measure minute variations in surface temperatures. High performance infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) allow rapid acquisition of a 2D surface maps--indispensable in planetary sciences. By using two different cut-off detectors integrated into a single FPA to simultaneously image a planet we can avoid atmospheric effect and much more accurately map minute variations in the surface temperature, or gain a clearer picture of the atmospheric composition. In recent years, Type-II InAs/GaSb superlattices have experienced significant developmentwe have played a pioneering role in the rapid development of that technology. However, the full potential of Type-II superlattice has not been fully explored and alternate superlattice architectures hold great promise; one of the most promising is gallium free InAsSb/InAs Type-II superlattices. In this project, we propose to study strain-balanced nBn InAs1-xSbx/InAs Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors and mini-arrays for LWIR/LWIR dual-band detection. Using this new superlattice structure, it is expected to achieve longer minority carrier lifetime. Longer minority carrier lifetime results in lower dark current, lower noise, higher operation temperature, and higher quantum efficiency. Applying this superlattice design to dual-band LWIR/LWIR FPAs, it is expected to achieve higher quantum efficiency, lower dark current, higher specific detectivity (D*) and reduced Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD).This work will form the basis of the Phase II work in which we will use this new superlattice structure to develop and deliver LWIR/LWIR dual-band FPAs for planetary sciences.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) LWIR is of special interest to NASA for planetary observation missions. The LWIR wavelength region is also an ideal wavelength to look at other planets, or look back at the earth from space, and accurately map minute variations in the surface and/or atmospheric temperatures. Furthermore, by using simultaneous measurements from two different LWIR wavelengths (i.e. a two-color camera) it is possible to better isolate the surface temperature from that of the atmosphere or vice versa. Using the infrared emission of the planetary body or active illumination via a laser source it is also possible to carefully look at the atmospheric absorption and perform chemical spectroscopy. Many molecules such as H2O, CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, NH3 have absorption lines in the infrared and the ability to compositionally map the concentrations of these and many other molecules.

The goal a moisture tolerant, drop-in replacement for the current CO2 sensor. Preliminary work achieved detection sensitivities for CO2, CH4, O2, and N2 of 1000, 300, 1000 and 1500 ppm, respectively. ERGS reports gas partial pressures directly and can operate tolerate pure oxygen. The response to all gases is linear from 0 to 100%. No consumable supplies are required and ERGS is self-calibrating.The ERGS technique is compact and robust and has low electrical power requirements. Its detection performance and physical characteristics make it well suited as a flight-capable system spacesuit gas sensor. ERGS detects gases by recording the Raman spectrum of a gas mixture flowing through a short length (~50 cm) of hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF). Sensitivity is more than 800 times better than conventional Raman spectroscopy since the gas and light confinement increases the Raman interaction length.This proposed STTR project is designed to bring ERGS technology from its current TRL 6 to TRL 8 or 9 at the end of Phase II. Phase I work by Mesa Photonics includes improving ERGS optical design, verifying gas measurement accuracy over a wide range of mixture compositions and total pressures, and testing response to condensing moisture. The CREOL team will design custom HC-PCF that is better matched to ERGS wavelength requirements and, possibly, have a larger diameter hollow core.

The ERGS-based sensor developed in this project is anticipated to meet mission requirements for current the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) and the upcoming Advanced EMU. The ERGS sensor offers the advantage of simultaneous measurement of key breathing air constituents (CO2, O2 and N2) and advancements during the proposed project may enable measurement of ammonia and water vapor.

Since ERGS can sensitively measure CO2, O2, N2 and CH4 simultaneously in real-time, it can provide the gas partial pressure data necessary to discern naturally occurring CO2 versus any leakage in the containment system. The ability to account for all key environmental gases, unattended, with a small footprint and low power requirements and without the need for supplies or consumables make it an ideal solution for networks of sensors around CCS sites. Advancement to the technology achieved in the proposed project will have direct implications to the application of ERGS for CCS and other terrestrial gas sensing applications.","Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Detectors (see also Sensors); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Pressure/Vacuum; Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Visible",,University of Central Florida,"12201 Research Parkway, Suite 501, Orlando, FL 32826 - 3246",(407) 823-3778,Gas Sensing Technology Advancements for Spacesuits is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Innovation focuses on a specific, challenging scenario: sub-surface access of multiple lava tubes by drones far enough from Earth for speed-of-light latency to preclude direct human control. The technology will be broadly applicable to resource prospecting in cold traps, dark craters, cryovolcanoes, asteroids, comets, and other planets. The technology is also applicable to Earth-relevant problems such as the detection of poisonous and explosive gases and flammable dust in mines; and surveying urban canyons; exploring bunkers and caves.The proposed innovation is the development of Anytime Motion Planners that can generate feasible guidance routines to accomplish subsurface prospecting by planetary drones. Anytime Motion Planners are algorithms that can quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. In addition to Anytime Motion Planners, optimal guidance routines will also be innovated in this work by formulating the Generic Autonomous Guidance Optimal Control Problem (Problem G&C) (Pavone, Acikmese, Nesnas, & Starek, 2013) as a convex optimization problem and employing interior-point methods to solve the resulting problem to global optimality. This work will determine whether optimal solutions may be computed quickly enough to be useful in practice.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The immediate markets within NASA are for exploration and science missions to surface destinations on the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. The proposed innovations in guidance improve mission capability by enhancing landing and flying precision; enabling access to previously inaccessible terrain; providing accurate autonomous target-relative navigation; modeling a target onboard a spacecraft; and providing a flight-ready, power efficient solution to TRN. Potential applications to NASA include:(1) Resource Prospector Mission, currently in Phase A with a target launch in 2019, has a $250M budget reserved. Science return is dependent on landing in an identified region with high volatile content and near regions of permanent dark. Polar terrain on the Moon is hazardous and lighting varies locally, so precise landing relative to terrain is exceptionally important.(2) The Mars Science Lab (total project budget of $2.5B with ~$550M expended on operations ) and Mars 2020 (budget $1.5B ). The technology developed by this research could enhance landing precision and enable landing at the location of highest value, enhancing mission science return.(3) At least six planned NASA missions  Asteroid Redirect, Comet Surface Sample Return, Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return, Lunar Geophyisical Network, Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher (Max C), and Venus In-Situ explorer  could be enhanced by this technology.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Astrobotic's proposed approach to reaching other commercial markets is to target the most likely candidates for market acceptance and profitability in Phase I and Phase II, particularly UAV application for defense and surveying.

At present, commercially available TE devices typically offer limited heat-to-electricity conversion efficiencies, well below the fundamental thermodynamic limit, calling for the development of higher efficiency materials. The team of MicroXact Inc. and Virginia Tech is proposing to develop a revolutionary high efficiency thermoelectric material fabricated on completely new fabrication principles. The proposed material and device will provide NASA with much needed highly efficient (ZT>1.6), macroscopically thick (from 100s of micrometers to over a millimeter) thermoelectric material that will permit >15% conversion efficiency of thermoelectric generation when using high grade space-qualified sources. The proposed material is comprised of PbTe/PbSe three-dimensional ""wells"" of PbTe/PbSe quantum dot superlattices (QDS) fabricated by a conformal coating of a structured silicon substrate with electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (eALD). In Phase I of the project the feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated by proving ZT>1.6. In Phase II the team will fabricate the thermoelectric generator, and will demonstrate conversion efficiencies exceeding 15%. After Phase II, MicroXact will commercialize the technology.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The largest immediate NASA application of the proposed thermoelectric materials is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, already being used in a large number of NASA missions. The unmatched efficiency combined with the light weight of the proposed material will provide the competitive advantage to MicroXact sufficient for successful market penetration, and will result in significant savings to NASA. Other potential NASA applications include energy recovery from processors and other electronics. The proposed concept, when developed and commercialized, is expected to cause a significant impact on the cost, safety and reliability of future NASA missions.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed ultraefficient thermoelectric materials and devices are expected to find applications in automotive and aviation industry (to reduce the fuel consumption), as well as in electronic device cooling (microprocessors, focal plane arrays, etc.), food storage/processing (wine cellars, refrigerant-free refrigerators).

Based on the success of the current Mars Science Laboratory rover instrument ChemCam, the first ever laser-based spectrographic system to be selected as an instrument on a NASA spacecraft, the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP) has developed and tested a prototype instrument. This new instrument is capable of at least 10,000 times greater sensitivity than the ChemCam instrument, allowing faster measurements up to 8 m away with a focused laser beam. This integrated, compact remote instrument is called the Compact integrated instrument for Remote Spectroscopy Analysis (CiiRSA). Replacing the existing laser with the Q-Peak proposed laser will reduce CiiRSA's weight by 30 % and volume by 20 %.In Phase I, Q-Peak will design, develop and build a laser that will produce 1-2 mJ of energy in < 2 ns pulse duration at 1047 nm and our partner HIGP will characterize the CiiRSA instrument at the anticipated energy and wavelength of the full system (5 mJ at 523 nm) to understand the ranging and performance of the final system.In Phase II, Q-Peak is proposing an ultra-compact laser with 10 cm3 in volume that will produce > 5 mJ, < 2 ns duration pulses at 523 nm at repetition rates from single-shot to 100 Hz. The entire laser system will be integrated into a suite of instruments that our partner at HIGP has developed to reduce the overall SWaP of the CiiRSA system.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA applications are in systems requiring compact, efficient, reliable, moderate-energy, nanosecond-pulsed lasers. For planetary exploration, these applications are in LIBS/Raman/LIF systems used for planetary surface characterization and in lidar systems for atmospheric measurements of aerosol concentrations and distributions, as well as precision ranging for planetary surface mapping from satellites and other spacecraft. The laser we propose to develop is compact, efficient, rugged and reliable, making it ideal for planetary missions.Given the high sensitivity of launch requirements to SWaP considerations and to reliability, we feel that the proposed laser source is uniquely positioned for standoff LIBS based missions. Other NASA mission profiles or applications that would benefit from generically small, light- weight, low power laser sources would be equally well served.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Commercial applications are in portable LIBS systems to replace the current bulky, inefficient, and less reliable lamp-pumped lasers now employed. LIBS, besides having numerous scientific applications in materials characterization, can also be used in industrial applications for process control through monitoring of exhaust streams, analysis of pharmaceuticals, profiling of metals, composition determinations of minerals in mining and detection of contamination in the environment.There are numerous applications for green lasers besides LIBS that require minimized SWaP. Green Illuminators with sufficiently high beam quality to enable long atmospheric transmission suffer from excess size and weight. The proposed laser would produce the required beam quality with a SWaP advantage of near factor 2. Green lasers can be use in the Non-Lethal Laser Dazzler field. Dazzlers, are most effective in green due to the eye's high sensitivity in the green spectral region but also require the most careful spatial beam profile control to insure that both spatially and temporally, the laser energy never reaches or exceeds the damage threshold of the eye. Q-Peak's advantage would be in having developed an extremely small, compact, simple, and rugged technology for generation of single mode laser pulse. This laser device will be much better suited for fieldable systems than present products both on SWaP, mode profile, and affordability considerations.","3D Imaging; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Image Analysis; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Navigation & Guidance",,University of Hawaii,"2440 Campus Road, Box 368, Honolulu, HI 96822 - 2234",(808) 956-7880,Technologies for Planetary Compositional Analysis and Mapping is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Smaller, smarter, and more efficient systems are being developed that could do as well as large, expensive, and heavy systems in the past. The 'science' fiction becomes reality fueled by advances in computing, materials, and nano-technology. These new technologies found their way into CubeSats  a booming business in the 21st century. CubeSats are no longer restricted to aerospace companies. Universities and even High Schools can develop them. The World is Not Enough (WINE) is a new generation of CubeSats that take advantage of ISRU to explore space for ever. The WINE takes advantage of existing CubeSat technology and combines it with 3D printing technology and a water extraction system developed under NASA SBIR, called MISWE . 3D printing enables development of cold gas thrusters as well as tanks that fit perfectly within the available space within the CubeSat. The MISWE allows capture and extraction of water, and takes advantage of the heat generated by the CubeSat electronics system. The water is stored in a cold gas thruster's tank and used for propulsion. Thus, the system can use the water that it has just extracted for prospecting to refuel and fly to another location. This replenishing of propellants extends the mission by doing ISRU (living off the land) even during the prospecting phase.In Phase 1, we plan to test and investigate critical technologies such as (1) sample acquisition, (2) volatiles capture, and (3) 3D-printed cold gas thrusters that use water vapor including the organic and particulate contaminants that are inevitable during the early stages of asteroid mining. The engine is similar to a Solar Thermal Engine but scaled for a CubeSat. In Phase 2, we propose to develop a testbed of the critical systems and to demonstrate these onboard the International Space Station (ISS).","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA can use this system to prospect for mining that will support Mars exploration missions. It can also use the system for any planetary exploration when there is a known water resource close to the surface. It can be used to explore the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, Main Belt Asteroids including protoplanet Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres, Mars, Europa, Titan, etc. The water propulsion technology can be adapted by NASA for its Extreme Access project to mine the permanently shadowed craters on the Moon. NASA can also use the system to test water/thermal propulsion at ISS. The results of that testing may lead to a new class of space tugs to help accomplish missions in cis-lunar space until a full water electrolysis capability has been established.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The system could be used by several commercial companies that are interested in In Situ Resource Utilization for financial gain. These include Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries targeting asteroids. Bringing water from the asteroids could be very profitable given that launching water from space costs ~$20,000/liter. The major market for water could be human consumption and radiation shielding (e.g. once Bigelow Space Hotels are established) or refueling of existing satellites. The latter is of particular interest, since satellites come to the end of their life not because of electronics, or power, but because there are running out of fuel for station keeping. NASA and industry have been developing in space refueling technology, the first step in enabling refueling of satellites in space. The technology could also be applied to the Moon and used by Shackleton Energy Corp., company interested in mining water and delivering it for refueling spacecrafts at Geostationary Orbit and Geotransfer Orbit. The International Space University 2012 Summer School demonstrated the commercial viability of boosting spacecraft to Geostationary Orbit via water-based propulsion.With the advent of small satellites (nanosats and CubeSats) one can imagine that these satellites could be able to stop at an Asteroid, refueling, and continue exploring.","Analytical Methods; Characterization; Conversion; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Resource Extraction; Simulation & Modeling; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)",,University of Central Florida,"4000 Central Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL 32816 - 3246",(407) 823-2000,Regolith Resource Robotic is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This system consists of smart sensors that interface with transducers measuring parameters such as heat flux, temperature, pressure, strain, and near-field acoustics. Low-level fault diagnostic autonomy is granted by advanced algorithms that not only extract features in measured data which are highly correlated with potential failure modes, but also take advantage of the interrelations in a large, complex system. High-level knowledge is infused into the environment with graph-based methods which allow describing cause and effect relationships. These core capabilities are then deployed in an innovative Enterprise networking infrastructure based on wireless and ubiquitous information sharing. Finally, at the front-end of IM-AWARE, graphical user interfaces (GUI) for both PCs and mobile devices deliver a complete picture of the monitored system and associated DIaK with real-time updates.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The Integrated Monitoring AWAReness Environment will directly support health monitoring and management within NASA propulsion and testing facilities.

This includes the monitoring of leakage, fire, etc. in propellant or gas delivery systems, cooling water lines, etc. Another example is the remote monitoring of vacuum lines as part of the low pressure and low cryogenic temperature A3 test stand at NASA SSC. Possible applications outside of SSC involve the health monitoring of test facility support systems at Glen Research Center, for example, vacuum line monitoring at the zero gravity research facility, as well as usage in wind tunnel test facilities such as those at Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) One of the main objectives of this STTR is the commercialization of the project's research results and introduction of a commercialized product into the marketplace (both civilian and government).

They can also harm aircraft avionics, communication and navigation. We propose to develop a system to aid forecasters in the prediction of such events, and in the identification/lengthening of ""all clear"" time periods when there is a low probability of such events occurring. The system leverages three recently developed technologies: physics-based models of the solar corona and inner heliosphere, robust CME modeling techniques, and empirical/physics-based assessments of energetic particle fluxes using the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Environment Module (EMMREM, University of New Hampshire). When completed, the proposed SPE Threat Assessment Tool, or STAT, will represent a significant step forward in our ability to assess the possible impact of SPE events.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The CCMC, located at NASA GSFC, is presently testing different space weather models to assess their applicability for eventual operational settings. STAT would represent the coupling of two preeminent modeling capabilities at CCMC (CORHEL and EMMREM) to produce physics-based model predictions of SEP fluxes. STAT would also be of significant interest to NASA SRAG, which is charged with the difficult responsibility of ensuring that the radiation exposure received by astronauts remains below established safety limits. This requires identifying periods with a high probability of no SPEs, as well as recognizing the imminent threat of an SPE. STAT can aid SRAG in this endeavor by estimating particle fluxes and dose rates for possible eruptions when a threatening active region is identified.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) SPEs are of concern not only to NASA, but to many government and commercial entities dependent on satellites and aircraft.

The Air Force is also interested in mitigation strategies for SPEs. The fledgling private manned launch services industry may wish to develop their own forecasting capabilities, as opposed to solely relying on government services.

This type of depiction can be important during a mission's development phase. Animation can show things that are not possible to see in the physical world and can help explain difficult concepts. Animation allows visualization of the mission without having to understand all the physics required. The communication of any mission scenarios through the medium of video - be it live action or animation - requires a particular set of skills: most notably, a sense of timing and layout. The sense of timing in animation can be compared to that of music; length, rhythm and order are the crucial elements for an effective delivery of an idea or emotion. Professional animators acquire this knowledge through formal training, education and years of experience. Although it would be impossible to impart this knowledge instantaneously, with current technology it can be encapsulated within a set of ""digital elements"" that can be manipulated and arranged to form a coherent stream of images (video) with order and meaning. Our proposed innovation is to develop a set of tools that can be used by a non-expert to build a virtual mission scenario that can be used for analysis, presentations and outreach. We will create a method for developing a collection of elements (objects, actions) with initial focus, space mission specific.

Together, these innovations will provide improved hopping radios (with digital, rapidly reconfigurable implementation, wider bandwidth and reduced overhead penalty for hopping) and improved spectrum and link quality sensing. We will demonstrate how these improvements provide the basis for links and networks that rapidly adapt. During phase 1, we will prove the feasibility of our approach and quantify the potential improvements in throughput and robustness of the link. We anticipate that adaptively changing the center frequency, hopping pattern, modulation and data rate will lead to doubling of the energy efficiency of data downlink for nominal conditions by keeping the link margin relatively constant. We anticipate much larger improvements for conditions with severe interference due to increased communications opportunities.Space Micro has already developed unique and critically important technologies that solve many of these challenges. Space Micro's advanced software defined radio, which we call the Agile Space Radio (ASR) is capable of adjusting its transmitter's data rate, modulation type and center frequency on the fly. Moreover, it is capable of advanced spectrum sensing to support its situational awareness over the entire accessible bandwidth, currently configured to the entire STDN band. This software-defined platform is used as a multi-band, multi-waveform transponder. We propose to demonstrate the concepts described in this proposal using the ASR.

Information from extensive instrumentation using 100's to 1000's of strain gages can be fed into a condition based maintenance (CBM) algorithm to improve structural health assessments, detect damage, and lower maintenance costs. Current methods for measuring strain are too cumbersome, bulky, and costly to be practical for a large scale dense network of strain sensors. Furthermore, existing piezoelectric-based vibrational energy harvesters are built around general purpose components designed for operation in low-temperature application spaces. To realize pervasive structural health monitoring across a wide range of thermal and vibrational environments, a low cost, minimally intrusive, low maintenance, and reliable technology is needed.Cutting edge microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors for measurements of strain, acceleration, pressure, acoustic emission, and temperature are becoming increasingly available for use in CBM and structural health monitoring (SHM). While these sensors offer a promising future for wireless sensing networks (WSN), implementation for CBM remains cumbersome due to the lack of versatile, cost-effective powering solutions. Wiring external power to sensors is an unattractive solution given the required installation overhead and associated maintenance costs. Battery powered solutions are unreliable and battery maintenance for a dense network of thousands of sensor nodes is not practical. For this STTR effort, Prime Photonics proposes to team with Virginia Tech to develop a multimode vibrational-thermal harvester with effective energy capture and efficient conversion.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The initial NASA commercial application of the Energy Harvesting Wireless Strain Sensor (EHWSS) technology would be in support of advanced flight testing of low subsonic and high supersonic aircraft.

This will be especially relevant as networked clusters of smaller-size satellites, made of CubeSats or microsatellites, are more and more used in place of a single monolithic satellite. The proposed wideband autonomous cognitive radios (WACRs) provide an ideal approach to achieving such autonomous and network-aware communications. The BlueCom team proposes to design and develop WACRs during the Phase I of this project by integrating a real-time reconfigurable radio front-end and a field programmable gate array implemented cognitive engine on to a software-defined radio (SDR) platform. WACRs will have the ability to sense state of the RF spectrum and network and self-optimize its performance in response to the sensed state. The cognitive engine is made of machine-learning aided algorithms to achieve this goal. The SDR platform coupled with a real-time reconfigurable RF front-end will allow the WACR to reconfigure its communication mode as directed by the cognitive engine. This will enable a WACR to overcome communications challenges encountered in space applications including interference, deep fading, waveform agility, delay and very low SNR by dynamically changing its mode of operation. This type of self-aware, autonomous and intelligent communication is what will be required to exploit the full benefits of networked clusters of satellites (e.g. CubeSats) in various mission types including earth monitoring and unmanned autonomous lunar/ planetary exploration.Phase I deliverables will include a detailed design of a WACR system architecture and a cognitive engine as well as development of cognitive algorithms and a real-time reconfigurable RF front-end/antennas.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Proposed wideband autonomous cognitive radios (WACRs) are an ideal technology to exploit full benefits of networked clusters of satellites (such as CubeSats). Clusters of satellites networked via proposed WACRs offer opportunities for both improving performance of current space communications links as well as exploring new communications paradigms. They can enable various cognitive cooperative communications techniques leading to new approaches to achieving mission success in certain situations. For example, cooperative relaying in a networked cluster of satellites can provide a data path for observing the night side of Mars. WACRs can also be ideal for achieving delay tolerant networking(DTN)in earth monitoring or unmanned lunar/planetary exploration missions: A networked cluster of satellites can provide either a time-sequenced observations of a single location or simultaneous ones at multiple locations. Cognitive cooperative communications enabled by WACRs can be used to link this data to a ground station reliably with minimum delay. Other applications include, a) facilitating higher bandwidth and fewer dropouts in imagery that is sent over ""short"" distances such as LEO spacecraft-to-ground, b) agility to avoid interference with other systems and to adapt waveforms, c) optimizing bandwidth within power limitations particularly at very long ranges such as interplanetary operations and d) reduction of interference behavior in reception-only modes such as radio astronomy.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Potential non-NASA applications of proposed wideband autonomous cognitive radios (WACRs) include military, homeland security and commercial applications. First, the proposed WACRs are in-line with the vision put-forth in the 2012 PCAST report for allowing coexistence of many different systems in larger spectrum bands without exclusive spectrum licensing. WACRs are an ideal technology to implement such spectrum coexistence. Thus, proposed WACRs can lead to a future universal radio device/system that may meet all communications needs of a user revolutionizing the consumer telecommunications. Moreover, cognitive radio technology can be utilized in many military applications such as broadband radar systems, directed energy diagnostic tools and covert communication. For example, the proposed filtenna technology can be integrated into the front-end of a radar to provide frequency agility and side-lobe suppression thereby increasing cross-range resolution. The filtenna technology can also be integrated into frequency selective screen sheets to provide frequency agile electromagnetic screens. Such screens can be placed around sensitive electronics and components to protect them from wideband RF threats. The WACRs can be also be used in unmanned aerial vehicles as well as for achieving reliable emergency/disaster/first-responder communications.

These destinations demand robust perception and navigation technologies that provide high position accuracy regardless of lighting conditions.Existing rover technologies are incapable of the types of perception and navigation required by the challenges of a dark environment that restrict the rover's ability to perceive its surroundings and overcome inherent positional uncertainty. Even the rover's own shadow can present a significant obstacle while operating in the glancing sunlight of polar regions.The proposed work will develop novel methods for sensing, mapping, and localization in and around the permanently dark regions of planetary bodies. The research will enable the exploration of previously inaccessible dark environments including pits, cold traps, and subterranean voids such as lava tubes and caves on the Moon and Mars. NASA's decadal science survey prioritizes exploration of ancient ices, highlighting a mission to study lunar volatiles in the permanent shadows on the lunar poles. The proposed work innovates perception and navigation technologies to make such polar missions possible.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed technologies enhance prospecting and excavating missions through enabling navigation in the dark. This has the potential to enhance near term missions like Resource Prospector Mission and follow-on missions for sample return or in-situ resource utilization.The developed technologies also unlock new mission destinations. Newly discovered pits on the Moon and Mars may provide entrance to lava tubes that could give us a deeper understanding of a planet's geologic, climatic, and even biologic history. They may also one day provide shelter to humans. Operation in caves requires dark perception and navigation.The proposed technologies enable activities that normally happen in sunlight to occur easily in darkness, including autonomous landing, rendezvous, docking, and proximity operations, and perhaps robotic satellite maintenance and mapping of comets or asteroids.Maturation and mission integration is benefited by Astrobotic's plans for a series of lunar expeditions to deliver commercial payloads. Technology for these missions is being developed in partnership with NASA as part of the Lunar CATALYST program and is funded by customer payments and investment. Demonstration on an early Astrobotic lunar mission will generate data to accurately evaluate and innovate technologies, a key step that enables others to confidently adopt the technology for their own systems.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The developed methods for perception and navigation in darkness will enhance perception in many terrestrial domains including, subterranean, night operations, enclosed spaces, and surveillance. The proposed technology applies broadly to terrestrial applications particularly those that are GPS-denied. Potential applications include driverless cars, search and rescue, mining, infrastructure inspection, military UGVs and UAVs, and agriculture. The developed technology will enhance the models created in these environments and provide higher resolution, more detailed, and more physically accurate models than are produced with existing methods.In addition, Astrobotic is continually engaged with the government and industrial entities interested in lunar exploration and development. This immersion in the relevant marketplace will enable Astrobotic to identify and market to non-NASA entities who would be interested in licensing use of the technologies developed during the proposed work in their own lunar systems.","3D Imaging; Data Fusion; Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Perception/Vision; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation)",,Carnegie Mellon University,"5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 - 3815",(412) 268-6556,Information Technologies for Intelligent and Adaptive Space Robotics is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Primary contributors to space radiation include Solar Particle Events (SPEs) associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).Because the mechanisms that produce coronal mass ejections (CME) are exceedingly complex, no reliable deterministic methods for predicting eruptions are yet available, and the most successful approaches are phenomenological and probabilistic in nature. But predicting the eruption is only part of the problem. In order to forecast the time, location, flux, and the energy spectrum of a Solar Particle Event (in order to better model its effect on specific hardware and instruments, for example) we must also understand the intervening plasma environment, including the steady-state magnetic configuration, as well as the dynamic, eruption driven configurations that provide for the time dependent transport and diffusive acceleration of solar energetic particles.Progress has been made in the understanding of the solar atmosphere due to the increased availability of observational data and the development of analytical and numerical models of the solar wind. One aspect of this development is the construction of complex three-dimensional (3D) models, which can be validated with observations and further refined to improve the comparison. In order to improve SPE forecasts Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) and the University of Michigan's department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Science (AOSS) intend to cooperate on this STTR project, which seeks, over Phase 1 and Phase 2, to 1) Use data-driven statistical models to forecast the likelihood of solar eruptions; 2) Couple these predictions with eruption generation models in the context of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) to forecast the likely time, location, flux, and energy spectrum of Solar Energetic Particles.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This technology will use data-driven statistical models to forecast the likelihood of solar eruptions and couple these predictions with eruption generation models in the context of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) to forecast the likely time, location, flux, and energy spectrum of Solar Energetic Particles.In principle, this technology could be developed by NASA into a commercial space weather forecasting product, available on a subscription (or other) basis to interested parties.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This technology will use data-driven statistical models to forecast the likelihood of solar eruptions and couple these predictions with eruption generation models in the context of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) to forecast the likely time, location, flux, and energy spectrum of Solar Energetic Particles.In principle, because the SWMF is publicly available, the forecasting technology described in this proposal could be developed by a into a commercial space weather forecasting product by a private company, available on a subscription (or other) basis to interested parties.","Analytical Methods; Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Space Transportation & Safety",,The Regents of the University of Michigan,"2455 Hayward St., Ann Arbor, MI 48109 - 2143",(734) 647-4705,Space Weather is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials. MR&D is proposing to perform a combined analytical and experimental program to develop a durability model for CMC Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBC). EBCs are required for CMCs in turbine exhaust environments because of the presence of high temperature water. The EBC protects the CMC and significantly slows recession. However, the durability of these materials is not well understood making life prediction very challenging. This program will be the first step in developing a tool to accurately evaluate the life of the EBC for a CMC turbine blade helping to facilitate their inclusion in future engine designs. This will be done by developing a custom, user defined element formulation for finite element modeling to simulate the kinetic reactions of the EBC with the turbine exhaust. It will be built on the back of earlier work developing such an element to model the oxidation of carbon fiber in reentry environments.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA Glenn has been directly involved in the effort to bring these materials to turbine hot section components. The NASA Ultra Efficient Engine Technology program (UEET) is focused on driving the next generation of turbine engine technology. One of the major thrusts is the development and demonstration of advanced high temperature materials which are capable of surviving the extreme environments of turbine combustion and exhaust.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In the commercial sector, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines are being developed for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, respectively.

These are large markets where the benefit of this technology will have a lasting impact in efficiency and cost. By workingclosely with Rolls Royce during the early stages of this development program, MR&D has ensured that the resulting products will meet the requirements of future customers. Rolls Royce has expressed a serious interest in this technology and, as demonstrated above, has a sizable market for its application. The aerospace industry is not the only potential beneficiary of this technology. The Department of Energy (DOE) is working hard to improve the efficiency of power generators. Just as with aircraft engines, power turbines' efficiency improves with higher operating temperatures. As an example, current turbines operate at 2600F, which provided a large improvement in efficiency over earlier models operating at 2300F.

In this project Mound Laser & Photonics Center (MLPC) will work with Wright State University (WSU) to implement a novel system for layer-by-layer in-process monitoring for AM. The key innovation in this work will be the use of a line-laser profilometer (LLP) for 3-dimensional, in situ, sub-micron profilometry on every layer during an AM process, both before and after the layer has been melted. Several advantages will be gained from this approach: (1) Measurements on the spread powder layers will determine powder distribution and quality, enabling correlation between powder distribution and finished part material properties such as microstructure and density; (2) Measurements on the melted layer profile will determine the geometric accuracy of the melted layer (both in depth and lateral dimensions), compared to the CAD file, and allow correlations between geometric accuracy to powder distribution, laser parameters, and material properties; and (3) simple layer defects will be easily identified before the next layer is spread. This technology could enable real-time process qualification, and eventually automatic powder re-spreading or layer re-melting to fix defects in the layer.In this project, the SBC (MLPC) will build test coupons in their custom-built, fully tunable, research-grade AM testbed and monitor the build process with the LLP. The RI (WSU), who has tremendous expertise in AM sample characterization, will then perform in-depth material analysis on the test coupons to determine material properties. At the time of this proprosal, MLPC has already determined that the LLP can measure the AM testbed with micron-scale accuracy. Therefore, achieving success with this approach is very likely, the primary needs for implementation are the development of experimental methods and process control correlations.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) (1) Improving SLM additive manufacturing processes: The in-process profilometry data collected in this STTR will be fully quantitative and useful for controlling AM processes. This will be possible through direct experimentation on the user's machine, experimentation across machines, or by supplying quantitative data to validate process modelling.(2) Non-Destructive evaluation (NDE) and part qualification: This project will provide verification and qualification of the build consistency, identify build errors layer-by-layer, and possibly enable inspectable 3D models of the built part constructed from the LLP measurements. (3) Materials Genome Initiative: The correlation of process parameters and sensor data to resultant material properties and microstructures would directly support NASA's role in this multi-agency initiative by providing better empirical methods to validate computational modeling of additive manufacturing processes.  (4) Final inspection of part geometry: The LLP can measure the dimensions of finished parts. For dimensionally critical systems this is an important step, and using the same sensor for both in-process monitoring and post-process geometric verification will streamline the production process. (5) Closed-loop processing: Closed-loop process control could be realized by measuring each layer both before and after melting, and making automatic adjustments based on LLP feedback.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) (1) Commercial aerospace applications have a high overlap with NASA applications, including strong interest in fabrication of rocket engine components and a variety of other lightweighted structures. (2) The US Army Armament Research and Development Engineering Center (ARDEC) has expressed an interest in AM process control technology. They seek to use AM manufacturing to enhance munitions and weapon systems under development at Picatinny Arsenal. ARDEC hopes to implement a process monitoring solution on commercial AM machines (made by EOS and SLM Solutions GmbH)(3) Sensorized Process Development Cell (PDC) for general research: There is a general frustration in the market with the limitations of commercial AM machines. End users are typically constrained to given material types and build protocols. Several institutions have expressed interest in obtaining a PDC similar to the one MLPC has developed for its own research. Examples are Rolls-Royce North America, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Integration of the PDC with the LLP-based process monitoring system developed under this project will create a comprehensive, low cost tool for AM research.

These platforms provide an all-lifting surface with a reduced wetted area, which lead to significant aerodynamic improvements over their conventional counterparts. However, due to their lack of a conventional tail surface with which to trim in pitch during low-speed operations, these aircraft suffer from a number of stability issues. Chief among these issues is the potentially catastrophic loss of feedback  normally a function of the tail surfaces  when the wing stalls at high angles of attack. This problem is further manifested through the large variation in stall behavior across the BWB's wingspan due to significant thickness differences between the payload-carrying centerbody and the aerodynamically efficient outer wing portions of the vehicle. Aurora Flight Sciences, in collaboration with Professor Mircea Teodorescu of the University of California at Santa Cruz, proposes an actively twisted compliant wing architecture for BWB aircraft that mitigates the stall concerns typically associated with these platforms while providing a significant increase in aerodynamic efficiency. The practical implication resulting from this novel approach is a state-of-the-art compliant wing architecture that provides active control of the twist along the span of the wing by sensing and appropriately responding to oncoming stall risks, thereby eliminating the need for outer wing washout and drastically improving the aerodynamic performance of the wing during cruise. These innovative concepts will be used to complete a preliminary design and build of the wing structure for proof-of-concept flight testing by the end of Phase I.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Retrofitting current NASA UAV platforms with the compliant wing technology would create revenue, both while opening compliant wing technology development for the next advanced aircraft, whether it be a transport-sized BWB platform or a smaller UAV system. NASA's efforts on the development of next generation commercial transport aircraft have shown a clear trend towards unconventional designs, including the strut-braced SUGAR concept and the Aurora/MIT D8 double bubble design configurations. While the BWB configurations could clearly benefit from the actively twisted compliant wing technology, the other unconventional platforms require enabling technologies in aeroelastic control and dynamic load alleviation to realize their full potential; the actively controlled compliant wing technology proposed for this effort  whether it be the fully integrated system or simply standalone components developed over the course of the effort  could be leveraged for integration into these next-generation platforms. Opportunities exist, through Aurora's heavy involvement with the development of the D8 concept, to implement the wing architecture on demonstrator programs for these next-generation concepts. These demonstration opportunities would allow a maturation of the technology, easing the transition to eventual fielding of the technology in the commercial or military sector, and providing NASA with an invaluable technical role in the development of this enabling technology.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) After the active twist architecture has been thoroughly vetted through integration into Aurora products, Aurora will aim to sell both the compliant wing structure construction methodology and the active twist control system architecture to outside customers as a stand-alone product, as well as an integrated system. Aurora will act as both the manufacturer and as a value added reseller, customizing integration and installation methods and refining the onboard control algorithms as appropriate for the intended use of the active control technology. Depending on configuration selection, this system could be packaged a wing architecture to be retrofitted on existing aircraft or the wing technology could be incorporated early in the design process of a ground-up aircraft development. Additionally, the technology could be a customized system where Aurora partners closely with a customer to tailor the actively controlled compliant structure to specific aircraft needs, such as integration into a self-aware vehicle or for prognostic health monitoring systems. Finally, BWB platforms have been shown to meet the next-generation requirements of several military aircraft, including the tanker and the bomber. The active twist technology would be a crucial to realizing the full potential of such platforms; therefore, efforts could be made to partner with large contractors to integrate the active twist technology onto these next-generation military vehicles.","Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)",,"University of California, Santa Cruz","1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064 - 1077",(831) 459-1378,"Dynamic Servoelastic (DSE) Network Control, Modeling and Optimization is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

As astronauts move deeper into space, it will be necessary for them to manage these robotic assets with less support from ground controllers. A flexible approach is needed to build and revise plans for semi-autonomous robots. A key requirement for such planning operations is the ability to accurately predict how much resource (e.g., time, power) is needed to perform planned tasks. TRACLabs and CMU propose to develop software to model resources for use in building and revising plans for semi-autonomous robots. The resource models will be used to estimate the duration of planned tasks based on historical plan performance. They will be updated periodically during a mission to improve model accuracy at a site. This software also will be used to provide actual resource data for annotating a map of the site when building. The resource modeling software will be designed for evaluation with the IRG Exploration Ground Data System planning software. Improved resource modeling produces more accurate predictions of the resources needed for planned tasks. More accurate resource estimates improves the likelihood that plans can be executed ""as planned"". When plans don't go as expected, these resource models can be used to determine how to modify robot plans within available resources. This should reduce the human workload needed to revise robot plans during plan execution and, when revisions are needed, to determine which subset of activities can actually be completed with remaining resources.

An ongoing operational trade during plan execution for the RPM is whether to take a closer look for water in an area or to move on to prospect another area. The proposed resource models have potential to help the science team make better decisions about prospecting by providing more accurate estimates of how long it will take to perform the tasks within a robot plan. Other tests where resource modeling might improve robot and science mission planning include BASALT, AstroBee, and the Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP).","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Unmanned Vehicles, including UAVs, UGVs, and USVs are growing in their importance to DOD. Correspondingly, the need to ensure that soldiers can work effectively with these vehicles is also growing. As the number of vehicles grows the need to plan for the coordination of multiple robots will also grow. The proposed resource modeling software can be integrated with existing planning and procedure technology to deliver flexible multi-robot plans. There is renewed interest in remote operations and robot inspection and maintenance for the oil and natural gas drilling, extraction, and processing. Whether controlling robots that monitor and maintain off-shore rigs during an evacuation, or controlling Remotely Operated Vehicles underwater, or controlling robots that perform disaster response tasks in large refinery, the need for robotics in the oil and gas industry is growing. The proposed software for resource modeling is enabling to build plans for such robot operations.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Man-Machine Interaction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),,Carnegie Mellon University - Silicon Valley,"NASA Research Park, Bldg 23, Moffett Field, CA 94305 - 2823",(650) 335-2823,Information Technologies for Intelligent and Adaptive Space Robotics is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The ability to detect and quicklylocate and mitigate a pressure vessel breach is critical to the safety ofany long duration spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or aproposed lunar base or mission to Mars. Current NASA protocol for findinga spacecraft leak uses a handheld ultrasonic directional microphone,similar to those widely deployed industrially, to detect the 40 kHzairborne ultrasonic hiss generated by the downstream leak turbulence.However, known limitations exist regarding the use of airborne ultrasonicemissions for locating leaks in the spacecraft environment because thedownstream side of the leak occurs into the vacuum of space, creatingreduced leak noise inside the pressure vessel. Blockages of thetransmission of airborne ultrasonic energy by structural components,avionics, and equipment racks also limit the detection range of suchsystems. An alternative approach that we propose is to monitor thespacecraft structure itself---the pressure vessel skin---forleak-generated surface-borne ultrasound by means of a flexible and modularelectronics package with fully integrated surface sensor arrays, dataacquisition electronics, and radio frequency communication capabilities.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters,approximately 150 words) The NASA program with the most risk due toMicro-meteor / Orbital Debris (MMOD) is currently the International SpaceStation, due to the prolonged exposure on-orbit and the large surface areaof the orbiting habitat. For this reason, it is particularly importantthat the system be able to be installed easily in a retrofit manner behindcloseout blankets in easily accessible areas. Additionally, it must befully self-contained, requiring only minimal data interfaces to the ISSfor data transfer to the crew and ground controllers. Although the risk tothe Shuttle from MMOD is largely considered to be due to the RCC panels ofthe Wing Leading Edge and Nose Cone, significant risk is still present inthe pressurized portions of the vehicle. Additionally, such a system couldbe used to monitor for leaks in the airlocks and other sealed vacuuminterfaces. As part of the Orion Program, NASA will attempt to increasesafety by an order of magnitude over the current Shuttle vehicle. MMOD isa major source of risk for the Shuttle, and will continue to be a risk forthe Orion specifically and all future Constellation Program habitats,despite improved MMOD shielding. The proposed system could likely be fullyintegrated with the Orion or habitat avionics systems, providingcontinuous monitoring of the entire structure while requiring only minimalvehicle resources and launch mass, as well as very little maintenance.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500characters, approximately 150 words) Beyond the direct application ofthe proposed technology for detecting leaks to vacuum in pressurized spacevehicles, significant opportunities exist within the more broadapplication field of applying PZT sensor arrays to NondestructiveEvaluation.

In addition, the technology can easily be modified to benefit research efforts focused on other space-induced biological phenomena such as bone loss, immune modulation, oxidative stress among others.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) It is also expected that the developed technology will find ready applications in the following civilian markets:  Pharmaceutical and Drug Discovery Companies Pre-clinical and Clinical Researchers (in particular stem cell and oncology researchers) Hospital & Health Site Monitoring (for nuclear medicine, immune ex-vivo treatments)",Biochemical; Biomedical and Life Support; Biomolecular Sensors; Optical; Particle and Fields,,Temple University,"1947 North 12th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19122 - 6018",(215) 204-7808

CFDRC and the University of Florida willdevelop an innovative simulation system for predicting surface erosion anddebris transport caused by lunar surface rocket plume impingement. Thissimulation system combines 1) a unified continuum-rarefied flow solvercapable of simulating plume impingement flow in lunar vacuum, 2) granularsolid-fluid interaction simulation models for developing databases forlunar soil erosion and debris particle release mechanism, and 3) particletracking tools to simulate debris kinetics and dispersion afterliberation. During Phase I, the Unified Flow Solver (UFS) capabilities insimulating hybrid rarefied-continuum plume flow, and the debris dispersiontracking capabilities were demonstrated. The fluid-solid simulation toolsrealistically simulated jet induced soil grain response characteristics,clearing the path towards establishing working models of erosion andparticle release mechanisms. In Phase II, the individual modules will berefined, validated and integrated into a coherent simulation system. Thesolid-fluid interaction physics will be refined for the peculiar lunarsoil layer characteristics and consequently soil erosion models will bederived. The erosion models will serve to prescribe debris initialconditions for a debris-tracking module developed and integrated with theflow solver. The simulation capability will be essential for predictingthe severity and range of dust and debris transport and for designinglunar settlement layout, dust and debris impact mitigation measures.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters,approximately 150 words) The debris simulation tool will be of firstorder importance to the Space Exploration program for lunar robotic andhuman mission architecture definition. The tool will be equally applicableto follow-on Mars robotic and human missions. The developed technologywill also be applicable for analysis of solid propulsion systems withembedded solid particle.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500characters, approximately 150 words) Many potential non-NASAcommercial applications exist in civil and military industries. Dust, sandand snow stir-up during helicopter landing and take-off in a desert orartic environment result in severe visibility impairment (brown-out),windshield abrasion and danger of debris ingestion.

The system will enable the collection of valuable information applicable to biosignature investigations, i.e., the search for evidence of life within the solar system. Current limitations to in-situ isotope measurements will be overcome by utilizing a hollow fiber optic based IR spectroscopy concept. This concept enables high precision measurements within the ultra-small sample volume (<<1ml) of the hollow fiber and has proven to be three orders of magnitude more sensitive in terms of required sample size than current state of the art isotope sensors. The proposed project will focus on transitioning the current lab-based technique to a small size, weight, and power (SWaP) device that can be operated unattended. Significant strides will be made in this direction through the use of optimized hollow fiber technology developed at OKSI. In Phase I, proposed concepts for improving the system performance, reducing the SWaP, and engineering a field-capable device will be proven and specific options down selected for full development in Phase II. A complete prototype will be produced to measure Carbon (C) and Sulfur (S) isotope ratios from solid rock samples in Phase II. The ability to generate simultaneous C and S isotope measurements from solid samples has great potential for assessing biosignatures relating to sulfate reducing organisms and organisms using simple C substrates (including methanogens, fermenters, and others). The sensitivity afforded by the proposed system would open up this capability to smaller samples than ever before measured as well as provide a potential device for remote deployment. This could be a significant development in the search for these biosignatures on other planets and near space objects as well as in the early Earth rock record.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The isotope sensor resulting from this project will be developed to support efforts to search for evidence of life on future NASA missions. The research is specifically relevant to NASA Objective 2.3 which is to ""Ascertain the content, origin, and evolution of the solar system and the potential for life elsewhere,"" as well as NASA Astrobiology Roadmap Goal 7: ""Determine how to recognize signatures of life on other worlds and on Earth."" In fact, NASA Astrobiology Roadmap Objective 7.1 is to ""Learn how to recognize and interpret biosignatures which, if identified in samples from ancient rocks on Earth or from other planets, can help to detect and/or characterize ancient and/or present-day life."" The anticipated technology would also be useful for the exploration of the Moon and asteroids, since it is able to quantify local variations in δ 13C, which have been observed in primitive meteorites, comets, and interplanetary dust particles when investigated at the microscale. The capillary absorption spectrometer (CAS) at the heart of the system will also provide a new high precision, ultra-low-volume sensor relevant to a range of other NASA applications. These include atmospheric sensing of Earth and other planets (e.g., Uranus) environmental sensing from a small UAV, analysis of soil bacteria related to Carbon cycle, as well as full elemental analysis of various microscopic-sized samples and organisms.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The CAS sensor to be developed under this project will provide an extremely attractive alternative to both isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IRMS) and cavity ring down spectrometers (CRDS). The CAS will be relatively inexpensive, require only picomoles of material, and under this project, will be developed to be easily portable and operated unattended. Such a system will fill niche markets in forensic analysis, environmental sensing, human breath analysis, and industrial process control. Furthermore, the new capabilities and features of the CAS will enable new applications in isotope and gas sensing that simply were not possible before.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL),"902 Battelle Boulevard, P.O.

BioComm is embedded with ADaM (Anomaly Detection and Monitorin) capability, which enables human supervisors or operators to exploit, benefit from, and interact with BioComm systems with high confidence by alerting the operators of multiple, heterogeneous ACSs on anomalous system behaviors without requiring a deep understanding of the functions in the underlying systems. The proposed solution (BioComm-ADaM) is based on the unique combination of: (i) Digital Hormone Model augmented with Criticality-Sensitive Control with the goal of achieving rapid self-configuration and fully autonomous adaptive deployment, redeployment, and reconfiguration of NASA's autonomous communication assets under a broad range of mission scenarios; and (ii) Surprise-Based Learning capable of learning the expected or normal behavior of a wide range of autonomous systems, detect any behavioral anomalies or deviations from the norm, identify potential causes, recommend some feasible changes to a human supervisor, and execute the selected or recommended changes. The BioComm system adds a powerful new degree of freedom for self-adaptation, which is the ""mobility"" of autonomous communication assets based on their awareness of the ""communication environment"", thus allowing radios to adapt both their software parameters and physical locations or formations so as to best support space missions. Thus, BioComm will greatly expand the feasible dimensions of self-adaptation for communication parameters by further allowing the autonomous assets to ""move"" to ""right"" places when the autonomous adaptation of parameters alone is not sufficient in order to achieve much greater and powerful autonomous end-to-end communication capabilities.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) We offer two NASA applications of the proposed BioComm-ADaM system. First, consider a scenario where the maximum-distance communication parameter profile configuration is not able to close the link between two autonomous assets, which forces them to initiate the Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) mode (store and forward). Without the mobility autonomy, they must wait until they are positioned to be able to communicate again. However, if BioComm's mobility autonomy is available for one or both assets, it (or both) may be able to autonomously adjust their positions (with the objective of minimum navigation) until they can communicate again. As a result, the mission will greatly benefit from potentially significant reduction of communication delay. Similarly, when a group of autonomous assets are flying in a large formation as a distributed ""antenna"" or ""telescope,"" the physical scope of the formation can be dynamically enlarged or enhanced by autonomously moving the assets to the correct location without losing the radio communication while still maintaining the formation shape. These new capabilities can be inserted into NASA's future autonomous assets (unmanned ground robots, spacecrafts, aerial drones, etc).","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Our non-NASA commercialization plan begins by completing our proof of concept prototypes of BioComm-ADaM and its components on the commercial-off-the-shelf software defined radios being developed for unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Currently, EpiSci is in active discussions with several large prime contractors (e.g., Boeing) as well as Air Force Research Laboratories and Office of Secretary of Defense to explore the most viable ways to transition and commercialize the Bio-AI technology. We anticipate that once Bio-AI find a suitable transition home, most likely the same agency or company will serve as the place for the BioComm-ADaM commercialization as well. With sufficient system testing conducted for the feasibility and reliability of the prototype systems, we will seek protection of our inventions by filing patents.","Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Network Integration; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",,USC/ISI,"4676 Admiralty Way, Marina Del Ray, CA 90292 - 6601",(310) 822-1511,Autonomous Communications Systems is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

To obtain the benefits of increased aerostructural efficiency, the controller needs to trim at a specified optimal shape while minimizing structural fatigue from gust disturbances. Tao Systems and Texas A&M University propose to develop a distributed, passivity-based, ASE controller (DPASC) using sectional aerodynamic and structural output-only feedback. This scalable, decentralized approach has the potential to minimize the impact of aerodynamic / structural uncertainties and control surface free-play / saturation, while guaranteeing global asymptotic stability.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The benefits of a distributed, passivity-based ASE system that we are proposing has a number of benefits: (1) addresses nonlinearities in aerodynamics, structures, and actuation, (2) increases controller robustness: reduces dependency on aerodynamic and structural uncertainties, (3) increases aerostructural efficiency, (4) enables mission persistence at a lower cost.For example, degradation due to atmospheric effects such as moisture and fatigue caused by constant wing stresses provides significant risk over the life of a HALE-type UAV, e.g., DARPA Vulture.

As the energy efficiency of computational devices drops, self-power via harvested energy becomes increasingly viable for a host of electronic devices for sensing and other applications. The ECM kinetic energy harvester provides self-power for a variety of wireless sensors that include those for in situ structural health monitoring (SHM) of NASA vehicles and infrastructure. ECM directly supports non-destructive evaluation (NDE) systems for safety assurance of future vehiclesespecially those making heavy use of composite materials.

Communication technologies will expand mankind's understanding of planet earth and the universe. As the needs to gather more data, even more advanced antenna technologies will be essential to deliver orders of magnitude more data. Low cost high data-rate flexible active digital beam forming phased array antenna (PAA) is one of the enabling technologies. Graphene is one-atom-thick planar sheet of carbon atoms that has mobility of charge carriers in excess of 200,000 cm2V−1s−1. It is the lowest resistivity substance known at room temperature. The extremely low resistivity makes graphene the next generation conductor that we are going to use as interconnects and antenna elements. Graphene also has supreme mechanical properties extremely suitable for flexible electronics. It is lighter, stronger, harder and more flexible than steel. Furthermore, it is a recyclable and sustainably manufacturable product that is eco-friendly. Another advantage of graphene antennas is that due to the reduced wave propagation speed of graphene, the size of antenna can be reduced to a factor of 10, which is critical for the routing and power dissipation for large number element arrays. Prototype of a fully graphene-based 4-bit 4-element digital beam forming PAA on flexible substrate such as Kapton, including antennas, field effect transistor (FET) switches and phase shifters will be developed. Performance features of the flexible PAA will be characterized including frequency/bandwidth, gain/efficiency, and power consumption.

Embry-Riddle and Honeybee Robotics propose an innovative resource prospecting mission concept based on autonomous small marsupial free-flyer prospector spacecrafts. Such technologies are currently being developed at Embry-Riddle. The spacecraft will utilize unique technologies such as MicroDrills and Pneumatic Samplers previously developed under other SBIR projects by Honeybee Robotics. In particular, the proposal will focus on flight control and reconfiguration for guidance under extreme environments, vision-aided navigation approaches, and sampling systems design, testing and evaluation. The proposed system will be developed, simulated and evaluated during Phase I of the project, and experimentally validated and demonstrated during Phase II through flight testing on an autonomous research platform. The successful completion of the proposed research is anticipated to provide a theoretical and experimental framework to investigate the capabilities of a marsupial-based robotic system to explore and extract samples from terrains that would be inaccessible to traditional rover-type vehicles and where traditional flight guidance and navigation sensors, such as GPS receivers and magnetometers, are not functional.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The acquisition of surface samples from small interplanetary bodies such as comets and asteroids, as well as small moons like Mars' Phobos, and Deimos holds great scientific interest.

In 2010, President Obama called for a new approach to space exploration, which would include human and robotic exploration of asteroids. Characterization of these objects would require novel approaches akin to what is here proposed.

This proposed ""smart"" material will ultimately enable the cost-effective manufacture of large, lightweight core-stiffened composite cryogenic pressure vessels. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will be transferred either directly onto the prepreg, or onto adhesive film plies that are subsequently laminated with the prepreg material. Electrical conductivity measurements via the CNTs will provide embedded SHM capabilities, while localized Joule heating will accelerate self-healing polymerization reactions. The CNT-enhanced prepreg will also serve as a carrier layer to embed well-dispersed self-healing micro-/nano-capsules within the polymer matrix and which will allow for self-healing of microcracks resulting from impact damage and thermal cycling. Self-healing efficiency will be characterized via mechanical testing. This smart material will ultimately be produced in spools of half-inch wide unidirectional prepreg slit tape, and laid down using Aurora's 7-axis, 16-spool automated fiber placement (AFP) machine. Trade studies will be performed on the AFP machine to determine the optimal processing parameters for laying down the smart material. The targeted demonstrator structure, a ""smart"" cryogenic pressure vessel, will detect microcracks caused by incident impact damage and rapidly repair the damage in situ.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed technology to integrate SHM and self-healing capabilities with a commercially available OOA prepreg material and an automated manufacturing process has several applications within NASA. As identified in this proposal, large composite cryogenic pressure vessels that are part of NASA's Space Exploration program will benefit from this technology by allowing them to be manufactured using lightweight materials in a cost-effective manner. The ability of these structures to repair microcracks in situ will also increase their lifetime and reliability.Other primary and secondary structures including vehicle and habitat module structures will also benefit from the proposed technology. Clearly, after these structures are launched into space, it is often not practical to service them in the event of any damage. The ability to detect damage and to self-heal will be advantageous in such cases. With the success of this STTR program, Aurora will have positioned itself to compete for future NASA contracts that require the manufacture of large, composite space structures similar to the Orion heavy lift launch vehicle, the Space Launch System, and NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) vehicle.

Being able to integrate SHM and self-healing capabilities with these structures will position Aurora to offer innovative new designs for commercial customers, that are more lightweight and damage tolerant. Furthermore, Aurora could leverage its relationship with major prepreggers such as Cytec, Hexcel, TenCate, and Toray to license the smart material out for subsequent sales to other industries including wind energy, automotive, and construction, where composite materials are being increasingly used. For example, Mega-watt wind turbine blades are being built to lengths of over 90 meters. These blades are repeatedly subjected to very high loads that often lead to cracks. A self-healing blade would minimize the downtime of the wind turbine required for repair and would thus lead to more efficient energy production. Moreover, embedded SHM capabilities would allow maintenance personnel to identify where cracks may be occurring ahead of time, thus preventing catastrophic failure.",Characterization; Composites; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Nanomaterials; Polymers; Processing Methods; Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Smart/Multifunctional Materials,,University of Massachusetts - Lowell,"600 Suffolk Street Room 226, Lowell, MA 01854 - 3643",(978) 934-4723,Smart Structural Composites for Space is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The result of this work will be systems that can rove with a reduced risk of catastrophic failure, while simultaneously increasing both the quantity and potential quality of science data products.

The Phase I program will combine several technologies with a simple design strategy to produce a flight-weight propulsion system that is easy to fabricate and operate. Self pressurizing propellants will minimize complexity of the propulsion system and vortex cold-wall technology will be used to simplify the combustion chamber. An inexpensive, light weight nozzle is being developed by Pennsylvania State University using carbon phenolics. Commercially available components will be use where possible to further minimize costs.The Phase I LNC will demonstrate these technologies through ground testing of a flight-like propulsion system. A small launch vehicle second stage will be designed based on the experimental performance characteristics. This work will form the basis for a family of vehicle stages from smaller upper stages to a main booster stage. The low cost technologies and design methods employed in the LNC will reduce the cost of launching nanosatellites into orbit.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The Low Cost Nanolauncher will have a variety of applications within NASA. The direct result of Phase I will be a design for an upper stage propulsion system that has been validated by subscale testing. It will be inexpensive to fabricate and operate, costing an estimated $70,000 per launch.  This upper stage will compliment the Nano Launch 1200 project at NASA, Marshall. This vehicle is destined to allow NASA to deploy small payloads to orbit without the restrictions and delays associated with piggybacking on larger vehicles. The Low Cost Nanolauncher propulsion system is applicable to many vehicle sizes both smaller and larger than the proposed stage. The simplicity and low cost of the vortex engine, ablative nozzle, and self pressurizing propellants make it ideal for small rockets with small budgets. The propellants are also storable and relatively benign, which gives the system a huge advantage over some of the higher performance alternatives. These qualities may be useful in other NASA programs such as the NASA Launch Services Enabling eXploration & Technology (NEXT) program. The propulsion system developed in Phase I is sized appropriately for a sounding rocket. With the addition of an airframe and parachutes the Low Cost Nanolauncher will become an inexpensive sounding rocket for use in atmospheric and near space research. It will also provide a means of flight testing thrusters, nano-satellites, and small components to increase their TRL level.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The propulsion system developed in Phase I will easily be transitioned to a sounding rocket. This sounding rocket would be low cost, reusable, and available on a flexible schedule. It will allow commercial customers fly payloads (5-10kg) on sub-orbital launches to 120km. This vehicle is expected to provide sub-orbital trips to space for $5,000/kg. Small businesses and research institutions would use this service to fly high altitude research equipment and test experimental hardware on sub-orbital launches to increase the TRL of their products. The educational system would be a new market made possible by low costs. From elementary school to college, educators and student groups could afford to make small payloads and have them launched. Such an experience would be an unparalleled tool for inspiring interest in applied math and science. All of these markets will benefit from flexible schedules and lower launch costs.During Phase II and Phase III a family of stages for an orbital vehicle will be developed. Such a vehicle will have a broad application. As a dedicated nanosatellite launch vehicle the Orbital Nanolauncher will be ideally suited to meeting expanding market demands. Without being tied to the launch of larger rockets, as most launches currently are, the Orbital Nanolauncher will provide flexible schedules and on-demand launch. The low vehicle cost and simple fabrication means production will easily scale to meet demand.","Aerodynamics; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",,Pennsylvania State University,"110 Technology Center Building, University Park, PA 16802 - 7000",(814) 865-1372,Affordable Nano-Launcher Upper Stage Propulsion is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Although existing lightning locating systems can geolocate breakdown processes with accuracies of 10s of meters at heights above 1.5-2 km, they do not accurately report ground strike locations or provide estimates of current and charge transfer. In addition, conventional VLF/LF LLS networks do not currently report lightning channels descending towards or contacting ground with enough accuracy to address this problem. There is a need for a system that can improve location accuracy and detection efficiency. Under this NASA STTR program, QUASAR Federal Systems proposes to team with Professor Ken Cummins of the University of Arizona to develop a lightning detection sensor based on an SoA 6-axis EB vector sensor and unique location and characterization algorithm. In Phase I, we will perform a feasibility study of using a 6-axis EB sensor to address NASA ""total lightning detection"" needs in location accuracy and detection efficiency.

During Phase I the team will apply adaptive meshing to enable efficient thermomechanical simulations for centimeter size test coupon builds, leverage existing multiphase flow models to analyze particle size effects on material variations, apply phase field models to predict microstructure evolution, and evaluate model predictions against experimental characterization.

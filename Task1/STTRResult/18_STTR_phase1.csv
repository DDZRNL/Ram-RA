A CO2 removal system that functions in a is a new area of research, as the primary CO2 removal component in the state-of-the-art system doesn’t have the adsorption performance behavior necessary to function in a Martian atmosphere. We propose to use an alternative adsorbent with unique and highly applicable CO2 adsorption properties - a diamine-appended metal-organic framework (MOF) - as a drop-in replacement for Zeolite 5A, the CO2 adsorbent onboard the ISS. Importantly, the mechanism for CO2 adsorption is disparate from the water adsorption mechanism, allowing the material to be the foundation of newly efficient CO2 removal processes.","Carbon dioxide (CO2) removal for breathing life support will always be a necessary component to human NASA missions. This proposal validates a new class of materials with remarkable CO2 removal properties at the low partial pressures relevant to human toxicity. Additionally, these materials are uniquely suited to perform in a Mars atmosphere. The chemistry of CO2 removal is more challenging on Mars than in a space vacuum, making the results applicable to any future Mars or non-Mars mission.","Industrial chemistry is a bedrock of modern society. Making chemicals, such as making the ethylene in polyethylene (grocery) bags, has two required components: making the chemical and separating it from any other molecules from the process.

Current testing instrumentation methods can be replaced with embedded sensor systems that are used for monitoring remote, hazardous, or inaccessible locations, while reducing cabling and power consumption. The additional information from the embedded sensor system will enable improved analysis techniques that will accelerate propulsion system developments. Luna proposes to develop a multi-function, drop in, sensor capable of measuring distributed temperature, heat flux, strain, and pressure in metal piping using embedded high-definition fiber optic sensing (HD-FOS). For Phase I, Luna will develop a demonstrator system and structure with an embedded HD-FOS for acquiring multiple physical parameters. The distributed multi-parameter sensor will simultaneously measure multiple physical effects on rocket engine piping and vessels. The HD-FOS has a spatial resolution of 0.65 mm, so thousands of data points can be collected along an optical fiber that can be used to quantify small features on complex test structures depending on the routing of the fiber. The instrumentation is highly flexible for a variety of extreme conditions (e.g. cryogenic) in remote or inaccessible measurement locations. This approach will minimize the wiring associated with multiple independent sensors such as thermocouples and pressure transducers, as well as increase safety benefits inherent in utilizing intrinsically safe sensors in the presence of fuel systems.","Distributed multi-parameter sensing can benefit existing and future rocket engine and test bed systems to monitor remote or inaccessible piping locations. Distributed sensing in turbojet engine applications in bypass piping, fuel delivery, and turbine coolant channel systems can be used for engine health monitoring. Satellite heat pipe sensing can provide data for cooling and power management. Computational models can leverage high fidelity distributed data for validation purposes.","Many applications extend into existing extreme condition and hazardous industrial processes. The automotive and commercial aircraft industry can use the sensors in critical high temperature components to detect the onset of hardware failure.

Currently, several methods are used to remove CO2 from spacecraft including amine scrubbers, lithium hydroxide canisters, and adsorbent-based carbon dioxide removal assemblies (CDRAs). Each scrubbing method has individual benefits and drawbacks: amine scrubbers have no particulate release but require high-energy regeneration; lithium hydroxide offers high capacity but the canisters are non-regenerable; and CDRAs offer moderate regeneration but suffer from dusting. The ideal unit would afford high CO2 capacity, low regeneration costs, minimized footprint and weight, and minimal particulate release.CDRAs, the preferred technology of NASA, currently utilize beds of Zeolite 5A and Zeolite 13x to remove CO2 and H2O, respectively. The drawbacks of this system are a result of the zeolite. Zeolites are a restrictive class of materials, where the inability to tune the material prevents further improvements in the CDRA system. Furthermore, utilizing zeolites in different environments beyond the CDRA system may further highlight the weakness of these materials for CO2 management.In contrast to zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a diverse class of chemically tunable adsorbents. NuMat Technologies (NuMat) proposes displacing zeolites in CDRA systems with MOFs, enhancing the properties of these systems. The ability to displace the water and carbon dioxide zeolites with a MOF will be evaluated. In addition, the ability of MOFs to be employed in other CO2 management environments will be investigated. During Phase I, NuMat will develop an understanding of how MOFs can enhance existing systems by utilizing the components of the system and simply replacing the zeolite bed with MOFs. This protocol of utilizing existing engineered systems will allow for MOFs to be rapidly transitioned through later technology readiness levels.","This phase one application will allow NuMat Technologies to understand how a new class of adsorbents, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), can be employed in CO2 management systems. This has the potential to be employed in multiple NASA applications. Primarily, these materials will be used to upgrade existing CDRA systems offering enhanced performance. Secondly, these materials have the potential to be employed in other CO2 management systems for use in surface systems and EVA systems.","The work under this grant has the potential to be used in a wide range of Non-NASA applications.

The freezing points of both hydrazine and NTO approach room temperature and require on-board electrical heaters for the propellant tanks.

The primary innovation proposed here is the development of a tool that generates bio-inspired, parametrically optimized cellular materials for integration into the design of Additively Manufactured three-dimensional structures, and will have four main constituent parts:Natural Models: Here we will identify biological models comprised of cellular patterns that will be used to parameterize the bio-inspired optimization tool. Parametrization: Using our identified natural models, we will measure and evaluate design parameters that will be used as inputs in the optimization tool. These parameters will fall into two categories: environmental (loading condition and thermal requirements) and design (thickness, curvature, length, and known material properties). Optimization Tool: At the heart of the proposal is an optimization tool that will use the commercially available Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software as its solver engine. The tool will operate on the environmental and design parameters (including material properties) developed in the previous part to identify clear structure-function relationships in the context of multiple objectives such as light-weighting and minimizing deformation. The output of the tool will both be reconciled against the data from natural models as well as used to design test specimens for validation with AM Additive Manufacturing: Our use of AM will serve two-purposes: first, we will use AM to validate the proposed design output from our bio-inspired optimization tool; second, we will ultimately use AM to manufacture bio-inspired parts, such as a heat exchangers or structural brackets that can be used in aerospace engineering.",Design and Manufacturing of high performance Materials for use in - Heat Exchangers - Lightweight structures - Space debris resistant skins,Design and Manufacturing of high performance materials for use in - Lightweight structures - Heat Exchangers - Protective Armor - Acoustic Liners - Shock Absorption,,,Arizona State University-Polytechnic,"P.O.

However, when bringing theory to practice, challenging problems related to the coordination and control of these swarms quickly arise. Vecna Robotics proposes a collaboration with MIT to extend existing autonomy behaviors and test platforms to address a class of planetary robotic operations involving heterogeneous teams of robots working together to accomplish a joint mission, with examples such as sample collection and mining. In these example applications, robots must perform coordinated task planning, operation, and execution while observing mission constraints that arise due to the asymmetric capabilities of the robot platforms. At pick-up and drop-off locations, there may be significant density of robots, requiring fast, real-time, coordinated motion planning to avoid collisions and achieve the desired behavior. To perform certain tasks, swarms of robots must localize relative to one-another to, for example, hold a formation while transiting from one task area to another.The Vecna-MIT team will address these challenges by developing a system that both has high requirements for autonomy and can handle heterogeneous robot teaming. There are three key areas of work to achieve the goal: 1) develop functionality that can accept high-level goals and recruit agents to meet the goals, 2) implement a set of local platform autonomy behaviors that enable swarm-like functionality, and 3) implement a task-arbitration system that can switch between “swarm” behavior and more traditional autonomy. The proposing team will leverage their unique capabilities to provide limited testing of the swarm behaviors on existing test beds as part of the Phase I. The results of this work can contribute not only to NASA’s objectives but also in the defense, disaster-recovery, and commercial sectors as well.","This work supports NASA’s objective to send swarms of vehicles to polar regions on Mars to search for frozen water sources or asteroids to mine precious metals. The solution can also serve as a base for other swarm applications, such as spacecraft. One application could be to swarms of drone-analogs that NASA is working on: Extreme Access Flyers, which could explore more distant locations on Mars, the moon, or asteroids.","The logistics industry is prime to benefit from swarm robotics applications. One application is to have “carrier” robots that interface with a central, more sophisticated retrieval robot to move boxes within a large package handling facility. Swarm behaviors can be used to coordinate complex motion around fixed automation equipment such as robotic picking arms.

The two main program components are 1) characterization of thin-ply HSCs through extensive testing and 2) multi-scale modeling of thin-ply HSCs at the constituent (matrix and fiber), lamina, and laminate levels. Of particular interest are modeling and characterizing the unique behaviors of highly spread tow woven textile HSCs.

The system now used on the International Space Station (ISS) is the carbon dioxide removal assembly (CDRA). While it has performed well on the ISS, managers have concluded that using the device to reach the new ppCO2 limit of 2.0 mm Hg is not practical and a new method is needed.In this project, Reaction Systems, Inc. and the University of Colorado will develop a new, membrane-based system to maintain ppCO2 at no higher than 2.0 mm Hg. The system utilizes the recent advances made in supported liquid membranes (SLMs) to achieve the high CO2 permeance and selectivity needed to make this approach practical. Performance data obtained with a Reaction Systems’ SLM was used to produce a conceptual system design that indicates an SLM system can maintain CO2 at 2.0 mm Hg and still meet size and power limits. A membrane system operates under steady-state conditions, and therefore pumps and heaters can be sized to operate at peak efficiencies, which maximizes lifetimes and minimize power requirements.Although the conceptual design of the SLM-based system proposed here is very promising, some of the data used to generate the design were obtained under conditions somewhat different from those that would be encountered in an application. Thus, the objectives of this Phase I STTR project are to acquire performance data for these components under representative conditions and then perform a thorough system optimization study using state-of-the-art software to identify the most efficient operating conditions for all components.Reaction Systems has been developing SLMs for CO2 control for over seven years and our partner in this project, Professor James Nabity, in the Snead Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department at the University of Colorado in Boulder, has nearly 15 years of experience developing ECLSS technologies for space habitats and spacesuits.","The immediate application of this technology is the use of a steady state system to control of CO2 in a spacecraft cabin to reach the ppCO2 limit of 2.0 mm Hg. A system that operates under steady state conditions allows all components to be sized to operate under peak efficiency conditions and eliminates the need to store and compress CO2 as it can be fed continuously into the O2 recovery system. This SLM technology could also be used in a simple, reliable system to control CO2 in a spacesuit.","This technology could also find use in capturing CO2, a known greenhouse gas, from power plants. Atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to over 400 ppm over the last 60 years and there is evidence that the CO2 atmospheric concentration is now affecting the world’s climate.

Figure 1 shows the proposed framework for the multiscale modeling suite. The process model will first predict the microscale thermal evolution in respect of various parameters. The temperature results will feed a subsequent macroscale model for prediction of stress and distortion at part scale. Moreover, the predicted thermal history and distribution will feed subsequent microstructure model to further predict the micro-scale features including grain morphology and porosity. The proposed computational modeling framework allows a comprehensive prediction and understanding of the metal AM process at multiple levels.In Phase I, Sentient will upgrade and demonstrate DigitalClone’s capability to integrate process-microstructure simulation for metal AM process. Specifically, selective laser melting of IN 718 alloy will be used for development and demonstration purposes in Phase I. AM coupons with different geometries will be fabricated by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) at different parameters. DigitalClone will be used to simulate all different scenarios of coupons made from IN718 alloys, and predict temperature, stress, part distortion, and grain structure. Materials characterization will be performed on the coupons to examine geometrical accuracy, microstructure, residual stress, all of which will be used to validate the DigitalClone model. In Phase II, different materials and AM platforms and more complex geometrical components will be tested for model validation. Additionally, close-loop optimization framework will be explored for improving geometrical design and microstructure features.","A successful completion of this project will lead to a robust AM modeling suite that provides accurate prediction of dimensional accuracy, microstructure, and defects in AM process. The proposed modeling suite will significantly reduce the uncertainty and conservatism in design of new AM components and processes. NASA would directly benefit from this software via virtually pre-testing the new AM component design, process effects and part quality.","The proposed modeling software will benefit several other industries incorporating AM technique, including aerospace, medical device, automotive industries.

The user can choose to include an arbitrary number of inertial sensors beyond the minimal number of sensors required for inertial navigation (3 gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers). This scalability enables both improved measurement resolution and system redundancy. The distributed nature of the system means that sensors can be placed arbitrarily by the user as needed in their design, under the constraint that each axis is measured by at least one accelerometer and gyroscope. This technology enables space-constrained systems to leverage redundant inertial sensors for fault detection and isolation (FDI). Beyond the systems engineering benefits of this system, distributing the sensors is grounded by previous research that suggests it will reduce the total noise of its output measurements.

To date, long and costly certification processes have hindered the widespread adoption and exploitation of the benefits of thin-ply composites with AFP. Without critical end-user feedback, material manufacturers haven’t fully developed their thin-ply material systems with the same repeatability, consistency, and quality of standard-ply-thickness composites.

The device will enable low cost of ownership (COO) $50-$100 for consumable parts and measurement system is expected to be less than $1000. High sensitivities of less than 67 femto grams per millimeter is expected. It is noted that each PC cavity is immobilized with a unique capture biomolecule, and interrogated simultaneously for binding between the probe capture and target biomolecule. Binding is manifested by change in resonance wavelength due to the change in refractive index. Large effective modal volume and high quality factor of the resonance enables the optical mode to interact with more biomolecules for a longer interaction time thereby leading to high sensitivity compact sensors. Binding specificity is achieved by sandwich assay techniques combined with multiplexed detection for statistical confidence. Electrical injection enables chip integration of the light source that offers superior advantage over all existing optical sensors which rely on coupling of external optical sources with complex instrumentation.

SiGeSn presents a great potential for the Si-based photonic spectrometers since it offers a direct band gap over a range of compositions as well as direct growth compatibility with Si. The narrow direct band gap offers the promise of III-V like photonic device performance in the ~1.5 to 5.0 micron range.The proposed on-chip biological and chemical spectrometer on silicon has the distinctive advantages of small foot print, potentially fully integrated on the same silicon platform to form the SI phonic circuits, including SiGeSn LED light source and detector, as well as light dispersion function, that will be made of a photonic crystal, rather than a diffraction grating as a means of wavelength separation.

Preliminary mission and spacecraft design work has shown that the swarm can support SAR imaging in the L-band (1.35 GHz) with a ground range resolution finer than 10 m with a revisit period of eight days. The spacecraft in the swarm are pre-programmed to rendezvous in a region, say a sphere or box of certain dimensions, centered at a specified set of (absolute) orbital elements. After deployment from the launcher each satellite maneuvers to bring itself into the rendezvous sphere while monitoring its surroundings with on-board means, such as the star tracker capable of taking still images while attempting to close inter-spacecraft radio communications (ISRC) links with its neighbors. Both (passive) optical or ISRC-based relative navigation are then used to determine the relative position and velocity vectors between spacecraft while they maneuver to aggregate the swarm in its nominal operations configuration. During swarm aggregation and nominal operations, algorithms developed in the framework of evolving systems ensure the stability of the swarm. Failure of one swarm member will also be simulated to analyze the swarm reconfiguration and recovery of nominal operations after reconfiguration. Formal proofs of feedback control system properties such as controllability-observability, stability, detectabililty, and robustness will be pursued to establish a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed algorithms. The Phase I feasibility demonstration will meet most of the technical objectives identified in the solicitation for the corresponding modes of swarm operations.","The evolving system algorithms proposed have a “common core” which can be applied to swarms of dynamic devices ranging from spacecraft to atmospheric and surface vehicles that cooperate to fulfill tasks beyond the capabilities of member. Swarm members can operate at a distance, without physical contact, such as the distributed SAR swarm proposed, or with physical contact such as in-orbit assembly of orbital solar power stations and commercial infrastructure.","Near-term applications of the algorithms are to autonomous road or off-road vehicles or ships. For example, the rendezvous between swarm members, of the distributed SAR mission, followed by swarm aggregation to acquire its configuration for nominal operations is quite similar to convoy formation and deployment for surface vehicles performing (re)supply operations for either defense or commercial use.",,,The University of Tennessee-Knoxville,"411 B.

High temperature materials such as ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are an avenue to lower engine mass because of the low density and high specific strength of the material. They also have a high maximum temperature and so contribute to high specific impulse by reducing the thermal load that must be removed from the nozzle structure, keeping the heat in the exhaust stream where it belongs. However, even the maximum temperature of CMCs is not high enough for stoichiometric methane-oxygen or hydrogen-oxygen flame conditions.In this Phase I effort, PSI will develop a regenerative cooling architecture and manufacturing method for a combined CMC/metal structure. The major difficulties encountered so far in adding fuel cooling to CMC nozzles is that CMCs are typically permeable and have low thermal conductivity. PSI will address these challenges using cold-spray metallization and metal additive manufacturing to build metal cooling passages on a corrugated CMC nozzle.If the proposed project is successful, it will result in a CMC/metal structure capable of withstanding combustion chamber, throat, and nozzle conditions by using regenerative cooling. The Phase I program will end with validated thermal design and manufacturing methods for a full regenerative CMC nozzle. This technology is applicable to a range of nozzle sizes from the 1.2 klbf MSFC “workhorse” nozzle configuration which would be targeted in a Phase II project, through booster-scale nozzles. At the end of the Phase I project, a manufacturing prototype of the CMC/metal cooling structure and design and test data will be provided to NASA.","The proposed regeneratively cooled ceramic matrix composite combustion chamber and nozzle technology would be immediately applicable to upper-stage rocket engines and small in-space and powered descent engines. With additional development, the same technology could be applied to large nozzles, which would yield an even greater system benefit than small nozzles due to their greater fraction of the total system mass for a large rocket.","Cooled ceramic matrix composites are applicable to combustors and hot structure for flight vehicles. For hypersonic airplanes, the technology is applicable to leading edges, combustor liners, and jet impingement surfaces. It can be used with fuel as coolant as in the rocket engine case, or with separate cooling loops including cryogenic, phase-change, or refrigerated.

The key components of this methodology are: (a) Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method for liquid jet core and primary atomization, (b) Transitional Breakup (TBU) model for treating large drops and ligaments resulting from primary atomization, (c) Secondary Breakup (SBU) models, (d) Lagrangian Particle Tracking Model (LPT) to track the dispersed droplets, and (e) Evaporation models. In Phase 2 work, this spray modeling methodology will be coupled to flamelet-based models in Loci-STREAM to yield a full spray combustion capability. The Transitional Breakup (TBU) model is a novel approach proposed in this project– it will allow a robust transfer of large drops from the VOF model to the LPT model. The key components of this TBU model are: (1) a cloud-of-parcels approach in which the large drops are extracted from the VOF model and injected into the LPT model as a cloud of Lagrangian parcels with a diameter equal to that of the large drop but a fractional number representing the part of the large drop that each parcel represents, and (2) a stochastic model which evaluates the probability of breakup and the size distribution of a large drop using Monte-Carlo methods.

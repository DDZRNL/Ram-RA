Given the uncertainty of future missions to the moon, Mars, and other bodies, a tool that allows for informed analysis of the option space is particularly relevant. Aurora Flight Sciences and MIT propose to further develop the Multi-Robot Planetary Exploration Architecture (MRPEA) methodology, a suite of software tools and analysis algorithms developed to provide decision aides to architecture planners of planetary surface exploration missions. MRPEA provides 1. A logical and graphical representation of the system space (e.g. interrelated decision variables with constraints), 2. Structural reasoning for rapid exploration of architectural spaces, 3. Simulation, and 4. Results viewing for a set of feasible architectures. Given the robots available or predicted to be available, the expected duration, and the mission goals, our methodology provides analysis results such as knowledge benefit-vs.-mass Pareto front graphs, to allow the designers to provide the best possible architecture for the planned mission or missions. The MRPEA analysis methodology primarily addresses the planning requirements of planetary surface missions, providing useful analyses of the many elements of the architectural decision space; in addition, the principles and techniques developed to analyze and select multi-robot architectures on planetary surfaces can also be applied to future fractional satellite systems, an area of increasing interest.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The primary NASA application for which the MRPEA methodology will be used is in overall mission planning of future planetary surface missions. This is applicable to future planetary surface missions. Last summer President Obama formed a ""Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee"" (NASA, Seeking a Human Spaceflight Program Worth of a Great Nation: Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee, 2009), tasked with identifying viable options for the future of human spaceflight. One option identified by the group, the ""flexible pathway"", does not explicitly call for human exploration of any planetary surface. This is in contrast to the 2004 Vision for Space Exploration (NASA, 2004), which lays out plans for human exploration of the surface of the moon, followed by Mars. Given the uncertainty of the involvement of crewmembers in planetary surface exploration, the application of a mission planning aide that allows the flexibility to utilize either robots and humans, or just robots, is highly relevant. The MRPEA methodology provides a flexible process by which mission planners can optimize future planetary surface missions, with varying resources (robots and/or humans), purposes, mission lengths and number of missions, and launch capabilities.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Potential non-NASA Commercial Applications primarily includes the Department of Defense. In particular, battlefield asset allocation requires optimizing the fleet of available unmanned and manned resources, depending on the purpose of a particular sortie or overall mission. We anticipate that a planner would be able to use our tool to better understand how to allocate networks of UGV's, manned vehicles, UAV's, and other assets. The MRPEA methodology can be extended to accommodate varying assets and mission purposes. In addition, we anticipate that this methodology could be used for design of human/robotic collaborative medical health care scenarios. Specifically, extended hospital or facility care (e.g. senior citizens) will, in the future, utilize robots for certain tasks. As this market sector grows, MRPEA will be useful in designating appropriate human or robot tasks and timelines, and designing architectural scenarios.",Computer System Architectures; Software Development Environments,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 - 4301",(617) 324-7210

The picosatellite technology demonstrator was at a TRL of 7 at the end of Phase 1. For Phase 2, NASA plans a second flight, and the technical objectives are to further characterize the DRAGON receiver and develop navigational solutions using DRAGON data.

Current granular mechanics models are based on mono-disperse spherical particles empiricism unsuitable for capturing the poly-disperse irregularly shaped grain mechanics. CFDRC and the University of Florida successfully demonstrated a novel approach in Phase I to develop granular mechanics constitutive models through innovative Discrete Element Methods emulating non-spherical, jagged particles constructed as clusters of linked/overlapping spheres. This first principle modeling captures the fundamental relationship between particle shape and particle-phase stress, cohesion, and particle flow kinetics. In Phase II, detailed regolith granular flow constituent models will be derived with these methods. An Eulerian granular phase model with the resulting constitutive models will be implemented in the Unified Flow Solver (UFS) simulation framework developed by CFDRC and UF for lunar debris transport and applied in Eulerian multi-phase gas-regolith interaction simulations. Surface stresses from turbulent jet plume scouring and regolith roughness that amplify erosion mechanisms will be captured using a Reynolds Stress Turbulence model. The integrated UFS simulation tool will be validated against erosion and cratering experiments with sand, lunar/Mars simulants, and reduced gravity effects.

The adaptable system will provide information on current and predicted aircraft performance and controllability, alerting the pilot to any aerodynamic degradation of the aircraft control surfaces. This includes heavy rain, in-flight icing encounters, environmental contamination of surfaces, and structural damage such as bird strikes or battle damage. The real-time monitoring system measures the unsteady control surface hinge moment from all aircraft aerodynamic controls. Control surface hinge moments are sensitive to the aerodynamics of the section, including separation. These data are processed and information on the current and predicted future state of aircraft performance and control (including asymmetric cases) is made available to the pilot or flight management system. Phase I results have shown that the hinge moment sensor concept is a viable technology for the monitoring and prediction of airfoil stall. The hinge moment monitoring system was able to provide reliable stall warning and prediction across an incredibly wide range of simulated aerodynamic hazards.

Aircraft health management systems are listed as critical research initiatives within the Aviation Safety Program, specifically in the Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) project. IVHM calls for advancing the state-of-the-art in on-board health state assessment including continuous diagnosis and prognosis.

Commuter aircraft are particularly important targets because they typically operate at lower altitudes/airspeeds, putting them at greater risk of environmental or structurally based aerodynamic performance degradation, including ice, heavy rain, and bird strikes. The real-time estimation of aircraft boundaries and controllability provided by the system is of utmost importance to the pilot encountering edge of the envelope flight, or flight into adverse conditions. The technology is equally valuable for UAVs where it is difficult, or impossible for the remote operator to sense differences in performance due to environmental hazards or structural/battle damage.

NASA particularly needs advanced components for in-situ gas measurements using tunable laser spectrometers in circumstances where available platforms such as aircraft, balloons, surface and entry probes, and landed rovers, present severe limitations on resources. Tunable laser absorption spectroscopy is a simple measurement technique known for its high sensitivity and specificity. For instance, tunable laser spectroscopy can measure the CH4 abundance down to 10 parts in 1E12 with preconcentration and to 1 ppbv without preconcentration. Measurement of the isotopic ratio 13C/12C in CH4 will help assess the biogenic origin of CH4 on a planet like Mars. Also important are laser sources for remote measurements of carbon-based trace gases (CO2, CH4, C2H6, and CO) from aircraft and spacecraft operating to nadir using the earth¡¦s surface as a target, as well as for profiling measurements from the ground using atmospheric backscatter.

Residential natural gas companies routinely search for leaks in distribution systems using very expensive methods (including trucks manned with funnel suction lines and spectroscopic equipment). The same situation exists at supplier levels where gas transmission, production, and storage facilities use enormous amounts of resources detecting leaks. Low cost, portable leak monitors, enabled by this source technology, would reduce the cost of facility ownership. Finally, the cost benefits that come with volume opportunities associated with semiconductor-based lasers could lead to devices with costs easily below $1000 per unit in large volumes and hence, portable sensors at unit costs below $2500.

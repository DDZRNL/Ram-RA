A research program is proposed to provide enhanced capabilities to the NASA STARS software package in two key areas.  These are; the addition of a control system toolbox including classical and modern control system design procedures, and the introduction of parallelization into the computational process.  Since most current and planned high performance air vehicles depend heavily on their flight control systems, and their structure is designed for low weight, and an efficient propulsion system is essential, a fully integrated analysis is required in the design process to produce overall optimized performance.  All these factors motivate the need for the newly proposed developments.  Also, as more complexity is added to the analysis software, computer throughput productivity inevitably drops, despite computer advances, and this drives the need for parallelization.  The capability resulting from this research promises significant increases in the scope and efficiency of STARS such that its use will have a greater range of application and will contribute to the assurance of safety in flight testing.  The planned reusable launch vehicle will be the initial application objective of the enhanced software.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  NASA will benefit from the expanded analysis capability and increased computational throughput made available by the addition of control systems and parallelization to STARS.  NASA Dryden conducts research into the most advanced air vehicles and must maintain software analysis tools of the highest quality to assure safety of flight testing, to which the planned STARS enhancements contribute.  The enhanced STARS tool can be offered to other NASA facilities, expanding the user base and ensuring its continued growth.  The reusable launch vehicle is a suitable first application, such that the benefit from this STTR project has an early impact.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  Multidisciplinary analysis simulation packages, such as STARS, are in considerable demand both inside and outside of NASA.

To protect laser lifetimes and increase performance, these lasers will require isolators to protect them from back-reflections, similar to the isolators in all fiber-optic networks.  This work proposes to monolithically integrate magneto-optical isolators with semiconductor platforms in order to reduce the size and weight, as well as increase the performance, of NASA?s semiconductor laser systems.  The important elements in an integrated isolator are 1) magneto-optical waveguides and 2) permanent magnet biasing films.  Yttrium iron garnet (YIG), the strongest magneto-optical material, is very difficult to grow onto semiconductor platforms.  This work will use a novel technique, metallorganic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) to achieve this feat.  Preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility, but not the optimization, of this technique.  Permanent magnet films of SmCo have also demonstrated promise as biasing magnets in waveguide isolators.  Here, SmCo films will be made using a novel in-situ nitriding technique during Sm and Co codeposition. Also proposed is the optimization of buffer layers, which buffer substrates during growth and act as optical claddings.

This idea will take the skill and intelligence inherent in human operators and provide the basis for how the controller can adjust during autonomous operation.

(OTI) is proposing a unique acoustic method for measuring flow rate of liquid cryogens.  Over the last 30 years, acoustic flowmeters have been demonstrated that non-intrusively measure flow rates in fluid filled pipes.  The majority of these use pulsed time of flight techniques but none have used continuous wave (CW) techniques as is being proposed.  The advantages of the proposed technique are simplicity of electronics, better signal detection capability, and continuous verses periodic measurements.  This translates to a cheaper, smaller, more capable and highly accurate sensor suite.  The risk of the proposed technique is reduced since proven pulsed time of flight systems use nearly identical sensor configurations and are based on the same physics.  Measurement of fluid flow of liquid cryogens adds significant complexity to the sensor design due to material thermal effects but literature suggests that acoustic flowmeters are applicable for flow measurement of liquid cryogens.  Upon completion of Phase I, OTI expects to have demonstrated the validity of the proposed method and have a working commercially viable flowmeter design by the end of Phase II.  OTI expects the new flowmeter will provide NASA with a means to more accurately and more reliably measure cryogenic flow.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  The primary NASA application is that stated in the request for proposal.  NASA requires cryogenic flow measurements during fuel loading (liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen) operations.  Accurate flow measurements are required to insure that correct amounts of fuel and oxidizer are loaded for test operations as well as Shuttle missions.  Accurate flow measurements are also required during test firings for plant control and monitoring.  Due to the high pressures involved, wetted flow sensors are less desirable because of the increased risk of leaks.  Higher maintenance is also an issue with wetted transducers. Acoustic flow sensors are more accurate and can be operated non-intrusively offering significant advantages. The proposed CW acoustic flowmeter offers inherent advantages. Sample rate is higher and cost is lower than acoustic flowmeters based on different methods.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  Acoustic flowmeters are applied in many industrial process control applications from the oilfield, to nuclear power plants, to waste water treatment, to manufacturing facilities.  Any plant where flow measurements are required is a potential application. The proposed flowmeter likewise has similar application but will be faster and less costly.  The proposed flowmeter will be cost competitive with traditional flowmeters but provide better accuracy. Current acoustic flowmeters are costly and generally used only where wetted sensors are not feasible and the cost is not the driving factor.   Researchers have also demonstrated acoustic flowmeters that provide density estimates allowing a single sensor to provide mass flow.  This is of particular interest in industries such as the paper industry where process control requires mass flow.

Highly porous structural foam may be developed for high thermal efficiency, high temperature fuel elements for both propulsion and gas-cooled power reactors. Current designs, such as annular rods or pebble beds, cannot operate at extremely high temperatures and thus limit efficiency. In this project, the foam fuel material will ultimately consist of a tricarbide, UZrNbC, composed of enriched uranium that is vapor infiltrated into a foam matrix of niobium carbide (NbC) and zirconium carbide (ZrC), although tantalum carbide (TaC) will be substituted for uranium carbide (UC) during initial development. The porous structure provides an extended surface area for highly efficient heat transfer and reduces density, reducing hydrogen turbopump power demands and increasing thrust-to-weight ratio. The foam matrix can have 80-90% open porosity for maximum convection, and the ligament dimensions can be tailored to provide either good or poor thermal conduction as needed. Recent work on porous materials has demonstrated effective heat transfer coefficients with helium near 26,000 W/m2?K. NbC and ZrC foams have several important advantages over other high temperature materials, including low density, lack of degradation in hydrogen at 3000 K (where they also retain structural integrity), and minimal neutron cross-section. The dispersed fissile material is an integral part of a high-conductivity matrix. Thus, a much lower temperature difference can exist between the fuel and the propellant. Extremely high outlet temperatures can be achieved, yielding the high specific impulse required for interplanetary exploration.

UltraSail is an innovative, non-traditional approach to propulsion technology achieved by combining propulsion and control systems developed for formation-flying microsatellites with an innovative solar sail architecture to achieve controllable sail areas approaching 1 km^2, sail subsystem area densities of 1 gm/m^2, and thrust levels 20 times those of ion thrusters used for comparable deep space missions.  UltraSail can conceivably even achieve outer planetary rendezvous, a deep space capability now reserved for high-mass nuclear and chemical systems.  The primary innovation is the near-elimination of sail supporting structures by attaching the sail tip to a number of formation-flying microsatellites which deploy the sail, and then articulate the sail to provide attitude control, including spin stabilization and precession of the spin axis.  These tip microsatellites are controlled by a laser metrology system and maneuvered by a 3-axis microthruster system using solar-power to maintain low, constant velocity and proper sail film tension during deployment with negligible propellant mass.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  UltraSail may have limited military applications for earth-observing missions at high orbit where stationary observing is useful ? e.g. pole-sitting missions.

Artificial gravity may be produced by spinning a spacecraft about its center of mass, but unless the distance from the center of rotation is several kilometers, the rotation rate required to generate one ?g? would induce vertigo in the astronauts.

The satellite links demonstrated a novel and sophisticated application of technology to the problem of retrieving in situ data from harsh remote terrestrial environments. Using these Antarctic seismic stations as a starting point, we propose to make a second innovative leap in remote instrumentation by creating intelligent, self-organizing instrument networks capable of recording, storing, processing, and returning high volumes of geophysical data from the field.  These instruments will be built from low-cost COTS components, will intercommunicate via wireless microwave protocol, and will return data through a high-rate telemetry system.  As such the proposed instrument network will drastically reduce the costs of field instrumentation and data recovery.  The notion of an intelligent autonomous array of sensors has gained in popularity and momentum in the scientific world with new technological advances.

It is not logistically possible to make an emergency medicine physician part of every crew so NASA relies on the C.M.O. program, which, in essence, places a layperson in charge of life or death decisions. The C.M.O.s have no clinical acumen on which to base their decisions, yet they are expected to make medical judgments. The device would allow laypersons to easily, reliably and quickly treat patients using sound, validated algorithms; the mainstay of pre-hospital care.

By rapidly monitoring (1 ?Ys response time) broad absorption spectra, the CWPE can interrogate temperature, pressure, and multiple species concentrations in gases at arbitrary conditions and can simultaneously monitor cryogenic liquid properties, all with a simple design.  Along a line-of-sight with non-uniform properties, the CWPE can also record gas temperature distributions rather than just the path-averaged temperature.  These capabilities represent a dramatic enhancement of the best diode-laser sensors available just two years ago, which were not wavelength-agile.

The unit will be initially demonstrated by interrogating static gas cells at various mixtures and pressures, flat-flame burners, and dewars of LOX containing known amounts of trace constituents (such and N2).

First, a novel on-line monitoring system performs model validation and fault diagnosis. The monitor automatically distinguishes between fault occurrence and normal operating regime switching and determines the particular fault type after fault detection. It can directly deal with nonlinear fault models, handle unstructured modeling uncertainty and unanticipated failures, and is suitable for real-time operations. Second, a new reconfiguration supervisor makes decision regarding controller reconfiguration and resource management. The supervisor provides a unified framework for fault detection, fault isolation and fault-tolerant control, which is still lacking in literature according to a recent survey paper. Another new feature is that the effect of fault detection time on system stability has been explicitly taken into account. Third, a controller suite with novel robust adaptive controllers to deal with different failure modes in each regime is proposed. The fault-tolerant controllers are designed based on recently developed nonlinear adaptive/neural control techniques.

The Autonomous Power Scheduler (APS) will maximize power efficiency and availability while being situationally-aware of bus conditions. The concept system would employ a component-based model to diagnose system status with embedded logic, and respond to anomalous power states and initiate recovery or mitigation actions pending further ground command, while remaining within defined spacecraft state-of-health parameters. The APS represents an innovative paradigm shift from conventional design practices. Conventionally, spacecraft power is managed using static, non-intelligent designs based on worst-case, lowest power scenarios, and subsystem operational power allocations are made with ?man-in-the-loop? decisions through transmitted commands. What is proposed here is a method to control primary power in an intelligent, semi- or fully autonomous fashion maximizing mission capability and performance. Appropriate power will be distributed when and where it is most needed. The autonomy of the APS concept and the resulting reduction in requirements for ?man-in-the-loop? decision making makes it particularly applicable to NASA?s future generation of distributed constellation missions.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  Over the next ten years NASA has planned numerous upcoming small satellite for near Earth and deep space missions which have a need for low mass, power efficient, survivable components and subsystems such as their electric power subsystems. The majority of these missions will be severely restricted in their ability to maintain batteries due to their limited power gathering capabilities, in particularly for deep space and constellation missions such as the Magnetospheric Constellation mission. These missions require components optimized for mass, power, and cost, while satisfying the reliability and efficiency needed for single string and deep space missions. To fulfill these requirements we feel the development of a highly efficient, semi-autonomous or even fully autonomous electrical power system based on APS which we are proposing will be beneficial and significantly contribute to life and capability of these missions.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  Due to the autonomous nature of APS, we envision a wide range of power-limited, mobile platform applications. This system will make better use of the available power resources to reduce weight and increase system life. Weight can be reduced by requiring less energy stores to meet basic mission objectives. Smaller batteries or less fuel may be required to meet operational goals. Weight reduction often equates to increased endurance for ground-based, autonomous systems. Two specific areas of ground-based systems that can benefit from reduced mass and increased autonomy are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Deployable Sensors. UAVs are operated remotely or, at certain times, completely autonomously. The less weight, the further range and flight duration that is possible. Deployable Sensors are most commonly used for theater applications. They are used to track and identify the source of ground movements. Reduced weight allows the sensors to be deployed with minimum manpower in difficult areas for vehicle access.",,Information Technology,University of Colorado,"527 UCB, Boulder, CO, 80309 - 0572",( 303 ) 492 - 2561

The solution leverages Embedded Research Solutions (ERS)'s expertise in the area of embedded real-time systems and merges recent advances by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the area of MBR. ERS has used a state-based approach to building dynamically reconfigurably software, through the creation of resource-savvy real-time frameworks and software components for control and communication applications. This technology provides the underpinnings to incorporate JHU/APL's newest results in MBR, namely expressive state definitions, into MIT's second generation MBR system TITAN, and shrinking the resulting reasoning engine to a size suitable for on-board real-time processing in autonomous systems.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS):  The solution directly addresses NASA's needs described in STTR 2002 Topic 1, subtopic, ""Technologies for Autonomous Spacecraft, Rovers, and Other Complex Systems.""

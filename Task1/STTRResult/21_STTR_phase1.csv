While digital assistants can be utilized to assist NASA analysts and engineers in performing many different functions (e.g., requirements verification, literature review, Q&A), our proposal focuses on helping NASA vehicle crew members answer routine operations and maintenance queries by monitoring system status using sensor data, telemetry, component outputs, and other real-time data. To support this goal, we propose the Vehicle Crew Operations and Maintenance Assistant (VeCOMA) in direct support of the TX11.4.7 Digital Assistant subsection of the 2020 NASA Technology Taxonomy. The goal of VeCOMA is not to replace Mission Control Center (MCC) guidance, but rather to provide course of action (COA) assistance to crew members using a multi-criteria decision making approach, which incorporates a dialog system and automated data ingest and formatting process. VeCOMA will help NASA vehicle operators in identifying issues in operation, finding their solutions in existing documentation through a comprehensive documentation database, and recommending a course of action to the operators accordingly.","The capabilities proposed in this project are needed on numerous NASA programs; however, our strategy is to focus transition on NAS via existing relationships with Aeronautics Systems Analysis Branch programs and HRP via collaboration with Space Mission Analysis Branch programs.

Spacecraft crew on deep space exploration missions will need to manage, plan, and execute a mission independently of mission control on Earth, because of communication time lags or outages. Due to complexity of spacecraft systems, operations management will be prohibitively time consuming and computationally intensive. Off-nominal events may occur that limit crew activity or capacity. Furthermore, space habitats like Lunar Gateway may operate without crew for weeks, months, or even years at a time, necessitating autonomous operations. When a space habitat is unoccupied, unexpected events may require immediate autonomous detection and response. HEART assesses ECLSS robustness in real time for autonomous habitat health management. It provides state estimation, model-based anomaly detection, prioritized anomaly reporting, and managed transitions to different operating modes (dormant, quiescent, and active) in space habitats like Lunar Gateway. The benefits of HEART over state-of-the-art ECLSS health management applications include improved situational awareness, model-based anomaly detection for dynamic systems, early degradation detection, risk assessment for prioritized reporting, state transition readiness, and adaptability. This Phase I project will show proof of concept for the enabling functions of HEART. In support of NASA’s priorities for sustained human exploration of deep space the HEART concept will be a major step towards autonomous systems that enable spacecraft operation independent of Earth-based mission control. The design will be readily transferable to terrestrial applications, including management of any complex controlled environment supporting life forms, such as submarines, plant growth chambers, greenhouses, or even biomanufacturing facilities.","HEART will be an asset for autonomous operations in space habitats envisioned by NASA for deep space exploration, such as Lunar Gateway, lunar surface habitats, Mars transit vehicles, or Mars surface habitats.

Benefitting from wafer-level fabrication, monolithically processed components allow for a sensing instrument with no moving parts which can be hardened to endure the harsh conditions of space missions.

REALISE will be based heavily on functionality, components, and experience from past Shuttle, ISS, and Orion heritage flight hardware but is intended to set new standards for in-situ scientific analysis, long-term cell culturing, as well as automation. The in-situ automated microscopy compartment will set new standards in characterizing cell adaptations in space over time as opposed to only start and end conditions. The fluorescent analysis -in addition to bright-field microscopy for morphological changes- will be used to characterize microbiological processes such as cell metabolism, cell health, and cell function. While REALISE is developed specifically for the Lunar Orbital Platform Gateway, it will have future applications also on commercial space stations and lunar surface habitats both manned and unmanned as well as for more automated and less crew-intensive experiments onboard the International Space Station. REALISE is proposed to be a two locker system that will be permanently deployed onboard the Lunar Orbital Platform Gateway and can store and actively support cell cultures fully thermally-controlled for up to 9 months. Once an experiment or production is terminated, REALISE is designed to be serviced on-orbit while the crew is present for consumable swap out so that the unit can initiate another autonomous operation cycle. Potential applications are radiation studies over multiple generations to characterize the response of organisms or the effectiveness of countermeasures for future long-term human spaceflights as well as cell production facilities for unique terrestrial cell culture treatments that can only be grown in the space environment.","REALISE will provide NASA the capability to conduct autonomous long-term cell culture studies ranging from microbiology (yeast, protein crystals, ) to mammalian cell cultures (bone cells, heart cells, blood cells, stem cells) in deep space.

Mesh adaptation is output-based, providing reliable control of numerical errors associated with quantities of engineering interest, such as drag or integrated wall temperature. The adaptation provides a feedback loop to automatically produce anisotropic meshes that are aligned with shocks, reducing errors induced by mesh-shock mismatch, and eliminates laborious human-in-the-loop mesh generation. Robust simulation of the strong bow shocks associated with high-speed flows is achieved through the use of a PDE-based artificial viscosity augmenting the conservation equations. The PDE-based articial viscosity provides superior dissipation for shock capturing by distributing artificial viscosity in a smooth manner between neighboring elements. The capability effectively reduces entropy noise in the post-shock region compared to shock operators based solely on local quantities. Metric-conforming mesh adaptation will be incorporated into the industry leading Pointwise mesher using established local cavity operators and mesh curving procedures. The metric-conforming meshing algorithm will first be performed under the assumption of linear elements (Q1). For higher order solves, the mesh will then be curved to better approximate the geometry. Existing finite-rate and multi-species non-equilibrium chemistry models will be analyzed as to their suitability for the higher order mesh adaptation. A specific challenge to be addressed in this project is adjoint compatibility (i.e. well posedness of adjoint PDEs) of the non-equilibrium relations and adjoint consistency of the resulting discretization. Essential to this process is establishing consistency between the mathematical and physical entropies associated with the models, and may require minor adjustments to modeling correlations.","NASA applications include high-speed air vehicles, space vehicle launch, assent, and entry, parachute deployment, and complex multi-species reacting flows.","Military applications include vehicle aerodynamics and store separation.

Our approach will enable the connection of multiple quantum memory registers across a free-space or fiber optical channel, increasing the bandwidth of near-term quantum networks by 10–100×. As most optical quantum memories operate at a single wavelength we cannot readily apply wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) techniques to increase the bandwidth of a quantum link. To overcome this challenge, we propose to utilize a high-efficiency frequency shifters at the transmitter to shift each quantum register within a memory unit onto a separate wavelength channel that we can combine using standard WDM techniques. After transmitting the multiplexed signal over a free-space or fiber link, a complimentary device at the receiver will de-multiplex the photons and a second set of frequency shifters will shift the wavelengths back to original native frequency of the quantum memory’s register. Within Phase I, we will design and demonstrate a compact on-chip, high-efficiency frequency shifter operating at a native quantum memory wavelength using an approach that can be readily adapted to any existing quantum memory configuration at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. These results, in conjunction with an architecture-design that can efficiently shift and route multiple photons to different registers within a quantum memory, will pave the way for the creation of a highly scalable quantum networks using QWDM.","The development of quantum communications and networks are a key technology to enable secure communication, sensor arrays, and quantum computer networks.

This level of accuracy enables the application of optical atomic clocks to a whole host of precision sensors, including the measurement of weak gravitational fields in near-zero gravity as well as accurate positioning, navigation, and timing onboard a spacecraft. However, high performance optical atomic clocks currently only exist in laboratory settings due to requirements of an ultra-narrow-linewidth (< 10 Hz) interrogation laser used as an optical flywheel for the atomic clock transition. The solution presented here for the development of an ultra-narrow linewidth laser is an extension to the initial investigations of Dr. William Loh at MIT-LL with chip-scale stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) cavities.

To ensure optimal growing conditions in these chambers, the plants will require precise monitoring of health throughout the plant life cycle. These monitoring systems will need to operate autonomously with little crew involvement. Current plant monitoring instruments include multispectral and hyperspectral sensing that require post-process algorithms to detect physiological phenomena.

Single photon sources that produces photons that are entangled are also needed for quantum communications. The development of a carbon nanotube electrode by the SBIR firm during unrelated SBIR Phase III work related to an E-Nose for detection of VOC's in COVID-19 infected patients, provides a new avenue for the development of single photon sources. By implanting functionalized quantum dots (QD) on activated carbon nanotube (CNT) sites we can generate single photons by three different processes. 1) Electrical stimulation of quantum dots embedded in a dielectric 2) Optical stimulation using a laser of a different wavelength 3) Opto-electric stimulation of the quantum dots by providing a bias voltage and then providing optical pumping. The use of CNTs as both the support structure and electrode provides an ultra dark background for absorbing light from the pump laser to allow easier viewing of the emitted photon. CNTs freely share electrons within their matrix, also making them appear as an electron gas, which may also enhance the QD photon generation pump process. The QD's will be implanted using a nano plotter on an array of 16 pixels that are derived from the E-Nose chip design, this could allow for the implantation of a variety of QD types to provide different colors of emitted photons from each pixel. During Phase I will focus on demonstrating that we can generate single photons by these modalities. A pump laser will be passed through a fast optical fiber switch and collimated to illuminate the pixel array; the 1x2 switch will be operated to allow the illumination and collected photons to be isolated, with the emitted photons captured by the collimator array and output by the fiber switch to a fast detector for measurement.","Generation of single photons and many of them is a key technology to applying quantum entanglement to quantum computing, communications and cryptology. Single photon generation will allow the adaptation of existing technology and infrastructure to this new and powerful means of communication.

The physical characteristics of regolith on the lunar surface, along with its lack of an atmosphere and low gravity make the fine particles a hazard for equipment and operations on the moon. Mars presents similar hazards with its low-pressure atmosphere and reduced gravity. Regolith ejected from landers upon landing or taking off represent the highest risk due to the high exhaust velocities. To mitigate high-velocity regolith from being ejected into adjacent areas, landing and launch pads require surface stabilization. Due to the large mass required and high payload costs, methods that incorporate ISRU have the potential to present a lower-cost and more efficient option for planetary construction. Past work by PISCES, in conjunction with NASA SwampWorks and Honeybee robotics, has focused on sintering basalt without binders. This method has proven successful, but the high energy and the need for consumable high- temperature molds would incur substantial energy and payload costs. Recent work done by PISCES evaluated the use of a binder in an aqueous solution that eliminates the problem of high energy input required for the process. The use of this binder has allowed for a reduction of the sintering temperature of the basalt, but most importantly, it cures into a structurally viable material under a vacuum and in CO 2 . This can be a game changer that allows for the regolith binder mix to be used in additive construction operations without the need for additional heat or consumable molds.

The state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamic (CFD) capabilities, however, still have many limitations in terms of accuracy, fidelity, and robustness which need to be addressed. For example, a 3-D Navier-Stokes solution with thermal and chemical nonequilibrium requires on the order of weeks to develop a sensible grid, the gridded geometry must be greatly simplified, requires careful monitoring of the solution as it runs since the problems are numerically “stiff” and are quick to “crash”, and the solution accuracy is limited by the numerical schemes employed. In response to this need, we propose to develop a compressible CFD solver employing a novel moving Discontinuous Galerkin with Interface Conservation Enforcement (MDG+ICE) approach including thermal and chemical non-equilibrium physics. In addition to all of the advantages of standard DG methods, discontinuous interfaces are not explicitly tracked and rather solved and obtained implicitly as a result of the interface conservation enforcement, which is enforced via grid movement. The MDG+ICE method represents a fundamentally grounded and break-through approach, and is specifically designed for flows with discontinuities and therefore especially attractive for hypersonic flows. This capability would enable a faster turn-around for modeling the complex physics relevant to entry-type problems due to increased robustness, higher order numerics less sensitive to mesh topologies and resolutions, and flexibility afforded by unstructured grids.","The proposed solution would directly benefit all of NASA’s on-going and upcoming EDL programs by delivering a high-order, robust CFD modeling capability for reentry modeling.

This capability would also greatly improve the fidelity and turn-around times for modeling of the different spacecraft being developed by NASA’s commercial partners such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Sierra Nevada.","The proposed solution would also greatly benefit the Defense Industry.

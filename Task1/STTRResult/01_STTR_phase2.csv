Methods of applying the identified coatings to achieve the desired surface finish will be optimized. High temperature friction and wear tests to 1500oF will be completed using both journal bearings and thrust bearing pads to evaluate and characterize the candidate coatings and foil materials. The use of sacrificial coatings as identified in Phase I will also be investigated. High temperature foil material manufacturing processes specifically designed for foil bearings and seals will be conducted. Final validation of selected materials and manufacturing methods will be conducted under dynamic bearing testing at elevated temperatures. The test results will be used to refine the bearing/sealing/coating system designs for incorporation into a candidate General Aviation gas turbine engine.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS) The commercial potential for the proposed coating system resulting from this program is significant, including both commercial and military applications that will use compliant foil bearings/seals. System applications for the developed bearing/coating system include gas turbine engines for helicopters, business jets, general aviation commuter jets, gas pipeline compressors, auxiliary power units and remote power generation systems.  Other applications include smaller and lighter air cycle machines for aircraft cabin pressurization and cooling; oil-free turboexpanders for high purity cryogenic gas/liquid production; motor driven compressors; and hybrid thrust bearing configurations for large gas turbine engines. The key benefit to these applications is the elimination of the lubrication system.

Brockmeyer,,,,,,,,,,,"TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS) Current thermal protection systems (TPS) severely limit the flight path and the mission flexibility of space transportation vehicles, including reusable launch vehicles.  TPS are essential, but add parasitic weight rather than providing both structural functionality and thermal protection.  Multifunctional TPS with combined thermal-structural capability would be highly desirable.  TPS are also subject to limited life due to rapid failure or need for replacement if the outer surface suffers damage.  The overall objective of this project is to overcome the limitations of current TPS and enhance capabilities over developmental systems by demonstrating an innovative, multifunctional and self-healing TPS.  This unique new system provides an unequaled combination of performance, large cross-section fabricability and low fabrication cost.  Phase I emphasized baseline application definition and process development for the innovative carbon aerogel-filled, carbon foam core structure.  A new lower-cost, larger-scale aerogel infiltration method was developed and demonstrated.  This reduces processing time by >50% and no longer requires equipment-intensive, costly and scaleup-inhibiting supercritical drying of the aerogel.  In a parallel, but secondary, effort, development was started of enhanced and potentially self-healing carbon/carbon facesheets.  In Phase II, the technology will be scaled up and demonstrated for a selected application.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS) Next-generation systems applications for the proposed advanced TPS include future space transportation vehicles, including reusable launch vehicles, the Military Space Plane and Space Maneuvering Vehicle or Space Operations Vehicle, reentry vehicles, and hypersonic missiles.  The proposed TPS could also benefit existing applications, such as the leading edges and windward surfaces of the space shuttle orbiter.  The proposed system has potential for dramatic weight reduction and higher operating temperature compared to state-of-the-art TPS designs, as well as improved durability, enhanced fabricability, and lower cost.  Broader derivatives of the technology are also foreseeable.  For example, using lower temperature variants of the aerogel filler (e.g. polymeric aerogels rather than pyrolyzed carbon aerogels within a rigid open-cell foam structure) could lead to structural, low temperature insulation systems.  These systems could be used with low temperature aerospace tank structures or could be considered for low temperature commercial applications.",,,03-Materials and Structures,Southern Research Institute,"757 Tom Martin Drive, Birmingham, AL , 35211 -4468",(205 ) 581 -2000

The technology uses optimized blowing to prevent flow separation and significantly reduce the downstream wake size. A Phase I STTR proved the feasibility of using suction surface blowing jets to produce a sound power reduction on the order of 7dB and a reduction in losses of 60%. This research will combine an optimized flow control design with alternating blowing concepts. Using alternating blowing with an acoustic liner to attenuate the broadband noise will allow us to maximize the noise reduction and minimize the required mass flow.  The amount of work produced by a single compression stage is limited by the amount of diffusion that can occur without large-scale flow separation. Viscous losses within the separated region not only result in an efficiency penalty but also create a large wake behind each of the rotor blades that interact with the downstream exit guide vanes and stators. Left untreated, fan exhaust noise from this interaction is the most dominant perceived noise at takeoff and landing. By using flow control to eliminate separation and the rotor wake, both efficiency gains and noise reduction can be achieved.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS) In reaction to the growing community noise problems that exist near many airports, FAR 36 Stage 3 noise requirements recently implemented will require that older low bypass ratio engines be retro fitted with hushkits or replaced with high bypass ratio engines. Beyond Stage 3 noise requirements, more stringent Stage 4 requirements will follow with an anticipated additional required reduction of 5-10 dB over Stage 3 levels. For high bypass ratio engines currently in use, fan noise dominates the total noise on approach and takeoff. Future ultra high bypass ratio turbofan engines will have an even greater fan tonal noise component at lower frequencies. The shorter inlet ducts relative to the size of the fan and the lower BPFs expected for these engines will make traditional passive liner technology less effective for attenuating the fan tones. Because of these difficulties, the proposed flow control system will be very attractive to industry looking for solutions to meet the increasingly strict noise regulations. If successful, the proposed technology will not only provide solutions for excessive fan noise but will also improve engine performance and reduce weight. Each of these benefits alone would make improved flow control methods a viable technology for industry.",,,02-Turbomachinery,Virginia Polytechnic Institute,"460 Turner Street, Suite 306, Blacksburg, VA , 24061 -0249",(540 ) 231 -5283

Accurate predictions of atomization/spray characteristics are vital to successful analyses of combustion systems for gas turbine, rocket, and internal combustion engines. In Phase I, a cutting-edge pressure-swirl atomization model, a plain jet atomization model, and a drop secondary breakup model were successfully developed, implemented, and validated in an unstructured and parallel CFD code environment. A preliminary spray/atomization module was transferred to NASA for implementation in the National Combustion Code (NCC). In addition, UWM successfully developed and validated a comprehensive supercritical drop vaporization model that will be fully implemented in Phase II. The Phase II work will focus on the development and validation of additional submodels including airblast atomization, turbulence-spray interaction, spray-wall interaction, deformed drop drag, and multicomponent spray. Each submodel will be developed in a highly modular fashion, and the atomization/spray module will be transferred to NASA for easy implementation into NCC.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS) An atomization/spray module for advanced CFD spray-combustion codes is essential for accurate combustion simulations. Such CFD codes can be used in designing and characterizing advanced gas turbines, rocket and diesel engines to improve the combustor performance, stability, durability, and pollutant emissions. Other examples of applications include characterizing nonreacting sprays for ignition calculations, spray cooling, spray painting, nozzle design for power plants, and any other application where liquid sprays are involved in industrial processes.

Nanostructured and microporous morphologies will be optimized to provide materials with high specific strength and low thermal conductivity required for multifunctional integrated thermal structures. Based on Phase I results, key research and development areas were identified for emphasis in Phase II.  These include; the improvement of material processing techniques to achieve complete densification and compaction, expansion of the experimental test database to high temperatures, measurement of thermal shock resistance, determination of oxidation resistance, further variation of material parameters to improve mechanical properties, incorporation of other types of reinforcements such as platelets, fibers and cloth, and finally detailed mathematical modeling. NASA mission requirements will be used to define typical applications for these engineered ceramics.  Prototypes will be built and tested.  The developed material database will be used to evaluate application in a variety of industries that utilize high temperature processes.  Industrial firms will be identified and contacted to establish appropriate business relationships for subsequent commercial production. Clear technical and business plans will be developed for Phase III, leading to a smooth transition to commercial production.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS) There are wide spread applications in industries requiring high temperature ceramic material for insulation, filters, mirrors and structure.

Racine Circle, Centennial, CO , 80111 -6427",(303 ) 790 -8499,Dr. Savio Chau,,,,,,,,,,,"TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS) The MIL-STD-1553B Bus is a widely supported data bus for avionics applications and compatible with most of the avionics equipment. However, its low data rate (1 Mbps) and command-response architecture are not suitable for many modern applications such as on-board autonomy.  Therefore, the avionics industry recently has been interested in adopting the IEEE 1394A Bus as the next generation avionics bus.  The IEEE 1394A Bus has a minimum bandwidth of 100 Mbps, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the 1553B Bus.   In addition, its sophisticated protocol and multi-master capability can support distributed processing in advanced applications. One major obstacle in adopting the IEEE 1394A Bus is its compatibility with heritage equipment that is mostly compatible only with the 1553B Bus.  It might take many years and large investments for the aerospace industry to convert all 1553B based equipment to the IEEE 1394A Bus. The objective of this task is to solidify the IEEE-1394A standard in spacecraft engineering by providing backward compatibility with MIL-STD-1553B.  This backward compatibility allows heterogeneous communications between the IEEE-1394A and MIL-STD-1553B buses, so that both heritage and modern components can share a common bus architecture.  Hence, this backward compatibility would shorten the time to acceptance of the IEEE 1394A Bus.  In Phase I of this STTR, the functional requirements of the bridge and formats of the embedded commands have been defined. A software testbed has also been successfully implemented to demonstrate the read and write commands. In Phase II, a single board level implementation of the bridge will be designed, built and evaluated. This will provide the basis for further integration and miniaturization in a potential Phase III.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS) Many future NASA flight projects and commercial spacecraft, are considering the IEEE 1394 Bus as their baseline.  These projects include the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), the Europa Orbiter, and the next generation weather satellite program NPOESS.  The science objectives of these missions require advanced application software such as on-board autonomy, real time hazard avoidance and precise landing.  These advanced application software demand processing capability beyond current flight-qualified processors (e.g. the Rad 750).  Therefore, distributed multiprocessor architectures have to be developed to support these applications.   In contrast, many instruments such as the inertial measure units (IMU) and the Small Deep Space Transponder (SDST) that are being considered by these missions, are compatible only with the MIL-STD-1553B bus. In the avionics industry, as the next generation unmanned aircraft are developed with more sophisticated processing, they will require a more advanced bus architecture, but they still use many heritage sensors.   With this bridge, much heritage equipment can be made compatible with the IEEE 1394 Bus without redesign.",,,04-Launch and Payload Processing Systems,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA , 91109 -8099",(818 ) 354 -8659

In Phase I, we developed a computerized graphical display for CPR procedures. Volunteers using the display removed an airway obstruction and stabilized the patient in 10.9 minutes compared to 13.8 minutes for those who used the current NASA paper protocol.  The number of errors was reduced by 42%.  These differences significantly increase the survival rates for the patient. The goal of Phase II is to develop and refine the BLSS with an animated graphical display of instructions so that an individual without medical training can effectively resuscitate a patient.  The BLSS will include an automatic external defibrillator, a CPR mask, and an oxygen supply. Sensors will provide feedback to inform the user of potential problems. The treatment protocol will automatically guide the user through the CPR algorithm and provide just-in-time training.  Phase II studies will assess whether novice responders benefit from using the BLSS and evaluate if novices using the system will be as effective at resuscitating a patient, as are responders with basic life support and AED training.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS) Applications for Axon?s CPR technology are in the rapidly growing first responder and public access market.  Axon?s display and CPR technology will be placed inside an automatic external defibrillator (AED) and will be marketed in conjunction with the AED.  The AED market in 2001 was $173 million dollars, with expected growth to $600 million in 2006 from the sale of over 300,000 units. The AED market is expected to grow rapidly because of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) endorsement of defibrillator placement in the workplace, the Community Access to Early Defibrillation Act funding for the purchase of defibrillators, and the enactment of the 1999 Cardiac Arrest Survival Act mandating placement of defibrillators in all Federal buildings. Phase II efforts are directed towards providing a Basic Life Support System to the crew medical officers who has received no more than 40 hours of medical training.  Based on our pilot study (i.e., Phase I), the treatment of a patient in a cardiac arrest would take too long to be successful following the current NASA protocol  because the text-based instructions are difficult to understand in high-stress situations.

The use of Adaptive Machine Learning (AML) techniques has proven that we can populate the SCL Rule-Based Expert System with monitor and control rules for a Space Shuttle Main Engine data stream.  This approach keeps the human in the loop but removes mundane tasks, and allows analysis in real-time, post-test, and post-flight.

In Phase II we will expand and refine this capability and add an advisory system coupled with a diagnostics engine.  This will greatly enhance the system as an operator aid and provide insight into the source of the anomaly and suggest corrective actions.  An expanded GUI capability for data signature analysis and real-time monitor and control is also planned.

Small crews have mission critical skills, but receive little training and practice in emergency medical response.  If a medical emergency were to occur, these crewmembers will have to handle the diagnosis and treatment under extremely stressful conditions.  NASA has recognized that the use of physiological simulation models can aid in protocol and procedure development for emergency medical response.  During PH 1, we showed that traditional medical treatment used on Earth may not always be transferable to a space environment.  A number of physiological changes take place in space flight and these changes may have important effects on response to treatment. During PH 2, we will model these changes in human physiology using the Emergency Care Simulator.  This will aid in both the teaching and learning of appropriate medical management of the most likely medical emergencies that may arise.

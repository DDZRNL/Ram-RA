The underlying technology builds on nanomaterial coatings and electro-optical modeling competency of the company. InnoSense LLC (ISL) will collaborate with Dr. Harold Kahn, Research Associate Professor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, to integrate the low-cost, flexible nanocomposite membrane mirror into a MEMS device. The Phase I project would demonstrate: (a) a membrane mirror capable of high broadband reflectivity; (b) deflections > 20-30 micron; and (c) large temporal bandwidth at frequency > 1 KHz. The focus of Phase II will be optimization of the reflecting membrane, refinements to the design of the deformable membrane mirror (DMM) device, accompanied by extensive evaluation of prototype DMMs for their ability to correct for large wavefront aberrations at high frequencies to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, and enable high fidelity imaging capability. To ensure success of this project, ISL has assembled a technical team with a cumulative 70 person-years of experience in nanomaterials coatings, MEMS, mechanical and electro-optical modeling.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) is one of NASA's planet-finding missions, whose primary goal is the direct imaging of an Earth-like planet orbiting near a star. Planets that that orbit stars other than our Sun are also known as ""exoplanets"" or ""extra solar planets"". The challenge to the direct detection of exoplanets lies in the huge contrast between the planet and the star it orbits. It is comparable to looking for a firefly next to a searchlight. To detect light from a faint source that is scattered and diffracted by atmospheric turbulence requires an extremely high resolution imaging system, with excellent performance in terms of both contrast and detector's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The issues associated with wavefront control sensing for space imaging are addressed by ISL's highly reflecting, flexible, nanocomposite membrane mirror integrated into a MEMS device.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The market sector for optical systems, components, information processing equipment such as telescopes, optical communication systems and displays is comparable to the high-end military and scientific sectors.

LEO is a relatively warm thermal environment and without careful thermal management, significant quantities of stored liquid cryogens can be lost due to boil-off. This requires that larger volumes of cryogenic fuels must be launched into orbit so that sufficient quantities are available to satisfy the mission propulsion requirements. It has been shown that active cooling using space cryocoolers has the potential to result in Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) of stored cryogens. The launch-mass savings using active cooling exceeds that of passive cooling of LOX for mission durations in LEO of less than 1 week. The savings advantage of active cooling for LH2 begins after about 2 months in LEO. The proposer is developing a Modified Collins Cryocooler that offers the potential for higher efficiency cooling with better system integration for ZBO storage than can be provided by Stirling or pulse-tube type cryocoolers.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In addition to application for ZBO of stored cryogenic propellants, sub-cooling to densify LOX and LH2 has the potential to reduce the gross launch weight of a vehicle by up to 20%.

To date however their use has been limited by the difficulty in fabricating complex shapes. Most current methods for manufacturing MMC's are limited to relatively simple shapes that often still require further machining. It is the machining of MMC's that is the biggest drawback to their application. Grinding or single point diamond turning are generally the methods of choice but in each case tool wear is excessive and surface damage is apparent. A very attractive alternative for rapid machining of MMC's is Laser Assisted Machining (LAM). LAM has been successfully applied to ceramics and some recent work has indicated that LAM can successfully machine MMC's with high material removal rates and no surface damage.

The approach will use wireless, passive SAW coded devices, building on previous orthogonal frequency coding, and also investigating different approaches, such as phononic structure coding and combinations of coding techniques. A second major objective is to investigate and propose a complete device-transceiver sensor system, such that a complete sensor system will be realized. This is crucial to the success of the fielding and commercializing the SAW sensor technology, since it enables the interrogation of the tags and will ultimately lead to a commercial, manufacturable sensor product.

The DWT system consists of a ground vibration test (GVT) hardware system and a real-time unsteady aerodynamic force generation software developed from an aerodynamic reduced order model (ROM). The ground flutter test using the DWT system operates on the real structural model, thereby no scale-down structural model is involved. Furthermore, the impact of the structural nonlinearities on the aeroelastic stability can be automatically included. Moreover, the aeroservoelastic characteristics of the aircraft can be easily measured by simply including the flight control system in the loop. In addition, the unsteady aerodynamics generated computationally is interference-free from the wind tunnel walls. Finally, the DWT can be conveniently and inexpensively carried out as a post GVT test with the same hardware. In Phase I, we will validate this DWT concept on a rectangular flat plate with a reference flutter solution. Through this validation process, the most significant hardware issues will be resolved to pave the way for a successful Phase II validation on a complex structure, such as a real aircraft.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The Dry Wind Tunnel testing concept would be particularly useful as a pre-flight testing effort to identify any aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instability that are not predicted by the analysis. For example, inherent structural nonlinearities such as friction and freeplay are notoriously difficult to model properly in linearized analyses but would be naturally present in the DWT testing as it is carried out on the actual structure. DWT testing would also be useful as a post-flight testing procedure to resolve discrepancies between the analysis and flight test results. The DWT test concept is applicable to a broad range of test structures, from components to wing to full aircraft, that are currently being tested by NASA.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The DWT system can be applicable to flutter envelope expansion and flying quality programs of military and civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft.

This novel phase shifter will incorporate MEMtronics' state-of-the-art microencapsulated, capacitive MEMS switches to control phase. The envisioned phase shifter behaves much like a switched-line phase shifter with broadband matched impedance, but without sacrificing size normally needed to accommodate multiple signal paths. Many MEMS-based phase shifters have been created with good results utilizing a loaded line approach. While this technique works well for smaller bits, larger bits suffer from narrow bandwidths and a poor impedance match in one or both states. Additionally, cascading multiple bits results in a relatively long multi-bit phase shifter. As insertion loss is dominated by conductor loss, these long multi-bit phase shifters become rather lossy reducing advantages that MEMS-based phase shifters may offer. This proposed project seeks to overcome these limitations by maximize phase shift per unit length, while increasing bandwidth, to arrive at a low-loss Ka-band phase shifter with significant performance and size improvements over currently available technologies.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Low-loss, low-power microwave and millimeter-wave switching devices are very important in the development of small, lightweight, low-power-consumption electronically steerable antennas.

This technology is applicable over a wide range of frequencies, from 2 GHz up to 100 GHz. Typical applications for these phase shifters are in phased array antennas for multi-platform data relays, micropower sensor pod communications, and high-rate satellite-satellite communications in support of sensor webs. Use in large aperture electronically steerable antennas benefits the development of deep-space communications and multi-spacecraft/ground data links.

Such datasets present new challenges in data analysis, especially for implementation in memory-constrained DECUs. Also, the traditional statistical methods break down partly because of the increase in the number of observations (measurements), but mostly due to an increase in the number of variables associated with each observation (""dimension of the data""). One of the problems with high-dimensional datasets is that not all the measured variables are ""important"" for understanding the underlying phenomena of interest. In addition to the computational cost, irrelevant features may also cause a reduction in the accuracy of some algorithms. The first key issue we propose to address is that of data reduction techniques for onboard implementation of data-driven classification techniques in memory-constrained onboard processing units. Some of the classification techniques we intend to use with the above data-reduction techniques include, support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), principal component Bayesian analysis (PCA). To improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of the above classifiers, we will apply classifier fusion techniques such as AdaBoost, Error correcting output codes, Voting to find which architecture will enhance the accuracy and under what conditions.

The excess photon energy is converted to heat. In addition, the quantum efficiencies of solar cells tend to degrade for high energy photons due to surface recombination effects. Optical down-conversion has been suggested as a method to recoup this lost energy, providing an increase in the theoretical single junction photovoltaic conversion efficiency from 30.9% to 39.6%. If substantial gains in PV efficiency could be achieved with a thin film coating of an efficient two photon downconverting layer, it would have a tremendous benefit not only to NASA payload burden, but also the the economics of terrestrial solar cells. However, the absence of materials with suitable time constants for the relevant electronic processes has hindered the realization of this method. Our proposed solution, being developed by the University of Arizona, is to use the unique optical properties of nanocrystals to produce efficient downconverting emitter materials.

A novel binning technique to track the wavelength shifts of the outgoing laser pulses on a per-shot basis before accumulation in the receiver electronics is described. This allows creation of a narrow histogram in the backscattered signal accumulation process while using less expensive, less stable lasers than are traditionally required. This technique relaxes the stringent stability requirements on the laser, and therefore its size, weight, complexity, and cost. We propose to demonstrate the technique in existing lidars more compact and suitable for airborne platforms in terms of size, weight and power requirements of the system. We utilize recent solid-state laser and high-speed signal processing technologies in the wavelength tracking system. The direct application of the wavelength corrector is in a direct detection Doppler wind lidar. This innovation will significantly reduce the cost of wind lidar systems permitting their installation at airports to look for dangerous wind shears as well as for weather forecasting.

The wavelength correction system is an enabling technology to reduce lidar system costs significantly by relaxing the laser stability requirements, thereby making a lidar system more amenable for large scale production and field deployment. It also provides a path to space-deployable systems by reducing laser complexity in terms of seeder stabilization systems and algorithms.

Sigma's lidar experience spans almost all types of lidar development to provide solutions such as the wavelength correction system. The most immediate application is the wind lidar.

GSE located near a major rocket launch can be exposed to damaging environments including heat, rocket plume impingement, vibration, and acoustics. This extreme vibratory environment results in the need for extensive check out and frequent repairs of GSE systems after each launch. Another consequence is the need for extensive design and qualification testing to ensure equipment survivability.Passive GSE vibration isolation systems often have natural resonances within the broad excitation spectrum, resulting in poor equipment protection. Additionally, passive isolation systems can only be tuned for one excitation type (amplitude / frequency) and one GSE rack arrangement. If the expected vibration spectrum changes, the passive isolation system is no longer optimized and requires redesign. Furthermore, if the inertial properties of the GSE rack itself changes (rack or drawer is replaced or rearranged), the passive isolation system will no longer function properly which may lead to catastrophic failure.To overcome these deficiencies, Techno-Sciences Inc, in collaboration with the University of Maryland, proposes to develop an innovative Adaptive Magnetorheological Isolator (AMI) system that will automatically adjust its energy absorbing capabilities to real-time environmental measurements as well as GSE rack properties. Such a system will utilize internal motion sensors coupled with an on-board microcontroller to provide automatic adaptation to the excitation as well as the inertial properties of the supported rack. In doing so, the system will eliminate damaging natural resonances and provide optimal vibration isolation at all times. Because of its adaptability and optimal vibration isolation capabilities, the AMI system will significantly reduce design and life-cycle costs and enhance equipment reliability.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Besides the protection of GSE during launch, the low-cost, retrofit capable AMI system is particularly attractive for a number of other NASA applications.

SAW devices are a platform technology for passive wireless sensing of numerous possible measurands. SAW devices have been demonstrated as passive wireless temperature sensors in NASA contracts NNK04OA28C and NNK05OB31C, and as hydrogen sensors and cryogenic liquid level sensors under contracts NNK06OM24C and NNK06OM23C. ASR&D is currently developing these sensors and systems further under NASA Phase II STTR contracts NNK07EA38C and NNK07EA39C. The proposed humidity sensors will use individually coded SAW device structures combined with hygroscopic film elements to produce rapid, sensitive humidity sensors capable of wireless operation over the full range of relative humidity (0% to 100%). The Phase I research will utilize the results obtained in ASR&D's coded SAW sensor and wireless interrogation system research, and external research on SAW-based and nanofilm based humidity sensing techniques. The team will evaluate hygroscopic films previously investigated and novel nanostructured films, along with sensor device simulation, to determine which films are most likely to produce devices with desirable characteristics. Issues including formation of chemically selective films on piezoelectric substrates, optimization of this film, and the effects of environmental factors on device performance will be investigated. Successful completion of the proposed Phase I activities will establish the technical feasibility of producing the proposed humidity sensors, evaluate their potential performance capabilities in a range of operational environments, and define the additional work necessary to effect device implementation. Assuming the results of Phase I are positive, Phase II could result in the development of multiple uniquely identifiable, wirelessly interrogable, humidity sensors.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The primary NASA application for the proposed sensors would be in a wireless multisensor system for humidity detection. With uniquely identifiable passive wireless sensors, a system could use low cost sensors mounted at numerous locations to remotely detect humidity leaks in real time. This system could be useful, for example, when used with NASA's ""Sensor Web"" to monitor humidity in air and soil in remote locations such as Antartica. The demonstrated ability of SAW sensor devices to survive extreme temperatures (including cryogenic cold), combined with the anticipated ability of the proposed sensing films to withstand wider temperature ranges than traditional polymer sensing films, make the applicability of these sensors to extreme environment sensing likely. The completely passive (i.e. no batteries) nature of the proposed sensors, combined with wireless operation, make them ideally suited to applications in space exploration and aircraft, where battery replacement is difficult or impossible. The rad-hard nature of SAW devices, combined with their ability to survive thermal extremes, makes space a natural application environment. Of course, the effects of such an environment on the chemicals sensitive films will need to be characterized further in order to gain a clear understanding of the limits of applicability for this technology.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Potential commercial and non-NASA applications for the proposed humidity sensors abound. Numerous humidity sensing applications currently exist, and generate sales of over 8 million humidity sensors per year worldwide, with annual revenues exceeding $600 Million. The proposed sensor s will have a competitive advantage for any applications where the use of wireless, completely passive sensors is advantageous. For example, commercial building product manufacturers may find it desirable to incorporate passive humidity sensors with essentially unlimited lifetimes into construction elements to be used in ""smart"" buildings, to monitor water vapor intrusion into walls, around doors and windows, and even into concrete structures. Such monitoring could allow building owners to recognize leaks early, preventing harmful growth of mold and further damage due to water. Humidity detection is important within concrete, both during curing (to ensure the concrete reaches intended design strength) and after cure to monitor water intrusion that might lead to structural failure (due to freezing) or corrosion of support structures. ASR&D is currently developing a wireless concrete maturity monitoring system using passive wireless SAW temperature sensors, that would benefit from humidity sensors. Given the antiquated state of much of the infrastructure in the U.S., such sensors may find wide application for structural monitoring of both aging and newly rebuilt bridges, roads, and tunnels.",Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety,,Temple University,"1601 N.

The phase change cooling as liquid N2O is flashed into a vapor is crucial to limiting to acceptable levels the erosion of both the nozzle throat and spike, thereby enabling reusable operation and/or long burn times. The N2O used for cooling the nozzle throat will be reintroduced into the combustion chamber, and the N2O used for cooling the spike will be used to provide base bleed, virtually eliminating any performance penalty associated with using a severely truncated, and therefore significantly lighter, spike. Because of its high vapor pressure, N2O can be self-pumping, thereby making it an ideal choice of oxidizer for simple, low-cost applications. As a simple, practical nozzle, the proposed innovation fits well with N2O-HTPB hybrid rocket designs, which tend toward simpler, less expensive design alternatives. Because of their high efficiency due to altitude compensation, aerospike nozzles could play an important role in bringing to fruition inexpensive access to low Earth orbit. In addition, these altitude compensating nozzles could provide significantly increased performance for a wide array of tactical missiles. Although a few rocket flights powered by liquid propellant rocket engines and two flights powered by solid propellant rocket motors have used aerospike nozzles in the last several years, the lack of a comprehensive flight test database has precluded the use of these nozzles in current as well as next-generation space vehicles. The simple, low-cost, reusable, oxidizer-cooled aerospike nozzle for operation on an N2O-HTPB hybrid rocket motor that is proposed herein is a device that will enable much-needed flight research of aerospike nozzles.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) At present no research other than our own is addressing thrust vectoring and throttling of the annular aerospike nozzle. Having a liquid oxidizer in a hybrid motor provides enhanced flexibility and safety compared to solid fuel propellants. The liquid oxidizer may be throttled back and forth, allowing for controlled thrust. In addition, according to our results, axial translation also can provide a measure of throttling. The two approaches, taken together, provide a means of continuous extreme throttling, allowing the possibility of in-flight shut-downs and restarts, thereby enhancing the flight envelope. In the near term, aerospike nozzles with optimal thrust vector control would provide added safety and improved capability to the NASA Dryden Aerospike Rocket Test project, as well as economic benefit through the reuse of nozzles. Thrust vectoring and throttling capabilities would provide control of flight regimes (speed, angle of incidence, transients, and other flight conditions). In addition, flights with thrust vector control would have less dispersion and therefore could be confined to a smaller test area, which would improve range safety.An aerospike nozzle with thrust vector control would be appropriate for future NASA single-stage-to-orbit programs.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The development of a cooled, truncated aerospike nozzle with an N2O-HTPB hybrid rocket motor will allow cost effective, reusable, and less expensive rocket designs. There are two major non-NASA customer groups for this technology: the U.S. military, and the numerous companies working to develop inexpensive low Earth orbit (LEO) launch vehicles. In addition to launching satellites into LEO, there has been increasing interest in developing space tourism in recent years. Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic have teamed up to develop SpaceShipTwo specifically to pursue the space tourism market.

The objective of this proposed research is to develop an analytical technique based on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) to measure simultaneously the concentrations of nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar) and oxygen (O2) contaminants in hydrogen (H2) gas storage tanks and supply lines. Advanced sensors for monitoring multiple species in H2 feed-lines and storage tanks will be useful before engine testing and will increase understanding of engine performance. Phase I will provide necessary information to build an improved prototype in Phase II, with better sensitivity and ease of implementation at NASA/SSC. In Phase II, a prototype LIBS system will be developed to measure impurities in H2 fuel at different places in the H2 feed line. This system will be delivered to NASA/SSC at the end of Phase II.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) A LIBS-based sensor can provide on-line, real-time and simultaneous measurement of the concentrations of several species in H2 tanks and feed lines at many locations in the testing facilities at NASA/SSC. This sensor can be used for non intrusive and near real-time monitoring of the quality of H2 before and during engine tests. This sensor will be useful to test H2 impurity levels and will be less expensive than current analysis methods. The impurity level data can be used with other measurements for evaluating the engine performance.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed LIBS sensor can also be used to monitor gas compositions in manufacturing plants to provide data for control and optimization. For example, when the concentration of an impurity, (which will vary depending on the application), reaches a threshold value, the sensor could warn the plant operator. The LIBS sensor can be used for quality control in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food processing industries. The technology can also be modified for other applications, such as a Continuous Emission Monitor (CEM) for hazardous emissions and in other pharmaceutical and chemical processes.",Feed System Components; Optical,,Mississippi State University,"205 Research Blvd, Starkville, MS 39759 - 7704",(662) 325-7375

Such systems will need to serve as precursors to human missions, collaborate with humans on-site, and carry on when humans have departed. This proposal concerns a control suite and teleoperator interface for whole-body mobile manipulators (WBMMs). WBMMs are a class of redundant, mobile, multi-limbed platforms able to use their entire bodies for manipulation tasks. Such platforms are extremely versatile and can address NASA's need for platforms that perform useful work on the surface of the Moon or Mars. To exploit WBMM, a control framework capable of exploiting redundancy and new man-machine interfaces are required. digitROBOTICS and the Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics at UMass propose to build a WBMM control suite and teleoperator interface to address these challenges. We propose to use control basis framework developed at UMass over the past two decades and used to advance the state-of-the-art in many robotic task domains including grasping and manipulation. The WBMM control suite will simplify controller design and allows control knowledge to be easily ported between robots and operating contexts. The WBMM teleoperator interface will allow for varying levels of autonomy, and can preserve safety constraints using control mechanisms from the WBMM control suite.  The anticipated result of the Phase 1 effort is preliminary software for controlling WBMMs as described above at TRL 4, and a proof of concept teleoperator interface at TRL 3. The anticipated result of a Phase 2 effort would be a commercial-grade version of both the control suite and teleoperator interface, and to have the control suite and teleoperator interface running on one of NASA's WBMMs (ATHLETE or Robonaut, for example). The results of the Phase 2 effort are estimated to be at TRL 5-6.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed software tools can be used to build control software for whole-body mobile manipulators (WBMMs) for planetary exploration, including such tasks as deploying equipment, sample gathering, habitat placement, site construction, deploying cables/conduit, connecting umbilicals, moving regolith, pad construction, and robotic helpers/followers. These software tools can provide existing NASA robotic platforms such as ATHLETE (Ames Research Center) and Robonaut (Johnson Space Center) with: an easy to use environment for programming manipulation tasks, safe and effective teleoperation in the presence of large time delays, the ability to repurpose hardware resources in response to unexpected contingencies, and the ability to transfer control knowledge between robots and operating contexts. These are crucial features for programming robots in the context of space exploration since they will allow a relatively small number of versatile but complex systems to perform a wide variety of tasks without the need for low-level teleoperation.The control schema used by the proposed software is portable across different robotic platforms. digitROBOTICS LLC plans to sell an economical WBMM bundled with the proposed software tools. The availability of this package could significantly reduce the cost and time required for an independent research laboratory to start producing control code that could be ported to NASA robotic hardware.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed software tools can be used to build control software for whole-body mobile manipulators for use in healthcare (as assistive devices for in-home or institutional use), in the military (reconnaissance, surveillance, refueling, carrying ordnance, probing environments, sampling soil), logistics/supply chain (loading/unloading at warehouses), and research on WBMMs. digitROBOTICS LLC plans to develop and sell an economical whole-body mobile manipulator (the uBot-5) bundled with a version of the control suite described in this proposal. We believe this will be a very attractive product for researchers working in the field of mobile manipulation and that the availability of such an economical hardware/software combination could potentially increase the rate of progress in the field of mobile manipulation. The software tools described in this proposal could also be sold as a stand-alone product for use on 3rd party robotic platforms. Additionally, since the control schema created by the proposed software tools are portable across different platforms, this hardware/software product would provide an easy way for independent researchers to develop controllers for extremely expensive and/or commercially unavailable robotic platforms used by NASA, other government agencies, or private companies.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Highly-Reconfigurable; Human-Computer Interfaces; Human-Robotic Interfaces; Intelligence; Manipulation; Mobility; Perception/Sensing; Software Development Environments; Teleoperation,,"The University of Massachusetts, Amherst","c/o OGCA, Research Admin.

Out-of-autoclave thermoplastic processing significantly lowers composite aerospace part costs, but the property gap must be closed. This STTR program, endorsed herein by Boeing and Cytec Engineered Materials, will remedy the mechanical property shortfall and enable large composite aerospace structure important to NASA to be manufactured without an autoclave. Accudyne is teaming with University of Delaware  Center for Composite Materials to apply their state-of-the-art TP-ATP process/property models to elucidate the physical mechanisms affecting microstructural quality that cause the property gap. Models will be applied to the NASA LaRC TP-ATP deposition head to optimize the head configuration and machine operating parameters, and the control systems for full mechanical properties. Laminates will be manufactured to demonstrate the property improvements. The process, head, and equipment changes will be upgraded on the NASA-LaRC thermoplastic tape head. In Phase 2, process/head modeling will be extended through laminate fabrication and testing, and a component of interest to NASA will be fabricated demonstrating the improved ""autoclave level"" mechanical performance.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) A proven out-of-autoclave thermoplastic ATP process would yield noteworthy benefits. NASA can commission higher speed/altitude atmospheric research aircraft with wing and fuselage skins manufactured from 350oF/50,000 hour thermoplastic polyimides. Other NASA vehicles incorporating large composite structure, like the Ares V Heavy Lift and Ares I Crew Launch vehicles, and the Crew Exploration Vehicle could be made at lower cost and weight by virtue of parts consolidation, eliminating the cost and weight of joints, since there is no autoclave. Lower weight translates to higher payloads and lower launch costs. NASA-LaRC Materials Branch could more effectively develop higher use temperature thermoplastic composite materials by demonstrating them using their in-house out-of-autoclave TP-ATP process. Finally, NASA-MSFS could promote thermoplastic composite in situ processing at space-structure fabricators for lighter weight/lower cost solid rocket motors, liquid rocket engines, and space vehicles, and at airframers for lower cost wing and fuselage skins with better thermal performance.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Machine builders like Cincinnati Machine could develop and offer for sale a new class of thermoplastic tape layers and fiber placement machines to US aerospace primes. Material suppliers like Cytec Engineered Materials could develop and offer for sale a new class of placement-grade thermoplastic tape and tow material systems to US aerospace primes. OEMs and the US aerospace industry, generally, can adopt thermoplastic ATP/AFP to 1) eliminate the capital and operating cost of autoclaves and significantly lower the cost to fabricate large composite parts of interest to NASA and, in general, for US competitiveness, 2) lower weight of aerospace structure since larger parts can be fabricated out-of-the-autoclave, 3) enjoy mechanical properties in the composite equal or superior to those generated from today's autoclave process, and 4) benefit from additional thermoplastic resin characteristics, for example, high temperature performance, elevated toughness, superior solvent resistance, and environmental durability.",Airframe; Composites,,University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials,"201 Composite Manufacturing Science Lab, Newark, DE 19716 - 3144",(302) 831-8149

They will be expected to prepare the lunar surface for human habitation as well as conduct scientific investigations. As humans arrive, first for short-term stays, the robots should be able to shift to providing direct assistance to human exploration activities. Such tasks require a new generation of robotic vehicles  a generation that has flexible, dexterous manipulation that can be scaled to include teams of machines. Since it will be impossible to tightly script complex operations ahead of time, it will be essential for planetary robots to be effective in unmodeled environments and unanticipated situations. Our proposal addresses four fundamental areas in mobile manipulation: 1) Motion Planning for Cooperative Mechanisms; 2) Task Sequencing & Monitoring; 3) Coordinated Control of Redundant Mechanisms; and 4) Human Robot Interface. Together, these innovations will create robots that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks to support NASA's exploration missions. We will demonstrate our approach using scenarios that involve several mobile robots with dexterous manipulators moving and assembling structures on the lunar surface and being supervised by remote operators.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA's envisioned exploration missions rely heavily on robotic precursors and on robotic assistance to astronauts.

In addition to the long-term benefits to NASA of this technology, there will also be some short-term benefits to NASA's research program  the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP). Two areas of ETDP will be immediate beneficiaries of this technology. First, the Centaur robot at NASA JSC is already a mobile manipulator and can benefit directly from the technology developed in this proposal.

Ablative thrust chambers have an extensive heritage and are the low cost approach to fabricating rocket thrust chambers. However, composite ablative chambers suffer from erosion that typically limitsperformance of the engine in terms of burn time and efficiency/performance of the combustion. In the last decade, there hasbeen significant interest in utilizing fiber-reinforced ceramic composites such as carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composites. Such composites have demonstrated a low erosion rate in bi-propellant liquid rocket thrust chambers at temperatures approaching 4000F. However insertion of these materials have been limited by complexities associated with required system redesign to accommodate a radiatively-cooled chamber, attachment methods, and addressing chamberpermeability issues. By incorporating a ceramic composite liner within an ablative thrust chamber in critical areas that are subjected to the highest temperatures, a low erosion, high performance chamber is obtained that eliminates costs and complexities that have limited the insertion of ceramic composite thrust chambers. The Phase I effort will produce a ceramic composite lined ablative thrust chamber, identify the degree of film cooling required and conduct a static hot fire test evaluationof the material to demonstrate the perfromance benefit of a CMC liner within an ablative thrust chamber.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) A number of launch systems under consideration for use by NASA can benefit from the improved performance of a low cost ablative thrust chamber obtained by incorporating a CMC liner.

The improved performance of these chambers is most suited for upper stage propulsion chambers. Other applications of interest to NASA would include lowering the cost per kilogram launch costsfor satellites and space exploration vehicles.

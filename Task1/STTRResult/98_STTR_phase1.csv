Utilization of nuclear engines will result in much shorter trip times and much smaller and cheaper launch vehicles that contribute to dramatic reductions in mission costs. A new ultra-compact nuclear engine concept, MITEE (MIniature reacTor EnginE), is described, and its performance evaluated for various solar system exploration missions. The MITEE concept will serve as a temporary bridge to the development of very advanced and much higher Isp rockets based on nuclear fusion/antimatter which will be required for the exploration and colonization of the solar system.

In a novel concept, low cost, robust outposts can be established with indigenous resources processed to manufacture breathable air, food and stockpile propellants, fuel, and construction materials.

One method that has been used to monitor for rocket engine wear is atomic emission in the UV-visible region from metal species in the plume. An alternative method that offers the promise of increased sensitivity and spatial resolution is laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. This method uses atomic emission from a micro-plasma formed at the focus of a high peak power laser. It uses gated-detection with a fixed delay after the laser pulse. This has the advantage of discriminating against background emission in the plume. Also the laser micro-plasma has a higher temperature than the plume, which increases atomic emission strength. During Phase I a LIBS system will be developed and demonstrated on several hydrocarbon-fuel flames and test stands. It will be optimized for sensitivity. Its capabilities, including detection limits and spatial resolution, will be characterized and reported. At the end of Phase II a working prototype will be completed and fully tested.",,"In addition to being a monitor for rocket engine wear, the LIBS system can be used to monitor automobile engines for metal species in the exhaust.

Of all fusion reactor embodiments, only the magnetically confined plasma in the Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) has the ideal linear geometry, the low confining field and high plasma pressure required for the direct conversion of fusion energy into high specific impulse and thrust. The FRC has demonstrated in experiments the scaling with size and density required for fusion ignition. Due to the high plasma pressure and compactness of the magnetic configuration, there has been no easy way to extrapolate the FRC into the reactor regime. Based on experiment, a simple way has been determined by which the FRC can be readily brought to ignition conditions.

(PSI), in collaboration with the Y-Division (Laser Division) of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), proposes to develop space-qualified optical components that are building blocks of the Optical Waveguide (OW) solar plant lighting system. In the OW system, solar radiation is collected by the concentrator which transfers the concentrated solar radiation to the OW transmission line consisting of low-loss optical fibers. The OW line transmits the plant lighting spectra (< 700 nm) to the plant growth chamber where the solar radiation from the optical fibers is de-focused for optimum intensity for plant growing. The non-plant growing spectra (> 700 nm) is utilized for generating electric power which will provide plant lighting when solar radiation is not available. PSI has been developing the OW technology in the past few years. Technologies resident at LLNL that are pertinent to the proposed research program include: optics and material technologies for laser power transmission; large diameter optical fiber technologies for continuous wave (CW) power transmission; thermal effects on materials and structure; vacuum technology; and space environment effects.

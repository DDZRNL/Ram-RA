Inspired by the complexity of the flight surfaces on the wings and tail of a bird, it is argued that increasing the number of interdependent flight surfaces from just a few, as is normal in an airplane, to many, as in the feathers of a bird, can significantly enlarge the flight envelope. To enable elements of an eco-inspired Dynamic Servo-Elastic (DSE) flight control system, IFOS proposes a multiple functionality-sensing element analogous to a feather, consisting of a very thin (gauge 18 or 20) tube with strain sensors and algorithms for deducing the shape of the ""feather"" by measuring strain at multiple points. It is envisaged that the ""feather"" will act as a unit of sensing and/or actuation for establishing shape, position, static and dynamic loads on flight surfaces and in critical parts. IFOS proposes to develop advanced sensing hardware and software control algorithms to demonstrate the proposed DSE flight control concept. The hardware development involves an array of optical fiber based sensorized needle tubes for attachment to key parts for dynamic flight surface measurement.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The flight surface sensing system proposed herein will extend flight research competencies at NASA by advancing innovative DSE concepts to extend the capabilities of future flight vehicles. The advanced hardware and algorithms for sensing and actuation to be developed will result in superior performance under extreme conditions from disturbances in an extended flight envelope. Importantly, these improved multi-surface DSE concepts should make all types of flight vehicles, from small single-prop airplanes to high performance, high-speed aircraft, more stable and more easily controllable, contributing still further to the safety of air flight.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Multiple commercial applications exist for the novel flight surface control system proposed here in the areas of near-space travel, air and sea defense, commercial travel and, farther afield, in motion and process control systems as used in a number of industries, including the energy sector, chemicals, manufacturing and robotics.",Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Optical,,New Mexico Tech,"801 Leroy Place, Socorro, NM 87801 - 4681",(575) 835-5606,"Dynamic Servoelastic (DSE) Network Control, Modeling, and Optimization is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed FSW machine is innovative because it can be deployed by 2 people and be used to weld complex surfaces that extend beyond linear welding applications. The in-space FSW machine is a 3 axis system that can be mounted to work pieces of varying geometry, position, and orientation through the use of a high performance vacuum system or mechanical clamps. The key enabler of the proposed FSW machine is a self adjusting and self aligning FSW (SAA-FSW) tool that eliminates the need for automated actuators. In addition, a collection of force reduction techniques will be included as part of the system. When combined together, it is theorized that the effect will be significant and will lead to the advancement of FSW by reducing structural rigidity requirements of FSW machines.Our work plan begins by determining the net effect of the combined force reduction techniques. Substantial effort is given to the development of a preliminary SAA-FSW tool which includes experimental welding. Lastly, a preliminary set of engineering plans will be delivered based upon the results from the development of the SAA-FSW tool and force reduction techniques.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The successful development of a 2 person portable FSW machine will enable in-space applications of FSW. This includes the joining and assembling of panels as well as in-situ repair operations needed for prolong and deep space missions beyond low Earth orbit. By no longer preassembling the structures, greater payload densities could be achieved, which would reduce the overall costs. The welding and assembly would then be done at the point of use via the in-space FSW machine.In addition, the SAA-FSW tool technology can be used to replace or substitute the actuating mechanisms used with NASA's self-reacting FSW tool technology. With the SAA-FSW tool, automatic actuation and control systems are eliminated.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and other aerospace companies have FSW applications very similar to NASA that would benefit from this portable system. These companies would increase the efficiency of welding operations by having a portable FSW machine to supplement existing immobile machines. Perhaps the most potential for a portable FSW machine lies with small businesses that will be poised to enter the FSW industry within the next couple of years as the major FSW patents expire. Entry into the FSW industry requires a rather significant investment to obtain the large machines. With a small portable FSW machine, entry will be much easier for these companies.","In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",,Vanderbilt University,"2301 Vanderbilt Place, PMB407749, Nashville, TN 37240 - 7749",(615) 322-2631,Materials and Manufacturing Technologiesis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

High performance IR detectors with cutoff wavelengths in the range of 2.5  5.0 microns will be developed using InGaAs / AlAsSb semiconductor materials. The proposal uses a two-pronged approach to address the problem of detector performance degradation by materials' defects, both ""grown in"" defects and defects caused by radiation damage. The project will apply an advanced device architecture, the nBn detector, which has been shown to be extremely successful in other IR detectors for suppression of defect-related dark current and noise. Additionally, the project will apply our proprietary defect mitigation technology, which passivates defects via UV hydrogenation treatments. The result of this program will be near-to-mid IR detectors with higher performance, reduced cooling requirements, and improved radiation hardness. These detectors are compatible with integration into mega-pixel IR imaging arrays for imaging 2.5  5.0 micron wavelengths with improved performance and reduced cost, which will be produced in Phase II.Amethyst has teamed with the University of Oklahoma and FLIR Systems to ensure that this technology can be readily transitioned to meet NASA mission requirements.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed InGaAs nBn detectors can be employed in NASA IR imaging applications at 2.5  5.0 micron wavelengths, such as the following programs:Landsat's Thermal IR Sensor (TIRS) http://ldcm.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html: Currently TIRS is employing Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIPs) for detection in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR) region. These detectors operate at 43K. With significant reduction in the defect densities in Ga-free SLS as well as integrated in an nBn architecture to reduce factors contributing to the dark current such as surface leakage, Shockley Read Hall, the proposed structure will operate relatively at higher operating temperatures (>100K). Although the cut-off wavelength for the proposed structure is in the MWIR, the program will be expanded to cover 5-14 microns in Phase II.Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) http://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/index.php: According to the Extend Pre-Phase A, one of CLARREO's goals is to test and evaluate IR instrument ranging between 5-50 microns, which can provide a test-bed platform for high performance detector technologies such as the propose Ga-free SLS nBn detectors.Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), a joint NASA and ESA project under Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) http://opfm.jpl.nasa.gov/library: JEO concept includes a visible-IR spectrometer between 400-5200nm wavelength with HgCdTe arrays, which may require cooling to as low as 80K for reliable operation.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) As the technology further matures the operability and yield gains will translate to significant reductions in cost and improved manufacturability of infrared imaging systems. The InGaAs nBn sensors will have reduced cooling requirements over other high performance infrared materials (such as HgCdTe and QWIPs) and, thus require fewer and lighter components for both military and commercial systems. The significant cost reduction associated with the InGaAs nBn based technology will generate new markets, currently inaccessible due to high price points, such as medical imaging, robotics, environmental and policing. Due to the nature of the Amethyst/FLIR partnership we fully anticipate that our rollout customer will be FLIR. However, to maximize the value of this program and Amethyst's intellectual property, Amethyst does not intend to grant an exclusive license to a single manufacturer. Amethyst has filed a number of patents relating to its photon-assisted and high pressure hydrogenation processes which will provide the basis for licensing negotiations with its customers.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Infrared; Long; Manufacturing Methods; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Nanomaterials; Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Telescope Arrays; Thermal; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation)",,University of Oklahoma,"440 West Brooks St., Norman, OK 73019 - 0225",(405) 325-3961,Technologies for Planetary Compositional Analysis and Mappingis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Our design is based on proprietary ""folded optics"" technology previously developed by our partner for use in military and commercial optical applications that require a compact footprint and high performance. The folded optics design is superior to conventional refractive optics in miniature star trackers because (1) the compact footprint is achieved without sacrificing accuracy; (2) the light-gathering aperture is much greater, leading to better sensitivity; (3) the aperture geometry makes the shielding baffles smaller; and (4) the imaging sensor can be shielded efficiently from cosmic radiation.During the Phase I project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our innovation by finalizing the design, performing analysis to determine the optimal design parameters, and testing a benchtop prototype to verify the design models. In Phase II, we will fabricate the optimized design, test the prototype in the laboratory and in the field, and deliver the prototype to NASA.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Many NASA science missions are exploring the use of pico- and nano-satellites as alternatives to expensive, large satellites.

The system is a refinement of existing spaceborne receiver technology built around a new, innovative collective detection and direct positioning algorithm developed by Dr. Penny Axelrad, a reduced set of GPS hardware, and a compact orbit propagator. The small satellite collective orbit determination receiver (SCOR) brings together efficient reference orbit representations, snapshot GPS sampling, collective detection and direct positioning, and modular orbit propagation methods, to produce an effective new approach for onboard support of small satellites. Since the collective detection algorithm does not require continuous GPS tracking to generate navigation solutions, portions of the receiver can be duty cycled to reduce power consumption between measurements. Additionally, this approach allows for satellites without pointing capabilities to obtain sufficient measurements to generate solutions by taking multiple snapshots when the spacecraft attitude is in a favorable orientation with respect to the GPS constellation.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA is currently fueling the development of cutting edge technology demonstrations, each being a potential candidate for our innovative solution. The current small satellite missions FASTSAT and Nanosail-D are missions which would have been ideal platforms for the receiver. In February of 2012 NASA issued a call for proposals under the Edison Small Satellite demonstration program. The SCOR is ideally suited for the size and power requirements of small satellites. A secondary application for this technology can be part of a Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) system for GPS receivers on larger, mission critical satellites. The state solutions generated by the collective detection receiver could be compared with the solutions from the traditional on-board GPS receiver to ensure the estimated states are correct.

Currently employed predictive capabilities to model the complex turbulent plume physics are too dissipative to accurately resolve the propagation of acoustic waves throughout the launch environment. Higher fidelity liftoff acoustic analysis tools to design mitigation measures such as deluge water and launch pad geometry are critically needed to optimize launch pads for SLS and commercial launch vehicles. This STTR project will deliver breakthrough technologies to drastically improve predictive capabilities for launch vehicle lift-off acoustic environments. Hybrid RANS/LES modeling presently established in NASA production flow solvers will be used for simulation of the acoustic generation physics, and a high-order accurate unstructured discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver developed in the same production framework will be employed to accurately propagate acoustic waves across large distances. An innovative hybrid CFD-CAA method will be developed in which the launch-induced acoustic field predicted from hybrid RANS/LES will be transmitted to a DG solver and propagated using high-order accurate schemes ideal for acoustic propagation modeling. This new paradigm enables: (1) Improved fidelity over linear methods for modeling nonlinear launch-induced acoustics; (2) Greatly reduced numerical dissipation and dispersion; and (3) Improved acoustics modeling for attenuation, reflection, and diffraction from complex geometry. The merits of the proposed approach will be investigated and demonstrated in Phase I for benchmark CAA applications and plume impingement problems. In Phase II, the methodology will be refined and validated against realistic targeted applications.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This hybrid CFD/CAA tool will uniquely fill the technology gap at NASA centers in defining lift-off environments for ongoing and new launch vehicle designs, and for the analysis of noise suppression techniques.

The tool will also be invaluable to payload system and instrument developers, particularly for one-of-a-kind and experimental optics and telescope systems that are susceptible to acoustic effects during liftoff.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed innovation offers significant advantages over aeroacoustic prediction tools currently available in industry.

As a result, the disk section is desired to operate in increasingly higher temperatures, which will subject it to additional degradation mechanisms of oxidation and hot corrosion. One approach to enhance the temperature capability of these systems is through the incorporation of environmental protective coatings which can provide resistance from oxidation and hot corrosion. Research is proposed here to optimize the use of advanced coating manufacturing techniques designed to enable the affordable application of environmental protective coatings having enhanced resistance to hot corrosion and oxidation to allow operation at the desired high temperature engine environments. Advanced testing conditions will be used to simulate real world conditions and demonstrate the performance of the deposited coatings in these conditions. This approach is envisioned to aid the development of advanced coatings required to protect the surface of turbine disk components at higher temperatures desired for fuel and thrust operationally improvement without inducing significant fatigue debit.

In view of the lessons learned from mishaps, i.e., failed space missions, it is imminent that reliability analysis and risk assessment are kept in sync with space system design as it evolves from the concept through preliminary design, detailed design, production, and operations. Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) in collaboration with Dr. John Sheppard from Montana State University (MSU) proposes a real-time health and risk assessment solution. The proposed efforts through this project in developing real-time computer-based environment for diagnosis, risk assessment, and visualization of system status will provide: (1) an environment for thorough and collaborative analysis and evaluation of a system design before the system is built and commissioned, (2) real-time diagnosis to identify Good, Bad, Unknown, Suspect, Degraded and Suspected Degraded of subsystems/components, (3) state of redundancies in real-time in case of single/multiple faults, (4) degradation status/criticality/time-to-failure, (5) risk identification of software and loss of mission/vehicle/life, (6) recommendation of a safer state to go to, and (7) visualization of risk (rank-ordered missions, probability of mission success, schedule and cost), mission criticality, and diagnostic coverage.

The current proposal leverages a substantial body of scientific and experimental knowledge derived from the Tactical Seeability System developed by Sentix' staff and BYU researchers to provide fully automated, optimal optical sensing over rugged 3D terrain. Discriminating features of our target capability include the following: 1.) A modular, sensor and platform agnostic framework for preflight and inflight modeling and optimization of performance in data acquisition missions, 2.) Mission impact modeling relating sensor payload configuration (states) to ""sensing value"" for the mission. 3.) An optimizer for the configuration of the aircraft and payload. 4.)

It is important to note that integration of sensing intelligence into payload systems will yield implications well beyond terrestrial / earth-bound applications. Space robotics used for exploration of other worlds will present the same, if not significantly greater, challenges with regards to C2 and data links.

The advancement from single junction silicon cells to current, state-of-the-art, triple junction, germanium cells enabled greater mission power per weight, stowed volume and deployed area. Near-term, advanced solar cell technologies will range from 4 to 6 junctions, and include a variety of band gaps.Solar cell testing is critical to space missions. Every solar cell is tested at the cell level under continuous light and at the panel, wing and sometimes spacecraft level multiple times under LAPSS. Current test methods calibrate the light source by measuring the current output of each junction and adjusting the source accordingly. Today's sources are a combination of lamps and filters. As cells with more the 3 junctions come into test, more flexible sources of narrower bands will be needed and current methods will have extreme difficulty, complexity and expense trying to keep up with the variety of near-term advanced solar cell designs.We propose a solid state illumination source with enough discrete source wavelengths to be flexible enough to be calibrated to any number of junctions, up to 6, for continuous cell testing. In addition, this source would be cost effective enough to allow many sources connected together to perform large area testing, pulsed or continuous, for panel and wing level testing. Calibration would follow similar methods to the current practice, but would be simplified through a software interface.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This program will benefit all NASA missions that will use solar cells with more than 3 junctions.

Extended development times and radiation tolerance requirements leave hardware performance a decade or more behind the terrestrial state-of-the-art at the time of deployment.

At the same time, topside pressure from application advancements is forcing space-based platforms to improve throughput and latency while reducing power consumption. A popular approach to addressing the tension between these requirements is the heterogeneous processing architecture. By providing multiple hardware tools that optimally support a subset of the anticipated workload, a heterogeneous architecture can offer performance and power solutions to the application developer. However, programming these systems is extremely challenging due to variations in toolsets and data sharing interfaces. As a result, data sharing and dynamic workload scheduling across heterogeneous architectures are often suboptimal and hindered by poor scalability.

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solves these dual problems at once. SLAM does not depend on any kind of infrastructure and is thus a promising localization technology for NASA planetary missions and for many terrestrial applications as well.However, state-of-the-art SLAM depends on easily-recognizable landmarks in the robot's environment, which are lacking in barren planetary surfaces. Our work will develop a technology we call MeshSLAM, which constructs robust landmarks from associations of weak features extracted from terrain. Our test results will also show that MeshSLAM applies to all environments in which NASA's rovers could someday operate: dunes, rocky plains, overhangs, cliff faces, and underground structures such as lava tubes.Another limitation of SLAM for planetary missions is its significant data-association problems. As a robot travels it must infer its motion from the sensor data it collects, which invariably suffers from drift due to random error. To correct drift, SLAM recognize when the robot has returned to a previously-visited place, which requires searching over a great deal of previously-sensed data. Computation on such a large amount of memory may be infeasible on space-relevant hardware. MeshSLAM eases these requirements. It employs topology-based map segmentation, which limits the scope of a search. Furthermore, a faster, multi-resolution search is performed over the topological graph of observations.Mesh Robotics LLC and Carnegie Mellon University have formed a partnership to commercially develop MeshSLAM. MeshSLAM technology will be available via open source, to ease its adoption by NASA. In Phase 1 of our project we will show the feasibility of MeshSLAM for NASA and commercial applications through a series of focused technical demonstrations.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) For the foreseeable future, robots operating beyond Earth will have to rely on triangulating rover position on a map or tracking the sun or stars. These approaches have shortcomings including limited resolution of orbital data and required interaction with ground control. SLAM is a promising means of infrastructure-free localization using local information; but unfortunately, most state-of-the-art SLAM implementations are not yet suitable for planetary exploration. Their implementations depend upon easily-recognizable landmarks that planetary environments lack. SLAM's computational complexity grows quickly with map size making it difficult to maintain kilometer-scale maps, especially on space-relevant computing hardware. MeshSLAM is significant to NASA because it provides planetary-relevant rover localization and mapping without orbital information, ground communication, or excessive computation. Furthermore in barren terrain its results will be more accurate than current methods.The partnership between Carnegie Mellon and Mesh Robotics is committed to developing and maintaining MeshSLAM following an open-source philosophy. Our aim is to leverage our years of experience working with NASA research groups to mature and prepare MeshSLAM for missions of the future. MeshSLAM will add value to long-duration missions involving repeated travel, such as manned-mission pre-cursors, site preparation, and long-range mapping.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Even on Earth, accurate localization remains a challenge in frequent situations where GPS is unavailable, either temporarily (e.g., passing under bridges or operating near buildings) or permanently (e.g., indoors and underground, or when GPS is jammed). As a result, the mining, agriculture, defense, and automotive industries are investing heavily in localization technologies. Companies (e.g., Applanix, NovAtel) have seen healthy growth in the past decade by providing off-the-shelf inertial navigation systems (INSs) that fuse GPS readings with data from inertial measurement units. Unfortunately, the underlying drift of even high-quality inertial measurements is severe and thus, localization estimates diverge dramatically within minutes of a loss of GPS.MeshSLAM can complement these existing techniques and improve their accuracy in GPS-denied situations. In unmanned-vehicle applications, MeshSLAM uses data from sensors already integrated for perception, so no new equipment is required. Furthermore, MeshSLAM's efficiency makes it suitable for running on highly-integrated embedded platforms.",Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Intelligence; Perception/Vision; Ranging/Tracking; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),,Carnegie Mellon University,"5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 - 3815",(412) 268-5421,Information Technologies for Intelligent and Adaptive Space Roboticsis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This process occurs in a combination of ""extreme environments"" that combine low gravity, little or no atmosphere, with rocket exhaust gas flow that is supersonic and partially rarefied, and unusual geological and mechanical properties of highly irregular soil regolith. CFDRC and the University of Florida have previously developed unique plume driven erosion simulation software for such environments by combining novel granular physics simulation modules developed by UF with the Unified Flow Solver (UFS) plume flow simulation software developed by CFDRC. Granular flow constitutive models, formulated through first-principle 3-D Discrete Element Method particle kinetics simulations, were implemented for efficient Eulerian gas-granular flow CFD modeling in the UFS simulation framework. Resultant simulations realistically capture the granular flow characteristics of particle erosion and cratering scenarios. The goal of this project is to dramatically advance the fidelity of these simulations towards simulating actual extra-terrestrial soil compositions with broad shape and size variations. This will be achieved through applying recent, novel particle kinetics modeling concepts to formulate granular flow physics models for both, realistic irregular particle shapes and realistically dispersed particle size distributions. The proposed technology development will result in unprecedented computer modeling capability for predicting liberation and flow of realistic granular material compositions in extreme extra-terrestrial environments.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The debris simulation tool will offer a powerful simulation capability of first order importance to the Space Exploration Program for robotic and human mission architecture definition to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations.

Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine operating temperature relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials.MR&D is proposing to perform a combined analytical, fabrication and experimental program to achieve the program objectives of developing innovative approaches to improving foreign object damage (FOD) resistance of CMC materials, specifically with Hyper-Therm High Temperature Ceramics's material system as this will be used by Rolls Royce for turbine engine hot-section components. MR&D will develop finite element math models of the CMC material specimens and the high velocity metal projectiles to simulate impact testing. The models will first be verified by reproducing experimental data measured on impacted baseline CMC specimens. Thereafter, candidate methods for potential improvement of the FOD resistance will be analytically investigated through mathematical simulations of impact tests.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA Glenn has been directly involved in the effort to bring Ceramic Matrix Composites to turbine hot section components. The NASA Ultra Efficient Engine Technology program (UEET) was focused on driving the next generation of turbine engine technology. More recently, the NASA CLEEN and NextGen programs also aim to improve efficiency in aircraft propulsion. One of the major thrusts is the development and demonstration of advanced high-temperature materials which are capable of surviving the extreme environments of turbine combustion and exhaust. These materials enable higher engine operating temperatures which directly improves efficiency. Additionally, by reducing or eliminating the hardware needed to provide cooling, the system become less massive, further improving efficiency. Improved FOD resistance for SiC/SiC combined with the ability to accurately predict impact damage will significantly improve the ability to utilize these materials in future turbine engines.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In the commercial sector, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines are being developed for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, respectively. There are currently 838 Boeing 787s on order and 562 Airbus A350 XWBs on order. The Trent 1000 was the launch engine for the Boeing 787. These are large markets where the benefit of this technology will have a lasting impact in efficiency and cost. By working closely with Rolls Royce during the early stages of this development program, MR&D has ensured that the resulting products will meet the requirements of future customers. Both companies have expressed a serious interest in this technology and, as demonstrated above, have a sizable market for its application.The aerospace industry is not the only potential beneficiary of this technology. The Department of Energy (DOE) is working hard to improve the efficiency of power generators. Just as with aircraft engines, power turbines' efficiency improves with higher operating temperatures. As an example, current turbines operate at 2600F, which provided a large improvement in efficiency over earlier models operating at 2300F. CMC turbine blades and stators will allow even higher temperature operation and is a topic which the DOE is currently investigating.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Ceramics; Characterization; Composites; Destructive Testing; Generation; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Processing Methods; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",,University of Dayton Research Institute,"300 College Park, Dayton, OH 45469 - 0104",(937) 229-2919,High Temperature Materials and Sensors for Propulsion Systemsis a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

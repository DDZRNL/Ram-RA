In particular, SSC would like to develop a sensor to monitor the quality of LOX in the delivery line during the testing of a rocket engine.  Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) with its relative simplicity and multi-molecule analysis can be easily employed to develop a sensor for on-line, real-time measurement. In Phase I we have designed an initial - prototype system for gas mixture and LN2.measurement. This proposed Phase II research is to design an integrated Raman system that will improve the sensor performance to satisfy NASA's need for LOX quality control. A calibration technique for the gas phase sensor will be developed. An optical access interface unit for the LN2/LOX mixture system will be designed. The performance of the integrated Raman system with LN2/LOX mixtures will be evaluated and the final prototype Raman system will be delivered to NASA/SSC.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) Potential Non-NASA Commercial Applications The sensor based on Raman spectroscopy developed for this proposal can be used to monitor the chemical composition in large chemical reactors to provide data to optimize the efficiency of the processing plant and to control the chemical process in the plant.

Phase I work confirmed the possibility of production of acoustic coatings for application in ducted flows near the exhaust of a large rocket engine. The screening process for Phase I was unique in its emphasis on the practical development of a deliverable coating, as opposed to untested theoretical work or screening at unrealistic environmental conditions. In addition, work done late in Phase I produced a coating with an absorption coefficient of 47 % which has yet to be screened for high temperature survivability. Phase two has one objective and one deliverable:  To produce and experimentally validate a fully working high temperature acoustical absorption duct lining material.  Production involves optimizing the material through iterative reformulation, experimental validation involves acoustic and survival testing at conditions (specifically temperatures and sound intensities) relevant to the use environment.

So, the electrons and ions have different temperatures and the magnetic mirror field induces an ambipolar axial electrostatic field which, acting with the nozzle effect of the diverging magnetic field, will accelerate the ions exiting the GDM in a jet along the centerline, giving the thruster a specific impulse that is up to 30 times greater than a comparable device in which the hot propellant is expanded adiabaticallyThe density and temperature ranges and the basic mode of GDM operation mesh well with electric power input by microwaves via Electron-Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH). A combined ECRH/GDM thruster will have an operating envelope that will span the gap (about two orders of magnitude in density) between ion engines and magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) arc thrusters, without the endurance limitations imposed by electrodes. The proposed research will explore the operational envelope of these thrusters.

For most commercial applications on the Earth, the last two factors plus design simplicity and low cost are critical. We propose a design that offers a combination of properties advantageous for both space and Earth-based applications. It features a composite rim, aluminum hub, Null-E magnetic bearings, axial flux ironless motor/generator, and PCB windings. Most of the kinetic energy is stored in the composite rim of the flywheel due to its large radii. The aluminum hub provides interface between the composite rim and other members of the flywheel assembly and also serves as a part of a magnetic bearing. High strength of the modern composite materials combined with low densities of both the composites and the aluminum result in high energy densities. Our preliminary performance estimates are 28Wh/kg (not including the housing and power electronics) and >158,000 cycles to failure. More detailed design and analysis will likely result in even better performance. Using Null-E magnetic bearings result in dramatic design simplification, cost reduction and improved reliability compared to active magnetic bearings while preserving the performance level.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) Stationary flywheel energy storage systems for UPS, Power Conditioning, Load Leveling, Micro Turbines, Fuel Cells and Railroad applications.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) Stationary flywheel energy storage systems for UPS, Power Conditioning, Load Leveling, Micro Turbines, Fuel Cells and Railroad applications.",,,"Center for Electromechanics, The University of Texas","10100 Burnet Road, Building 133, Austin, TX, 78721-0668",(512) 471-4496

Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers.  It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment.  An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight.  To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter.  The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times.  The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine.  The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) Lightweight, compact and affordable optical systems also have many applications outside space exploration.

This process uses an energy-efficient closed air-loop Heat Pump Desiccant dryer to remove moisture from wet starting material and a Porous Membrane Condensing Heat Exchanger (PMCHX) to trap condensate. Water recovered during drying is of good quality and available for reuse with standard processing. The process is energy efficient since enthalpy released by the condensing vapor is used to reheat the drying air. Volatile organic compounds are contained throughout the drying process and can be scrubbed with existing filter technologies. The key objective for the PMCHX is to extend its range of application from low-load humidity control in plant growth chambers to high-load condenser duty at up to 80oC air temperature and at temperatures varying over a 40oC range during a single drying run. Since the presence of organics in the condensate, and the predicted condenser temperatures of 5-40oC are conditions favorable to biofilm growth, PMCHX membranes will need to be configured to inhibit the formation of biofilms.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) HPD dryers are used in terrestrial drying applications including timber drying, food and biomaterial drying.

The ultimate achievement would be to embed the operator into a scene in such a way as to convince him or her that they are actually on site. We propose a technology that can potentially achieve this by addressing and expanding on two specific technology needs outlined under the subtopic of human/robot interfaces: 1) Stereographic display systems that provide a large field of view, and high resolution, and 2) Techniques for capturing 360 degree video at a work site and redisplaying as a mosaiced virtual environment to the crewmembers back at the base camp.

In this new method of propulsion, an antenna generates and propagates a helicon wave in a plasma providing a non-thermal, wave-based mechanism for the subsequent acceleration of the plasma ions to high Mach number.  The propellant is ionized and accelerated by the wave fields far from the thruster wall that results in an electrode-less plasma propulsion system.  The device is small, light-weight, and structurally simple.  It can operate with essentially any propellant, with efficiencies comparable to Hall and Ion thrusters.  Phase I results indicate that HPH based thruster will make an efficient propulsion system with an estimated thrust of about 1 N for 50 kWe at an Isp of 2000 s in Argon, with higher Isp in Helium and Hydrogen.  Higher thrust and Isp levels are expected with further optimization of its operational characteristics.   The RF power system is also low mass and highly efficient.

Having multiple spacecraft in close proximity undergoing comparatively rapid maneuvers dramatically changes the nature of safe modes.  No longer can a spacecraft just null its rates, point its arrays towards the Sun and phone home.  Now, the faulty spacecraft must also ensure that it will not collide with others.  Furthermore, it must plan its maneuvers such that if it does experience a fault, the likelihood of collision is minimized.  Fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) is more complex and requires a vigilant on-board software watchdog that reacts to both intra-vehicle as well as inter-vehicle faults and plans according to the consequences.

However, the ability to characterize non-nuclear test core simulators is currently limited by the lack of instrumentation options available for measurements of parameters of interest such as temperature, strain, and pressure. The key to obtaining sufficient data lies in distributing large numbers of sensors throughout the core to monitor these parameters in real-time.   Unfortunately, this type of measurement is not currently feasible. RTDs and thermocouples provide only single point measurements and, because of logistical problems associated with limited physical accessibility, cannot be used in any significant numbers and therefore serve to limit knowledge of the dynamic and complex thermal system represented by the test core. In the pursuit of early flight fission, more detailed measurements are needed for modeling the behavior of the core during operation. To address this need, Luna Innovations proposes to develop fiber-optic instrumentation sensors capable of high temperature operation based on Luna's unique distributed sensing technology, which uses fiber Bragg gratings as the sensing transducers for temperature, strain, and pressure measurements.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) In addition to being a powerful supplement to NASA's metrology toolbox and an enabling technology for space-based nuclear reactors, the proposed fiber-optic sensing technology is expected to find wide commercial appeal.

The objective is low-dimensional models that accurately reflect nonlinearity in both structure and fluid and that are efficient enough to permit full exploration of parameter space.  In Phase I, our team has demonstrated the technical merit and feasibility of two types of model order reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the coupled-system variables and the method of  harmonic balancing (HB). The HB and POD methods represent complementary and synergistic tracks toward meeting the objective of modeling fully nonlinear aeroelastic systems, providing the capability of efficiently analyzing important nonlinear aeroelastic behavior like limit cycle oscillations, hysteresis, higher harmonic and sub-harmonic resonances, jump resonances, entrainment, beating, and period doubling.  The innovation offers the possibility of engineering software for predicting nonlinear aeroelastic behavior that is as accurate and efficient as the current methods of analyzing linear systems and linear behavior like flutter.

Therefore this propulsion system study proposes to examine 3 innovative concepts of widely different configurations, namely: Advanced Uniflow Supercharged 4-cycle; Advanced Contra-Prop Supercharged 2-cycle; and Free Piston/Turbine designs. The common design philosophy of maximum breathing capacity, unobstructed combustion chamber design, and high mechanical/structural efficiency ensures maximum power density on multi-fuels at the lowest cost. Economy of scale and QA production are approached by innovative/universal design that is aligned with recreational engine power and manufacturing practices.",POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) -Sport Aircraft-Airboats -Backpack Parafoil-Outboard Motors -Ultralights-PWC Jet Pumps -General Aviation-VTOL Aircraft -Utility Blowers- Misc,POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) -Sport Aircraft-Airboats -Backpack Parafoil-Outboard Motors -Ultralights-PWC Jet Pumps -General Aviation-VTOL Aircraft -Utility Blowers- Misc,,,University of Nevada Reno,"900 Virginia St. Mech Eng MS312, Reno, NV, 89503-3755",(775) 785-7522

The core engine makes extensive use of a novel self-injection, compression ignition/combustion system capable of high-speed operation on kerosene-based fuels without degradation due to variations in fuel viscosity, lubricity and cetane value. Propulsion system safety is greatly enhanced by inherent single lever control, the employment of high flash point fuel, and the absence of fuel injection system degradation when operating on variable viscosity/lubricity Jet-A fuel having unregulated cetane values. Competing aero-diesel developments are dependant on OEM fuel system manufactures that are not willing to sell their system intended for aviation use due to the low lubricity of Jet fuel and the high product liability of General Aviation industry. The preferred self-injection system does not require any specialized equipment to produce and is comparable in cost to a carburetor. The controlled combustion is characterized by having modest pressure rise and virtually absent combustion noise thus eliminating the classic ""diesel knock"" and greatly improving the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH).",POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) Sports Aircraft-Airboats Backpack Parafoil-Outboard Motors Ultralights-PWC Jet Pumps General Aviation-VTOL Aircraft Utility Blowers-Misc.,POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) Sports Aircraft-Airboats Backpack Parafoil-Outboard Motors Ultralights-PWC Jet Pumps General Aviation-VTOL Aircraft Utility Blowers-Misc.,,,University of Nevada Reno-Mech Eng MS312,"900 N Virginia, Reno, NV, 89503-3755",(775) 785-7522

Use of consumables such as water that cannot be easily replaced should be of particular concern. In this aspect the EVA suits for Moon/Mars environments need to be different from the current Space Shuttle Extra Vehicular Mobility Units (EMU) that require water sublimation into space for removing heat. Moreover, both the Moon and Martian environments are quite different from what conventional EMUs are exposed to. These variations call for careful analysis and innovative engineering for design and fabrication of an appropriate thermal control system.  Rini Technologies, Inc. (RTI) proposes a novel and No/Low consumable approach to this problem.  With the feasibility of the RTI Miniature Vapor Compression Cycle (MVCC) design demonstrated in Phase I, this proposal explores the development of a novel MVCC system suitable for these rigorous environmental requirements.  In Phase II, RTI will build a compact prototype MVCC system capable of providing 250W of cooling while using 75W of electrical power.  Furthermore, the system will achieve TRL 4 prior to the completion of the research activity","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) The MVCC system is far reaching in the possible non NASA applications.  Specifically, in military and Homeland Security applications, the system can be implemented as a personal cooling device for use with highly insulative garments such as Chem-Bio suits.  In medical applications, the system may be applied to individuals with Chronic Metabolic disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis where thermal regulatory capabilities are diminished.  In electronics applications the System can be applied for active thermal management of the environment as well as high heat point source devices.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) The MVCC system is far reaching in the possible non NASA applications.

Phase I demonstrated the technical feasibility of the OFC approach to produce passive solid-state SAW sensors that can be interrogated remotely using RF signals, and that respond with a signal that encodes both the sensor's identity and temperature measurements.  OFC SAW temperature sensors similar to those demonstrated in Phase I are capable of operating over temperature ranges not possible with silicon, from cryogenic to 1,000oC.  The spread-spectrum nature of the system proposed herein, which consists of multiple passive OFC SAW sensors interrogated remotely using chirped RF signals, provides increased processing gain and greater communication security.  The proposed Phase II effort will develop and characterize prototype OFC SAW temperature sensors targeted to selected NASA and commercial applications, and demonstrate pressure sensors.  The transceiver design will be optimized given the SAW operating parameters, conventional and innovative wafer-level packaging approaches (for devices capable of withstanding extreme environments) will be developed, and a complete breadboard wireless multi-sensor system will be demonstrated.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) One very promising near-term commercial application for the proposed wireless temperature sensor system is concrete maturity monitoring.  OFC SAW sensor technology has distinct advantages over current wired technologies, and the potential market is substantial.  Since modified SAW OFC sensors can also detect changes in surface mass loading and viscosity, the OFC SAW sensor system platform can be extended for use in chemical sensing.  This opens up a plethora of additional potential applications, including in-situ continuous emissions monitoring of mercury for smokestacks, chemical agent detection, and H2 leak detection.  Shipping container and inventory thermal monitoring may be significant for homeland security.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS) One very promising near-term commercial application for the proposed wireless temperature sensor system is concrete maturity monitoring.

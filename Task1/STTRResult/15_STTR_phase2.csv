They can also harm aircraft avionics, communication and navigation. We propose to develop a system to aid forecasters in the prediction of such events, and in the identification/lengthening of ""all clear"" time periods when there is a low probability of such events occurring. The system leverages three recently developed technologies: physics-based models of the solar corona and inner heliosphere, robust CME modeling techniques, and empirical/physics-based assessments of energetic particle fluxes using the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Environment Module (EMMREM, University of New Hampshire). When completed, the proposed SPE Threat Assessment Tool, or STAT, will represent a significant step forward in our ability to assess the possible impact of SPE events.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The CCMC, located at NASA GSFC, is presently testing different space weather models to assess their applicability for eventual operational settings. STAT would represent the coupling of two preeminent modeling capabilities at CCMC (CORHEL and EMMREM) to produce physics-based model predictions of SEP fluxes. STAT would also be of significant interest to NASA SRAG, which is charged with the difficult responsibility of ensuring that the radiation exposure received by astronauts remains below established safety limits. This requires identifying periods with a high probability of no SPEs, as well as recognizing the imminent threat of an SPE. STAT can aid SRAG in this endeavor by estimating particle fluxes and dose rates for possible eruptions when a threatening active region is identified.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) SPEs are of concern not only to NASA, but to many government and commercial entities dependent on satellites and aircraft. For example, NOAA SWPC provides space weather information to a range of customers, for many of whom the forecasting of SPEs is a top priority. The Air Force is also interested in mitigation strategies for SPEs. The fledgling private manned launch services industry may wish to develop their own forecasting capabilities, as opposed to solely relying on government services. Once we have successfully developed STAT for NASA applications, we can address the needs of these customers as well.",Analytical Methods; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation),,University of New Hampshire,"8 College Road, Durham, NH 03824 - 2600",(603) 862-4865,Space Weather is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Such advanced materials have demonstrated the promise to significantly increase the engine temperature capability relative to conventional super alloy metallic blades. They also show the potential to enable longer life, reduced emissions, growth margin, reduced weight and increased performance relative to super alloy blade materials. MR&D is proposing to perform a combined analytical and experimental program to develop a durability model for CMC Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBC). EBCs are required for CMCs in turbine exhaust environments because of the presence of high temperature water. The EBC protects the CMC and significantly slows recession. However, the durability of these materials is not well understood making life prediction very challenging. This program seeks to enhance the durability model developed in Phase I to accurately evaluate the life of the EBC for a CMC turbine blade helping to facilitate their inclusion in future engine designs. This goal will be accomplished by grounding the model with experimental tests, which will provide both fundamental properties of the EBC system and a realistic simulation of the engine environment. The engine simulation tests will provide a way for MR&D to validate the model.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA Glenn has been directly involved in the effort to bring CMC materials to turbine hot section components. The NASA Ultra Efficient Engine Technology program (UEET) was focused on driving the next generation of turbine engine technology. One of the major thrusts is the development and demonstration of advanced high-temperature materials which are capable of surviving the extreme environments of turbine combustion and exhaust. More recently, the NASA CLEEN and NextGen programs aim to improve aircraft propulsion efficiency. A major thrust is to demonstrate that advanced high-temperature materials can survive the environment of turbine combustion and exhaust. These materials enable higher engine temperatures directly improving efficiency while reducing cooling hardware.NASA Glenn Research Center has been involved with in the development of SiC/SiC for aero-turbine vanes and blades for a significant period of time. Recent efforts include those aimed at investigating the advantages and disadvantages of SiC/SiC vanes and blades. NASA Glenn has also conducted research on environmental barrier coatings for SiC/SiC turbine engine components. The research conducted as part of this Phase II program is directly applicable to the NASA Glenn efforts noted and can be used to complement those development efforts. Similarly, the results from the NASA work could help to improve the materials and tools being developed in this program.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In the commercial sector, the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 and Trent XWB engines are being developed for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, respectively. There are currently 1031 Boeing 787s on order and 812 Airbus A350 XWBs on order. The Trent 1000 was the launch engine for the Boeing 787. These are large markets where the benefit of this technology will have a lasting impact on efficiency and cost. By working closely with Rolls Royce during the early stages of this development program, MR&D has ensured that the resulting products will meet the requirements of future customers. Through its own investment in EBCs, Rolls Royce has demonstrated a serious interest in this technology and, as demonstrated above, have a sizable market for its application.The aerospace industry is not the only potential beneficiary of this technology. The Department of Energy (DOE) is working hard to improve the efficiency of power generators. Just as with aircraft engines, power turbines' efficiency improves with higher operating temperatures. As an example, current turbines operate at 2600?F, which provided a large improvement in efficiency over earlier models operating at 2300?F. CMC turbine blades and vanes will allow even higher temperature operation and is a topic which the DOE is currently investigating.","Atmospheric Propulsion; Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Generation; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",,The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,"1001 North Emmet Street, P.O.

The WINE takes advantage of existing CubeSat technology and combines it with 3D printing technology and an In Situ Resource utilization (ISRU) water extraction system. 3D printing enables development of steam thrusters (higher Isp than cold gas) as well as tanks that fit within the available space within the CubeSat. The ISRU module captures and extracts water, and takes advantage of the heat generated by the CubeSat electronics system with supplemental power from solar charged batteries. The water is stored in a steam thruster tank and used for propulsion. Thus, the system can use the water that it has just extracted as fuel to fly to another location. The WINE is ideally suited as a prospecting mission and reconnaissance mission before the mining/exploration missions are launched. In Phase 1, we demonstrated critical technologies such as (1) sample acquisition, (2) volatiles capture, and (3) various CubeSat designs. In Phase 2, we propose to develop a testbed of the critical ISRU/propulsion system (regolith -> volatiles -> tank -> thruster) and GNC technology, and in Phase 3 we will demonstrate it in space as a hitchhiker payload on a mission such as EM-1 or EM-2, or onboard the International Space Station (ISS). An ISS demonstration can extract water from a meteorite analog (brought up to ISS), use the water to fuel a WINE CubeSat, eject it into LEO, and measure propulsion performance to improve the technology as it demonstrates a change in Delta-V from asteroid-mined water.The main objective of this effort is to develop a WINE spacecraft with capability to prospect planetary bodies using its instruments, perform ISRU to extract volatiles (water), and use water in a thermal steam propulsion system to keep exploring the Solar System.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA can use this system to prospect for mining that will support Mars exploration missions. It can also use the system for any planetary exploration when there is a known water resource close to the surface. It can be used to explore the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, Main Belt Asteroids including protoplanet Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres, Mars, Europa, Titan, etc. A water-based cold-gas propulsion system is planned for development by the KSC Swamp Works for the Extreme Access vehicle, so all the progress made here will directly help NASA advance that project. Mars mission architects will see the reality of space-mined water and begin to build it into their architectures. Investors in commercial space activity will see that asteroid mining is real, and that transporting spacecraft from LEO to GEO is a viable business worthy of funding, which will create customers for space mining. Space mining companies may also gain investors and make more progress that furthers the confidence of NASA mission architects. Establishing a testbed for these activities in Space Station will result in great interest from the public, greater awareness of the reality that space industry will solve problems on Earth, and ongoing support from policymakers and NASA decision makers to advance the relevant technologies via Space Station. It may also advance the vision of utilizing Station for additional space mining and space industry activities.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The system could be used by several commercial companies that are interested in In Situ Resource Utilization for financial gain. These include Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries targeting asteroids. Bringing water from the asteroids could be very profitable given that launching water from space costs ~$20,000/liter. The major market for water could be human consumption and radiation shielding (e.g. once Bigelow Space Hotels are established) or refueling of existing satellites. The latter is of particular interest, since satellites come to the end of their life not because of electronics, or power, but because there are running out of fuel for station keeping. NASA and industry have been developing in space refueling technology, the first step in enabling refueling of satellites in space. The technology could also be applied to the Moon and used by Shackleton Energy Corp., company interested in mining water and delivering it for refueling spacecrafts at Geostationary Orbit and Geotransfer Orbit. The International Space University 2012 Summer School demonstrated the commercial viability of boosting spacecraft to Geostationary Orbit via water-based propulsion.With the advent of small satellites (nanosats and CubeSats) one can imagine that these satellites could be able to stop at an asteroid, refuel, and continue exploring.","Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Fuels/Propellants; Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Resource Extraction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine; Surface Propulsion",,University of Central Florida,"4000 Central Florida Boulevard, Orlando, FL 32816 - 8005",(407) 882-0262,Regolith Resource Robotic is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This enhanced exploration capability takes advantage of perceptual models that can encode the probability of the existence of a resource given material properties estimated from current and prior sensor measurements. The proposed program innovates novel perceptual models and exploration algorithms that maximize the likelihood of detecting resources if they are present and enables robots to make decisions about where to loiter in order to sample terrain for a particular resource. Beyond topical research, the program will ruggedize Phase 1 software to operate in the presence of sensor and state uncertainty, integrate the capabilities on physical robots, and demonstrate results in relevant, subterranean field test. Besides RSL and craters, the research enables exploration and access of cryovolcanoes, steep and deep gullies, and canyons. Terrestrial applications include the detection of radiation in contaminated facilities or explosive gases and ﬂammable dust in mines, surveying urban canyons, and exploring bunkers and caves.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Aerial prospecting enables future missions to rapidly explore and quantify localized resources such as peaks of persistent light, planetary caves, and volatile-rich regions. This program delivers guidance and algorithms for precision safe landing and maneuvering. The immediate markets within NASA are for exploration and science missions to surface destinations on the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. Phase II development occurs in the context of a mission to the Moon and Mars. The technologies are enabling for future missions that prospect by rover, but the principles apply to precise touchdown and is applicable to near term missions such as Mars 2020, RP, and Asteroid Redirect. The proposed innovations in guidance improve mission capability by enhancing landing precision, enabling access to previously inaccessible terrain, providing accurate autonomous target-relative navigation, modeling a target on board a spacecraft; and providing a light weight, power efficient solution to TRN. This capability enables robotic exploration of areas with the highest scientic value and future human exploration. The RP, currently in Phase A with a target launch in 2019, has a $250M budget reserved. Science return is dependent on landing in an identied region with high volatile content and near regions of permanent dark. Polar terrain on the Moon is hazardous and lighting varies locally, so precise landing relative to terrain is critical.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The techniques developed under this contract for autonmous survey, detection, and mapping have significant opportunity in the commercial sector. Markets are as varied as First Responder (emergency response data gathering) to Survey Equipment. There are other emerging markets that are not mature enough to demand trending attention such as tower inspections (electric transmission lines, wind turbines, cell phone towers), in-construction building progress inspections, indoor arena ceiling/roof structure/lighting inspections), train and auto tunnel inspections and any need for data, visual and otherwise, from locations difficult, dangerous or impossible to access via foot traffic or vehicles. The technology will be broadly applicable to resource prospecting in cold traps, dark craters, cryovolcanoes, asteroids, comets, and other planets. The technology is also applicable to Earth-relevant problems such as the detection of poisonous and explosive gases and flammable dust in mines; surveying urban canyons; and exploring bunkers and caves.Law Enforcement, First Responder, Search and Rescue will benet from this technologyon robots that are being used to keep personnel out of harm's way.

Technologies are needed for remote operation and supervised autonomy of robots. Consider the Resource Prospector (RP) lunar mission. For RP it will be necessary to accomplish as much as possible in the available time. A key requirement for planning such operations is the ability to accurately predict how much resource (e.g., time, power) is needed to perform planned tasks. More accurate resource estimates can prevent wasting resources trying to complete unrealistic plans. Quick turnaround of plans revisions can minimize the time the robot is idle while its plan is being modified. TRACLabs and CMU propose to develop software for the Adaptive Estimation of Resources (AER) to help build and revise plans for robots performing NASA missions. This software will be used to estimate the duration of planned tasks using information about terrain features combined with historical plan performance. These estimates can be used to assess the feasibility of robot plans when built. And can be used to assess the impact of changes to robot plans during execution. These resource models will be updated during a mission to improve the accuracy of estimates at a site. Providing more accurate resource estimates for building robot plans produces plans more likely to complete within the allocated resources. These estimates give the planner a better sense of what resources are required to achieve objectives, which affects both the selection of which objectives to pursue and the order in which to purse them. When replanning is needed, either due to unexpected opportunities or problems, these estimates can help the team determine whether sufficient time remains to complete the revised plan and, if not, help users perform plan trades to determine which subset of activities should be attempted.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed project will develop the AER software for estimating plan resources for use when building robot plans that enable variable levels of robot autonomy (NASA Roadmap TA4). The AER software has direct application to NASA's Resource Prospector (RP) mission. An ongoing operational trade during plan execution for RP is whether to spend time analyzing a nearby area or to move on to prospect another area. The proposed resource models have potential to help the science team make better decisions about prospecting by providing more accurate estimates of how long it will take to perform the tasks within a rover plan. This software also has potential use to provide resource estimates for NASA field tests for future human exploration operations.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) TRACLabs is commercializing the PRIDE electronic procedure system for use in the oil and gas industry. We currently are deploying PRIDE with an upstream oil and gas company, for use in drilling automation. The PRIDE procedure editing software will be used to build procedural tasks sequences very similar to the robot task plans built using xGDS plan editor providing plans for the proposed project. The AER software can be integrated with the PRIDE editor to provide resource estimates for drilling automation procedures. Much like robot traverse tasks, the resources needed for drilling tasks are impacted by the environment in which they operate. The time to drill through subsurface with different geological structure can vary significantly. The AER software can model drilling times through these structures to estimate resources for planned drilling procedures prior to drilling. The AER software developed in Phase II will be the basis of a new tool in the PRIDE suite of tools for electronic procedures.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Man-Machine Interaction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),,Carnegie Mellon University - Silicon Valley,"NASA Research Park, Bldg 23, Moffett Field, CA 94305 - 2823",(650) 335-2823,Information Technologies for Intelligent and Adaptive Space Robotics is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Based on the success of the current Mars Science Laboratory rover instrument ChemCam, the first ever laser-based spectrographic system to be selected as an instrument on a NASA spacecraft, the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP) has developed and tested a prototype instrument. This new instrument is capable of at least 10,000 times greater sensitivity than the ChemCam instrument, allowing faster measurements up to 8 m away with a focused laser beam. This integrated, compact remote instrument is called the Compact integrated instrument for Remote Spectroscopy Analysis (CiiRSA). Replacing the existing laser with the Q-Peak proposed laser will reduce CiiRSA?s weight by 30 % and volume by 20 %.In Phase II, Q-Peak will design, develop and build a laser that will produce 5 mJ of energy in < 2 ns pulse duration at 523 nm and our partner HIGP will further develop compact and high resolution spectrograph. Both laser and spectrograph will be integrated into the CiiRSA instrument to make it lightweight, compact and efficient. We will detect organic and inorganic sample at 10 m standoff distance in Martian environment, earth atmospheric pressure, daylight.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA applications are in systems requiring compact, efficient, reliable, moderate-energy, nanosecond-pulsed lasers. For planetary exploration, these applications are in LIBS/Raman/LIF systems used for planetary surface characterization and in lidar systems for atmospheric measurements of aerosol concentrations and distributions, as well as precision ranging for planetary surface mapping from satellites and other spacecraft, for entry descend and landing of space craft, for autonomous rendezvous of space craft. The laser we propose to develop is compact, efficient, rugged and reliable, making it ideal for planetary missions. When frequency upconverted to uv and deep-uv the laser can be used in variety other applications such as in the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer in the ExoMars mission for elemental analysis using laser desorption.The Compact integrated instrument for Remote Spectroscopy Analysis (CiiRSA) has numerous NASA applications especially for mission that seek life in extraterrestrial. Compared with SuperCam a spectroscopy based elemental analysis instrument selected for Mars 2020, CiiRSA?s resolution is higher and has low size weight and power.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Commercial applications are in portable LIBS systems to replace the current bulky, inefficient, and less reliable lamp-pumped lasers now employed. LIBS, besides having numerous scientific applications in materials characterization, can also be used in industrial applications for process control through monitoring of exhaust streams, analysis of pharmaceuticals, profiling of metals, composition determinations of minerals in mining and detection of contamination in the environment.There are numerous applications for green lasers besides LIBS that require minimized SWaP. Green Illuminators with sufficiently high beam quality to enable long atmospheric transmission suffer from excess size and weight. The proposed laser would produce the required beam quality with a SWaP advantage of near factor 2. Green lasers can be use in the Non-Lethal Laser Dazzler field. Dazzlers, are most effective in green due to the eye?s high sensitivity in the green spectral region but also require the most careful spatial beam profile control to insure that both spatially and temporally, the laser energy never reaches or exceeds the damage threshold of the eye. Q-Peak?s advantage would be in having developed an extremely small, compact, simple, and rugged technology for generation of single mode laser pulse.

The purpose of this program is to develop new high performance energy conversion devices that can act as a localized power generator for sensors and other devices. The program has already made substantial headway in designing and fabricating simple, rugged, easily installed, high temperature energy conversion devices that can be easily installed on thruster components and other similar high temperature parts. Fortuitously, these new energy conversion devices can equally function as high performance/high temperature capable vibration/pressure sensors.

During the just finished Phase I STTR project, Bluecom Systems was able to develop a comprehensive design for realizing such a WACR and demonstrate the proof-of-concept operation in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The developed design consists of three modules: a cognitive engine, a Software-defined radio (SDR) platform and a reconfigurable RF front-end. The key module that makes the radio a WACR is the cognitive engine that acts as the brain of the system. The objective of this Phase II project is to prototype a Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS)-compliant plug-n-play cognitive engine, called the Radiobot 1.0, that can transform any suitably designed SDR in to a WACR.During Phase II, Bluecom will build on the success of Phase I to develop a suite of algorithms that will make up the cognitive engine: Algorithms for spectrum knowledge acquisition and protocols for cognitive communications. The latter will specifically be aimed at networks formed by clusters of smaller satellites such as CubeSats. Next, these algorithms will be implemented on an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC). Radiobot 1.0 prototype will be completed by developing a plug-n-play interface between the FPGA-implemented cognitive engine and any STRS-compliant SDR. WACR technology operation will be demonstrated by integrating this Radiobot 1.0 cognitive engine with suitable SDR platforms and in particular those that operate in Ka band.Beyond obvious benefits to NASA in realizing autonomous and intelligent communication networks required to exploit the full potential of networked clusters of CubeSats, Radiobot 1.0 will also find commercial applications in first-responder/emergency/public safety communications, autonomous systems and drones as well as many other military communications.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Phase II plug-n-play prototype, Radiobot 1.0, will allow NASA to achieve wideband autonomous cognitive radio (WACR) technology with minimal modifications to existing SDRs. Autonomous and intelligent communications networks made of WACRs will be ideal to explore the full potential of networked clusters of satellites (such as CubeSats) including improving performance of current space communications links as well as exploring new communications paradigms. Moreover, our planned Ka-band development and testing will be aligned with NASA?s goal of transitioning future systems to this band.They can enable cognitive cooperative communications techniques leading to new approaches to achieve mission success in certain situations. For example, cognitive cooperative relaying in a cluster of satellites can provide a data path for observing the night side of Mars. WACRs can also be ideal for achieving delay tolerant networking in earth monitoring or unmanned lunar/planetary exploration missions with CubeSat networks: Cognitive cooperative communications enabled by WACRs can be used to link data to a ground station reliably with minimum delay. Other applications include, a) facilitating higher bandwidth and fewer dropouts in imagery sent over ""short"" distances such as LEO spacecraft-to-ground, b) agility to avoid interference with other systems and to adapt waveforms, and c) optimizing bandwidth within power limitations particularly at very long ranges such as interplanetary operations.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Beyond NASA applications, WACR technology enabled by our Phase II prototype Radiobot 1.0 may also find many other applications in small satellites and autonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles or drones. There is a significant market opportunity created by the needs of major defense contractors and manufacturers of such systems. Another huge non-NASA application area of WACR technology is in first-responder/emergency/public safety communications. Reliability, interoperability and infrastructure-less operation are some of the key requirements on such systems and WACRs are uniquely position to meet these requirements. The spectrum-, network- and self-aware operation of WACRs can indeed be a robust solution for emergency/first-responder communications systems. Recently, the spectrum awareness of WACRs and their ability to operate over a large spectrum range has attracted interest of DoD agencies to this technology. In particular, Bluecom is in discussions with several DoD agencies in developing WACR technology for overcoming the issue of spectrum encroachment by unauthorized transmitters and cognitive anti-jamming.","Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Antennas; Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Network Integration; Prototyping; Radio; Transmitters/Receivers",,The Regents of the University of New Mexico,"1700 Lomas Boulevard Northeast, Suite 2200, MSC-011247, Albuquerque, NM 87131 - 0001",(505) 277-1264,Autonomous Communications Systems is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Energetic particles from SPEs associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may adversely affect not only beyond-Low-Earth-Orbit missions, but also aircraft avionics, communications, and airline crew/passenger health. It is crucial to develop a capability to forecast SPEs and their effects on systems to guide planning of mission-related tasks and risk mitigation strategies.CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC), University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), and Vanderbilt University (VU) propose to develop a comprehensive forecasting capability - SPE Forecast (SPE4) - comprising state-of-the-art modules integrated within a novel computational framework. SPE4 will include: (a) the MAG4 code for probability forecasts of flares/CMEs, and SPEs, (b) the PATH code for solar particle transport through the heliosphere, (c) Geant4-based transport calculations including geomagnetic modulation and atmospheric interactions (for avionics) to yield spectra of SPE-induced energetic protons/heavy ions, interfaced to (d) the CR?ME96 code for calculation of resulting effects in electronics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the superior capability of MAG4, PATH, and Geant4 for their respective tasks using a prior solar event case. A controller script was developed for automated code execution and data transfer across interfaces. Functionality of the overall event-to-effects capability was demonstrated using the 28-Sep-2012 event. We developed a concept of the final software product for NASA based on client-server architecture. In Phase II, we will collaborate with VU to interface calculated particle spectra with CR?ME96 to determine single-event effects in electronics. We will enhance robustness, accuracy, and execution speed via improved models and procedures, and demonstrate the software for persistent 24x7 SPE monitoring.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed effort is aligned with the goals of NASA?s Living With a Star (LWS) program that is focused on developing a predictive understanding of solar activity and its effects on Earth and space-based assets. The newly developed and validated ?event-to-effects? modeling capability will be synergistic to the strategic capability models available to the scientific community (e.g., via the Community Coordinated Modeling Center ? CCMC - at Goddard/GSFC). In fact, the MAG4 solar activity forecasting code within the overall SPE4 package is already (individually) available from CCMC. With the emphasis on linking the calculated particle spectra with CR?ME96 to calculate effects in electronics, optimizing SPE4 interfaces and calculation procedures, and continued validation, this project will also focus on transition towards operational use. This effort also addresses objectives outlined in NASA?s Human Research Roadmap and OCT Technology Roadmap TA06 ? Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems, in particular, the sub-technology area of Radiation, including Space Weather Prediction and Protection Systems. The SPE4 software will specifically address the limitations facing mission operational planning in terms of forecasting the occurrence, magnitude, and all-clear periods of SPEs. The SPE4 framework will also support interfaces to other downstream codes for radiation effects calculations (e.g., to analyze and design effective shielding materials).","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Dynamic variations in the high-energy, highly-penetrating solar particle environment can adversely affect aircraft (especially near the Poles), cause navigational and GPS equipment interference, disrupt spacecraft electronic systems, and cause disruption/equipment failure in communication systems. For DoD agencies and commercial entities with space-based or high-altitude assets, an efficient and accurate predictive capability for the radiation environment at desired locations or along preset trajectories, and resulting effects caused in systems (electronics, materials), will be a significant aid to mission planners for scheduling tasks and to adopt risk mitigation strategies for equipment. Changes in the Earth?s ionosphere due to SPEs can modify the transmission path and even block transmission of High Frequency (1-30 MHz) radio signals. These frequencies are used by amateur (ham) radio operators, commercial airlines, and government agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Defense. Terrestrial applications such as electric power transmission systems can be affected by SPE-induced changes to the geomagnetic field leading to blackouts. Induced stray currents leading to corrosion in above-ground oil pipelines (near the Poles) is another concern. In all these cases, a predictive capability for SPE-induced radiation level spikes can help equipment managers intelligently manage operations and prevent catastrophic failures.","Characterization; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools",,University of Alabama in Huntsville,"301 Sparkman Drive Northwest, Huntsville, AL 35899 - 1911",(256) 824-2657,Space Weather is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

At present, only high TRL devices based on infrared absorption are candidate replacements, because of their proven long-term stability, despite their size and power consumption and failures in the presence of liquid water. No current compact sensor has the tolerance for liquid water that is specifically required for a Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS), and NASA is investigating alternative technologies for the Advanced EMU under development. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will develop a luminescence-based optical sensor probe to monitor carbon dioxide, oxygen, and humidity, and selected trace contaminants. Our monitor will incorporate robust CO2, O2, and H2O partial pressure sensors interrogated with a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The sensors not only will tolerate liquid water but will actually operate while wet, and can be remotely connected to electronic circuitry by an optical fiber cable immune to electromagnetic interference. For space systems, these miniature sensor elements with remote optoelectronics give unmatched design flexibility for measurements in highly constrained volume systems such as the space suit. In prior projects IOS has demonstrated a CO2 sensor capable of operating while wet that also met PLSS environmental and analytical requirements. In Phase I, a new generation of CO2 sensors was developed to advance this sensor technology and fully meet all NASA requirements, including sensor life. In Phase II IOS will develop a novel sensor system with unique capabilities for inspired gas monitoring, a unique tool for NASA space suit development. The proposed effort could lead to an alternative to infrared absorption-based devices for space missions. IOS has established collaboration with relevant primes for NASA and the aeronautics and defense industry for technology commercialization.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed technology will apply directly to accomplishing the objectives of the NASA Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program, facilitating the rapid and effective development of novel EVA systems, and the demonstration of key capabilities for future human missions beyond Earth orbit. Exhaustive testing of prototype systems reduces risk and improves the affordability of exploration missions. The proposed technology will significantly enhance current capabilities for demonstrating, in ground-based testbeds and in flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), the prototype EVA systems developed in the AES program. IOS sensor technology is probably the most advanced alternative to infrared-based gas sensors, and the proposed effort could lead to an alternative approach for gas monitoring in the PLSS for space missions, to infrared absorption-based devices, with the advantages not only of operation under wet conditions, but also of reduced power consumption and size.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) IOS has already applied the proposed technology to monitoring pilots' inspired gases in military aircraft. The proposed technology has potential in other applications in military aeronautics, where the characteristics of the fiber optic sensor have significant advantages. Specifically, we are evaluating oxygen monitoring in on-board oxygen generation systems (OBOGS) and gas monitoring in on-board inert gas generation systems (OIGGS).Finally, the largest potential market for a combined carbon dioxide/relative humidity/oxygen (pCO2-H2O-O2) sensor is the indoor air quality control market. Advanced management of indoor air quality (IAQ) is essential to meet the DOE goal of reducing energy use by 20% in a decade while reducing IAQ-related health problems. Implementing novel building envelopes to reduce energy use can compromise indoor air quality. Technologies for the next generation of air control and monitoring must emphasize cost-competitiveness in widespread use.

The proposed -green-propellant- system offers significant advantages over competing technologies in the areas of cost, safety, and mission capability.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The availability of a dedicated CubeSat launch vehicle will provide NASA a solution for low-cost payload insertion for their in-house CubeSats such as Nodes, MinXSS, the ELaNa payloads, the CubeQuest Challenge mission, IceCube or FireFly. The proposed propulsion solution will offer a significantly higher degree of mission flexibility than is possible with rideshare delivery methods. The Parabilis solution also enables very precise orbit injection, allowing spacecraft to forgo on-board propulsion in many cases.  This precision facilitates cooperative missions where new spacecraft need to join an existing constellation, such as the proposed CubeSat A-Train that builds a network of observatories similar to the existing -Afternoon Constellation- of full-sized spacecraft currently in LEO.This solicitation and proposed technology aligns with NASA's 2014 Strategic Plan Objective 3.2, providing access to space.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Since 2000, there have been nearly 500 CubeSats launched. In 2014, the number of CubeSat launches surged in a large part due to the launch of PlanetLabs Flock 1 satellites. This increase in demand has created a backlog for CubeSats in rideshare markets. This backlog, as well as the ever growing capability of CubeSats has created a significant demand for dedicated CubeSat launch vehicles.Potential non-NASA customers include universities, businesses, and research institutions. A number of universities have CubeSat development programs that would benefit from a dedicated launch on demand service with precision, selectable orbit injection. The proposed innovation is also an ideal solution to military responsive space challenges. For instance, the US Navy's ICE-Cap CubeSat could be produced in bulk and stored to be launched as a quick response method for augmenting MUOS communications capability to meet rapidly-changing global demands.Additional commercial applications exist for the proposed stage beyond that of a dedicated launch vehicle upper stage. The stages -compact size allows it to be used as a secondary payload post-deployment propulsion system on many launch vehicles. This will give CubeSats and MicroSats significant capabilities when launched as a secondary payload. The innovation can also be applied to larger products geared for lower stages.","Exciters/Igniters; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Prototyping; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine; Structures",,Utah State University,"1415 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 - 1415",(435) 797-1659,Affordable Nano/Micro Launch Propulsion Stages is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Among the key technological challenges is to have a suitable detector that not only can be used for both gamma ray and neutron detection, but also satisfy the many highly desirable and essential for spaceflight properties: good energy resolution, high efficiency, high radiation tolerance, low power consumption, low volume, low weight and operation without cryogenic cooling. We propose a room temperature semiconductor detector (RTSD) using a single material that can detect both gamma radiation and neutron particles. The novel materials we propose are mercurous halides, Hg2X2 (X=Cl, Br) - mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2) and mercurous bromide (Hg2Br2). The development of these spectroscopy grade mercury halide-based radiation detectors are especially relevant to future NASA missions to any solid body in the solar system, including the Moon, terrestrial planets, asteroids, comets, and the moons of the other planets. Our goal is to deliver a breakthrough in detector technology that can lead to spectrometers that are capable of performing both gamma and neutron spectroscopy.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The ultimate goal of this research work is to build and demonstrate a space-borne spectrometer system that can perform both gamma and neutron spectroscopy. The parameters of the spectrometer system (including electronics) will be designed to meet the criteria necessary for the intended application of planetary exploration. This technology is relevant to missions equipped with -robot-based in-situ measurement systems, such as Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM), Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) and any post-2020 Mars-lander, where low payload (no more than 1 kg) is mandatory.  This technology is also very beneficial to any mission where the study of radiation environment is important to the -human side, -such as MARS 2020. LunaH-MAP and similar missions will also be able to leverage such SBIR/STTR technology to develop a low cost instrument to find water on planetary bodies.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Commercial applications include elemental analysis, explosive detection, medical diagnostics, x-ray imaging, seismic activity detection, and radiation monitoring. The detection and identification of radionuclides from atmospheric nuclear tests has obvious military applications such as detection of nuclear non-proliferation, treaty verification, and nuclear materials control. Another application for which this technology can be useful is that of commercial space development, particularly asteroid mining. A gamma/neutron spectrometer would be very well suited for the detection of possible valuable material in these objects. New legislation has even included a provision that gives individuals or companies ownership in any material that they -mine- from these objects. This could open up a new market for these spectrometers within the global radiation detector market.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Detectors (see also Sensors); Ionizing Radiation; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); X-rays/Gamma Rays",,Fisk University,"1000 Seventeenth Avenue North, Nashville, TN 37208 - 3051",(615) 329-8516,Technologies for Planetary Compositional Analysis and Mapping is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Leveraging an existing InGaAs APD focal-plane array (FPA) technology, improvements will be made to increase its reliability and performance. The high-gain, low-excess-noise APD FPAs will be characterized and integrated with miniature camera electronics, along with a medium-pulse-energy, high-repetition-rate, ultra-compact, pulsed diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser.

Some of these applications include: asteroid sample return and redirect, space-debris removal, human landing on the moon and Mars, lunar mining, autonomous resupply and crew transportation to and from the International Space Station, robotic servicing/refueling of existing orbital assets, and on-orbit assembly.

Most current lidar approaches are significantly limited by their hazard to the human eye. Many lidar systems are being developed in the invisible wavelength of 905 nm. Lasers that emit at this wavelength can potentially damage eyes. Due to ocular-damage threshold levels, the optical power of the lasers must be kept low. Lower laser power limits the range of lidar systems, making it difficult to cover large areas. With highly sensitive detectors operational in the eyesafe spectral region, with low-cost lasers operating at 1500-nm, a million-times-greater laser-pulse energy is permissible, allowing for more compact mobile lidar systems in a low-cost product.","3D Imaging; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Infrared; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Navigation & Guidance; Ranging/Tracking; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)",,University of Dayton,"300 College Park, Dayton, OH 45469 - 0104",(937) 229-2919,Navigation and Hazard Avoidance Sensor Technologies is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

MEDSEM will ultimately simultaneously measure X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Backscattered Electron (BSE) Spectra, Optical Spectra (OS) and Mass Spectra (MS). During the Phase II project Caltech will build on its transfer of electron-transmissive membrane technologies (Phase I) and further transfer to CL the technology for building an array of miniaturized, high-energy electron optic columns (EOCs) that are encapsulated by the microfabricated, electron-transmissive membranes for exciting XRF from samples in an atmospheric ambient. Electron field-emitter sources for these columns will be procured by Caltech from Stellarray Inc. and integrated with the high-energy electron columns. CL will manage the overall STTR Phase 2 project and assist Caltech in the fabrication and integration of EOCs, perform electron-optical and XRF-generation computer simulations to optimize the MEDSEM design, lead the testing and characterization of the Phase II MEDSEM prototype, and ultimately demonstrate the MEDSEM prototype performance. The 24-month Phase II effort will be aimed at developing and demonstrating a prototype MEDSEM prototype instrument (TRL6).

To date, although miniaturizing scanning electron microscopes has been a ?holy grail? for developers of planetary instruments, an in situ electron microprobe instrument has never flown. Once successfully demonstrated, MEDSEM would be a strong candidate for planetary instrument payloads for NASA?s future landed missions, as described by the National Research Council Committee on the Planetary Science Decadal Survey for future NASA missions from 2013 ? 2022. According to the Decadal Survey, primary planetary targets for landed missions include the moon, Mars, Venus and Europa. MEDSEM offers the great promise of offering multiple, orthogonal sensing measurements (XRF, BSE, Cathodoluminescence, and Mass spectrometry) all within a single instrument thereby drastically reducing the Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) required for flying each of these measurement modalities as separate mission instruments.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In the fields of materials science and engineering, geology, oil exploration, scrap and precious metals identification, academic research outside of NASA, there is a great need for capable, field-portable instruments that are rugged and reliable. As with NASA missions, size, weight and power consumption are of concern for humans transporting these instruments into remote locations for geological studies, environmental monitoring and oil exploration. An added concern is the overall cost of the instrument, especially for widespread acceptance and use. A successful MEDSEM instrument would also open up numerous applications in the educational arena. At both the K-12 and college level, MEDSEM could be used for science demonstrations as well as for hands-on experimentation and research in chemistry, solid-state physics, geology and materials science laboratories. Although MEDSEM cannot match the spatial resolution of terrestrial laboratory instruments such as scanning electron microscopes (mm vs nm), still it could serve as a rapid screening device with the ability to answer basic composition-related questions. MEDSEM?s primary advantage, of course, is its ability to simultaneously make multiple, different measurements on the samples being studied in ordinary room air.

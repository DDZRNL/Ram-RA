During Phase 1, we demonstrated that in addition to tracking and correcting for laser frequency drift, the system is able to track and correct for etalon frequency drift (in fact, only this relative frequency drift can be tracked). Data was collected before, during and after a frequency drift over a period of time typical of lidar data integration times. It was seen that integrating without the correction resulted in data too blurred to have any value, but that the correction system compensated for the shift and allowed for proper wavelength measurements. We now look to incorporate this technique into a lidar receiver system and demonstrate its viability in measuring wind velocity.

Hydroxyl Tagging Velocimetry (HTV) uses an ultraviolet laser to tag a region of the flow with OH molecules, and interrogates them after a short delay with a second laser to obtain velocity from time-of-flight data. The method relies on the dissociation of H2O molecules naturally present in the flow, and thus requires no seeding. Being an all-optical technique, it is not adversely affected by high temperatures or high dynamic pressures. Analyses and experiments conducted during the Phase I effort demonstrated feasibility by showing that OH tag lifetimes in a simulated rocket exhaust environment were sufficiently long to enable accurate determination of tag displacements corresponding to typical rocket exhaust velocities. The method was demonstrated by measuring velocities in the exhaust gases of a laboratory scale burner at temperatures and chemical compositions representative of a H2/O2 rocket exhaust.

Ablative thrust chambers have an extensive heritage and are the low cost approach to fabricating rocket thrust chambers. However, composite ablative chambers are heavy and suffer from erosion that typically limits performance of the engine in terms of burn time and efficiency/performance of the combustion. In the last decade, there has been significant interest in utilizing fiber-reinforced ceramic composites such as carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composites. Such composites have demonstrated a low erosion rate in bi-propellant liquid rocket thrust chambers at temperatures approaching 4000F. However insertion of these materials have been limited by complexities associated with required system redesign to accommodate a radiatively-cooled chamber and unproven attachment methods. By incorporating a ceramic composite liner within an ablative thrust chamber in critical areas that are subjected to the highest temperatures, a low erosion, high performance chamber is obtained that eliminates costs and complexities that have limited the insertion of ceramic composite thrust chambers. The Phase II will build on the successful static hot fire test of such a thrust chamber that demonstrated minimal erosion to demonstrate weight savings and a reduction in film cooling with respect to a comparable ablative engine.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) A number of launch systems under consideration for use by NASA can benefit from the improved performance of a low cost ablative thrustchamber obtained by incorporating a CMC liner.

The phase change cooling as liquid N2O is flashed into a vapor is crucial to limiting to acceptable levels the erosion of both the nozzle throat and spike, thereby enabling reusable operation and/or long burn times. The N2O used for cooling the nozzle throat will be reintroduced into the combustion chamber, and the N2O used for cooling the spike will be used to provide base bleed, virtually eliminating any performance penalty associated with using a severely truncated, and therefore significantly lighter, spike. Because of its high vapor pressure, N2O can be self-pumping, thereby making it an ideal choice of oxidizer for simple, low-cost applications. As a simple, practical nozzle, the proposed innovation fits well with N2O-HTPB hybrid rocket designs, which tend toward simpler, less expensive design alternatives. Because of their high efficiency due to altitude compensation, aerospike nozzles could play an important role in bringing to fruition inexpensive access to low Earth orbit.

All thermoset processes that utilize such machines rely on autoclaves to consolidate the laminates, at significant acquisition and operational expense. Autoclaves to consolidate wings are hugely expensive. Autoclaves for fuselages are nearly cost-prohibitive (only one exists). Autoclaves for the Ares V do not exist. The marketplace would welcome a proven out-of-autoclave fabrication technology.The tasks in the ASI/UD-CCM STTR phase 1 was to assess the performance of the current TP-ATP heads, do a model based parametric study to determine possible head and process parameter changes and demonstrate an improved understanding of the head, with a goal of autoclave level properties.A set of models for the in situ Automated Tow/Tape Placement (ATP) processes that capture the important process phenomena were developed by UD-CCM.  Accudyne then measured the laminate roughness, fabricated samples using a variety of conditions and tested the samples.Testing of the laminates indicate: placing with flat tape and using improved head chilling increases mechanical properties. Compacting with only a ¼ load reduces properties. Using a vacuum bag oven reconsolidation is ineffective, and even reduces mechanical properties.The phase 2 program innovation is to develop and deploy University of Delaware process models to Accudyne's thermoplastic tow and tape placement head to remedy the mechanical property shortfall between the two fabrication processes used to manufacture large composite aerospace structure important to NASA.

LEO is a relatively warm thermal environment and without careful thermal management, significant quantities of stored liquid cryogens can be lost due to boil-off. This requires that larger volumes of cryogenic fuels must be launched into orbit so that sufficient quantities are available to satisfy the mission propulsion requirements. It has been shown that active cooling using space cryocoolers has the potential to result in Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) of stored cryogens. The launch-mass savings using active cooling exceeds that of passive cooling of LOX for mission durations in LEO of less than 1 week. The savings advantage of active cooling for LH2 begins after about 2 months in LEO. The proposer is developing a Modified Collins Cryocooler that offers the potential for higher efficiency cooling with better system integration for ZBO storage than can be provided by Stirling or pulse-tube type cryocoolers.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In addition to application for ZBO of stored cryogenic propellants, sub-cooling to densify LOX and LH2 has the potential to reduce the gross launch weight of a vehicle by up to 20%. Additional applications exist to cool instruments to temperatures as low as 4K. Currently this is accomplished primarily by launching a dewar of liquid helium with the instrument payload.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The modified Colling cycle cryocooler technology is particularly well suited to cooling applications in a temperature range from 4K to about 60K. At temperatures above 60K the efficiency advantages of the modified Collins cycle become less significant with respect to that of Stirling and pulse-tube cryocoolers. However, significant technology applications exist in the sub-60K temperature range. These include cooling HTS-transmission cables (60K and lower), the NASA ZBO application (20K), cooling space optical systems (10K), and terrestrial applications such as cooling MRI & NMR magnets (4K) and cooling LTS superconductors and devices (4K).",Cooling; Fluid Storage and Handling; In-situ Resource Utilization; Propellant Storage; Superconductors and Magnetic; Tankage,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 - 4307",(617) 258-8015

The DWT system consists of a ground vibration test (GVT) hardware system and a real-time unsteady aerodynamic force generation software system developed from an aerodynamic reduced order model (ROM). The DWT system can serve as a replacement or complimentary means for flutter/ASE instability testing to a WT. Our Phase I effort has successfully demonstrated the validity of the DWT concept. That is, DWT testing can truly simulate in real time the unsteady aerodynamics through a GVT hardware system, namely the shakers and sensors. Merits of a DWT are many: It can use real full-size aircraft/wing structure including inherent structural nonlinearity and flight controller in-the loop, instead of a flutter model for WT, hence a cost/time effective test system. It can be carried out with a GVT setup, and because of the simulated aerodynamics the DWT measured data is wall-interference free. The DWT system can be applicable to flutter envelope expansion and flying quality programs of military and civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The Dry Wind Tunnel testing concept would be particularly useful as a pre-flight testing effort to identify any aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instability that are not predicted by the analysis. For example, inherent structural nonlinearities such as friction and freeplay are notoriously difficult to model properly in linearized analyses but would be naturally present in the DWT testing as it is carried out on the actual structure. DWT testing would also be useful as a post-flight testing procedure to resolve discrepancies between the analysis and flight test results. The DWT test concept is applicable to a broad range of test structures, from components to wing to full aircraft, that are currently being tested by NASA.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The DWT system can be applicable to flutter envelope expansion and flying quality programs of military and civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft.

This proposal describes a Phase II effort that will result in the development of multiple uniquely identifiable, wirelessly interrogable, passive humidity sensors, and a wireless interrogation system to obtain and interpret the sensor responses. The interrogation system used will be a slightly modified version of the system designed by ASR&D for use in the wireless SAW concrete maturity monitoring system currently being developed by ASR&D under funding from the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) and under the NASA Phase II STTR contract NNK07EA38C. ASR&D thinks that this interrogation system, which incorporates coded sensor time diversity with self-synchronization, has significant advantages over the OFC-sensor-based systems previously developed by the ASR&D and the University of Central Florida in terms of increased range and the larger number of sensors that can simultaneously operate without sensor to sensor interference. The proposed Phase II effort has technical objectives that aim (i) to further the development and implementation of the passive wireless SAW humidity sensor technology for which preliminary technical feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I, (ii) to modify existing breadboard wireless interrogator electronics to operate with these sensors, and (iii) to produce prototype sensor devices capable of operation with the modified breadboard wireless interrogator system to produce a multiple sensor system usable for field demonstration of the technology. Wireless system demonstrations will be conducted using laboratory samples of the composites used in wind turbines or other NASA relevant applications. At the completion of the Phase II effort, the sensors and system will be at TRL 4-5.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The primary NASA application for the proposed wireless multisensor humidity measurement system would be for detection of water infiltration in composite structures and insulating foam, a significant problem for a variety of NASA programs. The spray on foam insulation (SOFI) used on the shuttle external fuel tank can absorb water. Upon launch, water trapped in the foam can undergo aerodynamic heating, causing rapid expansion of foam sections as the water turns to steam. This can lead to delaminations and sections of the foam breaking off causing other hazards. Similar problems exist for composite aerostructures. Both honeycomb foam core carbon composites can experience explosive expansion of water vapor due to aerodynamic heating during launch, if excessive water infiltration has occurred. This major problem dictates that aerodynamic heating be taken into account when launch windows are determined. Installation of arrays of individually coded passive wireless humidity sensors inside such structures would allow for non-destructive determination of water levels internal to the structure, providing launch personnel with valuable information to optimize the flight path. Application to SOFI and nonconductive composite materials would be straightforward, while for electrically conductive carbon composites innovative techniques to transmit the activating signal through the composite layers would be necessary, such as the acoustic-electrical transmission demonstrated by JPL.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Measurement of humidity is one of the most commonly used metrics in industrial process control, and along with temperature, is critical to a wide range of industrial and manufacturing processes. Numerous commercially available humidity sensors are used in the manufacture of household appliances, automobiles, HVAC equipment, printing equipment, telecommunication equipment, computation equipment, and a wide range of industrial machinery. None of these commercial sensors, however, are passive, able to operate wirelessly, and capable of operation at extreme temperatures. Small, rugged, inexpensive, reliable sensors that can rapidly sense a range of humidity levels under extreme environments would prove beneficial to a range of applications. Additionally, the rapid response of the sensors demonstrated in Phase I could make these devices advantageous for certain applications where wireless operation is not required. The two most promising short term applications are detection of water intrusion in composite structures for wind turbines and the aerospace industry, and monitoring of joint sleeves in oil and gas pipelines for corrosion-inducing humidity levels and/or condensing water. Additional applications for which ASR&D has received inquiries from potential end users and industrial collaborators include monitoring for water intrusion in commercial built up roofing, humidity detection surrounding high-value consumer windows and doors, and water intrusion in concrete structures.",Airframe; Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Biochemical; Inflatable; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Tankage,,Temple University,"1601 N.

Prior to the Phase I activity, wireless, passive sensors which could operate in a multi-sensor environment had not been successfully demonstrated. This is no longer the case. An experimental transceiver test bed has been built in Phase I and wireless temperature sensing has been demonstrated. Using OFC sensors developed by the University of Central Florida (UCF), remote temperature sensing at distances of up to several feet at 250 MHz has been accomplished. Further, work on electrically small antennas (ESA) has demonstrated that antennas more commensurate with the sensor size can be achieved. A smaller sensor/antenna package yields a more flexible sensor solution. Using the results form Phase I, it is proposed that a prototype interrogator be built and operation demonstrated at 915 MHz in a multi-sensor environment.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) A wireless, passive, coded sensor that is rugged, cheap and can be remotely interrogated has multiple applications at NASA. Temperature, pressure and accelaration sensors can be installed on the leading edges of wings to monitor temperature, pressure loss and also provide a profile of the forces on the structure. Additional NASA applications include acceleration sensing for monitoring vehicular acceleration and vehicular vibration, vehicular docking, rotation and directional sensing, tilt control, and fall detection. By exploring the future use of SAW devices for monitoring structural integrity, extreme temperature, extreme pressure, toxic or lethal environments, it is highly probable that the wireless SAW can change the future of Airframe safety and the required/planned maintenance process. This technology can allow the feasible embedment of sensors in key structural components of an airframe for persistent monitoring both during flight and as a post flight analysis. Not only could the structural integrity of the airframe be monitored but other critical states of air flight could be instrumented without the increased cost of weight associated with fiber optic or wired communication.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Potential Non-NASA commercial include the Automotive Industry (state of health), Civil Engineering (stress management), Chemical and Biological development (toxic safety monitoring) and Refinery process (safety monitoring). The utilization of a wireless SAW device for remote monitoring of hostile environments will become not only technically feasible but also economically feasible based on the extremely low cost associated with the device. By establishing the WSAW as a passive device and the wireless interrogator as the active portion of the link you have enabled an architecture which can support the monitoring of possibly hundreds of SOH sensors per interrogator.As an example in an automobile the wireless SAW can be deployed as pressure sensors in each tire, liquid contaminant sensors in the fuel and oil supplies, temperature and pressure sensors within the engine, and carbon monoxide sensors within the vehicle.

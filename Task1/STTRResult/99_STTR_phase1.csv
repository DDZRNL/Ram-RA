Firsich,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tailored carbon nanofibers are under development at Florida Atlantic University. These materials exhibit an uncommon double-layer capacitance at high requencies; this feature makes them desirable for electrochemical capacitor applications. Their power and energy characteristics may be dramatically improved by surface functionalization using processes developed at Inorganic Specialists, Inc. Functional groups are attached which undergo reversible redox reactions (i.e., they provide pseudocapacitance). Preliminary results show that unctionalization increases the nanofiber's stored energy by 100 to 400%, and that the energy enhancement occurs at both low and high frequencies. The Phase I objective is to establish that surface-modified nanofibers can be made into exceptional high frequency energy storage materials. The work has two components. 1) High frequency capacitance nanofibers will be tailored with a maximum amount of edge plane sites. This should foster the attachment of a maximum number of energy-enhancing surface groups. 2) Surface functionalization procedures will be further developed, and functionalized nanocarbons will be tested for performance and electrochemical stability. Based on these two studies, an optimized material will be produced; its performance will show the feasibility of functionalized nanofiber materials.",,"Energy storage materials with high frequency capacitance and high power are needed for wireless digital communication applications and pulse digital technology.

The surface modification procedures of this proposal have broad applicability: they can improve the power and energy storage of any carbon or nanocarbon material. Phase I will demonstrate feasibility and practicality, and is anticipated that Phase II will yield materials with an eight- or ten-fold improvement in energy/power over the best nanocarbon capacitor materials currently available.",,01 - Human Operations in Space,Florida Atlantic University,"777Glades Rd., Boca Raton, FL Zip:33431",,

Such a compliant foil bearing will have the necessary capability to carry rotor loads in the event of a magnetic bearing overload or failure even for large gas turbine engines. To ensure maximum utilization of space the bearing system will be nested to produce a bearing system that is robust, simple in design, and is lightweight. Under this effort, MiTi will use state-of-the-art foil and magnetic bearing analysis tools and resources to establish key bearing design parameters for the high temperature applications.

A carrier sled levitated and propelled by magnets provides the initial velocity to a space transportation vehicle. Superconducting magnets enable higher fields at lower weights than normal  conducting magnets and consequently a significantly larger clearance between the guideway and the carrier sled. The reduced weight of the carrier sled and the relaxed mechanical tolerances of the guideway not only lead to cost savings in construction and operation of the MagLifter system, but to a more robust system with higher operational reliability. A superconducting magnet system is proposed for the MagLifter carrier sled and will be compatible with most guideways.

Recently, F&S and research team members successfully addressed the processing and cost issues associated with composite materials by introducing a novel fabrication method that uses thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (TLCP) reinforcement fibers. The TLCP reinforced composites are excellent for cryogenic applications because they offer a barrier to liquid hydrogen, liquid nitrogen, and liquid oxygen and the TLCP fibers have no measurable thermal expansion over a wide range of temperatures, thus significantly reducing structural cracking resulting from thermal cycling. During the Phase I program, the F&S team will focus on designing and fabricating composite storage tanks that are lighter in weight than existing tanks, more cryogenically stable, and non-reactive to liquid oxygen. The approach involves using a rotational molding process to produce a pure TLCP liner that will serve as the cryogenic liquid barrier that will be filament wound with bicomponent polyolefin/TLCP fibers to provide strength and stiffness.

The emulsified system will consist of a surfactant stabilized oil-in-water emulsion with the nanoscale iron particles contained within the emulsion particles. DNAPLs, such as TCE, diffuse through the oil membrane of the emulsion particle whereupon they reach the surface of an iron particle where dehalogenation takes place. The hydrocarbon reaction by-products of the dehalogenation reaction diffuse out of the emulsion particle and vent to the ground surface. The method of emulsion delivery can be applied to DNAPL pools under buildings without interruption of usage of the facilities. Direct treatment of the DNAPL pool will avoid long-term contamination of groundwater as the DNAPL slowly dissolves. Unlike pump and treat, which has failed to remediate DNAPL pools, this methodology possesses the potential to totally eliminate pools of DNAPL. Because no successful in-situ methodologies currently exist for DNAPL remediation, the successful demonstration of the proposed methodology would lead to widespread commercial usage.",,"Remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbon plumes is a high priority for Federal and private organizations.

The same economic analysis estimates costs for accelerated source treatment at $1.3M per site. The Department of Defence (DoD) alone owns over 3,000 chlorinated hydrocarbons contaminated sites. A review of these sites indicates that at least 270 DoD facilities have defined DNPAL sources.

990107,,,STRUCTURAL COMPOSITES FROM ALIGNED CARBON NANOTUBES,Busek Co. Inc.,"11 Tech Circle, Natick, MA Zip:01760",,D.L. Carnahan,,,,,,,,,,,,"The recent development of methods to create multi gram amounts of carbon nanotubes in aligned arrays is yet to be exploited for the fabrication of structural composites. Busek proposes, along with its team member Boston College, to create composites based on in-situ grown, aligned arrays of carbon nanotubes. A composite that harnesses the unique properties of carbon nanotubes(CNTs) will have exceptional strength and high specific stiffness. Other properties may be thermal conductivity, chemical inertness and high electrical conductivity. Busek Co. Inc. developing CNT based field emission cathodes for aerospace applications and we are herein proposing to apply their experience to structural applications of CNTs as reinforcing fibers in polymer - ceramic matrix composites with the assistance of Dr. Z. Ren, at Boston College, who, while at SUNY Buffalo, developed a technique to align nanotubes during their growth. In Phase I, Dr. Ren's nanotube growth technique will be transferred to Busek, who will begin to synthesize aligned arrays of nanotubes. Busek will prepare composites using the aligned nanotubes, which will be characterized and mechanically tested at Boston College. The ultimate goal of the program is to develop the entire process for the production of nanotube composites, aligned and optimized for structural applications. Success will enable the production of continuous CNT filaments and crystaline ropes for applications such as space tethers and as light weight electrical wires.",,"Carbon nanotubes can greatly improve the properties of structural composites. CNT stress transfer efficiency is estimated to be at least an order of magni- tude larger than in conventional fiber-based composites. This is expected to result in composites with higher specific strength, stiffness and/or toughness depending on the application. The corresponding weight reduction will benefit all military and commercial aerospace vehicles. CNTs can also reinforce composites with metal and ceramic matrices. The proposed program will also benefit other non-structural applications of CNTs including those in the microelectronic, microelectromechanical(MEM)industries.",,01 - Human Operations in Space,Boston College,"140 Commonwealth Avenue, Chestnut Hill, MA Zip:02467",,
990060,,,Lightweight Deformable Mirror Systems,Boston Micromachines Corporation,"59 St. Germain St, #2, Boston, MA Zip:02115",,Thomas Bifano,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this project, a lightweight membrane mirror device will be integrated into an adaptive control system, capable of correcting static and dynamic primary-mirror shape errors in a space-based telescope. The core innovation will be the use of a multi-zone, deformable mirror fabricated by thin-film surface micromachining. Contour shape of the mirror membrane will be controlled by an array of electrostatic actuators, each of which can deform a local subaperture. Electrostatic actuation holds considerable promise for membrane mirror shape control because it offers nearly reversible (i.e. low power) actuation, no hysteresis, and nanometer-scale precision and repeatability. Prototype micromachined deformable mirror (µDM) devices show promise: they are one hundred times faster, one hundred times smaller, and consume ten thousand times less power than the commercially available macroscopic DMs. The project team has produced the first continuous membrane zone-controlled µDMs: a critically important step in the development of large-aperture, space-based, lightweight mirror systems. Core research areas to be addressed in this project include development of optical thin-film reflective coatings for µDM membranes, demonstration of feasibility of a µDMs in a closed loop adaptive optical system, and design improvements to µDMs to allow more actuators, larger apertures, and curved substrates.",,"Micromachined deformable mirrors (µDMs) promise to alter the field of adaptive optics by providing a low power, compact, high performance, economical alternative to existing systems. The emergence of µDMs is likely to extend the field of adaptive optics from its roots in astronomical imaging systems to the commercially important, emerging areas such as laser based communications, biomedical imaging, laser welding, and terrestrial imaging. Also, because of their compactness and low power, such devices may find significant applications in space-based optical imaging systems that require dynamic or static compensation of flexible or segmented primary mirrors. A low-cost, low-power, modular deformable mirror system is likely also to find considerable market in the emerging area of image enhancement and beam formation.",,03 - Structures and Materials,Trustees of Boston University,"881 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA Zip:02215",,

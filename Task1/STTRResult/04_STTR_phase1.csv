However, poor software reliability is a major impediment to the success of these mission-critical systems. Testing, formal verification, and code synthesis techniques have been proposed to achieve more reliable software, with automated code synthesis being the most promising method. But synthesizing a complex system from scratch is costly.  A more practical approach is to synthesize systems from existing components, i.e., component-based system synthesis (CBSS).  Existing research in CBSS focuses on synthesizing systems bottom-up, which has severe limitations.  We propose to achieve CBSS by combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Specifically, we develop techniques to achieve automated system decomposition and semi-automated system architecture synthesis.  The IDEAL decomposition technique decomposes a system into ``IDEAL'' units that are mathematically composable and can be developed and evolved independently.  Consequently, the technique assures system reliability and enables on-the-fly feature/technology upgrades. The QoS-based architecture synthesis technique seeks to assure system QoS properties by synthesizing an architecture that optimizes QoS objectives.  It also facilitates on-board system adaptation due to resource and power constraints. Combined with bottom-up techniques, such as Amphion and pattern-based code synthesis, a dramatic leap in automated CBSS capability can be achieved. The proposed research will lead to sophisticated automation for synthesizing highly reliable, multi-mission capable avionics and exploration systems.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)   As it will lead to significant improvement of productivity and appreciable reduction of development and maintenance costs, the resulting component-based QoS-driven software synthesis technology will be appealing to the commercial sector.

The actuator/sensor is known as PVDF-IDT (Polyvinylidine Fluoride Interdigital Transducer) that is integrated into a TFT switching circuit. It is low cost, compact, flexible, and has great potential for wireless interrogation.

The second element of the system is an automatic fault prognosis tool, which consists of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). PCA is a popular neural network tool for extracting useful features. LVQ is used to generate the code sequence.

Few surfaces resist biofilm formation, most promote it.  Biofilm formation poses problems in water systems as they can clog pipes and pores, block filters, reduce heat transfer, and in general restrict flow.  Their metabolic products can aid corrosion, even of stainless steel.  In potable water systems, both their metabolic products and the bacteria or fungi themselves directly pose a health hazard.  A space environment appears to be a particularly favorable one for biofilm formation.  Cell cultures have shown far higher rates of growth in low-gravity environments.  Space radiation seems to accelerate microbial growth and foster their mutation.  Within a closed environment with many non-replaceable resources, prevention of biofilm formation is paramount.  To meet this need, Agave BioSystems and the Universities Space Research Association, propose to develop carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and other nanostructures for the prevention of biofilm growth.

The self-healing property of these materials is strongly correlated with the thermal processes that occur during and after damage initiation.  Recent experimental results have demonstrated that penetration of the polymer by a projectile causes localized heating near the puncture.  The heating then causes a localized melt elastic response which serves to close the puncture and 'heal' the polymer.  Since self-healing has already been demonstrated using these materials, the major technical challenge of this STTR effort is to stimulate the localized melt elastic response that has been shown to initiate self-healing.  Our concept is to incorporate a magnetically-response phase into the insulating polymer for the purpose of causing localized heating during high-frequency excitation of the polymer.  This magnetic phase will be located close to the electrical conductor.  Localized heating will cause flow into the crack and, upon cooling, the crack will close over the wire and eliminate the exposure of the bare wire.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)   Self-healing wire insulation materials will have wide-spread commercial applications wherever electrical power is utilized ? all kinds of automobiles, commercial buildings, homes etc. They could also be used in computer systems to improve reliability and reduce maintenance.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)   Self-healing wire insulation materials will have wide-spread commercial applications wherever electrical power is utilized ? all kinds of automobiles, commercial buildings, homes etc. They could also be used in computer systems to improve reliability and reduce maintenance.",,,Virginia Tech,"460 Turner Street, Mail #0170, Blacksburg, VA, 24061-0170",(540)231-5281

The investigation of backscattered light is of particular interest since most medical applications aimed at the in-vivo characterization of biological tissue rely on backscattered light. By recording the spatially dependent response of a medium to a polarized point source, one may obtain information about the scattering particles that are not accessible to mere intensity measurements. In this program, Boston Applied Technologies Incorporated (BATI), together with the Catholic University of America (CUA) proposes an innovative NIR polarization imaging solution based on high performance fast tunable phase retarder and novel algorithm. It will have the ability to record both scattering images and Stokes polarization imaging. It allows very fast recording the polarization images at the speed limit of a CCD. It contains no moving parts and can accommodate to most of the existing CCD cameras. The unique measurement procedure allows efficient, accurate sensing of the polarization imaging. A computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) software will be developed for the proposed polarization imaging system.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)   The potential for this device in commercial clinical practice is also enormous, from early detection of skin cancers, to microscopic tissue analysis.

The uncooled QDIP technology enables high-performance LWIR detecting on a chip with significantly reduced payload. It is highly desired in many Earth science applications. The Phase I work will perform feasibility investigation of the proposed device concept, optimize quantum dots growth and annealing techniques and produce a preliminary design for a prototype system that can be built and demonstrated in Phase II with a NASA supplied platform.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)The ultra-sensitive, room temperature and spectral tuning capabilities make the proposed technology particularly useful in many Non-NASA applications requiring ultra-sensitive and standalone, including:(1) Night Vision (2) Ultra-sensitive missile early launch detection and high-speed trajectory tracking with non-false alarming(3) Continuous and standalone chemical and biological hazard detection(4) High definition three-dimensional medical imaging and reconstruction","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)The ultra-sensitive, room temperature and spectral tuning capabilities make the proposed technology particularly useful in many Non-NASA applications requiring ultra-sensitive and standalone, including:(1) Night Vision (2) Ultra-sensitive missile early launch detection and high-speed trajectory tracking with non-false alarming(3) Continuous and standalone chemical and biological hazard detection(4) High definition three-dimensional medical imaging and reconstruction",,,University of Massachusetts Lowell,"Office of Research Administration, 600 Suffolk Street, Lowell, MA, 01854-3629",(978)934-3359

Qualtech Systems, Inc. in cooperation with Montana Tech of the University of Montana proposes to develop an intelligent self evolving prognostic fusion solution. The proposed solution intelligently combines multiple subsystem health assessments to form an overall system health assessment. Additionally, the solution performs optimal system configuration based upon the health assessment. Design of the individual prognostic solutions for subsystem health assessment also utilizes fusion methods. The approach combines both model based and data driven techniques to provide optimal health assessment. The prognostic solution self evolves over time to cover the life of the subsystem.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 100 WORDS)   The proposed technology will have wide applications beyond NASA.

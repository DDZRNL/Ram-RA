To achieve the long-duration missions away from Earth as outlined in the Vision for Human Exploration in Space, these energy storage systems will need to undergo a dramatic increase in their specific energy densities.  Recently, Mainstream has made startling advances in the area of high energy-density batteries using carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes.  However, theory suggests that silicon actually possesses an intercalation capacity that is an order of magnitude above that of carbon.  If this is able to be translated into added capacity, it would truly revolutionize Li-ion electrochemistry and energy-storage technologies in general.  The Universities Space Research Association has recently developed a process of growing silicon nanorods and has agreed to team with Mainstream for this Phase I STTR effort.  This Phase I focuses on developing and testing electrodes comprised of both silicon and carbon nanostructures in Li-ion batteries.  Because the basic battery chemistry will not be affected, safety will not be compromised.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) High energy density batteries have potential space and air-based applications that are simply too numerous to list.  The primary benefit of any such battery for NASA is that it will permit NASA greater flexibility in planning future missions to meet new long-term objectives.  Specific potential applications include orbiters and satellites, deep space missions, instrumentation balloons, and communication equipment.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Independent marketing studies have confirmed a significant commercial application for CNT batteries; the commercial electronics battery market currently produces millions of lithium-ion batteries per month with end applications as diverse as watches, palm pilots, cell phones, hearing aides, and pacemakers.

Orthogonal Frequency Coded (OFC) SAW devices have been demonstrated as passive wireless temperature sensors in NASA Contract NNK04OA28C, and are being further developed under NNK05OB31C.  The proposed hydrogen sensors will use a novel OFC SAW device structure, combined with Palladium nanocluster film elements to produce fast, reversible, highly sensitive hydrogen sensors capable of detecting a wide range of hydrogen concentrations at room temperature.  The proposed research will utilize results from Argonne National Labs on the formation of Pd nanocluster films on self-assembled siloxane monolayers on glass.  These optimized nanocluster films demonstrated hydrogen sensing from 25 ppm to over 2% hydrogen, with response times of milliseconds, complete reversibility, and no baseline drift at room temperature.  The films experience large conductivity changes due to the hydrogen induced lattice expansion of the Pd nanoclusters and the quantum nature of conduction in nanocluster films.

Modern IT tools and techniques have the capability to redefine many design and operational processes as well as enable grand exploration and science investigations. This proposal plans to address NASA's needs for innovative communication concepts for autonomous systems that require local information dissemination among mobile entities. We will explore a peer-to-peer paradigm for local dissemination of information among surface-based assets that are in geographic proximity. In this paradigm, a set of mobile objects (astronauts, rovers, robots, sensors, etc.) form a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET), and they communicate with each other via short-range wireless technologies such as IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth. We propose to develop a novel software toolkit that enables efficient local information dissemination applications in such an environment. The heart of this toolkit is a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) algorithm that disseminates information intelligently based on the semantics of the information. This algorithm does not rely on any infrastructure, central server, or routing data structures, and therefore provides a higher survivability of the network than the traditional data dissemination techniques.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) NASA's exploration of planetary surfaces will require dissemination of local information by surface-based assets, including base stations, astronauts, habitats, rovers, and robots. For example, a rover monitors the operation of a robot in proximity and be warned when the robot is moving in a wrong direction or is about to lose its capability; a base station needs to receive the notification about a malfunctioning rover, possibly generated by the vehicle health monitoring system; astronauts in proximity need to monitor each other and be aware of who is where, who is contacting whom, who has what capabilities; and so on. In these applications, the local resources that are of interest to mobile users are often only available during a limited period of time and these resources themselves may be mobile. For example, a malfunctioning robot may be moving and it is available only until it completely loses capability. Similarly, the current location of an astronaut, and the current temperature in a particular geographic area, are temporarily valid or available resources. MOBI-DIC provides surface-based mobile assets with an efficient information dissemination tool. MOBI-DIC will be embedded within a hardware device attached to mobile objects such as astronauts, robots, rovers, and sensors, and it will enable quick building of information dissemination services needed in NASA's exploration of planetary surfaces.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) MOBI-DIC will enable quick building of matchmaking or resource discovery services in many application domains including social networks, transportation, mobile electronic commerce, emergency response, and homeland security. For example, in a large professional, political, or social gathering, the technology is useful to automatically facilitate a face-to-face meeting based on matching profiles. In transportation, MOBI-DIC incorporated in navigational devices can be used to disseminate to other similarly-equipped vehicles information about relevant resources such as free parking slots, traffic jams and slowdowns, available taxicabs, and ride sharing opportunities. In mobile electronic commerce, MOBI-DIC is useful to match buyers and sellers in a mall, or to disseminate information about a marketed product. In emergency response, MOBI-DIC can be used by first responders to support rescue efforts even when the fixed infrastructure is inoperative; it will match specific needs with expertise (e.g. burn victim and dermatologist), and help locate victims. In homeland security, sensors mounted on neighbouring containers can communicate and transitively relay alerts to remote check-points.","Architectures and Networks;Autonomous Control and Monitoring;Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management;Database Development and Interfacing;On-Board Computing and Data Management;Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools;Power Management and Distribution;RF;Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors;Telemetry, Tracking and Control;Teleoperation;Wireless Distribution",,Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois at Chicago,"MB 502, M/C 551, 809 South Marshfield Avenue, Chicago, IL  60612-7205",(312) 996-9406

We plan to devise methods to improve the AlN epitaxial material quality and device structures for EUV detectors.  Specifically, we will study the properties of Si and Mg doped AlN epilayers and investigate n- and p-type doping issues in AlN and hence the feasibility for achieving high performance EUV detectors; improve the AlN material quality by exploiting novel template/substrates and growth schemes to reduce the dislocation and native defect density.

Improved performances of AlN based EUV detectors over conventional existing technologies are expected.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The UV range supplies a richness experimental data which is unmatched by any other domain for the study of hotter objects in the universe because it samples molecular, neutral and atomic gas at temperatures ranging from 10 to 105 K.  The performance of UV detectors has steadily improved over the last decades in many respects, and astronomical applications benefit from this evolution. Nevertheless, current detectors designed for UV, especially for extreme UV (EUV) observations (ranging approximately from 5 nm to 200 nm), are based on Si semiconductors and exhibit a few major drawbacks that are difficult to overcome within silicon technology.  For space applications, the ideal EUV detector is the one that is visible blind, reliable, high resistant to radiation damage, high efficiency, lightweight, minimal power consumption, and can operate at room temperature.  AlN based wide bandgap semiconductor materials hold very strong promise to satisfy these general requirements due to their inherent physical properties.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The development of AlN based EUV detectors will have broad applications in military, homeland security, and commercial sectors.  For military applications, there is also a need for higher performance sensors that require less power and occupied smaller volume in the military systems; EUV sensors may be used on UAVs, sub-munitions, guided flairs and other guided and precision munitions.  In the areas of homeland security, EUV sensors can be used for biothreat detections. For commercial applications, there exists a huge potential for miniaturized EUV sensors.

Delaying flow separation could allow an aircraft to recover from adverse conditions that would otherwise result in a loss of control. Active flow control using synthetic jet actuators has been the subject of significant research in recent years due to its immense potential to expand the operating regimes of unconventional airfoils and provide ""virtual"" shaping.  Barron Associates (BAI) and its research partners at the University of Virginia and the University of Wyoming propose innovative active flow control solutions that will allow achieve virtual sur-face shaping objectives and delay flow separation at high angles of attack to provide a safer and more efficient flight environment. The proposed integrated actuation and control systems will be demonstrated using a Boeing 747 flight simulation. In Phase II, the team will:  (1) implement the control algorithms in real time in hardware; (2) fabricate a Boeing 747-like scale model with integrated synthetic jet actuators, and; (3) demonstrate the actuation capacity and control algorithm performance for achieving desired flow control objectives.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The proposed research effort clearly offers the potential for a significant leap in vehicle performance, operation, safety, cost, and capability.

RF electron sources provide an alternative approach that does not consume electrode material.  The current from this Non-ambipolar Electron Source (NES) exceeds the current normally extracted from conventional rf plasma sources by a factor of (mi/me)1/2 where mi and me are the ion and electron mass.  Ions are lost to a negatively biased conducting cylinder with area Ai chosen to be Ai ≥ (mi/me)1/2 *Ae where Ae is the electron extraction area. Slots in the conducting cylinder allow the cylinder to serve as a Faraday shield to reduce capacitive coupling from the antenna to the plasma.

Radiative heat transfer in rocket engine combustion can play a significant role in determining engine performance and combustor wall heat loading. Radiation will also become increasingly important as hydrocarbon-based fuels are used in rocket propulsion as alternatives to hydrogen, for in-situ propellants, and in the development of nontoxic fuels for reaction control thrusters. Currently there is no radiation modeling capability in the LOCI framework, the basis for codes used by NASA and their contractors to design and analyze rocket engines. CFDRC has teamed with Mississippi State University (MSU), the original developer of LOCI, to develop the needed radiation module.  In Phase I, the well-established Control-Angle Discrete Ordinates Method will be implemented for solving the Radiative Transfer Equation. This module will be used in the combustion code, CHEM, and tested with proven gray and nongray gas radiation models to establish the framework for future development and to demonstrate the feasibility of radiation modeling using LOCI. In Phase II, efforts will focus on developing increasingly accurate and robust nongray gas models such as the narrow band models, Weight-Sum-of-Gray-Gases method, and the innovative Full Spectrum Correlated k-distribution model.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The LOCI radiation module will enable NASA and government contractors to better design and analyze rocket engine combustion systems, including new cryogenic rocket engines needed for In-Space Propulsion. At the end of Phase II, NASA will have a comprehensive suite of radiation modeling capabilities that will help design safer and more efficient rocket-propelled vehicles of the future. The software will be a final deliverable to NASA, and will be in open source format.  The LOCI module will be implemented into a NASA selected CFD code, LOCI-CHEM, and can also be added to other LOCI-based codes such as LOCI-STREAM.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Design and optimization of combustors using CFD tools is standard practice in both the rocket and gas turbine industries. Industrial combustion system designers are particularly interested in prediction of pollutant emissions, but poor radiation modeling limits the effectiveness of current CFD tools. The market value and commercial impact of the proposed development is expected to be significant because of its high fidelity, computationally efficiency, and utility for a wide range of combustion problems. The proposed development will also be of interest in the furnace, heater and boiler industry.",Chemical;Simulation Modeling Environment,,Mississippi State University,"Box 9637 300 Butler Hall, Mississippi State, MS  39762-9637",(662) 325-2756

Laser ultrasonic has now become a valuable tool for on-line inspection, demonstrating its advantages in the steel and aerospace industries. Non-destructive laser ultrasonic inspection equipments use large size laser components.  They are not designed for light-weight, portable and power sensitive applications. Currently, NDE of space transportation vehicles is primarily carried out on the ground, between missions but for future space missions, more inspection will need to be performed in space in order to monitor the aging process of the structure and to insure its integrity.  For inspection during space flight, the NDE equipment must be compact, lightweight, easily operated by human with limited mobility or robot, and exhibits low power consumption. To satisfy these requirements we proposed to develop a laser ultrasonic inspection system integrating an amplitude-modulated continuous wave laser source for high efficiency generation and a multi-channel random-quadrature interferometer for robust and highly sensitive detection. The proposed system takes advantage of fiber technology for both the generation and the detection in order to achieve a compact, portable and versatile inspection system.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The proposed system will be designed to satisfy the size, weight and power requirements for NDE systems to be embarked during space mission. The primarily target is the NDE during space flight, but it will also be applicable to on-the-ground NDE. Potential NASA applications covers a variety of NDE inspection needs, including the detection of subsurface inclusions and surface breaking cracks, the inspection of wiring and detection of cracks in the insulation, characterization of coating materials and bonding properties.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Potential non-NASA commercial applications include ground based aircraft and spacecraft inspection, the inspection and characterization of thin films and coatings, residual stress measurement, fatigue crack detection, and the inspection of metallic and composite plates.",Laser;Optical;Photonics,,Boston University,"110 Cummington Street, Boston, MA  02215-2407",(617) 353-3951

These new technologies when combined with advanced avionics and propulsion concepts will make GA affordable and ecologically sustainable. With a greater ease of vehicle operation, GA can become available to a much larger clientele and provide strong impulses for the aerospace industry. When a large number of new technologies are combined in a revolutionary way, validation of the entire system at the design and development stage becomes highly desirable. We propose building and flight testing a dynamically scaled model of NASA's GA demonstrator that will feature many important elements of the new GA concept.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The proposed 1/3 scale model will be a test-bed for testing of the dynamical behavior of the envisioned Next Generation Aviation Demonstrator (NGAD). It will also serve as a low-cost/ low-risk test-bed for novel technologies such as high lift devices, circulation control, and tail-fan propulsion. The proposed development and flight test program should demonstrate that scaled models can considerably reduce the cost and risk involved when developing radically new aircraft concepts.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) In addition to the research goals of the dynamically scaled NGAD, ACR will be able to directly benefit from the design and initial development of a light UAV airframe. Just like the goals of the full scale NGAD, the dynamically scaled model will have significant advantages over current light UAV designs. Noise reduction and safety are two of the biggest advantages. In a military context, most UAVs of this class are extremely loud, and can be heard long before being detected by other means. The shrouded fan and enclosed engine of the NGAD will both reduce and shift the noise signature of the aircraft. In civilian UAV applications, noise reduction shares the same value as it does in regards to tail-fan aircraft. Another advantage of the shrouded fan design is safety. By enclosing the propeller, the greatest danger to the ground crew of a UAV is removed.","Autonomous Control and Monitoring;Composites;Guidance, Navigation, and Control;Multifunctional/Smart Materials;On-Board Computing and Data Management;Pilot Support Systems;Telemetry, Tracking and Control",,"Arizona Board of Regents, University of Arizona","888 North Euclid Avenue, #515, Tucson, AZ  85719-4824",(520) 626-4607

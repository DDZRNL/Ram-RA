In cooperation with materials scientists at Texas A&M, NanoSonic would develop and manufacture ultra-lightweight Metal Rubber- and carbon nanotube-based rubber (CNT Rubber) wire and cables with performance equivalent to that of conventional copper cables but with only 10% the weight. Wiring harnesses contribute significant weight load to the spacecraft structure. Ultra-lightweight Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber wires and cables can reduce that weight while offering comparable or superior electrical power and data transmission performance and EMI resistance. During Phase I, NanoSonic would design, fabricate and test lightweight Metal Rubber and CNT Rubber wire and cable prototypes. Texas A&M's nanotechnology laboratory would co-develop methods for CNT Rubber production and evaluate resulting material properties. The conducting core and outer shielding layers would be fabricated by molecular-level self-assembly. Electrically-conducting cable shielding tape layers would be dimensioned using CAD-driven templating equipment at NanoSonic. Wire and cable would be manufactured using wire feed, dielectric extrusion and shielding tape winding steps.

SAW devices are a platform technology for passive wireless sensing of numerous possible measurands. ASR&D and its collaborators have demonstrated passive wireless sensors using SAW devices, for applications including temperature sensing, cryogenic liquid level sensing, hydrogen sensors, and humidity sensors under NASA SBIR and STTR funding. The proposed hypergolic fuel sensors will use SAW devices combined with chemically selective film elements to explore the possibility of producing sensitive hydrazine (HZ, MMH, and DMH), and nitrogen tetroxide sensors capable of detecting low ppb concentrations over a range of ambient conditions. This research will utilize the results obtained in ASR&D's nanocluster Palladium (Pd) film and coded SAW sensor and wireless interrogation system research, and existing hypergol sensing technologies. The proposed films should experience large conductivity changes due to interactions with the hypergolic chemicals being detected, producing measurable changes in SAW device performance, as seen in ASR&D's hydrogen sensors. During the Phase I project, issues including formation of the chemically selective films on piezoelectric substrates, optimization of these films, and sensor performance for different device types will be investigated. Successful completion of the proposed Phase I activities will establish the technical feasibility of producing the proposed sensors, evaluate the potential performance capabilities of optimized sensors, and define the additional work necessary to effect device implementation. Assuming the results of Phase I are positive, Phase II could result in development of multiple uniquely identifiable, wirelessly interrogable hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide sensors.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Compounds in the hydrazine family and nitrogen tetroxide, which are hypergolic when used together, are used as rocket propellants in NASA, Air Force, and civilian spacecraft. Until recently, the Shuttle's APU and HPU systems used such fuels,as do both mono- and bi-propellant propulsion systems. The continued use of these compounds to fuel rockets in the next generation launch vehicles under development at NASA is likely. However, these compounds are hazardous, and human exposure or atmospheric release may present serious health, safety and environmental risks. Hence adequate leak detection technology is essential for safe use of these materials. The proposed hypergol sensors will be developed to work with the SAW multi-sensor interrogation system being developed by ASR&D. This would provide a multi-sensor system to be used by NASA for distributed real-time hypergolic fuel leak detection. The passive wireless nature of these sensors will allow remote monitoring, with power only required at interrogation system nodes, where sensor ID and signal processing occurs. The processed data can then be sent back to a central reporting station using standard wireless communication protocols. Small size, low cost, RFID capability, and rapid reversible responses make this sensor technology potentially applicable for personnel monitoring and similar applications.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Hydrazine [HZ], along with its methyl-substituted derivatives (including monomethylhydrazine [MMH] and dimethylhydrazine [DMH]) are flammable, toxic compounds that are also suspected carcinogens. Permissible exposure limits, as recommended by the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists, are 10ppb. Nitrogen tetroxide is a strong oxidizing agent, and has a threshold limit of 3 ppm. In order to minimize potential exposure of personnel and to facilitate cleanup, it is essential to rapidly identify and localize accidental releases of these materials in both vapor and liquid form. Sensor systems used for this purpose must be capable of detecting levels of these compounds at concentrations far enough below regulatory limits to trigger alarms before regulatory exposure limits have been met. Thus, detection at low ppb levels is desirable for hydrazine, and high ppb levels for nitrogen tetroxide. The proposed sensors have the potential of providing rapid, real-time monitoring for these chemicals, at levels low enough to enable alarm system operation. Such sensors would be useful in any facility that manufactures, stores, transports, or uses these compounds. The world market for hydrazine and its organic derivatives is growing, with applications in space, defense, and civilian arenas. Availability of a cost-effective monitoring technology for these compounds could enhance regulatory compliance and safety industry-wide.","Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Fuels/Propellants; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport)",,Temple University,"1938 Liacouras Walk, Rm 217A, Philadelphia, PA 19122 - 6027",(215) 204-8691

For these field tests, a remote Science Team built rover plans to collect data that supplements astronaut EVA and a remote Flight Team supervised the execution of these plans. This model of operation requires the Science Team to generate and revise all plans, often taking a partially executed plan and quickly updating it in response to issues that may have nothing to do with science. As a result the Science Team pre-builds alternative plans, many of which are not used. In future exploration operations, astronauts orbiting a planet will supervise rovers operating on the surface below without benefit of real-time support from Earth because of time delay. In such cases it becomes important to provide a more flexible planning approach that permits the Science Team to distinguish essential tasks from tasks to be performed as time and resource permit, or in response to discovery (contingent tasks). TRACLabs and Carnegie Mellon University propose to build science alternatives into a single rover plan as contingent tasks, potentially reducing the time spent building plans and providing the Flight Team with more flexibility when executing plans. We will identify use cases describing how the Science Team will build plans with contingent tasks and how the Flight Team will execute these plans. We will design software for use by the Science Team to build plans with contingent tasks. We will design rover software for executing such plans and software for the Flight Team to supervise this execution. We will evaluate this design for use in K10 rover operations.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed technology for building and executing plans with contingent tasks has immediate application to NASA robotic field tests with intelligent rovers. The Science Team planning rover plan can express their priorities as minimum science requirements within the plan, with options for going beyond these minima as opportunity arises. The Flight Team responsible to execute these plans can adapt the plan by selecting among alternative tasks based on conditions and observations made during plan execution. Longer term, the proposed project provides a technology pathfinder for exploration missions where astronauts must supervise intelligent planetary robots without the real-time backup from Earth that is possible for near-Earth missions. The use of plans with contingent tasks provides a means for the Earth-based planning team to express priorities in mission objectives and to predicate the decision about what tasks the rover performs on what the rover discovers. This approach gives astronauts flexibility to adapt the plan when opportunities or problems arise to maximize mission return.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The Department of Defense (DOD) is actively pursuing remote supervision of Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicles for surveillance and reconnaissance. The software for building and executing robot plans with contingent tasks combines reactivity with the predictability needed for such operations.  The ability to perform contingent tasks based on what has been discovered by earlier tasks in the plan also is relevant to this domain.In the private sector, electronic procedures and technology for procedure assistance provide a means of gradually deploying plant automation. The technology for building and executing contingent plans supports defining reactive plant automation that adjusts tasks in response to production performance. Plants that have telemetry and commanding is available electronically are the most likely to adopt this technology, such as 1) Refineries, (2) Petrochemical plants, (3) Power plants (nuclear, conventional), (4) Pharmaceutical plants, (5) Food processing plants, and (6) Ethanol plants.",Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Sequencing & Scheduling,,Carnegie Mellon University - Silicon Valley,"NASA Research Park, Bldg 23, Moffett Field, CA 94305 - 2823",(650) 335-2823

The key innovation of this approach is the use of dielectricless high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils to overcome the limitations in efficiency and range of existing solutions. This approach is informed by existing research models that predict a nominal application of this technique is capable of delivering 100 Watts of power at a distance of 100 meters with over 90% efficiency. A notional application of the technology is to deliver power to rovers exploring the inside of craters at the Lunar poles, where solar power is not available. The naturally low temperatures would eliminate the need for thermal control overhead on the rover, allowing the system to be charged from a completely unenergized state or powered directly. Multiple rovers could be powered by the same transmission system and there would be no pointing requirements for operation. The phase I effort will demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer using superconducting wires as a proof of concept (TRL 3-4), which will be integrated with existing thermal control technology (TRL 4) into a working prototype (TRL 6) at the end of Phase II.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The technology applies wherever power generation at the point of need is unavailable, insufficient or too costly (in terms of mass). Powering multiple rovers within a polar lunar crater is an ideal application since the lack of sunlight generates a need for power delivery while providing an ideal thermal environment for the superconductors. Another example is a Mars rover architecture where a slow moving ""crawler"" provides power to a suite of agile rovers performing sampling and analysis tasks over a wide swath. Near the crawler the small rovers would fully function and store excess energy, whereas farther away they would operate primarily from stored energy until recharging becomes necessary. Other applications may involve human or robotic EVA outside of ISS, where the ISS would provide an ample power source. In 6 DOF operation the inductively coupled system has the advantage of less sensitivity to orientation than solar power generation.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In military operations unmanned rovers can be sent into dangerous situations to acquire intelligence. The inductive coupling allows for a rover to explore caves or the rubble of a demolished building, as well as undersea operations to power Unmanned Underwater Vehicles. FEMA could benefit by providing temporary power in areas where the infrastructure has been lost. A primary interest in commercial markets is power delivery to small electronics such as laptops, cell phones and PDAs. In this application, the receive side would not be superconducting. These wireless power systems are currently under development by other companies, however the efficiency of such systems could be substantially improved if the stationary transmission coil were superconducting, with the appropriate thermal control. This combination could increase the efficiency of such a system from 10% to over 90% over the distances of interest.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Distribution/Management; Superconductance/Magnetics,,University of Maryland,"3112 Lee Building, College Park, MD 20742 - 5141",(301) 405-6269

For example, unmanned missions such as the planetary probes and telescopes could see great benefit. The thin film shade for JWST could self-heal from potential damage from cosmic particles flying through interplanetary space. This will help mitigate degradation in the performance of the shade.

Because helium is a nonrenewable resource, it is desirable to conserve the gas when possible. For safety purposes, helium is used to purge an engine following a test that utilizes cryogenic liquid hydrogen fuel (e.g. a Space Shuttle Main Engine test). This proposal is another important step toward enabling helium conservation through real-time measurement of the H2 concentration in the purge gas. The STTR will continue the characterization of a commercial H2 detector for use as a real-time sensor for determining the concentration of H2 in the helium purge gas. The H2 concentration can be used as an indicator that the liquid hydrogen has been purged from the engine, allowing the helium purge to be of shorter duration, thereby conserving this resource. Significant analysis of sensor capabilities as well as experimental characterization of the sensor performance in a simulated test-stand environment will be performed. A sensor configuration will be recommended with the goal of identifying the best installation option that avoids pumps, mechanical actuators, or the need to vent or pipe a sample if possible.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The implementation of configurations that will reduce the purge time of liquid hydrogen will save value quantities of Helium. Accurately determining when the liquid hydrogen has been purged from the engine will save money while conserving the precious He resource. Additionally shorter H2 purge times will reduce operations time and increase safety. The installation option that avoids pumps, mechanical actuators, or the need to vent or pipe a sample will reduce the time and costs needed to approve the utilization of the new sensor. Complicated safety analyses will not be required due to the noninvasiveness of the new sensor.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Liquid hydrogen is a common liquid rocket fuel. Thus, the purging of liquid hydrogen will have the same cost, inherent safety, and conservation of energy benefits in commercial settings as in NASA applications. It will be applicable in the liquid hydrogen piping and storage facilities. There is a place for the technology in concept hydrogen vehicles and many research applications where the storage and flow of liquid hydrogen presents safety and costs issues.

While the orifice as a device is largely effective in stepping down pressure, it is also susceptible to a wake-vortex type instability that generates pressure fluctuations that propagate downstream and interact with other elements of the test facility resulting in structural vibrations. Furthermore in piping systems an unstable feedback loop can exist between the vortex shedding and acoustic perturbations from upstream components resulting in an amplification of the modes convecting downstream. Such was the case in the Arianne 5 strap-on P230 engine in a static firing test where pressure oscillations of 0.5% resulted in 5% thrust oscillations. The innovation described in this proposal directly relates to a proprietary design of a step down orifice that inhibits the instability modes generally associated with the operation of a traditional orifice while meeting performance guidelines. In the Phase I effort we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the new device through a combination of analysis and sub-scale testing in a cryogenic environment.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The novel orifice type flow control element resulting from this proposal would help alleviate instabilities in liquid rocket propulsion systems and test facilities for rocket engines that usually are initiated or amplified at the orifice plates.  Our product will addresses a severe shortcoming in NASA's test facilities since orifices/venturis are commonly used and are quite often responsible for resonance and structural vibrations observed in the piping system. Design of the new control element proposed here can be tailored to provide the required resistance in the flow path without the risk of cavitation or whistling/resonance/vibration in the test loop. The new orifice design can also be used in segmented solid propellant rockets where they can prevent low frequency oscillations from amplifying, thereby keeping thrust levels stable.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The commercial market for our product is very large and includes plant installations and industrial facilities that use extensive piping systems such as nuclear power generation, chemical process plants etc. The technology proposed here can play a critical and imminent role in addressing an important safety concern in pressurized water reactors where orifices are used in the emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) in conjunction with throttle valves. Another application of our product is in reciprocating compressors where resonant pulsation in the piping can be managed through the judicious use of a well-designed orifice-type element. In summary our product will provide the needed resistance in the hydraulic flow-path of plant installations/devices in a variety of industries without the flow transients and instabilities that are commonly associated with orifice plates leading to high-performance, high-reliability systems with significantly reduced risk.","Acoustic/Vibration; Characterization; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Simulation & Modeling",,Propulsion Research Center University of Alabama in Huntsville,"S225 Technology Drive, Huntsville, AL 35899 - 0001",(256) 824-7200

Presently, the helium used in these processes is discarded, along with substantial quantities of hydrogen. TDA Research proposes to design and build a compact, portable and cost effective membrane system for recovering, purifying and storing both helium and hydrogen. Recovered helium containing less than a few percent residual hydrogen can be re-used as a purge gas. The ultrapure hydrogen recovered concurrently may be burned as fuel or used to generate clean electricity in fuel cells. The performance of these high selectivity membranes has been demonstrated and is ready for implementation to solve this problem. In Phase I we will fabricate membranes and assess their performance by processing a simulated purge gas stream and determining the purities of the helium and hydrogen. We will also carry out a detailed engineering feasibility and cost analysis to determine the technical viability of scaling up the process in Phase II. TDA's system will help NASA conserve valuable hydrogen and the United State's rapidly dwindling and expensive non-renewable helium resource.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA consumes vast quantities of helium to safely test rocket engines for its space programs at Stennis and Kennedy Space Centers. Currently this helium is vented to the atmosphere, representing a loss of millions of dollars worth of this very expensive, non-renewable resource. NASA annually vents around 75 million standard cubic feet (SCF) of helium with a value of more than $6M. TDA's compact helium-hydrogen recovery system has the advantage of being portable so that it can be used to capture large and small purge streams at their source. Recovered helium containing less than a few percent residual hydrogen can be recycled as a purge gas. In addition to enabling cost effective helium recovery and purification for re-use at NASA's rocket launch and test facilities at Stennis and Kennedy Space Centers, TDA's helium-hydrogen recovery system will also recover the hydrogen that is vented during helium purging and lost to boil-off during the filling and storage of LH2 in propellant systems. Conservatively around 20% of this costly LH2 is lost through boil-off during system fills and storage. Recovered ultrapure hydrogen can be re-compressed and burned as a fuel or used to generate clean electricity on-site in fuel cells.

However, uncertainties regarding the material's impact durability continue to plague the FRP composites community. To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. (ADA), Littleton, CO, in partnership with the University of Delaware's Center for Composite Materials (UD-CCM), Newark, DE, propose the development of a novel, non-catalytic, fully passive, self-healing polymer for use as a fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) matrix material If successful, the proposed technology will provide fully autonomous self-healing without the use of a catalyst. Further, while the proposed program is largely focused on demonstrating self-healing capabilities in FRP material form, the proposed technology is broadly applicable to next-generation polymer-based composites such as carbon nanotube reinforced composites (i.e., polymer nanocomposites).","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) If successful, the proposed self-healing polymer technology would greatly increase the damage tolerance of current FRP composite materials as well as future, next-generation polymer nanocomposites.

The value of the torque is significant because it indicates how far the tool is plunged into the work piece.  Proper engagement of the tool into the work piece is critical for producing reliable welds.The commercialized innovation will consist of three elements. First, a FSW tool will be developed to produce a linear relationship between the welding torque and the tool's plunge depth into the work piece. Second, the welding torque will be measured from outside the welding environment via the spindle motor current, thus eliminating the need for expensive force sensors associated with force control. Third, a closed-loop architecture will be designed and implemented to control the welding torque.Torque control of FSW can be applied by NASA to increase welding reliability with the Upper Stage of the Ares I launch vehicle. Torque control will also reduce capital investment and operations costs for NASA. The expected TRL is 4 at the beginning of the project and 5 at the end of Phase I.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Torque control of FSW can be applied to welding the Ares I launch vehicle. In particular, the long and circumferential welds where work piece variation, machine deflection and changing thermal conditions create manufacturing challenges. By applying torque control instead of force control, the welding reliability will increase. Increasing the reliability of linear and circumferential welds that can range up to approximately 30 feet in length will increase the productivity of welding operations at NASA. There would be less weld defects due to the welding controls becoming unstable and causing weld defects. The vertical and robotic welding tools at Marshall Space Flight Center would be able to apply this technology almost immediately after project completion.Along with increasing reliability, torque control will be effective at reducing operating costs associated with FSW. Operations cost would be reduced by not having to replace or repair existing force sensors.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other aerospace companies have FSW applications very similar to NASA that would benefit from torque control of FSW. As with NASA, these companies would increase the reliability of welding operations, in particular with very long linear and circumferential welds. In addition, they would experience reduced maintenance costs and the reduction in required capital investment for future endeavors with robotic FSW.Lastly, torque control of FSW could be used by numerous small businesses entering into the FSW market. This technology would provide a cost effective method for using traditional machine tools and industrial robots to perform FSW. Expensive force gauges and dynamometers would no longer be required. Potential small business users are the numerous automotive suppliers to General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Chrysler. As these automotive companies begin to manufacture vehicles using FSW, many suppliers can utilize torque control of FSW.","In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)",,Vanderbilt University,"2201 West End Ave, Nashville, TN 37235 - 7749",(615) 322-7311

The NASA Europa Jupiter System Mission environment, for example, exhibits radiation levels seven times greater than Earth's geostationary orbit. In addition to the Jovian environment, highly charged environments can also exist at geosynchronous and medium Earth orbits owing to solar winds/storms and trapped radiation belts.

The estimated specific impulse for a high efficiency magnesium Hall thruster operating off of a standard 400 V power processing unit is 5000 s. Efficiencies >50% will be possible. Although the vapor pressure of Mg is relatively low, it is believed that spacecraft interactions can be managed through the implementation of a simple plume shield.

The phase change cooling as liquid N2O is flashed from a liquid into a vapor, limits to acceptable levels the erosion of both the nozzle throat and spike, thereby enabling reusable operation and/or long burn times. The N2O used for cooling will be reintroduced into the rocket motor and used to boost performance. Because of potentially the violent exothermic decomposition of N2O, a thorough understanding of N2O behavior is crucial to developing an aerospike nozzle and hybrid rocket motor that are sufficiently safe for flight testing, where cooling the aerospike is necessary to get the burn duration required for good flight tests to yield the illusive flight test data for aerospike nozzles. Our prior work seeking to develop a fundamental understanding of the behavior of N2O when it is used in applications has answered some important questions about the behavior of N2O, yielded significant advances in designing instrumented nozzles for N2O cooling experiments, and generated important advances in making accurate temperature measurements on the coolant flowing in these nozzles. However, our work in developing and validating analytical models for predicting heat transfer coefficients in N2O-cooling applications was only partially successful due to unanticipated levels of uncertainty from a variety of sources. By addressing the sources of the above-mentioned uncertainty using a combination of nozzle design, novel construction, analytical, FEA, and CFD modeling, along with experimental validation of all models, this work will yield the refined models of N2O behavior that are necessary for the future design of safe N2O-cooled aerospike nozzles.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed work will enable the design of safe N2O-cooled hybrid rocket motors having truncated aerospike nozzles, which will allow cost effective, reusable, and less expensive rocket designs.

In addition to the business of launching satellites, there is a burgeoning interest in space tourism. Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic have teamed up to develop SpaceShipTwo specifically to pursue the space tourism market. Likewise, Benson Space Company is developing the Dream Chaser, which is a 4-passenger suborbital or 6-passenger orbital vehicle. Each of these vehicles will use a hybrid rocket motor. Under study in the U.S. is a sewage treatment process that intentionally increases the production of nitrous oxide and methane, and uses the gases to power the treatment plant. In a low-oxygen environment in the treatment plant, where N2O-producing bacteria are favored, while aerobic species die off, the N2O-producing microbes consume relatively small amounts of organic matter, which allows for an increased production of methane. The methane will be used as a fuel, and the N2O will be burned in a hybrid rocket motor, where it will decompose into pure nitrogen and gaseous oxygen, both of which are completely green from a sustainability viewpoint.

Coded SAW sensor-tags have been demonstrated by ASR&D under NNX09CE49P to be capable of providing a passive wireless interface to external sensors, including switches, thermistors, and strain gages, as well as external sensors that generate voltages. These sensor-tags consist of a SAW device with an antenna attached to one port and sensor(s) and reference impedance(s) connected to the other ports. RF signals of the correct frequency range are reflected off of the surface wave device, and their reflection characteristics are modified by changes in the impedance/voltage of the attached sensor(s). Under NNX10RA68P a set of 32 individually identifiable coded SAW temperature sensor devices that avoids the serious problems with code collision seen in conventional SAW RFID systems was developed using CDMA and TDMA. Wireless measurement confirmed the ability to selectively detect any single sensor out of the combined response of multiple sensors. The proposed effort will incorporate direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) codes into SAW tag devices also using time diversity, to produce sets of more than 100 individually identifiable coded sensor-tags. DSSS coding has been demonstrated by researchers at the University of Maine to produce sets codes with good auto- and cross-correlation properties. These sensor-tags will be tested to verify that they can be used as an interface to external pressure sensors and strain gages. This project will also evaluate the wireless reader system architectures commercially available and currently being developed at ASR&D and at other research institutions to determine what system architecture is most beneficial for operation with the codesets developed. This will form the basis of recommendations for future system development work.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Sets of the coded passive wireless sensor-tags proposed and appropriate wireless readers would enable remote monitoring of external sensors throughout NASA programs and facilities, reducing the wiring infrastructure for DFI and for vehicle/structure monitoring systems. While the proposed work will develop interface devices for use with strain gages and pressure sensors, prior work makes it clear that the results of the proposed work can be extended for use with other sensor types provided the sensor produces a change in impedance or a voltage in response to an external stimulus (or change in a measurand). Thus, sensor-tag interface devices could be used to provide wireless interfaces to numerous existing sensors. This would allow NASA to re-use existing flight qualified sensors in a wireless mode, by qualifying a wireless link device suitable for use with each class of sensors, avoiding the need to qualify new sensors for every application.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed sensor-tag interface devices will also find wide usage for distributed wireless monitoring of sensors in aerospace and other commercial applications. Monitoring of commercial airframes for aging and deterioration is a high priority for aerospace firms and for military and civilian aircraft operators. Civil infrastructure monitoring could enhance our understanding of the condition of bridges, tunnels, and pavements, with real-time detection of cracks, delamination, and other growing failure mechanisms in concrete, metal, composites, and other materials. This would provide actionable intelligence and allow effective prioritization of limited maintenance and repair resources. Other commercial applications will likely include inventorying and tracking high value industrial assets, and distributed sensing systems for environmental applications such as landfills.","Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Contact/Mechanical; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Lifetime Testing; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Structures; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)",,University of Maine,"5717 Corbett Hall, Orono, ME 04469 - 5717",(207) 581-2201

Our first aim is to provide a reliable means of localization that is independent of infrastructure, such as GPS, and compatible with requirements of missions to planetary surfaces. Simultaneously solving for the precise location of the rover as it moves while building an accurate map of the environment is an optimization problem involving internal sensing, sensing of the surrounding environment, probabilistic optimization methods, efficient data structures, and a robust implementation. Our second aim is to merge simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technologies with our existing Reliable Autonomous Surface Mobility (RASM) architecture for rover navigation. Our unique partnership brings together state-of-the-art technologies for SLAM with experience in delivering and supporting both autonomous systems and mobility platforms for NASA.Our proposed project will create a SLAM framework that is capable of accurately localizing a rover throughout long, multi-kilometer traverses of barren terrain. Our approach is compatible with limited communication and computing resources expected for missions to planetary surfaces. Our technology is based on innovative representations of evidence grids, particle-filter algorithms that operate on range data rather than explicit features, and strategies for segmenting large evidence grids into manageable pieces. In this project we will evaluate the maturity of these algorithms, developed for research programs at Carnegie Mellon, and incorporate them into our RASM architecture, thus providing portable and reliable localization for a variety of vehicle platforms and sensors. Mission constraints will vary broadly, so our SLAM components will be able to merge readings from various suites of sensors that may be found on planetary rovers.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Technical innovations from this project will have immediate application to the Lunar All-Terrain Utility Vehicle (LATUV) and will enable it to achieve its full capability as it becomes a research appliance for NASA. We also see direct applicability of this work to vehicles developed by NASA for scientific exploration, habitat construction, and landing site preparation. ProtoInnovations will seek to sustain this work by providing SLAM capability to a wide range of planetary rover vehicles and prototypes.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) We believe that our effort can be sustained by our unique capability and experience, which we believe is valuable to emerging lunar-rover activities in Canada, Japan, and India / Russia. The market for lunar-rover autonomy is not large but it is highly technical and critical to mission success. ProtoInnovations intends to continue R&D to position itself as a world leader in rover navigation software and experience.Commercially-available, high-resolution positioning systems have been maturing rapidly over the past decade and have penetrated into agricultural, mining, and defense markets. Most of these products filter GPS data with measurements from IMUs, encoders, and so on. Such products are robust to brief GPS drop-outs but are not robust to long-term GPS losses. Such losses are frequent in urban areas or in dense foliage, and should be expected indoors and when GPS signals are jammed. When GPS is lost, inertial measurements and dead-reckoning drift and the resulting localization error increases over time and distance traveled. SLAM is an ideal way of correcting these errors without the need for infrastructure. Our SLAM approach, with its computational efficiency and loose requirements on operating environment, is a feasible add-on technology for commercially available positioning systems.",Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Intelligence; Perception/Vision; Ranging/Tracking; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),,Carnegie Mellon University,"5000 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15213 - 3890",(412) 268-5421

One reason for this growth is that the access to space for small satellites has increased and is expected to expand as commercial companies complete the development of systems to deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) and ancillary payloads to LEO. This expansion of small satellite activities has already resulted in significant interest in self-contained small satellite sample return missions.

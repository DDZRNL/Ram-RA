Much of the work reported has focused on single sensor devices and systems, with little work done on dense multi-sensor systems.  The system proposed herein consists of multiple passive solid-state SAW sensors that can be interrogated remotely using RF signals, and that respond with a signal that encodes both the sensor's identity as well as measurements of temperature and pressure.  The proposed research will study several innovative aspects of SAW sensor technology, including: new piezoelectric materials which can operate over large temperature ranges; new SAW device embodiments for measurement of temperature and pressure and their wireless transmission in multi-sensor environments; transceiver design and optimization given the SAW operating parameters; and innovative packaging and antenna considerations for rugged, small devices.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The primary NASA application for the proposed sensor system would be measurement of the temperature and pressure distribution just under the outer surface of NGLT vehicles for enhancement of IVHM systems.  Due to wireless operation of the sensors, the system might also be retrofitted to the shuttle or future OSP vehicles, or be used for tire pressure monitoring.  Numerous small, lightweight sensors could be mounted under or within the thermal protective layer of the vehicle, and an internal RF interrogation system could quickly scan through the sensors, providing rapid temperature and pressure distribution information at the surface of the vehicle.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Potential commercial applications for the proposed sensor system include automotive tire pressure sensing, monitoring temperature and other parameters in motors, furnaces, and other high temperature environments, and shipping container and inventory thermal monitoring.

The ability to uniquely identify large numbers of individual sensors, combined with a hand-held interrogation system, could make this approach useful for homeland security container screening and for inventory purposes where knowing the temperature history of a set of products is significant.",,,University of Central Florida,"Office of Research, 12443 Research Parkway, Suite 207, Orlando, FL, 32826-3252",(407) 823-0138

The core engine makes extensive use of a novel self-injection, compression ignition/combustion system capable of high-speed operation on kerosene-based fuels without degradation due to variations in fuel viscosity, lubricity and cetane value.  Propulsion system safety is greatly enhanced by inherent single lever control, the employment of high flash point fuel, and the absence of fuel injection system degradation when operating on variable viscosity/lubricity Jet-A fuel having unregulated cetane values.  Competing aero-diesel developments are dependant on OEM fuel system manufactures that are not willing to sell their system intended for aviation use due to the low lubricity of Jet fuel and the high product liability of General Aviation industry.  On the contrary the preferred self-injection system does not require any specialized equipment to produce and is comparable in cost to a carburetor.  The multi-fuel combustion system is controlled by the ""Fuel deposit on the wall"" method of injection.  The controlled combustion is characterized by having modest pressure rise and virtually absent combustion noise thus eliminating the classic ""diesel knock"" and greatly improving the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) of the installation.",POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS)  - ERAST - VTOL Helicopters  - PAVE  - RAC  - GAP   - SATS  - UAV   - STOL Aircraft  - AGATE,POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Commercial/Military Applications:   - Sport Aircraft   - Airboats  - Backpack Parafoil- Outboard Motors  - Ultralights  - PWC Jet Pumps  - General Aviation - VTOL Aircraft  - Utility Blowers  - Misc.,,,"University of Nevada, Reno","Mechanical Engineering, MS312, Reno, NV, 89557-0042",(775) 785-7522

This dryer will use an energy-efficient closed air-loop Heat Pump Desiccant dryer to remove moisture from wet starting material and a Porous Membrane Condensing Heat Exchanger (PMCHX) to trap condensate. Water recovered during drying should be of good quality and available for reuse with standard processing. The process is energy efficient since enthalpy released by the condensing vapor is used to reheat the drying air. Volatile organic compounds are contained throughout the drying process. The system could incorporate a photocatalytic oxidation system to remove VOCs accumulated during drying. The key objective for the PMCHX is to extend its range of application from low-load humidity control in plant growth chambers to high-load condenser duty at up to 80?C air temperature and at temperatures varying over a 40?C range during a single drying run. Since the presence of organics in the condensate, and the predicted condenser temperatures of 5-40?C are conditions favorable to biofilm growth, PMCHX membranes will need to be configured to inhibit the formation of biofilms.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Heat Pump Dessicant drying and high-temperature Porous Membrane Condensing Heat Exchanger condensate recovery have numerous potential applications in space life support.

Diamond turning (DT) has revolutionized the fabrication of lightweight optical surfaces for defense and science applications such as forward-looking infrared radar and infrared spectrometers.  It has made this impact not only because it can accurately and rapidly fabricate diffractive, refractive and reflective optical surfaces, but because it can create reference features tied to the optical surfaces to guarantee optical alignment.  An emerging trend in optical design is the use of NRS surfaces that reduce complexity, bulk and weight.  To create these surfaces, DT machines have been modified with a low-amplitude Fast Tool Servo, a third axis or a fly-cutter.  The problem with the FTS is its limited range and the other techniques are plagued by thermal drift during long fabrication times.  The proposed Live Axis Turning (LAT) process combines evolving technologies of air bearings, linear motors, high-resolution encoders and high-speed control systems into a moving lightweight toolpost on a conventional DT machine.  The result is a more flexible machine that can increase production and reduce cost for NRS components.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) There is a growing need for breakthrough instrument designs that will reduce the volume and mass of science packages while improving performance.

We propose the innovative process of composite pattern design as a means of constructing structured-light illumination patterns that measure surface topologies with only a single image and, thereby, are appropriate for recording real-time depth video. By moving the composite pattern into the Near-Infra-Red wavelength light spectrum and coupling with real-time optical processor, we intend to establish feasibility of a real-time, low latency, ambient light resistant, and high accuracy depth video sensor for producing a depth map of a scene applicable to virtual reality interfaces that permit control of robotic systems through human gestures by way of spatial tracking of user appendages in motion absent any wearable transmitters or markers.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The composite pattern method provides a non-touch human computer interface for applications that would otherwise require VR gloves, helmets and other wearable markers. Applications include cockpit interfacing, human computer interfacing with autonomous systems and robots, visualization of large data sets, tele-collaboration, and assistive technology.  Other applications are in the area of 3-Dimesional data acquisition of surfaces. These applications include industrial inspection, surveillance, robotic object avoidance, and multi-dimensional time-motion study. In contrast to stereovision, composite pattern has active illumination, so it is independent of ambient illumination and works well with smooth featureless objects or scenes.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The development of continuous, real-time, structured-light imaging for single-sensor, depth measurement is an important contribution to dynamic 3-D imaging and tracking. There is great potential for this technology in many fields from research microscopy on live specimens to non-invasive analysis of large, dynamic systems. The proposed camera could have a major impact on persons with disabilities by permitting nontouch gestures given the inability of some individuals to don and doff wearable sensors. This proposal addresses many issues raised in a wheelchair interface including the operation of structured-light in sunlight.",,,University of Kentucky,"102 Kinkead Hall, Lexington, KY, 40506-0057",(859) 257-8288

In particular, the Stennis Space Center (SSC) would like to develop a sensor to monitor the quality of LOX in the delivery line during the testing of a rocket engine.  Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) with its relative simplicity and multi-molecule analysis can be easily employed to develop a sensor for on-line, real-time measurement. The goal of the proposed effort is to develop a SRS sensor, which is able to provide sub-millisecond sampling time for detecting nitrogen percent concentration in cryogenic propellants. During Phase I, a SRS system based on photo multiplier tube detection will be designed. The experimental parameters will be evaluated to achieve optimum response time and sensitivity. A prototype will be delivered to NASA/SSC at the end of Phase I. The study from Phase I will provide the necessary information to improve the phase II prototype design to achieve sub millisecond response time and better sensitivity. In Phase II, a prototype SRS system will be developed and tested at SSC and will be delivered to NASA/SSC for on line measurement",POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) A Raman based sensor can provide on-line and real-time measurement  of  nitrogen concentration with millisecond  response time which is needed by NASA/SSC cryogenic testing. This sensor can be used for real-time monitoring of nitrogen concentration in LOX or LH2 feed line during the SSC engine test. This sensor can be used to shutdown the LOX feed control valve when the LN2 concentration exceed a pre-determined concentration,"POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) A sensor based on Raman spectroscopy developed for this proposal can also be used to monitor the chemical composition in large chemical reactor to provide the data to optimize the efficiency of the processing plant and to control the chemical processing in the plant.  When the concentration of certain element reaches above the threshold the sensor will send the warning signal for safety operation of the plant. The laser Raman sensor can be used for quality control in pharmaceutical, chemical and food processing industries.

The primary capabilities of these products have remained largely unchanged since their initial release. In the analysis and design of modern aerospace vehicles, the deficiencies of these legacy tools are becoming increasingly clear. The linear aerodynamic methods employed by these tools are not appropriate when transonic flight regimes are considered or when other nonlinearities are present, particularly when these techniques are used to predict flight vehicle performance. Although advances in computational power and numerical techniques present an opportunity to employ higher fidelity methods, the development of new software is proceeding slowly. The effort described in this Phase I proposal describes a means by which nonlinear analytic and experimental data can be used to improve the accuracy of flight vehicle performance predictions by utilizing existing analysis tools. A procedure is presented to integrate a finite element based analysis and design tool with a nonlinear aerodynamic solver and graphical visualization system to provide improved correlation of simulated results with flight test data.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The development of a multidisciplinary analysis technique which utilizes nonlinear aerodynamics will immediately benefit many NASA research and development efforts, particularly at NASA Langley, Ames, and Dryden Research Centers where simulations are used to predict wind tunnel or flight test results. The method presented will yield a much higher correlation between predicted results and those obtained by experiment.

The often-cited plasma confinement time is directly proportional to the mirror ratio and the length, and is inversely proportional to the square root of ion energy.  This confinement law, however, ignores the role of the ambipolar (electrostatic) potential which arises as a result of the rapid escape of electrons through the mirrors due to their small mass.  This positive potential tends to accelerate the ions while slowing down the electrons until both species drift out at the same rate.  It is expected, therefore, that a larger specific impulse and larger thrust will arise in the presence of ambipolar potential but at the expense of a longer device to maintain a desired confinement time.  This proposal is aimed at a theoretical and computational investigation of the impact of the ambipolar potential on the propulsive capability of the GDM thruster. It includes the generation of parameters that will allow experimental verification of this phenomenon using the existing GDM device at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (LIMIT 150 WORDS) One NASA objective for future space transportation systems is that they be faster, safer and more reliable.

From this perspective, a hubless flywheel energy storage design is very advantageous since most of the flywheel energy is stored in its outer circumference, while the core significantly adds to the system weight. One of the problems with this design is that conventional active magnetic bearings are difficult to integrate into the overall system. We propose to utilize recently developed Null-E Magnetic Bearings instead, which appear to be better suited for the hubless topology.  Their major advantages over active magnetic bearings include inherent stability at high rotational speeds, simplicity, low cost and lack of laminated components. At the same time, Null-E bearings deliver the desired combination of high load capacity, stiffness and low rotational losses. They can be designed to operate as entirely passive systems with no electronics or external power supplies, or as partially active systems, with some supplementary electronics. A combination of different modes is also possible, e.g. an active system at low speeds and passive at high.

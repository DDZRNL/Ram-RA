Nonreciprocal components play extremely important role in laser systems and telecommunications. Currently all such components are discrete; there are no fully monolithically integrated nonreciprocal components available in the market. This work will use a novel technique, metallorganic chemical liquid deposition (MOCLD) to achieve this feat.  Phase I results have demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in fabricating doped and undoped magneto-optic films, as well as buffer layers, onto semiconductors.  Permanent magnet films were also grown with sufficient strengths to bias the magneto-optic films for fully integrated waveguide isolators. All of these materials will be optimized during initial fabrication/characterization tasks in the Phase II program. Also, prototype devices will continue to be simulated using the beam propagation method. These simulation results will allow a fast path toward fabricating prototype devices with minimal processing/testing iterations. Photonic circuitry with electric and magnetic drives and magnetophotonic crystals will also be designed and developed in this Phase II program.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) At the heart of most NASA missions is the need for high performance devices with low power and small dimension requirements.  The results of this proposal will lead to excellent photonics integrated circuits (PICs) that meet these rigorous NASA standards.  Therefore, the results will most directly apply to ?Active Optical Systems and Technology? branch of Research Topic 3: Earth Science and Physics and Astronomy.  Specifically, the photonic isolating components that emerge from this work will enable the most efficient integration of compact semiconductor lasers into Passive Remote Sensing Detector Systems.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The proposed materials and devices provide a complete solution to integrated optical isolator applications in both NASA and commercial fiber optic communication systems. These devices will extend laser lifetimes without bulky components and normal alignment issues. The new integrated devices promise substantial reduction in cost and size, as well as improvement in performance.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the success will lead to practical devices for not only space applications, but also for applications in the military and commercial sectors.",,03-Earth Science and Physics and Astronomy,University of Minnesota,"200 Oak Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN , 55455 -2070",(612 ) 624 -5599

APS will dynamically monitor microsatellite power resources and then, by adaptively modifying the algorithmic solution applied by spacecraft systems, it will intelligently and autonomously schedule and distribute available power resources to the processing-intensive payloads and other spacecraft subsystems.  Due to existing power management paradigms, small spacecraft are prohibited from hosting advanced processing-intensive payloads.  However, to maintain cost-effective and useful access to space, the future of small spacecraft will be to accomplish more intensive onboard processing.  APS will improve the orbital power efficiency of small spacecraft, especially those with processing-intensive payloads, by as much as 10% for an investment measured in hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The overarching goal of proposed Phase II effort is to demonstrate and characterize the performance that can be achieved through implementation of the APS technology in future small satellite systems.  The Phase II effort is focused on integration and testing of the APS technology on a hardware testbed that is representative of a spacecraft platform.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Numerous NASA missions can benefit from the APS technology, particularly those with processing-intensive payloads.  Sun-Earth Connection missions, with severely limited solar power collection and battery power/capacity to support the mission in its highly elliptical orbit, are perfect candidates for APS.  For interferometric spacecraft constellations using distributed data collection, APS would enable onboard data processing, reducing the volume of transmitted data.  Planetary missions with instruments deployed on a planet?s surface might have a limited opportunity to collect solar power but demanding data processing requirements.  APS would enable these missions to be accomplished in a smaller, more efficient spacecraft.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Any systems with demanding, power-hungry processing requirements are prime candidates for APS.  Theater-specific applications such as SAR, hyperspectral imaging, geo-location, and ELINT result in significant quantities of data.  Onboard data processing, often a necessity for these missions, would be enabled by APS.  UAVs, becoming more prevalent as an economical and timely method for military operations, homeland security, and SIGINT, suffer the same power demand problems as microsatellites.  Here, APS would provide the power management necessary to adaptively process gathered data into a final product.

The innovative sensor system uses an amplified Chirped White Pulse Emitter (CWPE) to generate high-power wavelength-agile light for probing rocket plumes.  It also uses a high-power wavelength-multiplexed differential absorption scheme for probing LOX lines.  The plume sensor provides planar images of gas temperature and species concentrations.  Furthermore, these measurements will be continuous (one planar measurement every 62 ?Ys) and therefore useful for monitoring the evolution of rocket plume properties.  The LOX portion of the Phase II system will be capable of accurate (better than 0.1% error) measurements of LOX concentration in cryogenic fluids with 3 ?Ys time response.  The LOX sensor may also be extended to enable determination of LOX flow rates.  Phase II will begin with a focus on additional testing of the Phase I sensors.  The sensors will then be refined, tested extensively in a variety of rocket exhaust plumes and in a LOX delivery system, and assembled into a portable, user-friendly package for delivery to NASA/SSC.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) By the conclusion of Phase II, a single WORPS system is expected to cost less than $5000 and have the capability to monitor multiple gas or liquid properties with time response of 1 ?Ys.

Potential NASA applications include use for propulsion system monitoring in testing facilities at NASA/SSC, NASA/MSFC, NASA/GRC, NASA/ARC, and NASA/KSC.  Because the proposed WORPS system technology is lightweight and has only a few key components, it could potentially find use as a diagnostic tool for on-orbit microgravity combustion, gas, and fluid experiments aboard the Shuttle and ISS.  Real-time, in-flight monitoring of the SSME, and other flight units, for propulsion system health represents another applications for the mature WORPS system.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) All industries requiring non-invasive sensing of gas or liquid properties with fast-time response will benefit from the technology.

A highly stable low power seed laser plays a crucial role in these systems by keeping the high power, Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser at a fixed wavelength and single mode.  In addition, the seed laser reduces shot-to-shot intensity fluctuations due to mode beating in the YAG laser, which cause damage to internal optics and reduce the laser?s lifetime.  Current seed lasers are large, expensive, and suffer under vibration and field use.  The proposed miniature seed laser combines optical Bragg waveguide structures and new semiconductor laser technology to create a narrow linewidth laser at the precise wavelength.  The entire temperature-stabilized seed laser will be packaged in a robust one-inch-long fiber coupled housing for ultra-stable single frequency output in the face of external vibration and temperature fluctuations.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) NASA employs high power, Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser transmitters for high resolution topographical mapping, remote sensing of atmospheric winds, and profiling of atmospheric molecules and aerosols, that rely on being injection seeded with a stable, low power, cw laser.  Unseeded Nd:YAG lasers exhibit multi-mode behavior, wavering frequency, and a greatly reduced lifetime.  The size, reliability, and durability of this laser will make it ideal for injection locking airborne and space-based high power Nd:YAG lasers.  Other lower power NASA lidar efforts, such as wind lidar techniques and other atmospheric lidars, also need absolute single frequency operation with very high short term frequency stability.  The proposed seed laser design will prosper for these applications due to its small size, high efficiency, low thermal mass, and precise thermal control to achieve ultra-stable output.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) One important aspect of the proposed Bragg-stabilized seed laser is that the approach will work equally well not just at 1064 nm but at any wavelength within the range of common laser diodes (i.e. throughout the visible and IR).  In contrast, comparable stable narrow linewidth lasers currently available exist only at discrete wavelengths (1064 nm and 1319 nm).  This capability will benefit applications in the military, sensing and environmental monitoring, and basic research.

The product under development is a small pilot-mounted device which monitors physiological reactions, such as blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and brain activity as well as the vibration environment in which the pilot is operating.  Using these inputs as well as knowledge of the pilot?s state before coming on duty, the device will monitor the human fatigue state of the pilot.  Before a pilot?s fatigue state reaches a pre-determined threshold the pilot and/or mission planner is alerted.  Such a device allows monitoring of the fatigue state of any decision maker who is subject to stress and provides a means of alleviating fatigue-induced human error.  Development of the fatigue meter is highly dependent on simulation of the device in the flexible aircraft, such as in the STARS software package.  With a view to reducing the development time, advanced computational efficiency methods shall be investigated by the RI and implemented in the design cycle by the SBC.  The RI shall investigate structural analysis and control using piezoelectric and piezoceramic sensors and actuators relevant to the pilot?s environmental input to the fatigue meter.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) Since the various divisions of NASA are involved in both air vehicle modifications and new vehicle development, evaluation and testing, it is anticipated that considerable consultancy and hardware sales would be with NASA.

STARS is the most comprehensive multidisciplinary finite element-based software for design and analysis and as a simulation tool in flight test environment. STARS strength is in its capability to solve combined CFD, Structural, thermal and control problems. In this phase enhancements in capabilities in finite element-based computer programs with application to STARS are proposed. Enhancement of STARS capabilities are achieved through a complete and thorough evaluation of its structural FE compatibility and accuracy using NASTRAN and IDEAS for comparison; development of translator codes to seamlessly link NASTRAN preprocessor PATRAN with STARS; evaluation and enhancement of the current STARS-NASTRAN translator, NSTARS. Validations and enhancements in capabilities in finite element-based CFD with application to STARS are also proposed. CFDSOL module validation for boundary layer flow in variety of cases will be conducted. Methods for CFD-based stability and control derivative extraction will be developed and tested. Verification of newly developed STARS CFD-based ASE simulation capabilities will be conducted.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) High-performance flight vehicles that are currently being designed have unprecedented levels of interactions of structures, aerodynamics, propulsion, and flight controls.

(TUI) and the Standford University Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL), propose to develop and fly a very low cost nanosatellite experiment that will demonstrate the deployment of a lightweight multiline tether on orbit and obtain data on its survivability in the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environment.  In the Phase I effort, we designed an experiment in which three CubeSats will deploy a 1-kilometer long Hoytether in space,  and the middle CubeSat will slowly crawl along the tether, inspecting it for damage.  We successfully prototyped and tested key components for this experiment, including a separation/ejection mechanism and avionics for communications, command, and data handling.  During the Phase I we also secured $89K in additional, non-SBIR funding that is supporting the development of the crawler and inspector subsystems.  In the Phase II effort, we will build and fly the CubeSat-based MAST experiment.  The mission will obtain data on tether survivability and tether dynamics that are crucial to the design of all future tether missions.","POTENTIAL NASA APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The propellantless nature of tether propulsion will result in highly capable small spacecraft for future Earth science missions that can perform many more orbital maneuvers during their lifetimes than could be achieved with a propellant-limited propulsion. This will enable microsatellites deployed from the Shuttle SHELS payload adapter to raise their orbits up to 2,000 km, allowing longer-duration missions, while maintaining high payload fractions.  Tethers will also make feasible formation flying missions, such for SAR and long-baseline interferometry studies, which require large total delta-Vs that are not feasible with propulsion systems that require propellant. Additionally, the technologies developed and demonstrated in the proposed SBIR will be scalable to much larger applications, such as orbital maintenance of the International Space Station or a momentum exchange tether facility that can reduce the cost of lunar, Mars, and deep-space missions.","POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 150 WORDS) The Phase II effort will demonstrate a space-survivable tether structure that will enable tethers to be used for a wide range of long-duration space missions. The primary advantage of space tethers relative to competing technologies is that they can provide microsatellites with propulsion for orbit raising, station-keeping, and inclination changes with zero propellant expenditure, and can thus provide large total delta-Vs with very low mass requirements.  Other tether applications include formation flying and modification of the radiation belts. During the Phase I effort, we were awarded three non-SBIR/STTR contracts from DARPA and NASA worth over $1,115,000 to develop tether technologies and applications.  Although tether propulsion technologies will be developed specifically for the growing microsatellite market as part of this experiment, the technologies are easily scalable to application on larger spacecraft such as the next generation of telecommunications satellite constellations.",,05-Space Propulsion,Stanford University SSDL,"469 Lomita Mall, Stanford University, Stanford, CA , 94305 -4035",(650 ) 723 -8651

The availability of fast and inexpensive computers along with higher-fidelity design models has provided the opportunity to optimize aeroelastic behavior and consider uncertainty during the conceptual design phase.  However, computational time becomes prohibitive in conceptual airframe development due to the many iterations that must be performed to optimize weight and/or lift/drag ratios, while ensuring that aeroelastic flutter is avoided, particularly when uncertainty effects are included.  Automated Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) programs have attempted to address this shortcoming, but recent attempts have had only limited success, due to problems with slow convergence and local minima and due to the computational expense of performing uncertainty analysis. To provide a step improvement, MSI is developing an automated, robust and reliable multidisciplinary optimization method which uses a stochastic approach to avoid local minima, and a compromise response surface method to determine system performance and constraint probability density functions due to both controllable (design variables, operating conditions) and uncontrollable (material defects, wind gusts) random effects.

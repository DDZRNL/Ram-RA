Since water is safe to use and an excellent coolant (other than its high freeze point and volumetric expansion during freeze), a water coolant loop often is used to transport heat to or from the spacecraft via heat exchangers to the heat sink systems that reject heat to space. Some of the heat exchangers would freeze, particularly the ones transporting heat to a flash evaporator or cold radiators exposed to deep space, if not for system controls to prevent it. Yet, the principle of allowing a heat exchanger to freeze can be utilized to increase the turn-down of the heat rejection rate (e.g. to vary the heat rejection from radiators). Unfortunately, the expansion during the phase change of water to ice may damage and ultimately fail the heat exchanger if it is not designed to withstand this event. TDA Research, Inc. has been developing water/ice phase change heat exchangers for several years, since the thermal control system can be simpler (a secondary loop between the coolant water loop and the heat sink systems may no longer be needed) and smaller in size while reducing the use of consumables. Therefore, TDA Research and the University of Colorado propose a lightweight and freeze tolerant water/ice heat exchanger that can passively regulate the heat rejection rate from the water coolant loop to the heat sink systems. The heat exchanger will have no moving parts and thus will be extremely reliable. In Phase I, we will design and build a freeze tolerant water/ice heat exchanger without resorting to a large heavy-walled structure and then subject it to hundreds of freeze/thaw cycles to verify its integrity.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)A water coolant loop is usually part of the thermal control system for manned spacecraft. The water loop then interfaces with a Freon or ammonia loop to reject heat to the heat sink systems. A simpler approach would be to design the water coolant heat exchangers to be freeze tolerant and utilize the phase change of water to ice as part of the thermal control system. This would eliminate the need for a second heavier fluid loop using Freon or ammonia (heavier because these fluids are poorer heat transfer media). Further, a water/ice heat exchanger can use the buildup of ice to self-regulate heat transport from the spacecraft to space. This approach to thermal control should result in a safer and more reliable system. In spacesuits, a freeze tolerant heat exchanger/radiator system will dramatically reduce (by roughly 75%) the single largest consumable during EVA. A spacesuit radiator can replace the PLSS covering with very little net increase in weight and yet will cut the amount of water needed to cool the astronaut during an EVA by up to 6 lbs. This will represent a significant cost savings to future missions and especially in Lunar and Mars EVA missions where the reduction in water loss is not merely nice, it is essential.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The largest and nearest term commercial applications are the use of freeze tolerant tubing on earth. These earth-based applications include sprinkler systems and potable water supply in homes and commercial buildings. This market is potentially very large and virtually un-tapped because of the lack of a viable freeze tolerant tube. The Insurance Institute for Property Loss Reduction, says frozen pipes have cost the insurance companies in the USA $4.2 billion in damage to insured homes and buildings over the past decade (i.e., about $400,000,000 per year). The savings in insurance rates alone could more than offset the cost to the user, who would have the added benefit of not having valuables destroyed by water damage and their lives disturbed during repairs of the water damage.",Heat Exchange;; Lifetime Testing;; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation);; Passive Systems,,University of Colorado at Boulder,"572 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 - 0572",(303) 492-7110

We will employ QDs to enhance the middle cell absorption in a InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs metamorphic IMM cell. Detailed balance calculations indicate that the triple junction efficiency can be increased to ~42% by reducing the bandgap of the middle cell to ~1.2 eV. The combination of the QD technology with multi-junction ELO technology will be exploited in two ways: i) ELO GaAs cells with QD can be grown into full triple-junction cells and ii) back-surface reflectors on the ELO cells will be used to improve absorption by routing IR light for a second pass through the QD subcell.

A multi-robot system offers more efficient execution of mission tasks, such as exploration and mapping. The robotic team can re-configure in novel ways to extend range, increase mapping fidelity, or maintain a communication link. Innovative robot configurations will be developed to overcome the challenges of the subsurface environment. These challenges include power in the dark, communication to Earth, and mobility in rocky terrain. The robot team will implement state-of-art software developed at CMU to enable navigation of rough terrain, autonomous collaboration among large multi-robot groups, and sensing and navigation.

The platform developed will be broadly applicable to similar explorations of rough and/or subsurface planetary environments, including caves, craters, cliffs, or rock fields. Additionally, low-cost robotic team members are configured to exploit operation only in the shelter of subsurface environments without the stringent requirements for survival of radiation and thermal variations at the surface; this is applicable as a strategy to reduce the cost of multi-robot mission implementations.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Multi-robot operations for mapping in a subsurface void are broadly applicable to numerous terrestrial applications.

A key challenge in using robots to support human exploration is orienting remote personnel about robot operations as latency and communication constraints make real-time monitoring impractical. Communication bandwidth will be limited, making it essential to downlink important information early. Periods with no communication will require ground operations to catch up quickly when communication resumes. Consequently ground operators can no longer rely on eyes-on monitoring to orient them about robot performance and progress on mission objectives. Summary measures are needed to identify what progress the robot has made and, when progress is impeded, to indicate what went wrong. Trending measures also are needed that determine how well robotic assets are being utilized and identify opportunities to improve robot productivity. TRACLabs and Brigham Young University propose to develop software for anytime summarization that orients remote personnel quickly about rover operations performed without continuous, high bandwidth communication. An anytime summary will characterize progress on robot operations using whatever data has been downlinked when the summary request is made. It will compute performance measures that give an overview of robot mission success and the efficiency and effectiveness of robot operations, and will provide a launch point for interactive exploration of performance data. Because the quality of an anytime summary is affected by the latency in data availability for ground processing, we will investigate what summary information should be pre-computed by the robot, and the preferred order in which information should be downlinked. During Phase I we will design and prototype software for anytime summarization. We will evaluate this design for use in rover operations using NASA IRG robots. Phase I will produce a design for implementation in Phase II.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Anytime summarization supports crew-centered operations by assisting astronauts in understanding robot performance without eyes-on supervision. These summaries also help remote controllers come up to speed quickly when they cannot observe operations directly due to communication constraints. The proposed project will develop and evaluate quantifiable metrics for robot performance that can be applied at different levels of robot autonomy (NASA Roadmap TA4). The technology for anytime summarization has direct application in NASA analogue field tests with intelligent rovers. One such test is rover exploration of a lava tube as a terrestrial analog for Mars subsurface exploration. Such subsurface operations will result in periods where the rover is out of communication. The proposed software will provide key performance indicators and interactive data exploration to quickly orient personnel once the rover is back in communication. The proposed metrics for data coverage and quality should help science teams find the best data collected by intelligent rovers, such as the Haughton Mars Project field tests. The strategies developed for providing the summaries when access to data is delayed should be applicable for field tests investigating time-delayed operations, such as Desert RATS.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The Department of Defense has increasingly relied on remotely operated robots and unmanned drones for hazardous missions, such as disarming improvised explosive devices or performing aerial surveillance. The software for anytime summarization supports remote situation awareness of such operations. In fact the measures of data quality and coverage were originally developed for video collected by UAV. In the private sector, remote monitoring of drilling operations has much in common with remote space operations. Drilling operations are hazardous, making remote operations desirable. Monitoring for key performance indicators is needed to ensure safety and to make operations more cost effective.

Current surface materials ignore or take first-order approaches to complicated spectral behavior, leading to sub-optimal properties. The sensitivity of material properties to microscale surface structuring creates a design challenge that has precluded this technology development, however the availability of high-performance computing hardware combined with sophisticated optimization algorithms now permits the engineering of such materials. PC Krause and Associates, Inc. (PCKA) and The University of Texas (UT) will target two candidate applications with high potential for environmental and commercial impact: variable emissivity materials, and reduced emissivity glass. Both of these target applications offers independent paths to energy efficiency, along with clear routes to commercialization. Variable emissivity materials will directly reduce energy costs in diurnal climates. Likewise, the reduction of infrared emission from glass windows would address one of the costliest thermal losses in buildings of all sizes.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Materials engineered for intelligent radiative behavior will directly affect the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities and campuses. The sustainability of NASA facilities will be improved by the installation of window glass and variable emissivity building materials developed as a result of the proposed work. The ability to design passive variable emissivity materials also has direct application in spacecraft thermal management, where thermal radiation can represent the only mode of heat transfer to and from the craft.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The target applications focus primarily on materials that will reduce HVAC requirements in homes and buildings. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that approximately 70% of the electricity generated in the US is through fossil fuel combustion, which in turn accounts for approximately 40% of emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. The potential to reduce this reliance represents a large reduction in costs associated with heating and air conditioning, but also a reduction in environmental pollutants.

This method will provide more realistic launch environments for testing launch payloads. By providing a more realistic test environment, combined environment testing has the potential to reduce cost, save time, reducing risk and increase performance. Launch vibration data for a Terrior-Orion two-stage suborbital sounding rocket was used as a basis for analysis. The data presents a typical launch load environment in that two main loads exist: 1) sustained-g load from acceleration of the rocket, and 2) random vibration and shock loads. The current fixed-table vibration test devices are incapable of simulating both of these loads at the same time. Accordingly, the current test methodologies typically overstress the payload to ensure that the system survives the launch loads.

NASA's Stennis Space Center is one of the largest users of hydrogen, with the LH2 used as a fuel for cryogenic rocket engine testing. Other NASA centers including Kennedy Space Center, which utilizes hydrogen to support space shuttle launches, and many industrial locations also use significant amounts of hydrogen. Unfortunately extremely large amounts of hydrogen are lost during transfers and test operations due to boil-off resulting from heat transferred into the equipment, or by other means. Additionally, through test operations, hydrogen and helium become mixed and require separation to regain their value. This gaseous hydrogen is typically flared as a safety measure with little to no economic value or energy efficiency realized from the process. No economical means exists to safely capture, process and store, and simultaneously extract valuable energy, the large amounts of gaseous hydrogen released during NASA test operations, or in industrial applications where cryogenic hydrogen is used. The technologies developed to capture and clean the hydrogen must be cost effective and able to perform the recycling process in an in-situ rocket engine test area environment, and must comply with all safety and quality standards for this environment. Because cryogenic hydrogen is very pure, its recycle and recovery as a compressed gas can result in a valuable commodity and can provide the basis of a power generation system that conserves facility energy.This STTR project develops a Hydrogen-Based Energy Conservation System (HECS) that brings in gaseous hydrogen released from cryogenic storage or transfer or mixed hydrogen, helium stream from test operations, purifies the hydrogen and alternately electrochemically compresses it to commercial storage pressures (up to 6,000 psi) and reuses the hydrogen in a reaction with air to efficiently produce electricity.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The Hydrogen-Based Energy Conservation System (HECS) being developed as part of this STTR can be utilized to recover hydrogen from mixed gas streams resulting from rocket test operations and can reduce facility energy demand by efficiently generating electricity with this hydrogen.

This program, by utilizing a demonstrably capable team with a deep history in the manufacture, testing, and analysis of C/C materials, will address this need by developing a Lyocell C/C composite system aimed at the need for a composite J2X nozzle extension. The proposed Lyocell based system will have the advantages of being thermally compatible with, specifically, the TEG manifold of the J2X and will have a domestic supply chain. This technology has the capability to save hundreds of pounds of weight over the current (and less capable) metal based nozzle extension.

Also, the possibility of launching ""constellations"" of them offers unique capabilities for low-cost experimentation, sensing and communications in space. In comparison to larger spacecraft, their development time and costs have reduced and their launch costs are low. As a result several agencies have recently launched nanosats to test their ability to perform different missions. Unfortunately, none of these nanosats have had onboard propulsion systems, which would provide greater flexibility to position the satellite throughout the mission. There are several promising thruster concepts for nanosats which could provide attitude control and orbital transfer maneuvers (uN to mN thrust levels, respectively). Of these, the colloid thruster is most attractive since it is highly efficient even when scaled down to the micro scale. However, further development is still needed to meet the power, weight and volume constraints for fitment within a nanosat. Therefore, TDA Research, Inc. and the University of Colorado-Boulder propose to develop a solid-fueled micro colloid thruster. In Phase I we will melt a solid salt and supply it to the micro volcano emitter that will be used in Taylor cone experiments to determine its operating characteristics and evaluate its overall performance.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)This project will develop a solid-propellant micro colloid thruster for use in micro/nanosats, especially those based on the standard 1U CubeSAT configuration. None of the nanosats launched so far have had onboard propulsion, even though it would have been useful for attitude control and to keep the nanosat on a specific flight path. For this reason, the micro colloid thruster system to be developed by TDA will greatly increase nanosat performance and especially, the functionality of constellations of nanosats where precise positioning to one another is extremely important. We will utilize our technical results and Aerojet's thruster manufacturing model to support their marketing of our micro colloid thruster to NASA and other organizations currently developing nanosat systems.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Agencies other than NASA have also been exploring the use of nanosats. For example, the Army Space and Missile Defense Command - Operational Nanosatellite Effect (SMDC-ONE) nanosats were recently launched into Low Earth Orbit and then used to transmit data from one ground station to another throughout the 35 day mission. However, the SMDC-ONE nanosats use permanent magnets for passive attitude control and therefore tumble as they orbit the earth, which compromises signal quality. The nanosats also have no capability to maintain orbit or transfer to a new orbit, which limits their mission duration to weeks rather than months or years if they are used in low earth orbits. Therefore, a near-term product improvement will be to replace the magnets with an active micro thruster system such as the micro colloid thruster proposed herein.",Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices;; Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller,,University of Colorado at Boulder,"572 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 - 0572",(303) 492-7110

Smart lighting adds an occupancy sensor, photosensor, controller, and dimming unit to a light source and has been shown to save up to 50% of the energy required to power traditional lighting in existing buildings and up to 35% in new construction. Our novel system has the potential to further increase energy savings and enable new functionality never before incorporated into a light fixture. Our concept turns a commonly available low cost digital camera into an imaging photosensor using calibration techniques developed for NASA and the remote sensing industry. Our concept also takes advantage of the current mobile device technology boom by using mobile devices to both monitor and process control software within the smart light. Monitoring natural light that may be present, due to a window or skylight is key to our smart light, as our system spatially and temporally adjusts the light it produces when natural light conditions change a sustainable energy concept known as daylight harvesting. While we will initially work with white light LEDs, our concept accommodates multi-color LEDs that mix to generate white light. Our smart light will therefore be able to spectrally match the natural light found within a room by controlling each color LED separately. Tailoring light spectrums affects biochemical processes and has been shown to improve sleep patterns and academic attention. By working with mobile devices we can reduce privacy concerns and process imagery within the light sensor without recording or transmitting information. It may be desirable however to add that capability as it would enable a host of other safety functions such as general security, and fire detection.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)After a successful Phase II project, Innovative Imaging and Research will be in a position to provide this energy-efficient smart light technology to NASA and other Federal government agencies concerned with providing quality lighting while lowering energy consumption. United States Executive Order 13423, issued in January 2007, mandates that federal buildings reduce their energy use by 3 percent per year, so that they attain a 30 percent reduction in energy use by the year 2015. To enter this market, we will work to establish business relationships with commercial entities, such as Cisco Systems, that provide energy management solutions to Federal government customers. We also plan to approach NASA field office Center Operations offices directly to offer near-term consultation services to identify lighting solutions with the greatest energy saving potential. In general these will be NASA office and laboratory environments with partial solar illumination, that take advantage of the daylight harvesting feature of our smart light concept, and locations within NASA facilities that are intermittently populated such as stairwells and bathrooms, that take advantage of the occupancy sensing technology within our smart light concept. We also anticipate large payoff for NASA adopting this technology in areas that would benefit from security monitoring and fire protection monitoring, additional features that our smart light system will provide.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)After a successful Phase II project, Innovative Imaging and Research will be in a position to provide this energy-efficient smart light technology to non-NASA commercial entities that are interested with providing quality lighting while lowering energy consumption. We believe our technology will have significant appeal within the education sector. Throughout the country more and more school districts are incorporating ""green school"" concepts. The Green Schools Initiative incorporates a 4-pillared framework that includes energy efficiency and using recourses sustainably. We plan to engage with these programs and initiatives to showcase our unique technology, which is highly applicable to educational environments. Our smart light technology not only reduces the overall amount of energy consumed through efficient light harvesting-producing light only when and where it is needed, but is also capable of tailoring the spectrum of the light it produces to affect natural biorhythms, which has been shown to improve academic attention. Other potential markets include libraries, museums and other public places that would benefit from security monitoring and fire protection monitoring, additional features that our smart light system will provide. We believe that this technology will initially be too expensive for general household consumers, but as markets expand and LED and other component prices continue to decrease, this technology can be marketed to the general public.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems);; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors);; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors);; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors);; Data Processing;; Detectors (see also Sensors);; Radiometric;; Visible",,The University of Southern Mississippi,"118 College Drive #5157, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 - 0001",(601) 266-4119

Ideally, a robot should be capable of autonomously exploring and interacting within an unknown environment without relying on human input or suboptimal sensors. Behaviors such as exploration of unknown environments, memorizing locations of obstacles or objects, building and updating a representation of the environment, and returning to a safe location, are all tasks that constitute typical activities efficiently performed by animals on a daily basis. Phase I of this proposal will focus on design of an adaptive robotic multi-component neural system that captures the behavior of several brain areas responsible for perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and motor behaviors. This system makes use of passive, potentially unreliable sensors (analogous to animal visual and vestibular systems) to learn while navigating unknown environments as well as build usable and correctable representations of these environments without requiring a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). In Phase I, Neurala and the Boston University Neuromorphics Lab, will construct a virtual robot, or animat, to be developed and tested in an extraterrestrial virtual environment. The animat will use passive sensors to perform a spatial exploration task. The animat will start exploring from a recharging base, autonomously plan where to go based on past exploration and its current motivation, develop and correct an internal map of the environment with the locations of obstacles, select the shortest path of return to its recharging base before battery depletion, then extract the resulting explored map into a human-readable format. In Phase II Neurala will enhance and translate the model to low-power neuromorphic hardware and collaborate with iRobot to test the model in a robotics platform.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Technology developed in this project will have a transformative impact on space exploration, and is directly relevant in supporting the key attributes of autonomy to support NASA missions, stated in the OCT roadmap for Robotics, Tele-Robotics and Autonomous Systems (TA04) as, ""the ability for complex decision making, including autonomous mission execution and planning, the ability to self-adapt as the environment in which the system is operating changes, and the ability to understand system state and react accordingly."" This work addresses two space technology grand challenges which aim to enable transformational space exploration and scientific discovery: all access mobility and surviving extreme space environments. Development of a biologically-inspired, robust, low-power, multi-component brain system able to perform self-localization and mapping will enable robots to autonomously navigate novel terrains without the need of GNSS. By including the ability to learn about an environment as it explores, robotic agents will be able to autonomously negotiate novel terrains and send relevant, intelligently preprocessed information back to a human controller. Lastly, incorporating high-level decision making and conflict resolution will allow the robot to decide between exploration of its environment and returning to home base for a battery recharge.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)One of the fundamental challenges of modern robotics is to build autonomous systems that are increasingly able to explore their environment and act upon choices in an intelligent way.

Currently, industry and academic solutions of the SLAM problem rely on accuracy of expensive sensors that are highly sensitive to noise and the complexity of real-world environments. These solutions are suboptimal since they require expensive, precise, and power-hungry sensors. The technology proposed herein mimics an animal's ability to solve the SLAM problem with noisy sensors and without the need of GNSS.

However, the feedback for precise control of the stir zone temperature, and hence the process parameters to sustain that temperature within a narrow range, does not currently exist on the TSW machine at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). At present, the current state of the art for the selection of process parameters for both TSWing and C-FSWing parameters is highly empirical and by nature is based on phenomenological knowledge. In response to this need, Keystone is proposing this Phase I SBIR project to demonstrate the feasibility of closed-loop control of the TSW process and to enable the establishment of a theoretically derived processing map to accelerate process understanding and selection of parameters for a given material and pin tool design. The close-loop control system will enable sustainment of a steady-state temperature at the stir rod as a function of spindle RPM and the travel velocity for a given z-axis loading and stir rod design.

For large-body active debris removal (ADR), active technologies are required to safely and efficiently stabilize and capture the target debris. The interactions of these complex electromechanical systems (eg. imaging systems, LIDAR, robotic arms and grippers, etc) and control algorithms pose challenges best addressed by hardware-in-the-loop testing. Given the risks inherent in non-cooperative spacecraft proximity operations, and the firm requirement that ADR missions do not themselves produce additional debris, realistic ground-based testing is required for risk reduction. Testing space operations in ground-based facilities is notoriously difficult and limited. Our proposed approach significantly increases the capability and fidelity of such testing operations and elevates the chance of a successful ADR mission. We propose a combination of robotic technologies to allow for a large range of relative motion simulation with accurate contact dynamics. First, the target debris object is suspended from a thin rod and spun up to a desired rotational speed. The suspension point is actively controlled to remove the periodic pendulum effect while still allowing free motion from contact, and a universal joint permits free rotational motion. Second, the chaser spacecraft is mounted atop HOMER, an omnidirectional robot capable of unlimited planar motion and limited-range out-of-plane motion. HOMER was designed and built by Texas A&M to emulate the 6-DOF relative-motion trajectories common in spacecraft proximity operations. Along with careful attention paid to the design of mock-targets, these two systems will allow for large-scale motion with accurate contact dynamics for high-fidelity ADR testing.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Realistic ground-based testing of spacecraft proximity operations provides significant risk reduction for any active debris removal mission.

We will develop a bioleaching column for this simulant to purify metals for consumable production in space. We will characterize known biomining organisms to leach this simulant. Finally we will study the biochemical processes taking place in the leaching of the regolith to be able to improve the metabolism of these organisms in the future.In addition, will produce a database of organisms involved in biomining on Earth and the geologies and substrates that they have been found on. This database can be used as a tool to find undersampled mine sites that may contain novel organisms suitable for biomining in space.We then plan to develop a conceptual bioreactor which is designed to extract metals from regolith in space. We will perform a trade study of the mass, productivity, cost and energy requirements of such a bioreactor.Later phases of the research will involve characterization of the important enzymes involved in biomining in key organisms, adding to the limited existing knowledge of these pathways and leading to creation of a synthetic biological system for efficiently engineering them, which we will use to optimize these organisms for extracting relevant substrates in relevant space-settlement-like conditions.

This project will also address NASA goals of preparing for human exploration of Mars by designing and implementing a human mission with acceptable cost, risk and performance. Although this phase 1 STTR starts on moon simulants, Mars simulants are proposed as part of the intended phase 2 of our project. Similarly to moon experiments, Martian studies could aid in producing a bioreactor that makes effective use of martian resources, increasing the level of self sufficiency of Mars operations, which will be even more critical as the distance to Mars is far greater than any previously-attempted manned space mission.

Waste-water treatment system on board the ISS is one such system that has lifetime/durability limitations and would benefit from improvements. Therefore, in this Phase II STTR program Faraday will continue the technology development efforts of the Phase I by: (1) leveraging existing knowledge in the combined expertise of Faraday and UPR for device design and testing under zero gravity conditions; (2) exploring the bacteria for urea bioreactor and electrocatalyst for ammonia reactor tailored for zero gravity conditions of our subcontractor UPR, (3) optimizing the electrocatalytic efficiency and waste water treatment rate with on-board water simulates, (4) validating performance under zero gravity conditions; and (5) designing and building a demonstration-scale bio-electrochemical reactor unit capable of meeting NASA required specifications . This evaluation will enable TRL enhancement and demonstrate a potential path forward for Phase II scale-up and assessment of the bio-electrochemical system in zero-gravity environments. This technology has the potential to be an integral part of long term life support on NASA’s manned space missions.","The proposed technology will be used to treat waste-water onboard the ISS to enable improved durability and efficient reduction of contaminants that cause membrane fouling or performance degradation. We anticipate delivery of prototype units to NASA in Phase III for additional longer-term testing, including more extensive zero-gravity testing or experimentation onboard ISS. Once validation is complete and TRL 9 has been achieved, the bio-electrochemical units may be delivered to ISS via entities such as SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Upon successful implementation at ISS, this technology could be combined within the next generation ECLSS architectures and utilized on future man missions to Mars.","The primary customer is NASA, but humanitarian initiative to improve water utilization and recovery could be an invaluable to the world’s population. Some potential installation/sales targets include naval warships and military field hospitals. In 2015 United Nations reported that more than 40% of global population is affected by water scarcity and this number continues to increase. For this reason, water recovery from waste water is essential to human race. The proposed innovation thus has the potential to be useful in regions where water is scarce commodity or water recovery would be invaluable.

However, these missions impose significant operational demands on ground tracking resources and mission operators alike, by adding to the population of space vehicles tracked and by increasing the volume and frequency of space communication contacts. Moving certain functions from the ground to the spacecraft can provide significant benefits for DSM operations, particularly for missions in Low Earth Orbit which can navigate using the Global Positioning System. The proposed innovation represents a breakthrough in this concept.The PI of this proposal has developed and provided a proof-of-concept demonstration of a linearized solution to Lambert’s problem, enabling determination of a satellite’s orbit based on two observations of its location or constructing transfer orbits to change a satellite’s position. This linearized function may be transferred to the spacecraft itself, which could be used to automate DSM configuration updates and maintenance via a single spacecraft communication with the ground and further inter-satellite communication.NASA has been advancing its Core Flight System to further the rapid development and integration of new applications to a common flight software system. In combination with cFS, an onboard software engine capable of employing a linearized solution of Lambert’s problem will yield a powerful and enabling application for a wide variety of missions using distributed spacecraft arrangements. Advanced Space is developing an open source, embedded software application for onboard maneuver planning and relative orbit determination that is compatible with Core Flight System and that enables DSMs to operate with increased autonomy.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Developing advanced distributed spacecraft capabilities will strengthen NASA’s ability to investigate and understand the complex phenomena in astrophysics, heliophysics, Earth science, and planetary science. By enabling autonomous spacecraft operations, improved trajectory design, and increased resolution, this capability will make spacecraft operations feasible that are currently difficult or costly to implement. Advanced Space has identified maneuver planning, orbit determination, collision avoidance and rendezvous, and spacecraft relative position maintenance as important applications of this innovation. But there are other benefits such as lower ground system costs supporting small satellite mission, flexibility provided through incremental fleet upgrades, and improved system fault tolerance that will also be achieved. These developments will enhance NASA’s ability to conduct basic research, improve the public Return on Investment, and ultimately, improve the quality of life on Earth.Distributed computing capabilities provide system resilience in the case of loss of a single spacecraft, improve the resolution/quality of data recorded, reduce spacecraft costs compared to a single monolithic spacecraft, and enable formation reconfiguration and retasking in response to situational constraints, among other benefits. In addition, by enabling spacecraft to operate autonomously, resources can be reallocated from ground-based control to other concerns.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)With this technology, commercial operators will be able to conduct remote sensing operations using formations of small spacecraft that produce data that is simply not available today. Notional applications have been identified in agriculture, land use planning, resource identification and extraction and many more. Being able to harness DSM for these purposes dramatically shifts the feasibility of business plans for a range of space services. Being able to harness constellations of smallsats or cubesats that operate in unison with integrated sensors and long measurement baselines has a game-changing effect on the businesses using them.

The transition of AM technology from production of prototypes to production of critical parts is hindered by a lack of confidence in the quality of the part. In the push to commercialize the AM technology, currently available systems are based largely on hand-tuned parameters determined by trial-and-error for a limited set of materials. QuesTek along with University of Pittsburgh as the partner will develop an integrated experimental and analytical (model-based) technologies for process optimization and qualification of additive manufacturing. In the Phase I of the program, modeling framework for yield strength of AM IN718 was developed and validated experimentally. Building on the success of Phase I and utilizing the already established framework, additional models for toughness, fatigue and cracking will be developed to perform an overall qualification of AM IN718. The developed Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) framework combines QuesTek’s Materials by Design and Accelerated Insertion of Materials (AIM) technologies to accelerate the adoption of AM.","The proposed innovation should enable faster adoption of additive manufacturing in various NASA missions. The increased mechanistic understanding of the process and the modeling of associated uncertainty within the process would result in accelerated qualification of AM materials for use especially in aerospace applications, where the qualification requirements are demanding. Due to the inherently material agnostic ICME approach, the developed methods and tools for IN718 in the current program can easily be expanded to other materials of interest, increasing its applicability in the industry. The current program would help in generation of a standard qualified metallurgical process for AM IN718 leading to the development of a Material Property Suite and helping in defining the design allowables and process control requirements.","Beyond NASA, a software tool that will be developed under this program will integrate similarly into the existing AM supply chain, specifically with AM and materials researchers and producers, AM service bureaus who supply powders and components, major OEMs with AM capabilities, and other entities specifically involved with developing AM process prediction and modeling tools. The developed tools and methods can be used by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), where they can incorporate it in their work flow to reduce cost and time for qualification, reduce rejections by better process controls and understanding, thus adding great value. In the Phase II of the program, Honeywell Aerospace (attached letter of support) will provide valuable feedback for the development of the tool and how it can be can be applied to realistic aerospace applications.

This technology allows deploying flexible instrumentation and health monitoring capability in fully enclosed areas such as vacuum jacketed pipelines or pressurized tanks by a non-intrusive data and energy transfer through-wall system where perforations are avoided, maintaining structural integrity of monitored systems. Major innovations and capabilities are: (a) non-intrusive sensing where holes in isolating walls are not required; (b) wireless data and power transmission through solid walls by robust ultrasound techniques; (c) self-diagnostics of piezoelectric (PZT) elements used either for ultrasound communications or as sensors; (d) embedded intelligent algorithms in the TIMs (Transducer Interface Modules), i.e. smart sensors; and (e) sensor network operation capability, i.e. smart sensors on both sides of the wall and in remote locations can communicate to a network coordinator. TWall-ISHM is an integral solution with Instrumentation and Measurement methods, advanced ultrasound communications (in addition to RF and wired communication), and health monitoring in an innovative yet practical product.","The TWall-ISHM will directly support NASA testing facilities by providing an innovative cost-effective instrumentation and measurement (I&M) as well as health monitoring system with minimally intrusive ultrasound communication and intelligent data analysis diagnostic techniques. The innovation of the system is the ability to extend measurement capabilities in previously inaccessible spaces where physical holes would either comprise structural integrity or result in major disassembly downtime costs. Potential applications are: (a) long-duration use in vacuum jacketed pipelines; (b) cryogenic systems monitoring; (c) explosive environments such as propulsion systems in test stands; (d) pressurized tanks and storage vessels; (e) strain gage instrumentation, (f) distribution systems, etc. Generally, the system can be used for expanding I&M in critical systems and test stands such as those at Stennis Space Center. Rather than requiring manual inspections over miles of pipelines, TWall-ISHM nodes (internal sensor system and outside data acquisition system) can be installed at specific locations for automatic data recovery. High-dollar value systems are a focus, where the TWall-ISHM should provide cost-savings by enabling flexible system monitoring without disassembling or drilling holes to obtain data and to analyze problems. The technology can be readily applied to different structure types, thus maximizing flexibility and ease of installation, further reducing costs for NASA.","The TWall-ISHM provides novel instrumentation and monitoring capability with significant application potential for a wide range of non-NASA systems within both civilian and military sectors. For example, the TWall-ISHM can be applied to systems health monitoring (processing of strain, stress, humidity, temperature, etc.) of equipment, machinery, and assets in difficult to reach locations such as airframe components (wings or enclosed fuselage compartments) and remote/inaccessible bridge elements, civil structures, and military systems. Innovative aerospace instrumentation and advanced measurement techniques will be enabled when considering data and energy transfer in pressurized aircraft cabins or cockpits, where sensors in both the outside and inside of the cabin can transmit data and power with the thru-wall ultrasound technology. Other applications are: (1) oil wells; (2) submarine hull data acquisition; (3) shipment containers monitoring (e.g. ultrasound tags instead of RFID tags); (4) underwater vehicles; (5) extending the coverage of existing wireless sensor networks (WSNs); (6) corrosion monitoring of civil structures, vessels, military infrastructure; (7) tracking of military assets and life-cycle status monitoring; (8) Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) and Enterprise asset management; (9) complex system maintenance and repair guidance; (10) logistics and depot maintenance; and (11) Internet of Things (IOT).",,,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"110 8th Street, Troy, NY 12180 - 3522",(518) 276-8359,,

This disconnect unduly burdens mission operators, as it requires the involvement of expert robot programmers to define each activity. To eliminate this burden, we propose that robots in space (whether autonomous or remotely commanded by humans) should be commanded using verified, human-readable procedures. Such an approach will allow NASA to seamlessly allocate new robotic capabilities and resources to existing space activities, and will facilitate the cooperation of humans and their robot assistants when performing joint activities.In Phase I of this work, progress towards this goal was demonstrated by combining two previously disparate software suites. TRACLabs' Procedure IDE for authoring and running electronic procedures and our CRAFTSMAN mobile manipulation planning and control software have been developed over the past few years in conjunction with NASA engineers and researchers on various projects. The integration of these two research streams in this PHARAOH (Procedure-Handling Architecture for Robots And/Or Humans) system has demonstrated the promise of our approach, while also highlighting deficiencies in the current electronic procedure software as it pertains to command and control of complicated remote robots. In Phase II, we will build upon lessons learned to replace, improve, and validate various architectural, operational, and computational components of the Phase I prototype. The specific aim of this Phase II is to achieve a TRL-6 software package with suitable software and hardware validations to ensure that TRL-7 performance could be achieved within a 5 year time frame, where we envision non-robotics flight controllers using PHARAOH to task remote robotic assets by using English-language procedures that automatically map directly to robot capabilities on the back-end.","For NASA, we envision non-robotics flight controllers being able to write and run electronic procedures to task remote robotic assets to create English language procedures that automatically map directly to robot capabilities behind the scenes.

Our strategy for PFRC has evolved since our Phase I proposal, and we now propose a hybrid magnet approach: a combination of so-called “dry” conduction-cooled low-temperature (LTS) superconductor magnets and high-temperature (HTS) magnets that are operated at low temperature for maximum current at high fields. Conduction-cooled LTS magnets are becoming state-of-the-art for MRI machines, and reduce coolant requirements from 1000’s of liters of helium over the lifetime of the machine to a few liters in a closed cryocooler. This is with a mass penalty for cooling of only about 5%. These low-coolant LTS magnets, producing a field of 5 to 6 T, will have excellent safety margin in both critical current and field and will have a clear path to space applications. PFRC also requires higher-field nozzle magnets producing fields of 20 to 30 T. These would utilize HTS superconductors operated at low temperatures of about 10 K. All coils will require highly efficient cooling systems, excellent mechanical support, and overall low mass including structural components. Our partner, PPPL, is the only institution in the world where active research on the physics and technology of small, steady-state fusion devices is being performed. We propose a Phase II experiment to build a 0.5 Tesla LTS magnet with a split pair of winding packs, to mimic a subset of the PFRC magnets. A separate pulsed copper test coil to simulation the plasma will be used to study the effects on the magnet of FRC formation, which will occur in a fraction of a second and result in large increases in magnetic field at the windings. In parallel, we will continue to advance the design of the HTS nozzle magnets, seeking the lowest mass solution.","A small fusion engine such as Direct Fusion Drive would be useful for many deep- and inner-space missions, such as Lagrange points, manned Mars and lunar missions, a Pluto orbiter and lander, and the 550 AU solar gravitational lens. The novel superconducting coils have applications to additional advanced propulsion concepts and scientific payloads. One example is the AMS-02 experiment for which a low-temperature superconducting coil option was built and tested but later swapped out for a traditional magnet with a longer lifetime. Other advanced propulsion techniques require superconducting coils including the VASIMR electric thruster and the PuFF fission-fusion thruster. There has been considerable research on using superconducting coils for radiation shielding; these coils may also be useful for space materials processing and precision formation flying.","There are many military and civil applications of the fusion engine and the coils. Military space applications include high-power Earth satellites with radar, laser, or communications payloads. There are wider applications including generators for wind turbines, high efficiency motors, particle accelerators, energy storage, and terrestrial fusion reactors. Small terrestrial fusion reactors of the PFRC type have unique application to remote and mobile applications, such as military forward power and disaster relief, as well as high-intensity energy applications like desalination.

These arrays are used for high frequency filters and in antenna applications. We propose to use FSSs as multi-functional sensors. FSS sensors are unpowered, low-profile (thin), wireless and passive, and are interrogated remotely via low power microwave energy. These sensors can be embedded in non-conductive structures or surface mounted on conductive or non-conductive surfaces. They can be surface mounted at any point in the service life of a structure.Microwaves penetrate through dielectrics, so FSS sensors can be interrogated through non-conductive materials such as paint, insulation, fiberglass, Kevlar etc. Multiple sensing parameters can be concurrently sensed through proper sensor design and interrogation, as was illustrated in Phase I via both simulation and experimental measurement of a prototype strain and temperature sensor. Phase I work included: completing a study on the effect of FSS dimensions and illumination footprint on achievable resolution; miniaturization was applied and shown to improve sensor response and resolution; modeling correctly predicted sensor ability to measure temperature and strain; FSS sensors and tensile test samples were constructed and bonded together; and thermal and mechanical testing were completed to empirically confirm capabilities and limitations.In Phase II we plan to improve sensor materials and designs; address measuring ranges of strains and temperatures on varying surfaces; optimize FSS bonding methods; build and test a complete strain/temperature measurement prototype; test the system on structures (both visually available and covered by nonconductive materials) undergoing various loads and temperature changes; quantify capabilities and limitations; deliver the system to NASA Langley; and develop a commercialization plan.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)A low profile (thin), un-powered, passive, wireless sensor that can be interrogated non-contact through coatings to monitor the underlying structures strain and shape change would have many applications.

FSS sensors provide a cost effective tool for providing long term monitoring of strains and deformations in structures such as bridges and dams. Because the sensors can be applied in a non-zero strain environment, the FSS sensors can be embedded on legacy infrastructure and can therefore provide the ability to monitor loads from that point on. According to the FHWA, there are 54,560 Structurally Deficient Bridges in the United States, plus another 47,619 bridges rated structurally poor. The system we propose to develop in this Phase II effort would allow bridge structures to be monitored over time, even if paint, fiberglass repairs, concrete or other patches are added to the structures. FSS sensors can be applied to architectural structures in areas that are prone to natural disasters. During these events the buildings may experience unnatural strain loading resulting in microcracking or deformations on structural components that are hidden from view. Using the remote sensing ability of this system can allow architectural engineers a glimpse into the any unseen damage the building may have suffered. FSS sensors can be incorporated into aerospace structures such as the fuselage or the wing skin. The quick, non-contact scanning of permanently placed FSS sensors would allow lifetime strain monitoring of the aircraft. This would assist in driving more efficient maintenance schedules.",,,,,,,24

Hybrid Rockets offer substantially lower cost compared to storable and cryogenic bipropellant systems, but currently suffer from poor packaging efficiency. During proof of concept work, the use of a high density, HAN based oxidizer system combined with a high density and high regression rate solid fuel were demonstrated as solutions to packaging efficiency, O/F ratio sensitivity, and regression rate limitations of hybrid motors. The HAN based oxidizer has low freezing temperature and no appreciable vapor pressure, being safe, storable, and eliminating the need for special handling and shipping precautions. The high density oxidizer combined with the high density, high performance fuel, creates a hybrid engine system with the density impulse performance of a solid rocket motor, but the throttleability of a bipropellant system, with the safety approaching an inert system. An electrically enhanced ignition system was demonstrated which improved C*, and enables higher performance to be met with shorter motor grains, with the potential for multiple start capabilities.This Phase II program will continue the development of high density, safe, storable, non-toxic hybrid motors to optimize ISP and motor design, improve injector and igniter performance, and mature third and fourth stage motor maturity through full scale motor burns.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The third and fourth stage motor designs are sized using the nanolaunch2000 PSRM-120 and PSRM-30 third and fourth stage motors as the reference motors.

A storable hybrid is a highly attractive alternative for kick motors, being the size of a solid motor but with throttleability and near infinitly storability without a hazard classification. Storable high density hybrids, due to their improved reliability, and high density-isp, also make compelling candidates for mars sample return and planetary missions, as well as nano- and picosatellite propulsion systems.

CrossTrac Engineering, Inc., in cooperation with our partners Professor Kerri Cahoy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Mr. Paul Graven of Cateni, Inc., proposes to develop a free space optical communications and ranging system with inherent precision pointing as a 1U module for 3U and larger CubeSats requiring intersatellite crosslinks.

The ideal method would allow for a rapid structural repair to be performed in locations with minimal access without the need for extensive tooling, surface prep, cure times and complicated techniques. In Phase I, engineers at Luna demonstrated a comprehensive system that included facile surface preparation, single-bag out of autoclave processing and Luna’s unique fiber optic measurement capability for monitoring repair state. This Phase II program will focus on optimizing these methods for launch vehicle composite damage that can be performed during ground processing of the launch vehicle without the need for full replacement. It is expected that the technology will meet NASA launch vehicle requirements and demonstrate potential for in-situ repairs to spacecraft on long missions.","Luna’s composite repair system will be directly applicable to launch pad damage mitigation activities for current and future launch vehicles.

The μG-LilyPond™ concept expands the types of crops that can be grown on a spacecraft to include aquatic floating plants as a nutritional supplement for the crew diet. Innovative features include low maintenance, increased reliability with passive water delivery, volume efficiency, full life cycle support via vegetative propagation, close canopy lighting, and crop versatility.

The proposed study will be the first to show that a complete and accurate description of the propulsion airframe integration (PAI) effects enables autonomous flight of a DEP aircraft using a standard approach to model-based flight control. A combination of modeling & 6DoF dynamic simulation leveraging OpenVSP/VSPAERO, wind-tunnel and hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) ground testing, and system identification (SysID) flight testing will be completed to support the design of the autonomous controller. The resultant controller will be demonstrated in flight on the ADEPT-FC research aircraft at multiple stages of development, including trim flight with uniform and asymmetric throttle mixing as well as DEP system fault tolerance through autonomous controller reconfiguration.

Autonomous flight control of DEP aircraft with strong PAI effects is one piece of a greater integrated autonomous controller (IAC) envisioned for hybrid electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) aircraft, a technology foreseen by ESAero to enable substantial risk probability and criticality reduction, improved energy efficiency, and reduced pilot workload.","One of the three commercialization strategies envisioned by ESAero for the proposed autonomous controller technology and the IAC product it would be a part of is to develop and integrate an IAC for NASA’s X-57 “Maxwell” aircraft. There are presently no active efforts by NASA to integrate health-aware, autonomous flight control capability on NASA’s X-57 Maxwell aircraft despite the fact that most subject matter experts on DEP agree that such a technology is strongly recommended for safe and efficient operation.

The topics of DEP, PAI, OpenVSP, and autonomy relate to Strategic Thrusts 3a, 4, and 6 of the ARMD and have ties to several NASA programs including TACP, AAVP, AOSP, and IASP through projects including CAS, TTT, AATT, SASO, and UAS in the NAS. As an engineering services contractor with close ties to all aeronautics centers of NASA, ESAero will actively pursue follow-on efforts to leverage its newfound core competencies and intellectual property in support of any these programs and projects.","ESAero has targeted the rapidly growing Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market led by Uber for the eventual Non-NASA commercialization of the IAC technology and product. The eVTOL aircraft being developed for this market features many of the hallmark characteristics that call for IAC technology, including numerous high-power electric propulsors, DEP-based control concepts, and strong PAI-related dynamical complexities. Additionally, autonomous systems have already been identified by Uber Elevate as a future feature of their fleet, owing to their superior safety and operating costs. ESAero’s end-goal for this path of commercialization is to sell or license the IAC technology to Uber and/or one or more of the aircraft developers in the UAM market. Post-Phase II activities needed to enter this market include the development and demonstration of the IAC technology on a larger aircraft with features matching that of eVTOL aircraft, such as Uber Elevate’s eCRM-001 concept, to increase the TRL to 7 and attract the interest of airframes in the eVTOL community. ESAero intends to leverage their strong relationship with Uber and/or their partners to secure funding for this first activity.

Truly autonomous operation of power systems (e.g. turbo-electric distributed propulsion aircrafts) cannot be scripted. An intelligent system capable of self-healing and management requires two key pillars to achieve a sufficient degree of correct self-aware behavior: a reliable accurate model of internal system behavior, and efficient and reliable ways to deal with external and internal information. As a byproduct of accurate and reliable modeling, better design procedures will be in our hands. On these areas, the innovation will extend the ideas behind the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM, which solves non-equivocally the steady-state equations of electrical power systems), to encompass a larger heterogeneous system: the joint electrical and thermal system. The innovation builds first on their joint operational physical model, seen as a holistic system of algebraic equations. The second innovation context is data processing for self-aware behavior algorithms, proposing convergence of the physical model-based approach (HELM) and emerging unsupervised Deep Learning techniques in Big Data Artificial Intelligence. The CWRU knowledge base on fault detection and protection will also contribute significantly in efficient defining self-aware heuristics.

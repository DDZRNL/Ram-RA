Our telediagnosis solution has been demonstrated to Honeywell and NASA-JSC, and is being considered for remote monitoring of the Space Station. It is also the centerpiece of Honeywell?s NOVA program (www.wipnova.com). Encouraged by the strong response from NASA and the Aerospace industry, we would like to develop on the shadow reasoning framework and statistical prognosis techniques from our Phase I effort and make RDS the most capable and scalable Intelligent Vehicle Health Management solution, onboard or remote. In Phase II we will add a novel new feature in our reasoner to explain in intuitive terms the diagnosis inferred by the reasoner. Such a capability will speed the adoption of the reasoner by experts, and will have applications in training. We will also address challenging issues of test sequencing in the presence of uncertainties and diagnosis in the presence of variable delay in detection of the fault(s) by tests. The new algorithms will be incorporated into our telediagnosis product, the Remote Diagnosis Server (www.teamqsi.com/rds).",,"POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)  Potential applications include monitoring and diagnosis of commercial and military jets, space systems, manufacturing systems, building heating ventilation and cooling systems, embedded automotive diagnosis, etc. The remarkable aspect of the proposed technology is that the data acquisition module can be implemented as single-board or even single chip solutions that can be mass produced and embedded in any networked system, while a network based server can monitor and assess health of thousands of such systems. This makes real-time diagnosis universally accessible at a low cost to a wide variety of applications, including home and office automation, smart appliances, battlefield soldier and equipment health monitoring, and in-home health care of patients in need of round the clock monitoring.",,01-Information Technology,University of Connecticut,"U-157, 260 Glenbrook Road,, Storrs, CT, 06269 - 2157",(860 ) 486 - 2195

Future military aircraft concepts have been proposed with planforms that are different from present configurations, resulting from the need for low radar cross-section.  The low wing loading and low-level, high-speed flight operational requirements of some new configurations can lead to extreme buffeting of the aircrew when flying for relatively long periods in turbulence.  In severe turbulence aircrew tolerance may be limited to only a few minutes of sustained performance before the pilot?s abilities become impaired.  There is therefore a need for a means of assessing the likely ride quality characteristics for the proposed aircraft configurations and how susceptible they may be to this problem.  It is proposed to apply analytical methods for quantifying cumulative aircrew fatigue by enhancement of existing analysis software.  Further, it is proposed to develop a ride quality meter that can be used in practice to provide real time or off-line information about the extent of fatigue exposure either directly to the aircrew or to aircraft operational personnel.",,"POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)  The objectives of the research are to provide enhancements to the NASA Dryden STARS analysis software package for commercial exploitation, and to develop a related product, a ride quality meter, to provide real time and/or off-line information about cumulative fatigue of aircrew and passengers during flight in continuous turbulence.  Together, these objectives provide both service and product routes to commercialization. The development of a gust and turbulence response capability in STARS will increase the application range at NASA Dryden for test and evaluation clearance work for future advanced aircraft projects.  It will be suitable for potential sales and services marketing to various research facilities and aircraft manufacturers where similar advanced flight testing is undertaken. The ride quality meter will be able to assess ride quality using a device that is independent of the aircraft systems.  It will be of interest where excessive cumulative fatigue of the pilot clearly can potentially lead to failure to achieve the mission objectives and in the extreme can endanger the aircraft, and also for other aircrew and passenger comfort assessments.  An existing vibration meter is to be used as the basis for the development, which will be carried out in collaboration with the original manufacturer.",,02-Atmospheric Flight Operations,Naval Postgraduate School,"Code 09, Dean of Research, Rm 220, Monterey, CA, 93943 - 5138",(831 ) 656 - 2980

Spectroscopic measurement of the emission spectra of meteors as they are heated by entry into the Earth's atmosphere can yield this information.  An objective-grating spectrograph instrument payload designed to capture the ultraviolet emission spectra of metoers is proposed.  This Shuttle and or Space Station payload will detect and record randomly occurring transient upper atmosphere phenomena such as meteors and upper atmospheric lightning.  In this Phase II effort Princeton Scientific Instruments will complete the design and fabrication of the high frame rate CCD camera portion of the payload.  Villanova University will complete their thermal analysis and design to include the proposed International Space Station payload ""SUMS"" (Slitless UV Meteor Spectrometer).

While these NASA-commercial applications are sufficient justification for this program, there are other commercial market reasons as well.  This research and development is applicable to the increasing use of imaging in industrial, scientfic, and military applications, and the collateral need for real-time image processing to make decisions in real time.  There is an increasing need to recognize, respond to and measure transient events and to do this at high speed, high resolution and good photometric fidelity.  The software algorithms for detecting and characterizing rapidly changing spectral images and differentiating between meteors and Sprites will be applicable to other problems.  One example is real time analysis of rocket engine exhaust plume images and spectra to make quick decisions as to whether to proceed with a missile launch.  The ultraviolet image sensor and optics are also of commercial interest.

Neidhoefer,,,,,,,,,,"TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)  In Phase I we developed, integrated, and demonstrated a real-time adaptive navigation system, and a companion real-time adaptive guidance system for UAVs. The underlying project goal is to provide an aircraft with the capability to autonomously reroute itself in real time through dynamic hazard environments and still achieve its mission objectives.  The adaptive naviagtion system uses an evolutionary algorithm to determine a set of waypoints which define an optimal discrete path between the current position and the final desired position.  The waypoint location search space is constrained such that calculation of the performance index is very fast.  The adaptive guidance module uses an adaptive critic to generate smooth, realizable paths between the waypoints.  The critic utilizes information gathered off-line about the closed loop system to adapt the natural frequencies of a system of second order smoothing filters.  The smoothing filters accept a series of step inputs (the waypoints) and output smooth paths between the waypoints.  During the proposed Phase II STTR program we will take development of the system to the next level including analyzing its stability characteristics.  The Phase II will culminate with an actual flight test demonstration/verification of the system on one of AACs research UAVs.",,"POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)  As a result of the technology developed under this project, as well as the results of several other SBIR projects, we have received a three million-dollar investment from D.B.

The first product will be a nonlinear adaptive critic guidance and control computer.  The second product will be a software package that uses that tool for remote and autonomous operation of air vehicles.  These products are an important part of an operator station for a group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). An obvious application is to Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV).  By enabling a ground station to more easily operate an aircraft, the efforts of a remote pilot can be minimized and response time can be reduced.

Hoyt,,,,,,,,,,"TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (LIMIT 200 WORDS)  Inflatable or self-deployable systems offer the only practical way to achieve space deployed antennas with low mass at large aperture.  In this Phase I program, open-celled rigid polyurethane foams were developed for use in self-deploying antenna structures.  Advantages of such a system relative to current systems include high volumetric efficiency of packing, inherent restoring force, low (or no) outgassing, low thermal conductivity, high dynamic damping, mechanical isotropy, infinite shelf life, and easy fabrication with methods amenable to construction of large structures (i.e., spraying). In Phase I, it was demonstrated that rigid polyurethane foams with a variety of glass transition temperatures (Tgs) can be easily formulated using commercially available urethane components; foam systems with Tgs ranging from 30 to 150?C were prepared.  The ability to tailor the system Tg is a critical element in tailoring the deployment of these systems on-orbit.  The ability to create open cells in rigid polyurethane foams was also demonstrated; a sample was prepared with greater than 50% open cell content.  Open-celled foams are critical for achieving high packing efficiency and maintaining dimensional stability of the structures during thermal cycling.  It was also demonstrated during the course of the Phase I program that metallized open-celled foams can perform well for antenna applications.  RF insertion loss testing in the frequency range 12-17 GHz on foam samples coated with approximately 3.5 microns of metal indicated a minor loss of 0.2 dB, clearly demonstrating the promise of metallized foams for antenna applications.",,"POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)   Large space-deployed antennas are receiving a great deal of interest in both the NASA and commercial sectors.  The reason is the increasing need for a variety of applications that include communications, long baseline interferometry, micro-spacecraft, and DoD space-based radar.  Investigators in these areas identify the need for structures up to tens of meters in aperture size and 1 to 90 GHz operations.The eventual markets for communications antennas and radars are extremely large.  In the commercial sector, over 200 satellites are expected to be launched in the next 10 years to meet consumer demand for cellular phones and other communication devices.  A large number of military satellites are also expected to be launched in that timeframe.  Current mesh antennas sell for $25-40 million each.  Self-deploying antennas using the foam technology demonstrated in this Phase I program should be priced in the $3-4 million range each.

New measurement techniques and equipment have been incorporated into the basic experimental apparatus constructed in Phase I, and this improvement will add considerably to our capabilities and to the fundamental understanding of laser-matter interactions.  Three materials (lead, aluminum, and carbon) showed the greatest promise for ALP in Phase I and we will concentrate on these in Phase II.  Our interest has previously been directed toward investigating the fundamental physics of ALP and we believe that the important concepts are now understood well enough to take the next step and actually produce a flight demonstration of a prototype ALP-powered craft.  Phase II will begin with further investigation of the selected materials and will conclude with the construction and flight of a laser-propelled craft of our own design.  The proposed work will demonstrate the viability of the ALP concept.",,"POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATION(S) (LIMIT 200 WORDS)  Commercial applications of ALP fall into two broad categories: satellite launches and satellite altitude maintenance.  A laser-propelled craft could be used for temporary global positioning satellite applications; launching of specialized cellular telephone communications antennae for communications with remote areas and satellite-to-satellite communications; rapid delivery of tools and components for Space Shuttle or Space Station missions; remote visual inspection and diagnostics of satellites; maintenance of low orbits, using periodic boosts from the ground, for controlled-altitude data gathering in global hydrology applications and high-altitude weather monitoring; and cost-effective, efficient clearing of space debris.  Secure communications would be possible by storing the information in a small laser-launched payload that would communicate with the satellite when it is within a short range, obviating the use of signals transmitted from the ground and making interception of the signal impossible using ground-based antennae.  In addition to relevant NASA programs, this project has direct potential application to DoD BMD programs.

The H-PDLC constitute a stack of polymer and liquid crystal layers whose index of refraction can be changes by the application of electrical potential, thus changing the optical properties of the stack.The operating requirements for displays and telecommunications, under development for several years at a significant level of funding, are vastly different from the requirements for tunable filter based sensors.  The Phase-I STTR investigation, therefore, focused on identifying H-PDLC properties that need to be tailored to meet sensor requirements, and on developing technical approaches to implement such changes.We have successfully completed this evaluation and developed plans for a series of modifications including special tailoring of material, assembly process changes and control steps, addition of other additives, etc., all of which will lead to a filter with the correct properties for the sensor applications.

The sensors that will be developed with this partner will be used for precision agriculture on farm equipment.  This partner has already invested in complementary research at OKSI sums that are greater than the Phase-I STTR value, and continues to invest in sensor development.

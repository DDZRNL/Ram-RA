000021,,,An Intermittency Transport Model for Practical CFD Designs of  High Speed Vehicles,"Taitech, Inc.","1430 Oak Court, Suite 301, Beavercreek, OH,",,Chung-Jen J. Tam,,,,,,,,,,"This proposed research is to present a general CFD subroutinefor predicting flow transitions in hypersonic regimes. The subroutine makesuse of an intermittency transport equation to describe the behavior of the flowtransition, and is therefore compatible with existing CFD codes. The proposedmodel solves an additional transport equation for the intermittency distributionand the resulting intermittency is then used to adjust the turbulent eddy viscosityin the transition region. The major advantage of this approach is that it doesnot require pre-calculation of the mean flow but includes the laminar, transitional,and turbulent regions in a single computation. The current intermittency transportequation has been validated for subsonic flows with different freestream turbulenceintensities and pressure gradients. The Phase I research will extend the capabilityof the model to high Mach number flight conditions by including compressibilityand heat transfer effects.","For the design of hypersonic vehicles, it is important to predictflow transition reliably: Mach number effects cause a significant delay in flowtransition and also give rise to a wider transition region, as compared to thetransition behavior of incompressible flows. As a result, the capability ofthe current CFD code in predicting flow transition plays a significant rolein hypersonic vehicle designs. The proposed intermittency model involves thesolution of a transport equation for intermittency, and the resulting intermittencyis used to modify the eddy viscosity such that the transition behavior can bedescribed adequately. The current method has been tested in incompressible flowsunder a variety of flow conditions with impressive results. As compared withthe available stability methods for transition preditions, the proposed intermittencymethod is a cost-effective method to predict transitional flows, for it caneasily be incorporated into commercial and research codes used in the designof high transport aircraft and space launch vehicles.",,,02 - Atmospheric Flight Operations,University of Kentucky,"102 Kinkead Hall 0057, Lexington, KY, 40506"

A unique feature of the proposed effort is that the failure detection,isolation and reconfiguration modules can operate remotely over a low bandwidthwireless link. This can be utilized by ground support to assess system healthand to shadow the onboard reasoner.

Since CNTs have an extremely high surface area, can be readily modified with metals or functional groups, and can function without the mass transfer limitations of traditional activated carbon, they are an ideal material for integration into spacecraft air handling systems.  In the Phase II program, we will build upon the unique structural and chemical nature of carbon nanotubes to construct a prototype system utilizing these smart adsorbents.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  NASA's next generation spacecraft will have a totally redesigned air purification (or climate control system) and a major concern is that this system will not be able to deal with the low levels of ammonia and carbon monoxide generated during long space flights.  Therefore, in addition to adsorption and degradation of VOCs, the development of a versatile CNT-based system that can be used to adsorb and release ammonia, and also remove CO by oxidizing it into CO2 would be ideal.  In addition to routine removal of low ambient level CO produced through normal metabolic activity, a second important operational scenario is an excursion with high CO levels, > 10 ppm possibly greater than 100 ppm, arising from a fire.  For this situation, a catalyst with high activity and storage capacity, such as this novel CNT-based system, is critical to reduce high transient levels within minutes before incapacity or death occurs.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) An example of the commercial importance for CO removal is in fuel cell power generation.  Generally in fuel cells, the reformate gas typically contains 0.5 ? 2% by volume CO.  It is imperative to lower the concentration of CO because it is a catalyst poison for the gas-diffusion anode.  Volatile organic compounds present one of the major environmental problems today.  Filters for airborne particulate matter are essential in many instances, including air purifiers, respiratory protection equipment and clean rooms.  In the manufacturing sector, semiconductor manufacturing requires ultra-high filtration.  Applications for this technology include indoor filtration systems to remove VOCs from indoor air streams, personal protective gear for workers exposed to occupationally high levels of industrial chemicals, and equipment for military personnel, firefighters and other public health officials who may come into contact with toxic air contaminants while dealing with the aftermath of industrial spills and leaks.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning,,Universities Space Research Association,"10211 Wincopin Circle, Suite 500, Columbia, MD  21044-3432",(410) 730-2656

SLA achieves these outstanding attributes by employing flexible Fresnel lenses for optical concentration (e.g., 8X), thereby minimizing solar cell area, mass, and cost.  SLA's small cell size (85% less cell area than planar high-efficiency arrays) also allows super-insulation and super-shielding of the solar cells to enable high-voltage operation and radiation hardness in the space environment.  Recent studies show that SLA offers a 3-4X advantage over competing arrays in specific power for many NASA Exploration missions, and that SLA is ideally matched to Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) applications, which can save NASA >$10 billion for lunar exploration cargo transportation.  In Phase II, ENTECH and Auburn will perform critical ground tests, including an advanced solar concentrator (1 kW, 600 V, color-mixing lenses, multi-junction cells) direct-driving a Hall-effect electric thruster, and SLA/thruster plume interaction tests.  After Phase II, SLA for SEP technology will be ready for flight testing in preparation for many NASA, DOD, and commercial missions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The 600 V Stretched Lens Array (SLA) for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) technology being developed under this STTR program will have major applications for near-term and far-term NASA Exploration Missions.  One major NASA application is SLA for SEP technology applied to reusable cargo tugs, not only for near-term robotic and human missions to the moon, but also for longer term missions to Mars and beyond.  One reusable cargo tug using SLA for SEP technology can save NASA over $3 Billion in launch costs alone, compared to conventional chemical propulsion delivery of 110 metric tons of cargo to the lunar surface over a five year period.  Other NASA applications of SLA for SEP technology include orbit maintenance for the International Space Station, orbit raising or lowering of spacecraft for science missions in orbit about the earth, moon, planets, or asteroids, and primary propulsion for large-scale deep space science missions.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Many additional non-NASA applications for the proposed SLA for SEP technology also exist, from LEO to GEO orbit raising for commercial communication satellites to repositioning of DOD space assets to meet specific mission requirements.  In addition, several of the new entrepreneurial space and near-space companies are working with our SLA team on near-term large-scale commercial applications of the high-voltage radiation-tolerant SLA for both their SEP and their non-SEP missions.  Finally, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is also funding development of the radiation-hardened SLA for critical National security applications in space, including DOD spacecraft capable of withstanding the effects of man-made threats, including ground-based lasers or nuclear detonations in low earth orbit.

Delaying flow separa-tion (i.e., wing stall) and providing ""back-up"" control power could allow an aircraft to recover from adverse conditions (due to a control surface failure, pilot/autopilot error, etc.) that would otherwise result in a loss of control.Flow control studies have shown that synthetic jet actuators are efficient devices for controlling separated internal and external flows.  However, an obstacle to the widespread application of synthetic jet actuators for practical flight control is that modulated input signals to achieve closed-loop flow control objectives have been shown to be complex.  Barron Associates, the University of Virginia, and the University of Wyoming propose to develop a software toolbox for the creation of adaptive control systems for actuators having complex, nonlinear dynamics.  The Phase II effort will culminate in a wind tunnel test that quanti-fies the safety improvement potential offered by adaptively-controlled synthetic jet actuators.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The proposed research effort clearly offers the potential for a significant leap in vehicle performance, op-eration, safety, cost, and capability.  The technology will require a Phase III demonstration in an actual-flight environment to fully characterize and validate the performance that is predicted in simulation and demonstrated in wind tunnel experiments in Phase II. The research is particularly relevant to NASA's Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS), which has the objective of enabling a pilot to land an aircraft that has suffered a major systems failure or combat damage, and also to the Single Aircraft Accident Preven-tion thrust of the Aviation Safety Program in which Barron Associates has participated for a number of years.

Furthermore, active flow control technology provides a natural complement to other advanced intelligent vehicle control prod-ucts already under development at Barron Associates.  The most direct commercialization route is via collaboration with the major airframers.  Fortunately, Bar-ron Associates has strong, existing working relationships with these companies.  As parallel research advances at the major aerospace companies, BAI will pursue commercialization and collaboration oppor-tunities.

Safety- and mission-critical components and systems will be instrumented with embedded sensors to provide a real-time indication of health, helping to ensure that America's space exploration remains safe and cost efficient. One of the most promising technologies for accomplishing this is fiber-optic sensors. Due to their light-weight and multiplexing potential, fiber-optic sensors are highly desirable for employment in this fashion. However, most commercial fiber-optic sensor interrogators are bench sized units and are too large and heavy to be easily integrated for space-based applications.To address this shortcoming, Luna Innovations proposes to develop a compact, light-weight, multi-parameter distributed fiber-optic instrumentation system based on the OFDR technique. The interrogator will incorporate photonic integrated circuit technology, a highly integrated swept-wavelength laser, and state-of-the-art integrated processing technology to dramatically reduce the size, weight, and cost and to dramatically increase the performance and robustness relative to existing technology. This interrogator will interface with fiber-optic strain, temperature, and shape sensor arrays, enabling simultaneous interrogation of a multitude of sensors, dramatically reducing the per sensor cost of instrumentation.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The interrogator as well as the sensors will be designed to perform in the high-stress and hostile conditions expected on launch vehicles and space environments. The resulting miniaturized, ruggedized device will thus be capable of operation in high-vibration environments, resulting in a high-reliability device that will have great utility as a portable multi-parameter sensing unit. Such instrumentation could continuously provide distributed strain, temperature, and shape measurements in a space environment. Strain measurements, for example, could yield information on highly-stressed or fatigued structural members, enabling condition-based maintenance of the crew exploration vehicle or composite over-wrapped pressure vessels.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The resulting instrumentation system is expected to be extremely attractive in a number of commercial applications. For example, the long term monitoring of civil structures using sensor arrays would be enabled by a permanently installed interrogator. In addition, technology is expected to find use in many health monitoring applications as a sensing network in air-, land-, and sea-based military vehicles.

This Stability Diagnostic System (SDS) will be designed, assembled, and tested during this effort.  The SDS will include a high-speed video camera and multiple photodiode detectors for observing the plume.  It will also include a software package, which will aid in analyzing the plume data and in determining the acoustic modes of the instability.  To ensure that the system works properly, Sierra and Purdue will leverage an oxygen/kerosene combustor, developed under AFRL funding, to operate with unstable combustion.  Technology previously developed at Purdue will be used to modify the engine's injector so that the combustion instability occurs.  The dirty (soot laden) plume produced by this combustor better simulates the conditions present in full-scale hydrocarbon fueled engines.  Finally, the methodology for predicting combustion response from plume observations, developed under the Phase I effort,  will be matured.  The SDS system and accompanying software will be delivered to NASA for future application on NASA test facilities.  Successful completion of this project will provide a non-intrusive tool for detecting and diagnosing combustion instability that is superior to current, intrusive methods.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  Current NASA roadmaps point towards development of new hydrocarbon fueled engines.  Whether the new engines use kerosene or methane, both fuels have led to unstable combustor designs in the past; therefore, combustion stability will be important to NASA in the future.  Improved combustion stability diagnostic tools, especially ones that are non-intrusive to the combustor hardware, can be an important part of this future development.  If the technology proposed here works, complete combustor bomb test campaigns (which can be dangerous) may be eliminated with potential cost savings of millions of dollars.  Application of this technology to other combustion issues, such as combustion efficiency, can improve engine-specific impulse, which would improve overall CEV performance.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Successful application of this technology can be important to many other organizations that develop combustors, not only those in liquid rocket engines.  Combustion stability has plagued solid rocket motor development as well as air breathing aircraft engines and commercial burners.  An improved methodology to assess stability margin and diagnose problems could be applied throughout the combustor industry.  The Missile Defense Agency is also researching more accurate ways of typing threat missiles.  Data and instrumentation design developed in this effort could be directly used in developing new typing instrumentation and methods based on high frequency intensity variation.Entrepreneur rocket company developers often have many resources at their disposal, but ability to assess and solve combustion stability problems is not one of them.

T3RSS does this by using a Configuration Manager for a Dynamically Reconfigurable System (CMDRS). This piece of logic employs a Mission Survivability Assurance Algorithm (MSAA) for the subsystem.  Should radiation, manufacturing or even launch damage render a particular region of the FPGA temporarily or permanently unusable while on orbit, then the MSAA can shift the critical logic to a new region, or even to a new FPGA altogether. The shifting logic uses a network of components to maintain the ability of each logic block to communicate with the required memory and hardware. Ensuring that needed logic is always available ensures that the satellite can maintain 100% mission survivability even during failures.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  Mr. Clint Patrick is the Reconfigurable Computing point of contact for NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center.

He has expressed his full support of our research in an attached letter.The first program, Fault Tolerant Avionics, is researching the feasibility of including a single, reconfigurable FPGA as a 'common spare'. This spare would be a backup for the other avionics boards on the aircraft: if one goes down, the functionality of that system would be passed to the spare to take over in real-time. The T3RSS concept is directly applicable to this program because the same goals are being investigated. The second program is in support of Radiation-Hardened Electronics for Space Exploration (RHESE). Their self-training, autonomous, neural network is currently configured to run on powerful CPUs. The speed and power savings of moving this processing to logic would mean better performance out of the network, however, the size of each neuron implies that a 'shifting' or 'time-multiplexing' of logic within each FPGA would be needed. The on-demand and priority-driven algorithms developed for T3RSS to ensure the modules are where they're needed, when they're needed, could be the enabling technology for the redesign of  this system.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) 10.2 Potential Military ApplicationsThe Air Force's Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) is an initiative to build the technologies required to have a more reactive space industry.

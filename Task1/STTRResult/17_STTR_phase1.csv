Our proposal uses heat re-cycling to improve the energy efficiency of both regolith-to-ore enrichment and iron ore reduction. This heat re-cycling creates a bonus, the liberation of water (formerly bound to the regolith) as liquid water and a relatively low temperature water vapor. This water can be retrieved with the addition of a small condenser unit and a water storage tank/heat sink. Iron (and other transition metal) oxides are reduced using a reducing gas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide inside two multi-use vessels (MUVs, in which heat recycling is also done). The reduction makes metals, mostly iron, but also exhausts water and carbon dioxide. This exhaust is re-cycled to a water/carbon dioxide splitter that produces the hydrogen and carbon monoxide reducing gases and also oxygen. The preferred water/carbon dioxide splitter is a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) from Ceramatec (maker of the SOEC for NASA's MOXIE), and Ceramatec has asked to be included in the proposal with a budget placeholder as a supplier. Metal purification and steel powder making is done using carbonyl metallurgy techniques developed by BASF with a possible variation to replace steel powder making with metal vapor deposition to shaped steel objects (as previously advocated for by William Jenkins). It should be emphasized that the entire manufacturing chain, and an extended chain than includes 3D metal powder printing to finished steel objects, (i) can be operated by robots (that can also carry out ore mining), and (ii) the robots and equipment needed to carry out this mining and manufacturing chain can be made such that their entire combined total mass is small enough to fit in Mars landing craft payloads well under 2500 kg.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Martian iron ore mining through to steel-making, oxygen generation and water liberation, and then onto steel equipment fabrication, assembly and operation on Mars can start an expanding spiral of Martian activities for NASA. For example, it can produce more power generation equipment, such as re-orientable support structures for solar photovoltaic panels and steel solar parabolic dishes. Increasing electrical and thermal power generation on Mars is especially useful because almost all activities for human settlement of Mars need electrical and/or thermal power and all of these are limited (or given scope to expand) by the amount of such power that can be delivered. Steel-making and new power generation equipment can each facilitate an expansion of the capacity of the other, to create a coupled spiral of expansion of capacity. Expansions in the capacities of steel-making, steel fabrication and power generation, will also expand oxygen generation and water liberation capacities, but, also, expand capabilities in other areas; for example, panel- and scaffold-making for pressurized habitats, habitat plumbing and fixture manufacture, compressor, engine and spare part manufacture, and on. Steel-making, steel fabrication, power generation and robots can deliver Mars mission robustness by creating spare parts and extra parts that can be put to use to create settlement system reliability, self-repair and settlement growth.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposal's Martian iron ore processing could be applied to iron ore processing here on Earth. However, the economics of different methods of iron ore processing on Earth will be different from those on Mars, and it is unknown whether there is economic value for the process here on Earth. However, Martian steel-making uses zero carbon dioxide emissions iron oxide reduction. This realization has already caused an investigation into other methods for doing zero carbon dioxide emissions in iron oxide reduction here on Earth, that use renewable energy inputs, and this has caused the proposal's PI to draft patent applications for a new iron oxide reduction methods.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Conversion; In Situ Manufacturing; Metallics; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors),,Michigan State University,"428 S.

Current state-of-the-art models for SRM environment do not have the capability to simulate the accumulation and dynamics of slag in SRMs as they rely on a Lagrangian particle approach that is only capable of predicting the location of accumulation. In this STTR effort, CFDRC will team up with Mississippi State University and Tetra Research to develop models for quantifying the effects of slag accumulation and dynamics on SRM performance. To enhance current slag modeling capabilities, an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to accurately model a slag-phase is proposed, in which Lagrangian particles can be converted to an Eulerian description and vice-versa. The Phase I project aims at developing the basic numerical model for the transport and accumulation of a slag-phase in Loci/CHEM. The multiphase framework, comprising of gas-phase, a dense slag-phase, and Lagrangian particles representing aluminum and alumina, will be developed and demonstrated in the Phase I effort with a TRL starting at 2 and ending at 3. In Phase II, the models will be extended and validated to provide an accurate numerical approach for slag dynamics that incorporates many of the physical phenomena present during SRM operation, including the transfer from Eulerian to Lagrangian description of slag at burnout, increasing the technology readiness level by the end of a Phase II project from 3 to 5.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed physics-based multiphase model for the SRM environment will find a multitude of applications at NASA and for DoD and industry customers. The applications include: (1) Accurate modeling of slag accumulation during the operating of an SRM, (2) Quantitative analysis of the effect of slag accumulation on propellant conversion efficiency (3) Analysis of sloshing and the potential effects on SRM conning, (4) Assessment of slag as a potential debris hazard, and (5) Assessment of new concepts for SRM design and trade studies. At the end of Phase II, a well-validated suite of tools will be available to NASA and its government contractors to better understand SRM combustion and dynamics in large-scale solid rocket motors.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Companies such as Aerojet-Rocketdyne and Lockheed Martin can benefit from the advanced SRM modeling capabilities in the same way NASA can. The potential of understanding slag accumulation/dynamics in SRM can aid in designing high performance-cost ratio systems. In addition, the proposed slag model will have the capability to account for slag after SRM burnout, time at which slag poses as a potential hazard. This is of particular interest to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The transport of slag during operation of the SRM and after burnout are of critical importance to MDA to understand the radiation signature of the plume at burnout. The developed tools will be directly apply to these applications.","Analytical Methods; Fluids; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",,Mississippi State University,"133 Etheredge Hall, 449 Hardy Road, Mississippi State, MS 39762 - 9662",(662) 325-7404,Detailed Multiphysics Propulsion Modeling & Simulation Through Coordinated Massively Parallel Frameworks is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) are orbital multispectral imagers of Mars. THEMIS has 10 spectral bands in the 6-13 micrometers region and a spatial resolution of 100 m. TES has 143 spectral bands in the 5-50 micrometers range, but with low spatial resolution of 3x3 km. Although both have been used to map out the surface composition of Mars, there are some limitations. First, THEMIS has low spectral resolution that may not provide accurate surface characterization. Second, TES has low spatial resolution that cannot provide fine spatial details of surface characteristics. Roughly speaking, each TES pixel contains about 900 THEMIS pixels. It is therefore very challenging to fuse the two data sets. We propose a novel and accurate framework that can deal with the above challenge. The framework is based on the latest development in image registration, image fusion, anomaly detection, pixel classification using hyperspectral images, and concentration estimation. First, a two-step image registration algorithm is proposed to align the THEMIS and TES bands. Subpixel accuracy can be achieved. Second, a novel image fusion algorithm is proposed to fuse THEMIS and TES bands to generate an image cube with 143 bands of 100-m resolution images. Our algorithm has been proven to be better than state-of-the-art fusion algorithms. Third, we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm for detecting interesting regions in the fused image cube. This algorithm is known as cluster kernel Reed Xiaoli (CKRX) and has high performance in anomaly detection. Fourth, a sparsity based approach is proposed to perform accurate rock classification. Finally, a deep learning based algorithm is proposed to estimate the chemical composition of the rocks for better surface characterization.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Accurate Mars surface characterization will be important for Mars exploration. It should be noted that, for Earth observations, there are imagers that are similar to the above instruments for Mars. For example, the Worldview-3 imager collects high resolution visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) images at sub-meter resolution whereas the NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), etc. are collecting low resolution (hundreds of meters) multispectral images. For some future hyperspectral imagers like the NASA HyspIRI with hundreds of bands as shown in website: http://hyspiri.jpl.nasa.gov/science, the spatial resolution is only about 30 meters. It will be good to fuse the high resolution Worldview images with MODIS, AVHRR, and HyspIRI images to yield high resolution in both spatial and spectral domains. Consequently, many applications, including urban monitoring, vegetation monitoring, fire and flood damage assessment, etc., will benefit from the high spatial and high spectral resolution images.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Our proposed surface characterization system can be used for military surveillance and reconnaissance and civilian applications such as border patrol, coastal monitoring, vegetation monitoring, urban development monitoring, etc. The combined market can be over 5 million dollars over the next decade. The market size is based on an estimated of users of 5,000 and a unit price of $1,000 per software.","Data Fusion; Data Processing; Display; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",,Arizona State University,"781 E Terrace Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 - 1404",(541) 519-1903,Technologies for Planetary Compositional Analysis and Mapping is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This work will result in a high-fidelity, high-performance multiphysics simulation capability to enhance NASA's current simulation capability of unsteady turbulent reacting flows involving cryogenic propellants. This novel FAM model utilizes a combustion submodel assignment, combining flamelet-based combustion models (such as inert-mixing models, equilibrium chemistry, diffusion-flame Flamelet/Progress Variable (FPV) or premixed-flame models) for the computationally efficient characterization of quasi one-dimensional, steady, and equilibrated combustion regimes, with combustion models of higher physical fidelity (such as thickened flame models, reduced/lumped chemistry models) for accurate representation of topologically complex combustion regions (associated with flame-anchoring, autoignition, flame-liftoff, thermoacoustic coupling, and non-equilibrium combustion processes) that are not adequately represented by the current flamelet model in Loci-STREAM. In FAM, the selection of a combustion submodel from a set of models available to a CFD-combustion solver is based on user-specific information about quantities of interest and a local error control. With this information, FAM performs an identification procedure for an optimal combustion submodel assignment from the available combustion models that.

(ESAero) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will create a methodology for the development of a flight control algorithm featuring differential thrust provided by a distributed electric propulsion (DEP) system. The focal piece of the study is a dynamically scaled Cirrus SR22T UAV at UIUC, which will be modified to include multiple electrical ducted fans (EDF) arranged to exhibit strong propulsion-airframe integration (PAI) effects. Although aeropropulsive efficiency of the DEP system will be monitored, the team's goal is to establish a methodology which can be applied to any DEP aircraft regardless of how well it is designed. The study will include a combination of low-order aerodynamic simulation via OpenVSP/VSPAERO, dynamics modeling in MATLAB/Simulink, wind tunnel characterization of the EDF units, and flight testing to educate and demonstrate the flight control algorithm. During Phase I, the team will characterize the baseline vehicle as the control for the experiment and then compare measured control authority of the DEP system against a simple thrust-line dynamics model to determine the influence of PAI. Subsequent phases will develop and demonstrate closed-loop flight control using differential thrust from the DEP system.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Flight control of DEP aircraft using differential thrust has been identified as an enabling technology for ARMD's Strategic Thrust #3 (Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles) and #4 (Transition to Low-Carbon Propulsion). In particular, it is a major component of the envisioned hybrid electric distributed propulsion (HEDP) integrated autonomous controller (IAC) (a.k.a.

Following the end of this period, the system can continue to generate useful power for additional tens of minutes.In Phase I, for the power converter system, we will demonstrate feasibility of fabricating a critical component in larger areas (5 cm x 5 cm), and for the metal hydride (MH) system, we will experimentally characterize the MH decomposition/recombination reactions that enable continual electrical power generation for a useful duration after the period of high thermal intensity has ended.

The proposed technology would generate electrical power during the hot atmospheric descent as well as surface operations. Another example would be a planetary sample return mission, where a small probe ascends a high speed through the atmosphere, with the converter providing power generated from scavenging heat from the vehicle's heat shield. Planetary missions to Venus and Mars are presently a part of the NASA roadmaps.

However, the repair and subsequent inspection methods for these materials are considerably more complicated. Typically, a composite laminate patch must be manually fabricated and bonded or co-cured to the damaged structure. To ensure high quality patches with sufficient compaction and low void content, significant time, preparation and equipment is required. Current surface preparations require time consuming labor and can be a risk for further damage. The ideal repair methodology would allow for a rapid structural repair to be performed on-site in locations with minimal access and without the need for extensive tooling, surface prep, cure times and complicated inspection techniques. Engineers at Luna have developed a number of technologies that have the potential to enable high performance composite repair and inspection during pre-launch ground processing. Luna's comprehensive system will realize improvements via facile surface preparation, reduction of specialized fabrication equipment, rapid-on-demand curing resins and utilization of Luna's unique fiber optic measurement capability for monitoring repair state. This Phase I program will focus on developing these methods for composite damage that can be performed during ground processing of the launch vehicle without the need for full replacement","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Luna's composite repair system will be directly applicable to launch pad damage mitigation activities for current and future launch vehicles. Ground processing operators will be able to identify the damage that will require patching and Luna's technology will enable rapid surface preparation, patch bonding, vacuum debulking and consolidation without the need for complicated tooling or equipment. This should dramatically reduce time and energy costs while maintaining high probabilities of mission success.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Luna's technology is applicable to a wide range of composite material systems, manufacturing methods, and applications. The barrier and curative approaches can be adapted to prepreg systems that would have prolonged room temperature storage capability with the ability to be quickly cured, out of autoclave and on-demand. The impact of these systems on the broad composite commercial market could be enormous. A good example where the technology would be directly applicable and would make a dramatic impact is the military and commercial aerospace industry, where optimal performance is required of structural components for the absolute maximum weight savings.","Composites; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Polymers; Structures",,Aerospace Corp,"2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245 - 4609",(310) 336-5664,Technologies to Enable Novel Composite Repair Methods is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Improvements in coupling microstructure prediction models to local process conditions, validation, and control of material microstructure are required to mature the state of the art. To address these needs, CFDRC in partnership with Arizona State University will develop and apply modeling and simulation tools for prediction and control of microstructure in SLM fabricated parts. The Phase I effort will establish critical software elements, modeling methodology, and experimental data analysis required for Phase II. We will demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity models that are capable of predicting the formation of key metallurgical microstructures observed in SLM additive manufacturing processes as a function of the local thermal environment at different locations within the as-built component, reduced models for mapping process conditions to additional microstructure features impacting material quality, and potentially controlling material quality throughout a sample as-built part. The Phase II program will focus on the development of efficient, validated high-fidelity simulation codes and reduced models providing the means to reduce variability in as-built material microstructure and properties, and culminate with the delivery to these tools to NASA researchers and other stakeholders.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA has identified a number of components within the SLS, including RS-25 engine parts, which provide the opportunity for significant cost and time savings if additive manufacturing can be used for their production.

The new array uses a robust, ultra-light, color-mixing Fresnel lens to point-focus sunlight at a 25X concentration ratio onto the most advanced 4-junction and 6-junction inverted metamorphic (IMM) photovoltaic cells. Waste heat from the cells is dissipated to space by a bio-inspired nyctinastic graphene radiator. The radiator passively folds up around the cell, like a flower at night, to reduce the drastic temperature drop in deep space, due to the reduction in solar irradiance at large distances from the sun. The 25X concentration and the high-optical-efficiency lens eliminate the low-intensity (LI) problem by maintaining an irradiance on the cell of nearly one AM0 sun at 5 AU distance from the sun. The nyctinastic radiator mitigates the low-temperature (LT) problem of conventional arrays by maintaining the cell temperature at about -100 C instead of the typical -140 C at 5 AU. This warmer cell temperature minimizes changes in band gaps for the 4 junctions or 6 junctions in the cell, thereby maintaining better current matching for the series-connected junctions. The performance metrics of the new array are unprecedented. The expensive solar cells are reduced in area and cost by 95% compared to conventional one-sun cells. The cells can be heavily shielded front and back from space radiation at very low mass penalty, due to the small cell size. The overall specific power of the lens + cell assembly + radiator is more than 1,400 W/kg for a heavily shielded cell, about 3X better than for a one-sun cell with the same shielding. The feasibility of the new array technology will be proven in Phase I by the small business (Mark O'Neill, LLC), the research institution (University of Connecticut), and the IMM cell firm (SolAero). In Phase II, fully functional hardware will be developed and delivered.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The new array will apply to a wide range of NASA missions, most of which use solar power. The new array's superior attributes include LILT-mitigation, scalability to high power, radiation hardness at low mass penalty, reliable high-voltage operation, outstanding power metrics (specific power, areal power density, and stowed power volume), and low cost per Watt. The LILT mitigation will be ideal for deep space missions to the outer planets and their moons. These other attributes will be especially important for high-power missions of all types, including Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) missions. The high unit cost (e.g., >$10/sq.cm.) of advanced multi-junction solar cells (e.g., IMM cells), may make conventional one-sun solar arrays too expensive for very high-power NASA missions, such as, for example, 300-600 kW SEP tugs to carry large amounts of cargo from low earth orbit (LEO) to GEO, the Earth-Moon Lagrange Points, lunar orbit, Mars orbit, or beyond. For such high-power missions, the new array could be mission-enabling because of its much lower cost per Watt, combined with its superior performance attributes, compared to one-sun arrays. The new array is also high-temperature-capable, allowing inner planet missions or slingshot trajectories to the outer planets. Potential NASA customers of the new array therefore include the Space Technology Directorate, the Science Directorate, and the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The new array will apply to a wide range of non-NASA space missions, most of which use solar power.

Rough-terrain mobility, site surveying, and dexterous manipulation all demand a fully 3D map of the world that simultaneously exhibits large scale and high resolution, a situation we refer to as scale disparity. Most robots discretize the world into a uniform-grid that is used to accumulate evidence from multiple measurements. Unfortunately the memory footprint of such maps grows dramatically with scale disparity. Octrees can lessen memory requirements, but do not fully counteract the exponential growth of the underlying grid representation. In response, we are developing a map representation called an Evidence Mesh that provides the benefits of probabilistic treatment of evidence but performs better under scale disparity. It is based on a triangulated mesh and is compatible with well-known simplification algorithms to represent the shape of objects at adjustable levels of fidelity. Like an evidence grid but unlike other mesh-based mapping methods available today, an Evidence Mesh accumulates evidence about the location of objects through simplification and across multiple sensor measurements, enabling robust noise filtering and avoiding artifacts and aliasing introduced by artificial grid structures.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Our work will produce an efficient map-representation that can be used by NASA's terrestrial experiments today and by missions in the future. We plan to release an open-source implementation for use by NASA. Evidence Meshes support Topic TA04 of NASA's RTA Systems Roadmap as follows: An Evidence Mesh is a natural framework for sensor fusion, which has relevance to NASA-relevant tasks such as grasping and manipulating objects. Manipulation tasks like these often face severe challenges from scale disparity. For example, an ISS map for robotic EVA must be large to support path-planning, yet must have sufficient resolution to model the fine geometry of small tools involved in the task. Planetary-surface rovers will also benefit from enhanced terrain mapping capability. Motion planning over very rough terrain (e.g., cliffs, lava tubes) requires large-scale yet high-fidelity terrain maps. Evidence Meshes are well suited for this becaus they address scale disparity and, because they use triangulated meshes, they support a variety of well-known collision detection algorithms. Their probabilistic framework makes Evidence Meshes a natural representation for planning algorithms that deal with uncertainty, such as probabilistic roadmaps. Evidence Meshes will also benefit existing visualization tools for mission planners and science teams by providing an efficient, compressible data format for transmitting maps via low-bandwidth communications channels.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The challenge of scale disparity abounds in industrial and commercial applications, so Evidence Meshes have clear potential outside NASA. For example, driverless cars model the road ahead with grids that can be on the order of 100 meters but must model potentially dangerous objects that are only tens of centimeters in size. Indoor applications that need fully 3D maps, such as robotic manipulation for assembly or for household tasks, suffer even more from the scale-disparity problem. We see the potential for Evidence Meshes to become an underlying technology for disparate products, including: Map-building software for robotic manipulation, especially in factory and logistics applications.

SVGS was developed at NASA MSFC for application on cubesats and small satellites to enable autonomous rendezvous and capture, and formation flying. SPHERES are free-flying robots that have been used for numerous experiments on board ISS. Their metrology system is based on ultrasonic beacons, and does not operate correctly with large flyers due to multi-path signal reflections. The main objective of this study is the integration of SVGS (as vision-based position and attitude sensor) with the SPHERES GN&C environment. Successful integration will be demonstrated by 3DOF vision-based guidance, navigation and motion control experiments on a flat floor using the RINGS ground units available at Florida Tech. Performance assessment will be done by a vision-based metrology system based on data fusion using high resolution cameras. A path forward for deployment on ISS will be developed in coordination with NASA ARC.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) (1) The proposed effort will deliver a positioning/metrology system based on smartphones that can be used for navigation and positioning control applications in space robotics.

This proposal seeks to address this need by developing DEP aircraft analysis tools able to accurately predict and optimize aerodynamic and aeroelastic performance, loads, flight dynamics and acoustics of DEP aircraft in computational times commensurate with daily design work. The proposed approach is to leverage and enhance existing V/STOL aircraft analysis and flight simulation software with new capabilities that address current gaps in technology identified by NASA in this solicitation and developers of DEP aircraft. The new comprehensive DEP aircraft analysis will be built in a modular fashion, coupling flight simulation, aeromechanics and acoustics components into a single tool but with an eye toward implementing each transportable software library within alternate analyses and optimization tools, such as NASA's Multidisciplinary Design, Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) platform. In Phase I, a prototype DEP aircraft comprehensive analysis will be created and validated for accurate, fast prediction of DEP-related aeromechanics phenomena. A modular form of the new analysis will be coupled with a flight simulation enhanced to support additional control options available to DEP aircraft like variable RPM and thrust vectoring. Automated coupling with an acoustic prediction code will provide DEP aircraft acoustic characteristics for both steady and maneuvering flight. A model of NASA's SCEPTOR X-Plane will be constructed and demonstration calculations performed predicting flight dynamics, acoustics, aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.

This thrust vectoring capability allows the aircraft to utilize thrust borne flight for vertical takeoff and landing as well as the conventional configuration for more efficient liftborne flight operations. The pitching moment is typically controlled by one or more propellers that is/are either mounted statically to the tail (Canadair CL-84) or attached to an articulated tail wing plane (NASAGL-10). In contrast to a tiltrotor, the lifting and control surfaces of a tiltwing are immersed in the slipstream of the attached propellors, potentially delaying the onset of stall during transitions and also allowing, for example, the ailerons to provide some yaw control in the hover configuration.Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) is a natural enhancement for tiltwing aircraft, where additional thrust can be used in vertical take-off and landing (and transition) operations and then scaled back (and tucked away) for conventional flight operations. The use of a centralized electric power plant for DEP leads to an increased payload capacity without large sacrifices in endurance and efficiency, all while maintaining its VTOL capabilities.Our goal is the development of a flight maneuvering system for distributed electric propulsion, toward this end we propose the development of model analysis and design tools and techniques focused in particular on the transition maneuvers. The proposed innovation will facilitate the development of analytical tools and methods with which to assess the tiltwing vehicles using DEP; this includes aerodynamic force and moment models for transition,dynamic simulations for trajectory exploration, and tools for trajectory optimization.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) GL-10 programThe foremost application for NASA would be for their own GL-10 prototype aircraft.

(ACT) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) propose to develop a thermo-radiative cell to harvest energy from waste heat, for example, from radiators. Currently NASA's Top Technical Challenge is the need to ""increase available power"". Additionally, NASA has a Grand Challenge as ""Affordable and Abundant Power"" for NASA mission activities. The thermo-radiative cell technology uses semiconductor p-n junctions, similar to the photovoltaic cell but with smaller band gap semiconductor, to convert heat to electricity. This technology makes use of the extremely cold dark universe (~3K) as the natural heat sink and low-grade waste heat (~50-100℃) as the heat source. The imbalance of the thermal radiation emitted and absorbed by the cell will cause the imbalance of the charge carrier motion in the p-n junction, i.e., generating electrical power. The overall technical objective of Phase I and Phase II projects is to develop a thermo-radiative cell system that can generate practically usable power as supplementary power for the electronics on space vehicles, platforms or habitats. During Phase I, ACT will fabricate a cryogenic system to investigate the performance the thermo-radiative cell made of commercial available InSb, HgCdZnTe, PbSe, or InAs wafers. The cryogenic system will use liquid nitrogen to create a stable low temperature environment. Performance investigation includes the power density and energy efficiency at different heat source temperatures for the non-optimized cell material component and structure in Phase I.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The immediate NASA application of this technology is to provide additional power from low grade waste heat, whenever a view of deep space is available. This can be important for outer planet missions. NASA is considering solar power for some NASA outer planet missions, due to the shortage of General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS). Scavenging waste heat to supplement the limited solar power is necessary. In addition, the thermo-radiative cells can improve the efficiency of radioisotope power systems, powered by either thermoelectric or Stirling convertors. Due to the low efficiency of the thermoelectric systems (~7%), there is still significant thermal energy dissipated as low-grade waste heat via the radiator. The proposed thermo-radiative cell technology could satisfy this energy harvesting need and reduce the mass/volume of overall energy systems. In addition, this technology is well-aligned with the NASA Strategic Roadmap (TA 3: Space Power and Energy Storage) as it may have many in-space applications such as on spacecraft or planetary explorers.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Radiative cooling has recently started to commercialize, with companies providing cooling by radiating to the night sky.

After sunset, the panels can flip to allow the thermo-radiative cell side facing up.

CrossTrac Engineering, Inc., in cooperation with our partners Professor Kerri Cahoy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Mr. Paul Graven of Cateni, Inc., proposes to develop a free space optical communications and ranging system with inherent precision pointing as a 1U module for 3U and larger CubeSats requiring intersatellite crosslinks. Based on technology developed by Professor Cahoy and her team at MIT, the module will enable small satellites to achieve the sub-milliradian pointing control of the optical beam necessary to close laser crosslinks at ranges from 200 km to 1000 km with input power of less than 20 W and data rates of 100 Mbps and greater, all within a 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm (1U) volume or smaller. The proposed work is directly aligned with the STTR solicitation T11.02 and the objectives of Technology Area 5.1 Optical Communications and Navigation in the NASA 2015 Technology Roadmap.1 Optical crosslinks are a key technology that will enable new multi-spacecraft CubeSat and microsatellite missions. These missions include large constellations for global data distribution and rapid response Earth imaging and asset tracking as well as swarm missions that, among other tasks, can be formed into sparse aperture systems providing unprecedented image resolution. These swarm missions require precise relative position knowledge as well. The optical terminal being developed under this effort will provide this sub-mm level relative position knowledge. Furthermore, the free space optical crosslinks can be used to make atmospheric composition and thermophysical measurements (e.g., via laser occultation).","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The optical communications terminal and networking concept developed under this effort will provide new capabilities to small spacecraft operating in constellations and swarms, allowing them to transfer large amounts of data around the network while simultaneously measuring the positions of the spacecraft relative to one another. This development will support NASA constellation and swarm missions, providing a high data rate network and precision metrology system. Swarms of spacecraft, relying on the close coordination of action to perform a mission in unison that cannot be performed by a single spacecraft, can use this technology to explore Earth-Sun interaction by measuring spatial variations in electromagnetic fields and create large sparse aperture imaging systems with unprecedented resolution, among other applications. These swarm missions can be performed around other celestial bodies, comets, near-Earth objects just as well as they can around the Earth.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In many ways, commercial ventures have led the way in the development of capable CubeSat platforms and the exploitation of their capabilities to meet customer needs. The optical terminal and related network will enhance the capabilities of existing imaging and asset tracking CubeSat constellations by providing a means to move large amounts of data through the constellation quickly, reducing data transfer latency and making more efficient use of ground stations. Proposed constellations that intend to provide data services to customers throughout the world even in remote locations will require crosslinks to provide immediate connections between users and distributed ground stations. Optical crosslinks will be necessary for these users to move the large amounts of data they produce. Swarms of spacecraft, relying on the close coordination of action to perform a mission in unison that cannot be performed by a single spacecraft, can use this technology to create large sparse aperture imaging systems with unprecedented resolution, among other applications.

It addresses problems of early anomaly and fault detection in PMAD systems, adopting a larger scope by also including the thermal system. Truly autonomous operation of large power systems (e.g. ISS) cannot be scripted. In the quest to replace expert human operator functions by intelligent applications capable of self-healing and management, two key pillars are prerequisites to achieve a sufficient degree of correct self-aware behavior: a reliable model of internal system behavior, and efficient and reliable ways to deal with external and internal information.On these areas, the innovation will extend the ideas behind the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM, which solves non-equivocally the steady-state equations of electrical power systems), to encompass a larger heterogeneous system: the joint electrical and thermal system. Rationale: being both critical and inter-dependent, they need a holistic approach. The innovation builds first on their joint operational physical model, seen as algebraic equations. The focus will be on its eventual future use as the computational engine for autonomous operation applications. HELM is a computational engine in intelligent decision-support for operations in transmission grids, and is currently being adapted to spacecraft DC grids.The second innovation context is data processing for self-aware behavior algorithms, proposing convergence of the physical model-based approach (HELM) and emerging unsupervised Big Data/Machine Learning techniques.

A Doppler radar now provides wind measurements that satisfy this requirement at the Eastern Test Range. Thermodynamic soundings are provided by intermittent radiosondes on launch day. Typical intervals of an hour or more between radiosonde launches and drift distances of 100 km or more at 20 km height limit their timeliness and accuracy in characterizing the atmosphere along the launch path. NASA is seeking a thermodynamic remote sensing system with higher timeliness and accuracy, in clear and cloudy conditions. Current Radiometrics (RDX) microwave radiometer profilers provide continuous thermodynamic profiles from the surface to 10 km height, with radiosonde equivalent accuracy up to several km height, with decreasing accuracy at higher levels. The RDX profiler also provides cloud and atmospheric stability information that can be used to identify lightning risk. Improved thermodynamic profiler accuracy, and pressure profiling capability, have been demonstrated using variational retrieval methods that include model gridded analysis. Variational retrievals can also extend accurate thermodynamic and pressure profiling to 20 km height.

The μG-LilyPond features several innovations relative to state of the art, including passive water and nutrient delivery to floating plants, volume efficiency, minimal time for maintenance, full life-cycle (seed to seed) support, and crop flexibility.  Small floating macrophytes like Duckweed and Azolla are 100% edible (with no inedible biomass), nutritious (high in protein), exceptionally fast growing, and able to thrive in nutrient rich wastewater. The μG-LilyPond concept aims to maximize production of these tiny plants in a very small volume, for use as a crew dietary supplement, atmospheric revitalization component (CO2 reduction to O2), and potentially a metabolic wastewater treatment facility.

The DISCUS will be based on advanced distributed state estimation techniques, probabilistic guidance and control under collision avoidance and other relevant mission constraints, real-time contingency management including reactive collision avoidance with un-responsive team members, and low-level fault-tolerant control robust to subsystem and component failures. Decentralized estimation is based on using RSS (Received Signal strength) and TOA (Time of Arrival) sensors, and fusion of information from EO (Electro-Optical) sensors. Guidance and Control (G&C) is based on extensions of an innovative approach to swarm density control using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach with guaranteed satisfaction of the ergodicity, motion, and safety constraints.

For instance, Smallsat swarms replacing current space implementations of Synthetic Aperture Radars can substantially decrease the launch cost and cost of deployment. Other applications of Smallsat swarms include sparse aperture sensing, stellar interferometry, and global broadband internet via satellite swarms. Swarms of Smallsats could also provide global real-time space weather monitoring in a way that is presently not possible from a single satellite. A swarm of satellites in orbit can provide a survey of the geomagnetic field and its temporal evolution, and gain new insights into improving our knowledge of the Earth's interior and climate.

Existing capabilities for modeling the turbulent plume physics during early lift-off are too dissipative to accurately resolve the propagation of acoustic waves throughout the launch environment. Higher fidelity non-dissipative analysis tools are critically needed to design mitigation measures (such as water deluge) and launch pad geometry for current and future launch vehicles. This project will build upon existing capabilities to develop and deliver breakthrough technologies to drastically improve predictions of transient acoustic loading for launch vehicles in motion during early lift-off. Innovative hybrid CFD/CAA techniques based on RANS/LES modeling for acoustic generation physics and an unstructured discontinuous Galerkin method will be employed to model long distance acoustic wave propagation along with vehicle motion using ideally-suited high-order accurate schemes. This new paradigm enables: (1) Greatly reduced dissipation and dispersion; (2) Improved modeling of acoustic interactions with complex geometry; and (3) Automatic identification of transient acoustic environment including vehicle motion.

Urine is a readily available commodity in space that is rich in valuable nutrients for plant growth. Humans produce individually about 500 L of urine per year that contains ~7 g/L of nitrogen (N), ~1 g/L phosphorous (P), and ~2 g/L potassium (K). NanoSonic shall fabricate tailored nanocomposite ultrafiltration membranes that selectively capture key nutrients from urine through tailored binding chemistries, while filtering away undesirable components including sodium. The nutrients will then be eluted from the membrane and available in a useful form for direct application on plant soil. NanoSonic's membranes have excellent chemical and mechanical properties allowing for repeated use over long time periods, thereby limiting the need for replacement. Moreover, their high thermal transition temperature (~190C) permits serviceability in space where the temperature can range from ~-150C to +120C. Our STTR partners, Professors He and Vikesland in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech, are experts in nutrient recovery and the use of nanotechnology for wastewater treatment. During Phase I, together with Virginia Tech, NanoSonic will increase the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5 of our simple, lightweight, and low-cost filtration membranes through membrane analyses. TRL 7 shall be achieved during Phase II with industry support from our Environmental Engineering partners at 3e for nutrient extraction from urine to be deployed for plant growth in space on board the International Space Station (ISS).","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NanoSonic envisions several applications for the NASA sponsored technology on membranes that will enable food production in space through nutrient recovery. First, NanoSonic intends to manufacture nutrient recovery kits to be used by NASA for food production in space. The ability to grow food in space helps solve a big problem in space travel: the price of transporting food. NASA's International Space Station and Spacecraft Processing Directorate estimates that it costs ~$10,000 per pound to send food to the ISS. NanoSonic's membranes could also be modified to recycle water; that is, take urine, flush water, and even condensate and purify it for drinking water.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Membranes are widely used materials in water treatment, medical, and laboratory research.

The largest sub market is in the treatment of water and wastewater, which contributes half of all sales. This market is growing at a fast pace with opportunities associated with the increasing demand for nutrients. The integration of recovery technologies provides the opportunity for additional revenue by providing the agricultural industry with necessary nutrients. The main challenge for the market, and one that the proposed technology by NanoSonic can overcome, is the problem associated with the lifespan of membranes: the efficacy of the membrane decreases over time due to fouling, requiring replacement and increasing operational and maintenance costs.","Composites; Crop Production (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation); Nanomaterials; Polymers; Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment",,Virginia Tech,"800 Washington St, SW, Blacksburg, VA 24061 - 0000",(540) 231-6000,Space Exploration Plant Growth is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

One of the biggest hurdles to the adoption of AM of metals is the qualification of additively manufactured parts while currently available systems are based largely on hand-tuned parameters determined by trial-and-error for a limited set of materials with significant uncertainty. A comprehensive ICME approach is needed to address this issue by modeling the process-structure-property chain to predict performance of AM parts. We propose to improve state-of-the-art modeling for AM by coupling FEM codes with materials phase transformation and precipitation simulation software. The Phase I focus on determining the ICME framework architecture and identifying the necessary models as building blocks, as well as key data and experiments for calibration and validation.

Distributed mission architectures allow for multipoint in-situ measurements, multi-angle viewpoints, and considerably improved understanding of the connections between separately measured phenomena and their time variations. DSMs are particularly important for NASA's efforts to better understand Sun-Earth interactions, space weather, and heliophysics, and they deliver operational and scientific benefits for missions to small bodies and planetary satellites as well. In all cases these missions impose unique operational requirements that can stress ground tracking stations and mission operators by increasing the number of vehicles or create challenges when establishing sufficient communications contacts. These DSM challenges can be addressed by employing automation both on board and on the ground. Moving autonomous operations on board the spacecraft mitigates both the operational burden of such missions as well as the ground segment congestion faced in these scenarios. Advanced Space proposes developing a real-time (RT), open source, embedded software (ESW) application for on-board maneuver planning and relative orbit determination that is compatible with NASA's Core Flight System (cFS) and that enables DSMs to operate with increased autonomy in their spacecraft operations. In combination with cFS, an on-board software engine capable of employing a linearized solution of Lambert's problem will yield a powerful and enabling application for a wide variety of missions using distributed spacecraft arrangements.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA has targeted heliophysics, Earth sciences, and planetary sciences as high-priority areas of scientific interest. Developing advanced distributed spacecraft capabilities will strongly advance NASA's ability to investigate and understand the complex physical interactions characteristic in these areas. NASA's goals in heliophysics are particularly well-suited for the proposed application. Understanding phenomena like magnetic reconnection in geospace requires multi-point, multi-instrument data acquisition over short and long time scales. Obtaining sufficient quality and quantity of data to characterize these environments will remain difficult until distributed systems of spacecraft working with significant more autonomy are available. Stereographic and multi-viewpoint imaging enables the resolution of features and their setting in detail that is simply unobtainable via single spacecraft observations. The notional MEDICI mission proposes using two spacecraft to observe the same environment from differing angles to obtain a stereographic view of ionospheric behavior.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Other government agencies can leverage this technology in multiple applications and environments.

While astronomical objects are rich in the desired metallic elements, these elements are in the form inappropriate for use in Additive Manufacturing processes. Lynntech, in collaboration with University of Texas El Paso, proposes to develop a process to convert material from its native state (typically an oxide dispersed in a silicate matrix) to one suitable for use in Additive Manufacturing methods to allow the direct fabrication of complex parts in space. Proposed process consists of four steps: grinding of the native material for ease of processing, reduction of oxides to zero valent metal, conversion of the metal to a volatile form for separation and recovery, and direct formation of metal powder in a size and purity suitable for use in Additive Manufacturing. Our unique process requires relatively low temperatures, recycles all the reagents (thus there is no need for consumables), and produces oxygen as a byproduct.  Phase I effort will demonstrate the reduction, volatilization, and powder formation steps for nickel and iron using regolith simulant as the feedstock. Recovered metal powders will be thoroughly characterized for use in powder-based Additive Manufacturing processes.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Producing the materials needed to fabricate structures and vehicles is a critical requirement for the long-term occupation of space. If everything had to be delivered from Earth, the cost would be overwhelming. The process proposed here will allow the production of iron and nickel almost anywhere in the solar system in a form appropriate for use in Additive Manufacturing without consuming any material that must be brought from Earth. Once in the powder form the metals, if desired, can readily be converted to other forms such as rods, ingots, and sheets for use with conventional fabrication methods. Therefore, proposed process allows supplying both additive and conventional fabrication processes with metal.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The volatilization-based process to be used in the proposed project is already known as an effective method of producing high purity metals. Pure metals produced by this process are generally more expensive compared to those produced by other processes (for instance, iron reduced with coke), which limits their use to high value applications. A direct application of the proposed process is to permit the straight fabrication of metal in a form suitable for Additive Manufacturing processes rather than making bulk material and reducing its particle size. Indirectly, improvements made as part of this project will contribute to reducing the price gap and increasing the number of applications that can cost effectively use high purity iron and nickel.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); In Situ Manufacturing",,University of Texas El Paso,"500 W University, El Paso, TX 79968 - 0001",(915) 757-6465,Regolith Resources Robotics - R^3 is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

In this proposed Phase I STTR effort, material testing coupled with health monitoring techniques will be used to quantify damage accumulation within composite materials, both standard ply thickness and of the thin-ply design. A multi-scale physics based approach, verified with empirical data, will be used to develop a design tool capable of predicting the useable life of a composite structure subjected to cyclic loads.A fracture mechanics based model in a multi-scale framework is proposed as a design tool for modeling thin-ply laminates. The key variable of the model, the microcracking critical energy release rate (CERR), is to be calibrated to quasi-static and fatigue testing. Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring will be used to quantify the crack density as a function of load history. The model will be interrogated with CERRs to best match the crack density as a function of load observed during the experiments. If the CERR is indeed a material property, the same value should exist regardless of ply thickness and fiber architecture. The design tool will include a stand-alone program to perform this calibration of the CERR for cross-ply laminates.

These arrays have been used as high frequency filters and in radar, stealth and advanced antenna applications, and more recently, as sensors. In particular, FSS-based sensing has found a home as a next-generation structural health monitoring (SHM) approach. FSS sensors are inherently wireless and passive, and are interrogated remotely via microwave energy. These sensors can be embedded in layered dielectric (non-conducting) structures during manufacture or installed during the service lifetime on the surface (conductive or dielectric). Microwaves penetrate through dielectrics, so in the case of layered structures, FSS sensors can be placed on materials/layers of interest that may be covered by additional dielectrics (such as reentry heat tiles covered with insulation). Multiple sensing parameters can be concurrently sensed through proper sensor design and interrogation, as is illustrated below through a strain and temperature sensor.

The key reason for developing a nuclear powered rocket is the vast energy density gain of nuclear fuel when compared to chemical combustion. Current nuclear fusion efforts are wholly inappropriate for space transportation as the application of a reactor-based fusion-electric system creates a colossal mass and heat rejection problem in space. The Fusion Driven Rocket (FDR) represents a revolutionary approach to fusion propulsion where the power source releases its energy directly into the propellant, not requiring conversion to electricity. Several lithium metal shells are magnetically driven by induction to converge radially and axially and form a thick blanket surrounding the target plasmoid and compressing it to fusion conditions. The lithium is rapidly vaporized, ionized and accelerated to high exhaust velocity (> 30 km/s) as virtually all of the radiant, neutron and particle energy from the fusion plasma is absorbed by the encapsulating, metal blanket thereby isolating the spacecraft from the fusion process and eliminating the need for large radiator mass. This energy, in addition to the intense Ohmic heating at peak magnetic field compression, is. T, while having no significant physical interaction with the spacecraft limiting the thermal heat load and thus radiator mass. The FDR can be realized with little extrapolation from existing technology, at high specific power (~ 1 kW/kg), at a reasonable mass scale (<100 mt), and cost. The prime objective of the phase I project is to address the most critical element of the FDR concept, that is the validation of the fusion physics by an experimental demonstration of fusion energy production at a scale that would justify the FDR prototype to be demonstrated in phase II can reach fusion gain conditions (TRL 4) and justify the future investment required to fully develop the FDR concept.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The most significant commercial application by far for the proposed Fusion Driven Rocket propulsion system would be the enabling of a wide range of manned and unmanned planetary missions with a rapid Mars mission as the most significant first step.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The basic methodology for fusion energy generation employed in the Fusion Driven Rocket has the clear application to electrical power generation producing no atmospheric carbon while avoiding the hazardous waste and nuclear proliferation issues.

Such infrastructure will include some type of landing pads. In order to reduce the volume/mass of construction materials to be transported from Earth, it will be critical to utilize in-situ resources as the main construction material. Regolith seems to be the most logical choice given its abundance and easy access. The proposed technology would allow for the robotic construction of critical structures in-situ using native resources. In Phase I we therefore propose to:Determine the ideal shapes for the building blocks that will allow mechanical jointing and construction of horizontal (landing pads, roads, etc.) and vertical (habitat, shelter, etc.) structures. Manufacture the molds to fabricate these building blocks.Fine tune the sintering process (thermal profile) to ensure repeatability of the fabrication of the material.Produce prototype building blocks and test their structural properties and strength of the joints.

Development of a suitable construction grade material, or materials, derived directly from Lunar/Mars regolith without utilizing any additives could significantly advance ISRU options for the construction of infrastructure, equipment protection or habitats while reducing the amount of raw materials required to be transported from Earth. A significant advantage of the processes suggested in this proposal relies on the simplicity of the concept. The raw material can go directly from the ground and into the production line without having to go through any separation, refinement or synthesis process. Different grades of sintered basalt can be utilized for a variety of purposes including: tools, structural components, spare parts, VT/VL tiles, roads, indoor pavers, thermal re-entry tiles, radiation protection, thermal wadis, and shelter/habitat construction.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) It is estimated that approximately 5-6% of all CO2 greenhouse gases generated by human activity originate from concrete production . While it is not realistic to consider that basalt derived products could eliminate the use of cement, there are some locations (such as Hawaii) where all cement for construction must be shipped in. While creating cement alternatives for such locations may not have a significant impact on the reduction of greenhouse emissions by decreasing concrete manufacturing (global demand remains high), it would reduce emissions created by shipping this critical material overseas. In addition to environmental benefits, it could create a new industry to diversify the local economies where it would be useful.","Destructive Testing; In Situ Manufacturing; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)",,Pacific International Space Center for Exploration Systems,"99 Aupuni Street Suite 212-213, Hilo, HI 96720 - 4273",(808) 494-5553,Regolith Resources Robotics - R^3 is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

As missions are foreseen to be extended with limited earth resupply available there is need to develop durable and sustainable closed loop living systems. Waste water treatment and recovery system that is managed by ECLSS on board the ISS is one such system that has lifetime/durability limitations and would benefit from improvements to increase its lifetime efficiency. Therefore, in order to achieve NASA?s goals of extended manned deep space missions, Faraday Technology Inc. and Dr. Carlos Cabrera of the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) propose to develop a technique to eliminate many of the contaminants that commonly foul the waste water treatment system and produce a more durable closed loop process compatible with existing ECLSS mainframe to treat and recover water. In this program, UPR will develop enzyme based bio-reactor to efficiently convert urea to ammonia, while Faraday will scale and optimize ammonia electrolyzer incorporating custom-fabricated gas diffusion cathode and anode. This integrated system is anticipated to enable significant performance enhancement by reducing osmosis membrane fouling caused by contaminants from the waste stream and thereby increasing the efficiency and durability of the treatment process. This technology has the potential to be compatible with existing ECLSS systems and be an integral part of the closed loop living systems required for long term life support on NASA?s manned space missions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) As manned space missions are foreseen to be extend with limited earth resupply available, the ECLSS will need to become more durable to support closed loop living.

The proposed bio-electrochemical system consisting of a bioreactor and ammonia electrolyzer will eliminate many of the contaminants that commonly foul the RO system and produce a more sustainable wastewater treatment and water recovery system.

As flight directors and their flight control teams train for exploration using PRIDE in simulated environments, the procedure sequences they develop for exploration can be captured along with all the execution data. TRACLabs proposes to use the resulting logs, along with archived telemetry, as a basis for applying apprenticeship learning to learn what procedures should be used in a given situation and in what order.

We have significant experience in all required technologies and have already integrated them into a general MAESTRO architecture designed to be easily applied to spacecraft subsystems. Montana State University (MSU) has designed, built, launched, and operated several satellites and has specifically studied in-space PV degradation. In addition to providing substantial knowledge, expertise and practical experience, MSU will also provide real satellite telemetry data and set up a laboratory hardware testbed, using spare MSU satellite hardware, for testing our EPS-MAESTRO prototype in Phase I. They also plan to field an actual EPS-MAESTRO prototype onboard one of their future satellites, in-space, during Phase II. The eventual, ultimate goal is the ability of an onboard autonomous intelligent system to manage the spacecraft EPS itself through the development of EPS-MAESTRO, which can be easily adapted to the EPSs of different spacecraft. EPS-MAESTRO must be sufficiently powerful, general, and computationally efficient and be easily adapted by developers. This will be accomplished using open standards, clearly defined open interfaces, use of Open Source software, and leveraging several previous NASA investments. Phase I research goals are to explore the spacecraft EPS management domain for small satellites and large manned spacecraft, elaborate the AI techniques useful for EPS characterization, diagnosis, replanning/rescheduling/adaptive execution/safing, prove the feasibility of these techniques through prototype development (by prototyping two applications), and develop a complete system specification for the Phase II EPS-MAESTRO system.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The most direct targets for transition of this proposed effort are the large number of various future manned and unmanned, deep-space and near-earth spacecraft that would significantly benefit from autonomous, intelligent EPS management. By showing its ability to autonomously create high-quality responses to EPS events, EPS-MAESTRO will clearly illustrate its advantages over the status quo. Because it will be an open system that other developers could use to create intelligent EPS management systems, a large number of EPS-MAESTRO applications can be quickly developed. Since EPS-MAESTRO is specifically designed to easily interface with Diagnosis, Adaptive Execution, Planning, and Scheduling engines, such developers will have their choice. And additional interfaces can be developed over time to increase the number of such options. There is a potential to automate the majority of EPS management decision-making at NASA, even for low Earth orbit, with a corresponding savings in highly skilled manpower. Additional applications are various types of ground processing at KSC that also have EPS management needs. The planned Phase II demonstration of EPS-MAESTRO in space onboard an MSU satellite, will greatly aid its adoption.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Stottler Henke already sells Aurora to private companies. Commercial product and service sales related to Aurora have already resulted in over $10 million in revenue. EPS-MAESTRO improvements can be readily incorporated into Aurora and sold through existing sales channels, especially to the power generation industry, which we are already pursuing. And beyond NASA there are a large number of real-time diagnosis, replanning/rescheduling, and execution problems that EPS-MAESTRO could be readily adapted to, such as oil refineries, factories of all types, etc. And many of these potential EPS-MAESTRO users are already Aurora customers.Current Aurora customers tend to be aerospace manufacturers, partly due to our early conversion of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner production line to being an Aurora customer. Companies like Learjet and Bombardier quickly followed suit as well as some Boeing suppliers. Other customers tend to have high-value applications both requiring a high-quality solution and justifying the relatively high price. Examples include Massachusetts General Hospital, which is saving a huge amount of manpower scheduling residents, Honda, which is realizing large savings through reduced destruction of prototype vehicles during safety (e.g., crash) testing, and Clipper Windpower, which has greatly shortened their production time for individual, custom wind turbines. A MAESTRO-enhanced version of Aurora would presumably tend to have a similar diverse base of customers.",Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Distribution/Management; Intelligence; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Sequencing & Scheduling; Space Transportation & Safety,,Montana State University (MSU) - Bozeman,"Office of Sponsored Programs 309 Montana Hall, PO Box 172470, Bozeman, MT 59717 - 2470",(406) 994-2381,Intelligent/Autonomous Electrical Power Systems is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

The proposed research is innovative in presenting a new setting for subdivs demanding novel extensions to subdiv algorithms, techniques and theory as well as new methods in merging of terrain data from multiple sources. Our primary objectives are to: (1) develop a prototype mapping system using subdivs as a representation for terrain data with highly varied spatial resolution and 3-D features; (2) extend our novel volumetric merging method, integrating input data at varied confidence levels from varied source formats (DEM, point cloud, range data, etc.) while supporting overhanging and cave-like terrain geometry; (3) demonstrate collaborative use of registered surface detail with terrain-mapped data fields such as terrain color, confidence estimates, and science-data overlays; and (4) show, via high-quality DEM extraction, compatibility with existing systems including applicability for autonomous processing on small, weight- and power-constrained (SWAP) robots. The expected benefits are: (a) higher-fidelity terrain visualization with reduced processing error and lower infrastructure requirements; (b) ability to visualize 3-D features, such as overhangs, missed in DEM's; (c) compact encoding with natural level-of-detail control for interactive viewing on mobile devices; (d) greater algorithmic efficiency for non-visualization scientific computation; and (e) enablement of new software-tool capabilities for dynamic mapping of alternative local-terrain datasets, non-destructive experimentation, collaboration, and data traceability.

Our goal will be to design space coils using the latest high temperature superconductors. The coils will be operated at medium temperature, between 20 and 30 K, which eases the cooling requirements and temperature margins compared to 4K low-temperature conductors. This also increases the critical currents providing more margin for neutron radiation damage, possibly reducing shielding. The coils will have highly efficient cooling systems, be low mass and require minimum structural mass. Bath cooling and conduit cooling will be compared. There is likely an optimum operating temperature which minimizes the mass of both the conductors, shielding, and cooling systems. Given the rapid advancement of HTS materials determining the feasibility of such an optimal coil design requires detailed research into the state-of-the-art.

The APC consists of a centralized controller connected to an array of local component controllers. The centralized controller will be capable of optimal generation and load scheduling, abnormal conditions and/or failure detection, and system restoration, while the local controllers monitor system components and pass sensor data to the centralized controller. The core of the APC is a database architecture that facilitates data movement to enable the various control functions. The design of this database was carried out by the PI, Dr. Hong, in a 2016 collaboration with NASA GRC, and it will be leveraged in this STTR effort to support the expansion of the APC. The effort will also utilize a spacecraft system simulator tool developed by PCKA. Therefore, the team is well-placed to successfully develop the APC. Potential applications of the APC will be in deep space explorations, aeronautic flights, and special human habitats, where human supervision of the electric power systems is limited and availability of electric power is critical to mission success.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The most immediate NASA applications for this technology is NASA's Exploration Augmentation Module (EAM) system. PCKA's existing Simulink model of this system will form the testbed used to demonstrate the capabilities of the APC. The International Space Station power system is similar in nature, a dc system based on solar arrays and battery energy storage, so it is also a potential application for the technology. The APC will also have potential applications in aircraft electrical propulsions systems, wherein the electrical system is mission-critical. NASA's CAS and NEAT programs are examples of such systems. PCKA also has existing models of these systems to facilitate future application of the APC.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) While the proposed effort is focused on spacecraft power systems, other types of power systems could take advantage of the control technology. The underlying control architecture can be applied to essentially any type of microgrid power system. Terrestrial microgrids do not suffer the same communication latency as deep-space systems; however, autonomous control of these systems would greatly improve performance through optimal operating point identification and automated reconfiguration in response to faults or disturbances. It should be noted that these systems can be either ac or dc in nature; however, the APC formulation can remain largely the same. Furthermore, the team's approach to development of the control using a simulation-based testbed allows efficient development, testing, and validation of the approach to a wide array of systems.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Distribution/Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)",,Case Western Reserve University,"10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106 - 7071",(216) 368-5092,Intelligent/Autonomous Electrical Power Systems is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This disconnect creates undue burden on mission operators as it requires the involvement of expert robot programmers to define each activity. In contrast, we propose that robots in space, just like human crew members, should be guided through vetted, human-readable procedures. Such an approach will allow NASA to seamlessly allocate new robotic capabilities and resources to existing space activities, as well as to facilitate the cooperation of humans and their robot assistants when performing joint activities.We propose to develop the PHARAOH system, which integrates TRACLabs' proprietary procedure authoring and execution software with our robot navigation, manipulation, and visualization tools. TRACLabs' Procedure IDE (PRIDE) and our affordance template (AT) robot planning & control software have been developed over the past few years in conjunction with NASA engineers and researchers on various projects. They represent the state of the art in their domains. Integration of these two research streams will result in the unprecedented simplification and standardization of how robots are used by mission operators (as opposed to robotic experts) to accomplish the tasks NASA requires. We envision non-robotics flight controllers eventually being able to re-task remote robotic assets by using English-language procedures that automatically map directly to robot capabilities on the back-end.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Both the PRIDE electronic procedure management software suite and the Affordance Template framework were developed in collaboration with NASA, albeit in very different project groups. NASA has an ongoing interest in both of these technologies, and TRACLabs would be well-positioned to market this product to them in Phase III. NASA recognizes that as they investigate long-duration missions, advanced robotics will play an important role, and there is a need for technology such as this.Although this research will initially focus on remote rover robots, like Resource Prospector, the Affordance Template framework is applicable to manipulation robots like Astrobee, R5, and SSRMS. NASA's Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) project that is modernizing the space agency's ground infrastructure systems for their Space Network is evaluating PRIDE as a potential technology for Local Operating Procedures (LOPs). NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) is interested in applying PRIDE to the Scalable Convergent Electronic Propulsion Technology Operations Research (SCEPTOR) project. PRIDE is being evaluated for use in ground control operations for the Resource Prospector (RP) robot being developed by NASA JSC and ARC for lunar surface operations. All of these NASA projects could benefit with the extensions to the PRIDE software proposed as part of this research.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) TRACLabs sees application of this technology in the automotive manufacturing area. TRACLabs has a contract with one of the top international automotive suppliers to install our robot perception, planning, & control software on industrial manipulators in an automotive parts assembly plant.

The interaction of standard operating procedures and robotic manipulation is of great interest to our automotive customer.TRACLabs is already selling PRIDE as a commercial product with a major oil field services company as a launch customer. This company is field-testing PRIDE at several sites world-wide before deployment in actual operations in mid-2017. PRIDE is proving automation assistance to drilling operations. We will work with them to make sure that this project meets their requirements. TRACLabs expects additional customers in the oil and gas industry will deploy PRIDE once it has been proven effective by our launch customer.Commercial space companies have also purchased PRIDE licenses for their operating procedures.

This novel integration of currently existing metrics allows for the quantification of specific crew resource elements over the mission timeline and an in-depth analysis of the impacts caused by various spacecraft design choices.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) As one of the first comprehensive crew performance models, this technology has far reaching applications in areas where complex system design need to be analyzed for human factor impacts. The merits of this particular framework and model is that it ties together existing data that scientist already understand and use for their research. As the model evolves and becomes more sophisticated, additional layers of analysis can be done to extract user behavior. The data can be fed back to the model design and identify areas for improvement and add efficiencies. This is relevant to NASA, its subcontractors for spacecraft development (Lockheed, Boeing, SpaceX, Orbital), but also relevant to those companies developing their own human-rated space vehicles (Blue Origin, Bigelow, SNC, XCorp etc.)","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This application is intended for other government agencies that have complex systems with human users and have a need for tracking the quality of human performance. This ranges from military combat situations, to polar expeditions, to operators of complex systems (nuclear power plant, submarines, emergency services etc.). Other potential applications are industries that have an increase of robotic or machine equipment designed to interact with human operators. For example, production line facilities for manufacturing and assembly of consumer goods often have mechanized robotics which interface with an operator. The model developed here can help guide designers of the production line in finding optimized layouts and architecture for ensuring work flow efficiency and safety of their workers.","Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Verification/Validation Tools",,University of Colorado-Boulder,"579 UCB, BOulder, CO 80309 - 0572",(303) 492-7110,Modeling And Estimation Of Integrated Human-Vehicle Design Influences is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

Key to successful transition of standard ply to thin ply ATP processing is the ability to fabricate uniform high fiber volume and fiber distribution composite parts with below 1% void content. Our ATP robotic system will be adapted to handle thin ply materials, including accurate placement and consolidation to minimize potential defects (adjacent tape gaps creating voids, non-uniform compaction of plies, etc.). Existing modeling of the placement process at our academic partner will support hardware optimization. Coupon fabrication and testing will provide validation of the process to produce high quality parts and initiate the development of a property database (microstructure, mechanical performance, etc.).","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA has interest in applying thin ply technology in various programs including the Composite Cryotank Technologies and Demonstration (CCTD) project. The Boeing Company was contracted to design, analyze, and manufacture the large composite cryotanks for testing at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. An automated placement system was utilized to place thick and thin prepreg plies with final consolidation using out-of-autoclave processing (OOA). The approach has the potential to reduce cost by 25% and weight by 30 percent compared to existing aluminum-lithium propellant tanks.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The general approach and specific technologies developed in this STTR can also be applied to other military platforms and commercial applications (aerospace, automotive, wind etc).

Combustion instabilities are spontaneous, self-sustaining oscillations that tie the combustor acoustics to the combustion reaction itself. These oscillations can lead to a wide range of problems from off-design performance to catastrophic failure. Efforts to predict instabilities at design-time is hindered by the complex, multi-physics nature of the acoustics and chemistry, typically requiring multiple iterations of time and resource intensive system prototyping. The proposed Phase I STTR project aims to develop a simulation framework that will enable accurate, design-time prediction of instabilities. This framework will leverage the capabilities of Loci/CHEM for massively parallel, multi-physics flow simulations to generate low-order, independent models of combustion and acoustic response to perturbations. By solving for simultaneous solutions of these low-order perturbation models, it will be possible to numerically map the acoustic modes of the system to their stability characteristics, providing a means to predict instability. Phase I will develop critical additions to Loci/CHEM's combustion modeling capabilities, develop the appropriate acoustic models, develop a test plan for experimental validation of the combustion model, and conclude with a proof-of-concept demonstration of the full framework. In Phase II, an experimental campaign will be carried out to validate the combustion modeling tools developed in Phase I and augment the simulation framework with multi-phase modeling appropriate for full-scale LRE combustion chambers.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA is spearheading the creation of this next generation of LREs through their Evolvable Mars Campaign and ongoing development of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Commercial Crew/Cargo launch vehicles. A number of engine development programs are currently underway and could benefit from the improved predictive accuracy resulting from this technology; examples include the design of J-2X (or RL-10) as the upper stage engine for SLS, and adaptation of the Space Shuttle main engine (RS-25) for use on the SLS core stage. Similarly, potential future programs for which combustion instability will be a key factor include development of a common upper stage/in-space stage engine and booster options for SLS Block 2, including a Large Oxygen-Rich Staged Combustion (ORSC) cycle engine and a Large Gas Generator (LGC) cycle engine. As prime contractor for many of the liquid propulsion systems used by NASA, the DoD, and international space agencies, Aerojet Rocketdyne is a key potential customer of this technology. In addition, customers of the modeling tools or ATA's accompanying services include engineers at the NASA centers developing the aforementioned missions and at companies developing propulsion systems for other launch vehicles (e.g., Blue Origin's BE-4 staged-combustion rocket engine to power the United Launch Alliance (ULA) next-generation launch system, Vulcan and SpaceX's development of the Raptor engine for their planned Interplanetary Transport System).","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Combustion instability poses significant technological and economic challenges in the gas turbine power generation and aviation propulsion fields. GE, Siemens, and others have invested heavily in combustion instability research over the last few decades as they have sought practical low NOx gas turbine combustors for power generation. Numerous mitigation strategies, both passive and active, have been studied and implemented as instabilities arise during testing, however the ability to predict instabilities and make system changes at design time has remained elusive. In the aviation community, the challenges of combustion instability have largely precluded the use of low emissions combustors in favor of safer, but less efficient systems. The challenges that we seek to address for rocket combustion chambers are analogous and in many respects, more extreme than those facing gas turbines. The tools resulting from this effort will be directly applicable to design-time analysis for power generation and aviation combustors.",Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine,,Purdue University,"155 South Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907 - 2114",(765) 494-6204,Detailed Multiphysics Propulsion Modeling & Simulation Through Coordinated Massively Parallel Frameworks is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

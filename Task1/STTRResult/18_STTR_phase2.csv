MarsOasis™ integrates a wealth of prior research and Mars growth chamber concepts into a complete system design and operational prototype. MarsOasis™ includes several innovative features relative to the state of the art space growth chambers. It can operate on the Mars surface or inside of a habitat. The growth volume maximizes available growth area and supports a variety of crop sizes, from seeding through harvest. It utilizes in-situ CO2 from the Mars atmosphere. Hybrid lighting takes advantage of natural sunlight during warmer periods, and supplemental LEDs during extreme cold, low light, or indoor operation. Recirculating hydroponics and humidity recycling minimize water loss. The structure also supports a variety of hydroponic nutrient delivery methods, depending on crop needs. The growth chamber uses solar power when outside, with deployable solar panels that stow during dust storms or at night. It can also use power from the habitat or other external sources. The growth chamber is mobile, so that the crew can easily relocate it. Autonomous environmental control manages crop conditions reducing crew time for operation. Finally, remote teleoperation allows pre-deployment, prior to crew arrival. This project directly addresses the NASA STTR technology area T7.02 “Space Exploration Plant Growth” and will be a major step towards closed-loop, sustainable living systems for space exploration. This collaborative effort between Space Lab Technologies, LLC and the Bioastronautics research group from the CU Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department will culminate in the development of a pilot-scale engineering demonstration unit (EDU) for key components.

CU Aerospace (CUA), in partnership with the University of Illinois, propose the continued development of a scalable and distributed IMU (DSIMU) for space robotics and CubeSat applications. The user can deliberately choose a number of inertial sensors beyond the minimal number of sensors required for inertial navigation. This scalability enables both improved measurement resolution and system redundancy. The distributed nature of the system means that sensors can be placed arbitrarily by the user as needed in their design, under the constraint that each axis is measured by at least one accelerometer and gyroscope. This technology enables space-constrained systems to leverage redundant inertial sensors for fault detection and isolation (FDI), jitter on a spacecraft, and angular velocity without the use of gyroscopes. Beyond the systems engineering benefits of this system, distributing the sensors is grounded by previous research that suggests it will reduce the total noise of its output measurements and have important SWaP-C implications for space systems. This technology can potentially be used in most robotic systems currently using an inertial navigation system. However, the best applications of this technology are in space constrained robots that can benefit from accurate state estimates or fault tolerant systems.

A hot reservoir variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) that can provide much tighter passive thermal control capability is an ideal thermal management device for future planetary landers and rovers. Based on previous ISS test results, advanced fluid management features and strategies are the key to maximize hot reservoir VCHP’s reliability during long-term planetary exploration missions. In STTR Phase I, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) performed a fundamental study to understand the complex fluid transport phenomena within a hot reservoir VCHP. A Loop Hot Reservoir VCHP (LHR-VCHP) concept was devised during the program. With the novel loop configuration, two mechanisms to induce a net transport flow for VCHP purging (i.e. removal of working fluid from the reservoir) were identified: (1) by momentum transfer from vapor to NCG through shearing (2) by filtering the pulses (via a Tesla/check valve) generated in the heat pipe section of VCHP loop. The existence of momentum transfer flow and its effectiveness on VCHP reservoir purging were demonstrated through modeling and experiment. In Phase II, ACT-CWRU team proposes to further mature the LHR-VCHP technology and demonstrate its reliability by maximizing the flow rate induced by the two mechanisms stated above. Phase II work plan will include systematic studies of both momentum transfer induced flow and pulses generation and filtering induced flow within a loop VCHP, development of fluid diodes for pulses filtration, design and optimization of LHR-VCHP prototypes based on the two mechanisms.

The Gas-Granular Flow Solver (GGFS) had previously been developed for simulating the multi-phase gas-particle interaction and transport simulations for the complex regolith compositions found on Moon and Mars. Eulerian-Eulerian models are applied to model gas and particle phases as continuum fluids. This project is aimed at overcoming scalability and performance limitations encountered with the original GGFS implementation through migration of the GGFS simulation models to the highly scalable Loci computational framework. In Phase I, the GGFS Eulerian-Eulerian approach for modeling gas-granular flows was implemented in Loci and the anticipated performance enhancements clearly demonstrated. The prototype simulation tool has been successfully applied to the InSight landing reconstruction effort at NASA MSFC/ER42. Phase II enhancements will include: (1) Vehicle dynamics during propulsive descent and ascent using an overset/moving-mesh approach with 6-DOF motion, (2) multi-component gas and polydisperse granular mixture models for physically-consistent plume/surface interactions, (3) GPU-implementation and performance assessments, (4) verification and validation.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Potential NASA commercial applications include plume-surface interaction effects analysis to support NASA and industry led lunar and Mars lander development projects.

For deep space applications, low-temperature propellants are of particular interest but accurate fluid property data was scarce or unavailable to the industry. Recently, NASA MSFC has funded several research programs (including this proposal's phase I contract) to develop capabilities of handling and measuring the physical, thermodynamic, and system properties of Modified Oxides of Nitrogen (MON), which is Nitrogen Tetraoxide (NTO) blended with various percentages of Nitrous Oxide. High-MON blends (15-30% NO) have a significantly lower freezing point than neat NTO and promise to enable cold-propellant operation in hypergolic rocket engines when paired with Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH). The fluid property data resulting from these studies would best serve the engineering community if made available in the REFPROP program from the NIST and this proposal seeks to author the collected data into a freely-available library under NIST direction.Additionally, although the freezing point of MMH approaches -60°C and it should be usable with MON down to -40°C, the viscosity of MMH increase rapidly below 0°C. This may cause flow and mixing problems that can inhibit ignition and steady operation. In a previous Department of Defense program, it was demonstrated that adding a compound to a similar fuel resulted in lower viscosity without negatively impacting combustion efficiency. To characterize the results of blending MMH similarly, this proposal also seeks to investigate key physical properties of MMH-blends at cold temperatures and perform hypergolic ignition and hypergolic performance testing with MON-25. Like the MON data, the results of these studies will be authored into the REFPROP libraries for general distribution.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The information obtained by this proposal will directly benefit the currently active TALOS program managed by the Marshall Space Flight Center as well as a NASA JPL mission to Jupiter's moons currently being planned.

We propose to work with Notre Dame University and Utah State University to adapt this film for space applications such as solar sails. The performance of solar sails is strongly affected by the ratio between the reflecting area of the sail and the mass of the craft. Current generation sails use coated 2.5 micron polyimide films (CP-1) which are extremely delicate to handle and deploy. The PE Graphene nanocomposite has lower density and vastly superior strength compared to CP-1. In terms of specific strength, the new film material outperforms even the best commercial fibers (such as Dyneema) and can offer dramatically improved performance for solar sails. At the same thickness, it offers roughly 70% of the mass of existing solutions and 50x the strength.","The polyethylene/graphene nanocomposite film we are adapting for use in space could dramatically improve the performance of solar sails, solar cells and deorbiting devices.

Moreover, adaptability at the hardware level provides increased flexibility and capabilities. While electronic version of such systems is widely being used in NASA applications, they incur significant size, weight, and power, and cost (SWaP-C). We propose a photonic reconfigurable hardware, Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC), that will have significantly lower SWaP-C compared to electronic counterparts. The proposed programmable PIC will be fabricated using phase change materials (PCM) that enables non-volatile, compact, low-loss, and broadband switches that can be mass produced through well-established integrated circuit (IC) fabrication process. In spite of the reduction in feature size that can affect resolution and bandwidth, the photonic platform will enable loss-less controlled passage of light and allow the PIC-based spectrometer to provide equal or higher efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. Also, the compact integrated design will enable constructive augmentations that can improve efficiency without compromising on SWaP-C. In Phase I, we will work on the design of the programmable PIC using a reduced order modeling (ROM) based simulation platform. We will calculate the performance characteristics, including the sensitivity to key design parameters, and derive guidelines for improved design. In Phase II, we will optimize the design to meet NASA requirements, build a prototype, and experimentally verify the performance of programmable PIC, including as a function of radiation effects and temperature variations. Promising designs will be delivered to NASA.","The programmable PIC is aligned with multiple NASA 2020 Technology Taxonomy areas like TX05: Communications, Navigation, and Orbital Debris Tracking and Characterization Systems, TX08: Sensors and Instruments, TX10: Autonomous Systems, and TX17: Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C).

Because of a lack of global constraints, visual inertial odometry (VIO) will drift over time in four degrees of freedom. Range information between rovers will provide additional constraints that limit drift. To perform distributed localization, each rover will estimate its own trajectory in a factor graph of poses and receive additional condensed information from other rovers. Because the range and VIO measurements are not tightly coupled, each of the rovers can navigate on its own, and this method is inherently robust to communication outages. A key advantage of this approach is that any other constraints from sensors such as sun angle, bearing to visually observed rovers, terrain matching, and point features, can easily be added to the factor graph formulation. The proposed technical approach is most closely related to the Decentralized Data Fusion Smoothing and Mapping algorithm (DDF-SAM2, specifically), though DDF-SAM2 assumes landmark (point) feature observations and shares the relative position of these landmarks by default. It can also be extended to share relative positions and orientations of objects rather than just the positions of landmarks. Our problem is different in that only range measurements are available from the UWB sensor, but these are measurements with error and drift models that are much simpler and do not require solving a data association or loop closing problem. A simulation environment will be developed to assist in the development and testing of the DALEC SLAM algorithm. The simulation will produce simulated IMU, UWB, and imagery data from 4–15 rovers operating simultaneously. The simulation will then be used to test and tune the DALEC algorithm.","The proposed system has utility for applications such as JPL’s A-PUFFER robots and NeBula autonomy architecture. This technology could also support teams of heterogeneous robots, e.g., the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter. The localization system could also be made to support non-planetary spacecraft such as orbital satellites. In this formulation, relative navigation cameras and RF ranging cross-links could be used to localize satellite constellations for uses such as distributed aperture telescopy and large baseline interferometry.","Higher accuracy location estimates for Astrobotic’s CubeRovers would allow for a larger suite of commercial swarm-based missions.

SSTM is a high-performance truss of tape-springs with structural mass efficiency twice that of trusses of solid rods (e.g. coilable longeron masts) and four times better than traditional non-trussed CTMs. SSTM booms are inherently low cost because they are fabricated using automated and mold-based processes with minimal touch labor. Opterus is currently proving out similar booms (optimized for high load applications) at the 20m (65 ft) length scale using the same materials, tooling, curing, and fabrication equipment that will be used here. Processes are only limited in length by the facility, currently 120m (400 ft). This effort will optimize and develop booms with a linear mass density of less than 50 grams per meter while maintaining the stiffness and strength to support 10,000 m2 and larger high performance sail systems. SSTM provides a lower cost and lower risk solution by avoiding spin deployment and stabilization complexities. The complexity, challenge, and risk of cable stays (guywires) are similarly not needed with SSTM. Prototype booms will be designed, fabricated, and tested. SSTM is enabling for the next generation of 10,000 m2 large class solar sails for multiple heliophysics missions including HISM (High Inclination Solar Mission), SPI (Solar Polar Imager), and next generation space weather monitoring missions. SSTM can also enable a faster transit to deep space, which is needed for the Interstellar Probe Mission.","While optimized for sail sails, SSTMs are also performance enhancing and enabling for a broad range of deployable boom applications. These include satellite and lunar surface solar power systems, large science antennas and instrument booms, telescope sunshades, telescope occulter systems, and lunar towers.",DoD and commercial applications additionally include large communications and sensor platforms.

(PSI) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will develop Photonic Integrated Circuit Assisted-Single Photon Detectors (PICA-SPDs) to increase the bandwidth and timing resolution of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Realizing low size, weight, and power (SWaP) SPDs with high saturation-rates and high timing-resolutions are critical for deploying of quantum technology in space. While the best superconducting nanowire SPDs (SNSPDs) can achieve saturation rates up to 100 MHz with timing resolutions of several 10’s of ps, these also require cryogenic environments, making their deployment in space a challenge. On the other hand, single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) are low SWaP and can operate at room temperature with good efficiencies (>75%); however, the timing resolution is often 50 ps (or more) and the saturation rate is typically limited to 10s of MHz. To overcome the challenge of increasing both the timing resolution and saturation rate of SPAD arrays, our unique active-approach leverages high-speed, low-loss PIC modulators. Here, single-photon optical signals enter the PIC and are routed to a series of Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switches. These fast, traveling-wave switches are driven by periodic signals having progressively higher frequencies to create a switch yard. As the photon stream enters each of the MZI switches, the different time-positions are routed to different outputs of each MZI, which isolates individual time-positions to enable readout using an array of SPDs. This approach enables an array of SPADs to operate together to achieve timing resolutions even surpassing SNSPDs with greatly enhanced saturation count rates to enable space-based quantum networking applications.","The development of quantum communications and networks are a key technology to enable secure communication, sensor arrays, and quantum computer networks. Our proposed technology will allow NASA to increase the bandwidth of both free-space and fiber quantum links.","High saturation rate, low-jitter single-photon detectors are a general-purpose tool for a range of applications, from quantum networks and communication links, to imaging and healthcare applications.",,,Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (at Urbana-Champaign),"SPA, 1901 S.

(RSI) propose to develop the Polymer Anti-damage Nanocomposite Down-converting Armor (PANDA) coating of solar sail-embedded PV cells that, in addition to blocking UV and ionizing radiation and being UV stable, flexible, and light weight, converts UV into visible radiation that matches the responsivity spectrum of the PV cell. This makes possible to generate extra electricity thus improving the overall PV conversion efficiency by up to 5%. PANDA coating uses a polymer nanocomposite impregnated with UV absorbing luminescent quantum dots (QDs) to shield the coating itself and the coated solar cells from UV radiation and increase PV power conversion efficiency. This is achieved by using spectrum downshifting of solar UV radiation in the QDs to visible radiation. The innovativeness of the technology has three features: (1) UV shielding is combined with the use of the UV energy, otherwise wasted, in the production of additional PV electricity; (2) UV shielding also prevents polymer photodarkening, and (3) solar spectrum conversion from UV to visible-NIR is highly efficient. The overall goal is to develop and demonstrate feasibility of a UV stable coating for sail-embedded solar cells that improve PV power output. To reach the goal, the following technical objectives are identified (1) Design and implement spectrum converting QDs and produce PANDA coatings. (2) Enable UV stability of PANDA and its perforamnce as a protector of solar cells from UV radiation and enhancer of PV conversion efficiency. (3) Conduct experiments on both UV stability and conversion efficiency, analyze experimental data and make conclusions on feasibility of the proposed ideas.","If successful, the proposed technology can be implemented as “UV stable thin-film protective coating for sail-embedded power-generation…”, Scope “Next-Generation Solar Sail System Techn.”, topic T5.05 “Advanced Solar Sailing Technologies”, Focus Area 5 “Communications and Navigation”, NASA FY 2022 STTR Solicitation.

Large electro-optic (EO) coefficients and lower third-order nonlinearity compared to other III-V materials (e.g., InP, Si) make LiNbO3 an ideal candidate for active photonic devices. Although indium phosphide (InP) and silicon (Si) -based foundries are already established, a LiNbO3-based foundry is something unimaginable until now. Recently, advances in crystal ion sliced (CIS) films of LiNbO3 on insulator (TFLNOI), which guide optical modes almost 20 times smaller than their bulk-LiNbO3 counterparts have emerged as an answer to some of these issues. Now, strip-loaded waveguides can be used to tightly confine the optical mode, allowing smaller electrode gaps, decreased Vπ, tighter bending radii and PIC compatibility. With this advance in thin-film technology, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in the LiNbO3 platform can now be realized, paving the way for future LiNbO3 platform-based foundries. Our goal is to investigate fundamental building blocks for TFLNOI PICs and ultimately demonstrate the utility of these unit-cells to produce an EO modulator that will reduce the footprint of standard Mach-Zehnder Modulators and bring improved DC and high-frequency EO response.","Thin-film LiNbO3 on insulator (TFLNOI) PICs can be leveraged for: analog photonic links that possess gain, THz/sub-mmW/mmW sensing, antenna remoting, optical switching, generating entangled photon pairs, etc. In addition to being useful for many applications, TFLNOI is chemically stable, enables the replacement of heavy coaxial cable with lightweight electromagnetic interference insensitive fiber. The proposed research has potential use in systems both on and off of this planet for NASA.","A reduction in SWaP-C, in comparison to currently existing LiNbO3 devices.

Traditional instrumentation systems and providers often promote a single type of general-purpose data-acquisition channel that can “do it all”, or at most a few different types of data channels targeting specific applications. However, few of the potentially hundreds of different types of sensors require the full capabilities of each channel in the general-purpose system. This results in bulky, overly complex systems that do not make full use of the system’s capabilities, resulting in increased cost, power consumption, and data communication requirements for the entire instrumentation system. The proposed innovation replaces the centralized, high-cost, high-performance instrumentation system with a distributed network of wireless, low-cost, requirement-optimized smart sensor nodes. The requirement-optimized hardware, reduced deployment costs, improved data accuracy, and increased installation flexibility are provided by removing wiring constraints, creating a system with a higher total value per channel. The system also allows for continual sensor health monitoring by distributing some intelligence to each node and will ensure the data collected with the system will be NIST traceable. These innovations provide the customer with the ability to significantly increase the total number of deployed measurement points for less than the total system deployment cost of traditional wired instrumentation systems.","This system not only benefits the testing of next-generation rocket propulsion systems, but adds to the capabilities of the NASA Stennis Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Propulsion Test Office at White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). It is also viable for other NASA ground- and flight-test facilities due to the ease of the system’s deployment. The system capabilities could also be expanded beyond rocket-propulsion ground test to include monitoring during other ground tests and potentially in situ testing including spaceflight.","This system could also find use in a multitude of research, defense, and commercial applications where precision measurements are required in difficult to install locations or retrofitted into infrastructure that is unconducive to wired systems.

Key to the success of CPH teams are trustworthiness and trust. In the context of machine agents on CPH teams, trustworthiness refers to whether a machine performs its intended task (and not prohibited actions) when faced with unknown physical processes. A need exists for methods that are flexible to encompass known and unknown elements of physical processes and produce outcomes that are interpretable for all members of CPH teams. Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) incorporate information from scientific models to constrain machine learning approximators. In the work proposed here, we aim to increase the reliability of UQ in UDEs to enable more detailed analysis of uncertainty in the learned representations of dynamic systems. The potential for inclusion of physics-based priors into the learning process for UDEs could enhance trustworthiness and trust in CPH teams because it is possible to extract a closed-form differential equation from UDE-based models. However, most UDE research has focused on deterministic solutions rather than a study of the sensitivity of the identified representation. In the work proposed here, we aim to increase the reliability of UQ in UDEs to enable more detailed analysis of uncertainty in the learned representations of dynamic systems. We will first conduct simulations of a semi-stable dynamic system in Simulink. We will demonstrate UDE learning of the equations of motion that describe the semi-stable system. Once this has been demonstrated, we will move onto the development of an advanced UQ framework for UDEs. We will build upon examples from literature (such as Bayes by Backprop), with a focus on human interpretability to increase the trust in the machine learned representation of the dynamic system.","Future NASA mission objectives involving Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) teams—such as maintaining lunar habitations or preparing for Martian landing—are ones we believe may benefit.

To make informed run-time decisions regarding how much autonomy a robot should be permitted, even in the presence of non-trivial communication delays, or to assess how well a robot is performing its tasks once commanded, it is imperative that human operators have sufficient feedback to orient them about the robot's state and intentions, and what responsibilities the robot can be trusted to accomplish.

In the isotropic world of metals, there has independently been a tremendous amount of research (and success) in the development of topology optimization tools that develop design concepts that are not always obvious a priori, but that offer significant performance advantages and (with additive manufacturing) are often cheap and easy to produce. Topology optimization algorithms use a fictitious density in each finite element as a design variable, and usually optimize this “density” to find the best places to leave material in place (density 100%), and the best places to remove it (density 0%). This problem has some fundamental similarities to the design of a composite part with AFP – since AFP is essentially an additive manufacturing process, we have tight control of where to add material (and where not to) for a given ply.

The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will operate at SEL2 for about 5-10 years until fuel for station keeping and attitude maneuvers is depleted. At this point JWST will essentially become inoperable as it was not designed to be serviced or refueled. With a multi-billion-dollar price tag, it is essential that the technology is developed to enable future telescopes to be serviced autonomously in space. In addition to autonomous in-space servicing, autonomous in-space assembly of telescopes will allow for much larger telescopes that cannot be launched as a single payload. The probability of detecting Earth-like planets orbiting other stars is correlated to the size of the telescope aperture. To date, space telescopes such as JWST, have had to be designed to fit within the fairing of a particular launch vehicle and unfold after launch. This obviously presents numerous technical and programmatic challenges, which could be mitigated with advancements in technology for autonomous in-space assembly. Of course, autonomous in-space assembly also presents several challenges, some of which we will address in the proposed work. For the design reference mission, we consider autonomous assembly of a large aperture space telescope mirror that consists of multiple hexagonal components. We will use a distributed scheduler that tasks each agent in the system to retrieve a mirror component from a nearby cargo vehicle and place the mirror segment into a unique place within the primary mirror.

NASA JSC has been using Virtual Reality for many years to train the astronauts in limited world space, for instance the interior of an ISS module, the robotics arm of both Shuttle and Station. The Artemis missions will challenge the current set of VR training capabilities and will require the move to a greater virtual world realism, to a more collaborative work environment, to a mix of multiple modalities and to the use of the continuously improving VR and AR headsets. Tietronix is proposing to develop a framework and associated artifacts development tools and workflow that provide a photorealistic multi-user multi-modality shared environment.

Our novel radiation-hard adaptive dual-mode neuromorphic (event-based) vision system configuration is designed to provide terrestrial autonomous robot-comparable 3D object detection, depth estimation, mapping, and tracking functionality for future use on lunar and planetary surfaces. Our approach is to recognize that ultra-high performance terrestrial state-of-the-art image processing microelectronics hardware likely will not be available. To address this constraint, our solution is to instead selectively reduce or throttle the image data from the image sensors to the downstream image processing microelectronic hardware. By selectively (and significantly) reducing the image data rate from the camera(s), lower performance space-qualifiable image processing electronics will then be able to provide the needed functionality on the now much sparser information from image data. The challenge is reducing the image data rate, while still providing the terrestrial-comparable state (pose and velocity) estimation, 3D object detection, depth estimation, mapping, and tracking functionality needed for autonomous operations. We propose to solve this challenge by replacing existing conventional space-grade CMOS frame-based cameras with a novel radiation-hardened version of a Dynamic and Active Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) dual-mode image sensor, which combines a conventional global-shutter CMOS camera with an event-based image sensor (EBS) in the same pixel array. In practice, event-based image sensors can reduce the downstream computational burden by an estimated one to two orders of magnitude.","Future NASA missions that could benefit from these advancements include the Lunar Gateway, expected to be unmanned for 92% of the time and thus, rely heavily on robotic systems for maintenance and repair, and a planned ‘tunnel-bot’ to pierce through the icy surface on Europa to study the space underneath. It can also help the Cold Operable Lunar Deployable Arm (COLDArm) project, one of NASA’s technologies being developed to enable future missions to extreme environments on the Moon, Mars, and ocean worlds such as Jupiter and Saturn moons.","Alphacore’s solution can be applied for use in maintenance and repair of defense and commercial space systems. Alphacore’s radiation-hardened perception technology can help add autonomous capabilities to defense unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous terrestrial platforms, such as future robotic combat vehicles and optionally manned fighting vehicles.",,,Arizona State University-Polytechnic,"ISTB4 Room 677, 781 E Terrace Mall, AZ 85287 - 6004",(480) 727-4726,,13

The SMART aircraft is a subscale vertical take-off and landing (e-VTOL) vehicle designed with unique demonstrated capabilities (NASA SBIR Phase II 80NSSC19C0094) to represent multiple different UAM configurations, perform dynamic flight test maneuvers and collect data collection for system identification. During this Phase I effort ESAero, in partnership with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo(RI), will develop the detailed flight test plan, generate expected aerodynamic and acoustic flight test results, and asses the current propulsion and instrumentation systems and develop system upgrades for the SMART vehicle as necessary. These actions will provide the necessary technical inputs to then execute the flight test plan safely during a phase II effort. In Phase I ESAero will also coordinate with the FAA to put in place a part 107 waiver to execute the free flight transition testing in phase II as well. This effort will allow ESAero to develop a testing capability that will provide a step change in data accessibility for NASA and the wider transportation community. In recent years the development of eVTOL vehicles has observed a ramp-up of initiatives driven by start-up companies that are focused on developing and maturing a proprietary commercial product or service. However, the developments of eVTOL technology bring a series of engineering challenges that must be well understood by regulatory, safety, and government planning agencies at all levels before eVTOLs significantly impact transportation systems. The proposed program will support this transformation by planning for (Phase I) and testing transition phase flight maneuvers (Phase II) with a scalable reconfigurable vehicle designed specifically for eVTOL flight testing.","The Phase I effort will make a leap forward toward non-proprietary data validation datasets and a technology testbed for investigating the critical transition phase of flight aiming to serve NASA research teams. The SMART vehicle will provide the AAM National Campaign with an alternative developmental flight test provider and another vehicle provider with the unique aspect of being non-proprietary allowing for increased information exchange and collaboration. Being scalable, non-proprietary, and designed for test will drive demand within NASA.",ESAero will leverage the increased maturity of SMART developed under this effort to provide a scalable validation vehicle for customers beyond NASA to further push the demonstration and validation of eVTOL technologies.

Current biofilm control technologies (i.e., hydrophobic surfaces, biocide-impregnated plastic coatings, chemical biocides, mercury-based lamps or light emitting diodes (LEDs)) either work for a very short duration, lead to residual chemical by-products of concern, have impractical physical designs, or limited light irradiation capacity. We propose a means of increasing the irradiation area of a UV-C LED by >100x by launching its light into side-emitting optical fibers (SEOFs), essentially creating germicidal flexible glowsticks. Currently only visible light SEOFs are commercially available. However, we discovered a technology (patent-pending) using silica nanoparticles (NPs) permanently attached to optical fibers that achieve side-emission of UV-C light along the entire optical fiber length. This is achieved using our dual-layer SEOF that includes 1) tunable shape-, size-, and surface chemistry-modified silica NPs that create photon and energy-scattering centers on the fiber surface and 2) UV-C transparent polymer coating over the NPs that protects the SEOF while allowing light to enter the water. Flexible individual or bundled SEOFs can deliver light from UV-C LED(s) to large surface areas. Our SEOF technology targets biofilm control in water or air, including narrow channels in potable water devices or tubing, biomedical devices or surface disinfection. Research performed during the Phase I STTR successfully 1) optimized the SEOF NP coating, 2) advanced development of desirable light profiles along SEOF, 3) developed a proprietary first-principle optical fiber light scattering mathematical model to engineer the SEOF and 4) demonstrated bacterial inactivation in water or on surfaces.

CAMFlow uses an innovative control scheme that enables stable operation using only Boolean valve states, even for the low flow rates necessary for sub-kW Hall thrusters. This methodology removes system complexity and places the onus of reliability almost entirely on valve cycle life. Throttling, open and closed-loop operation, as well as hard startup/shutdown in closed loop mode were all successfully demonstrated with the CAMFlow system with a Hall thruster at UM facilities during the Phase I effort.

The Phase II effort has the dual focus of extensive reliability/performance testing and the design, assembly, acceptance testing, and delivery of a compact integrated Phase II system ready for flight integration. The successful Phase I demonstrations of stable operation at target performance levels lead to the design of the Phase II CAMFlow system test hardware, thermal modeling, production, acceptance testing, environmental validation testing, and delivery of a flight-like CAMFlow system (TRL 6) at the end of Phase II.

The antimicrobial activity of Ag NPs is attributed to the release of Ag + ion, which means that Ag NPs need to be soluble to achieve microbial inactivation. However, because of this constant silver release, Ag NPs rapidly dissolve away from the surface, depleting the biocidal activity and limiting the use of Ag NPs for long term biofouling control. In Phase I of this project, the team led by Cactus Materials Inc. demonstrated that Ag NPs can be passivated with less soluble forms of silver, such as Ag 2 S, AgBr, or AgI, to slow down silver release and extend the lifetime of Ag NPs-based antimicrobial coatings. When different passivation chemistries were compared, sulfidation of Ag NPs was found to have the best performance in terms of both slow silver release and high antimicrobial performance. The improved anti-biofouling performance is attributed to the higher retention of silver on the surface over time. A green chemistry approach was developed to functionalize surfaces in situ using a flow through system with reagents of Toxicity Class II or lower. The passivated silver coatings were shown to be compatible with the current use of aqueous AgF for water treatment and storage in the International Space Station. Phase II of this project will evaluate how to coat surfaces comprised of different materials or having complex morphologies with the passivated silver coating developed in Phase I. Long term anti-biofouling performance will be assessed in a dormancy scenario of up to a year. Release of chemicals and particles during the dormancy period will be assessed to identify any risk to the water quality from long term exposure to the passivated silver coatings.

However, this is not necessarily a safe or cost-effective process. The MIL STD may underestimate some known threats specific to a NASA mission. Successive revisions to MIL-STD-461 have increased radiation susceptibility levels by more than 40dB to accommodate the rapidly evolving EMC threats from ever-higher frequency digital electronics.

By appropriately tuning each element on the metasurface, using metasurface-specific algorithms, we will demonstrate a high gain electronically steered beam with fast switching speeds. This approach lends itself to minimize total power consumption, and by association, cooling requirements. A DMA will uses inexpensive components (e.g., varactors and DACs at a few $ each) and unlike an AESA, the DMA does not require phase shifters or densely packed transmission/receiver modules. As a result, production DMA antennas are expected to have a bill of materials (BOM) of around $100k per square meter, or less, making it possible to build large, high-performance—but relatively inexpensive—apertures. Further, in exploring the DMA for very large aperture systems, the Duke team has discovered a variation of the metasurface architecture that minimizes the number of components needed to achieve the requisite beam forming and beam steering performance, further reducing antenna costs. Ultimately, the DMA design maintains the advantages of a sparse phased array, but with the extreme field of regard associated with advanced active electronic scanned arrays (AESA) systems.The antenna platform we envision here will harness commercial printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing techniques to produce the top metasurface layer.

This system is compatible with additive manufacturing techniques, high-temperature thermoset resins, and composite substrates currently in use and under development by NASA, SpaceX, and others. Our in-situ resin curing system will eliminate the need for large ovens or autoclaves. By leveraging advances in out of autoclave curing methods, our system will enable curing of additively manufactured high temperature thermoset resin based TPS in-situ. An infrared heat source mounted directly on the print head will rapidly stiffen the extrudate as it leaves the nozzle, enabling multi-layer printing. Upon completion of the printing process, a modular system of conductive heat blankets, conforming to the surface contours of the structure, will control final cure of the thermoset. The system will measure the temperature of the resin, and provide feedback control and log thermal history during curing. In-line surface activation with a corona generator will ensure strong bonding to the underlying substrate and at layer interfaces.Validation of the system will be performed by measuring the degree of cure of in-situ cured samples and measurement of bond strength.

Designing and producing safe reliable UAM aircraft is particularly challenging given the relative infancy of electric propulsion for aeronautical applications, and that the complex aeromechanics associated with multiple proprotors and lifting/nonlifting surfaces interacting with each other and the airframe impacts fatigue, performance, control and flying qualities. As UAM aircraft concepts start to mature to the point that sub-scale demonstrators and proof-of-concept aircraft are being developed, there is a need for improved analysis tools, to support more detailed design, control law and control system development and testing. Unfortunately, the current generation of CFD-based high fidelity tools is unsuitable for many daily design and analysis applications due to computational cost, expertise requirements and setup level of effort. Conversely, many current design tools rely upon look-up tables or empirical relationships to capture complex interactional aerodynamics, or viscous and compressible effects, and become increasingly inaccurate in regions where the strong wake/component interactions occur or wakes trailed and shed from aerodynamic component becomes highly distorted. To directly address this market need, the team of Continuum Dynamics, Inc. and Georgia Institute of Technology proposes to build upon ongoing nonoverlapping work for NASA and the Department of Defense to develop a suite of mid-fidelity aeromechanics tools that directly address modelling assumptions and limitations of current and emerging design tools without being as costly as contemporary high fidelity overset CFD-based approaches.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The proposed effort supports several of NASA ARMD’s Strategic Thrusts ( #3 - Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles and #4 - Transition to Low-Carbon Propulsion) and ongoing Advanced Air Vehicle Program (AAVP) projects (the Advanced Air Transport Technologies (AATT) project, the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP), and the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technologies (RVLT) project.

A conventional high resolution spectrograph usually contains a collimator, echelle grating, cross disperser, and finally a camera and science detector—both typically semiconductor detectors. Here we propose developing a spectrometer where the light is separated and channelized by a photonic circuit and is then detected by an energy-resolving superconducting detector. The instrument would be a radical new type of high resolution spectrograph applicable for both multiobject and integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy and other fiber fed light applications. Our goal is to create a high resolution multi-object spectrograph by marrying two breakthrough technologies, ultra-low loss arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, or MKIDs. MKIDs can determine the energy of each arriving photon without read noise or dark current, and with high temporal resolution. The AWG allows us to disperse light from the telescope, in a compact way and to position the dispersed light into numerous output channels which we can conveniently position (i.e. dispersed not just by the angle at which it diffracts off a prism or grating). The MKID allows us to distinguish between the orders in the disperse light contained within the channels, eliminated the need for a cross-disperser.

NASA has identified the RDE as a technology of interest for its in-space propulsion applications such as orbital transfer or planetary lander engines. However, a technology feasibility assessment is not currently possible since the dynamics of the key fluid-combustion-system processes are not well understood for relevant conditions. To achieve a reliable and efficient RDE, various processes must be understood and/or optimized including the fuel-oxidizer propellant mixing, injection of fresh propellants with minimal pressure losses, and the interaction of fresh propellants with combustion products while avoiding deflagration losses. For liquid RDE combustion, measurements simply do not exist that provide detailed characterization of liquid breakup, atomization, vaporization, and burning during the interaction of liquid propellants with shocks and detonation waves. The proposed research focuses on transitioning state-of-the-art, time-resolved measurement techniques to liquid-fueled RDEs to provide information critical for understanding these systems and their design. The proposed research will provide ultra-high-speed (100 kHz–5 MHz) in-situ spatially and temporally resolved imaging of the gaseous oxidizer-liquid fuel mixing, species concentrations, and combustion to anchor and improve numerical modeling predictive capability. The proposed imaging measurements will characterize and measure the gaseous oxygen-liquid fuel mixing, combustion processes, flowfield structure, and dynamics in the liquid-fueled RDEs. Concurrent simulations will be performed at two fidelity levels (a lower fidelity Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes model and a higher fidelity shock-physics/multiphase-combustion mode), enabling improved interpretation of the measurement data and RDE physics, and anchored modeling and simulations.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The proposed R&D work seeks to modernize the measurement technology in RDEs for rocket applications. This includes time and space resolved measurements inside the RDE leveraging new technological developments such as the burst-mode laser. Detailed measurements of the mixing, O/F ratio, quantified deflagration versus detonation, and other key RDE phenomena will be directly compared to numerical simulations to provide boundary conditions and anchor current and future RDE modeling efforts.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Non-NASA applications of the proposed efforts include high-fidelity, spatiotemporal analysis of highly dynamic phenomena and validated modeling. Commercial applications include air-breathing propulsion, stationary power generation, and fundamental research in a wide range of aerothermal flows.",,,Purdue University - Main Campus,"155 South Grant Street, IN 47907 - 2114",(765) 496-2782,,24

The sensor consists of a software-defined radar transceiver, compact dual-polarized array antenna operating in the X-band as well as an integrated RF analog front-end. By leveraging dual-polarization processing, the system will be able to extract atmospheric parameters; thus it will be able to identify and classify the atmospheric conditions as well as local obscurants. The software defined radar transceiver has a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) component which can easily generate high bandwidth chirp waveforms (bandwidth >=200 MHz) and pulse shaping can be defined digitally to reduce the side-lobes considerably. IAI is currently developing a software defined radar (SDR) platform that can adaptively switch between different modes of operation for radar, by modifying both transmit waveforms and receive signal-processing tasks on the fly. The proposed multi-channel radar technique and the system design will leverage IAI's vast experience in SDR, RF hardware design and antenna design and OU's capabilities in microwave design and field-proven atmospheric hazard modeling and detection algorithm development.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed technology is built upon the radar design and communications expertise of IAI and our sub-contractors at OU.

At the atomic level, the crystal structure is expected to be both open (for fast Li-ion intercalation/diffusion) and stable (for good reversibility). The cathode materials developed in this program are expected to have high capacity and high rate capability, as well as long cycle life. Additionally, the crystal structure of the proposed material is expected to be stable over a wide temperature range upon Li-ion deintercalation, without oxygen evolution.

The structure, composition, particle morphology and electrochemical performance will then be determined. The objective of the Phase I STTR program is to demonstrate the feasibility of a new high capacity and high voltage cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries.

Solar panels are an obvious solution but making them suitable for the grueling space environment. Panels must withstand intense radiation bombardment and extreme temperature swings while maintaining acceptable levels of efficiency. Additionally because of the exorbitant costs of current technology NASA would like to reduce the costs associated with power generation. We propose to introduce a new class of solar cells that utilize the environmental strengths and absorption properties on InGaN technology. This material has an amazingly high defect tolerance but even more impressively can be tuned to capture any wave length of light in the solar spectrum. Our proposal offers the possibility of solar cell efficiencies exceeding 70% while providing excellent radiation resistance and a price point similar to that of silicon, 100 times cheaper than current space age technology.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Our solar panels will be of interest to NASA on each and every operation that is under taken. Power generation in space is essential to drive all the electronics necessary to keep machinery working and astronauts alive. Our panels will be light, powerful and resilient allowing them to take less space and be stored more efficiently. These are very important characteristics, millions of dollars ride on the performance of the power generation system. When Hubble was first deployed it was almost a complete disaster, if the solar panels had not successfully deployed the circuitry of the enormous satellite would have frozen in space. Increased efficiency will increase operational restrictions allowing probes to last longer, travel farther, and recover more information. Such projects as a lunar base will become cheaper, and more feasible when combined with our power generation technology.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Beyond NASA the strength of our technology lays in its outstanding efficiency and low production costs.

Small improvements in the RPS performance, weight, size, and/or reliability can have a dramatic effect on the scientific capability of the vehicle and the overall mission costs. Radioisotope Thermophotovoltaic (RTPV) energy converters are a particular type of RPS that directly convert the heat produced by a General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) to electrical power using a specialized Photovoltaic (PV) cell. A key element in an RTPV system is the radiative emitter that converts GPHS thermal energy to radiative energy that illuminates the PV cell. In this project, Creare and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) propose to develop an advanced, 2-D, photonic crystal radiative emitter that is optimized for RTPV systems. The emitter will provide high emittance in the bandgap of the PV cell with low emittance elsewhere that, when coupled with advanced PV cell filter technology, will provide high system efficiency. In Phase I, we will design the emitter and fabricate test samples, which will be fully characterized for high-temperature emittance and durability. We will also assess the impact of this new emitter on the overall RTPV system design and performance.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Exploration missions that extend much beyond the earth's orbit around the sun are severely limited by the amount of power that can be generated by conventional solar panels. Radioisotope power systems are, therefore, required to enable flagship missions to the outer solar system and in some cases to the inner solar system (e.g., the lunar poles). RTPV systems offer the potential for high specific power and high efficiency, both of which can lead to vehicles with more science capability at lower cost and lower launch mass. RTPV offers the potential reliability and low vibration of a static conversion process like thermoelectrics with efficiency approaching that of dynamic systems like Stirling and Brayton energy converters. RTPV could, therefore, be a viable alternative for any NASA exploration mission requiring an RPS.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Radioisotope power systems are used for a number of military applications. RTPV-based systems would be a viable alternative to the current thermoelectric-based systems. There is also current interest in small nuclear powered batteries based on RTPV. The emitter technology developed on this project could be readily applied in both these military applications. TPV with combustion-based heat sources has long been considered for a number of industrial and consumer applications. The technology developed on this project would have potential application in many of these systems if a commercial TPV system were ever marketed. Most likely, this would be a low power energy scavenging application(s) (e.g., self-powered sensor).",Nuclear Conversion; Photovoltaic Conversion; Thermodynamic Conversion; Thermoelectric Conversion,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 - 4301",(617) 258-5015

Two major loss components are conductive (phonon) heat transfer through the TE lattice and parasitic losses at fabrication interfaces.  Shock wave consolidation of thermoelectric nanopowders to produce TE devices will reduce both loss sources, leading to enhanced efficiency devices. The conversion efficiency of a TE device will always be thermodynamically limited by the Carnot ratio of (Th-Tc)/Th, where Th and Tc are the temperatures of the hot and cold junctions.  Present technology thermoelectric devices can provide conversion efficiencies up to a third of the Carnot limit. With the restrictions on phonon transport acruing from nanopowder consolidation, conversion efficiencies of over 50% of the Carnot limit should be possible.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Thermoelectric efficiency enhancement will allow the fabrication of smaller, lighter TE devices such as radioisotope generators in satellites and deep space probes.  Efficiency enhancements will also enable applications that have not previously been addressed such as harvesting sensor energy from astronaut body heat and piggybacking thermoelectric generating cells on the back of photovoltaic cells to allow the maximum extraction of energy from solar radiation.Improvements in thermoelectric efficiency benefit Peltier cooling of astronauts, CCD cells and electronics since less energy will be required for these heat pumping applications.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) High efficiency thermoelectric generation allows significant energy capture from waste heat streams in industrial and power plants. Combined with escalating electricity prices, the payback times are reduced and this allows wider deployments and both scale and scope economies.

(Maxion) and Professor Mario Dagenais and his group at the University of Maryland (UMD) jointly propose to develop a compact, efficient, single mode, narrow linewidth tunable laser source in the 3.2to3.6 micron wavelength region. This effort, if successful, will assist NASA in its trace gas detection objectives by supplying NASA with the most critical (and difficult to obtain) laser source required. During the Phase 1 portion of this effort, Maxion and UMD propose to: a) develop/demonstrate a low-loss IC laser design, b) develop ultra-low modal reflectivity anti-reflection (AR) output facets on interband cascade laser (ICL) gain chips, and c) validate the AR coating quality by demonstrating continuous tuning of an ECL using the high temperature, state-of-the-art AR-coated gain chip developed during this program. The low-loss ICL design is important to improve the maximum cw operating temperature of IC lasers, currently limited to near-room-temperature values. The ultra-low reflectivity coating will permit the maximum possible wavelength tuning range to be achieved. This is important as it will realize tunability throughout the widest possible range (the goal being 3.2-to-3.6 microns) using a single semiconductor laser chip. The new low-loss IC design and the ultra-low reflectivity output facet represent, together, the two central roadblocks Maxion sees to achieving a compact, tunable laser source in the mid-infrared wavelength region. Consequently, the Phase I effort will represent a feasibility study to see if our approaches to overcoming these two roadblocks can be successful.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA requires LIDAR instruments and components for use in remote sensing measurements in future earth science missions. NASA particularly needs advanced components for direct-detection LIDAR instruments on new UAV platforms, on ground-based test beds, and eventually in space. For in-situ gas measurements using tunable laser spectrometers, available platforms such as aircraft, balloons, surface and entry probes and landed rovers impose severe limitations on instrument size, weight and power (SWAP). Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy is a simple measurement technique known for its high sensitivity (subparts per billion) and specificity, and potentially superior SWAP compared to competing technologies. For instance, tunable laser spectroscopy can measure the gas phase methane abundance down to 10 parts per trillion with pre-concentration and to 1 ppbv without pre-concentration. Measurement of the isotopic ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in methane can help assess the biogenic origin of methane on Mars-like planets. Also important are sources for remote measurements of carbon-based trace gases (CO2, CH4, and CO) for total column measurements from aircraft and spacecraft operating to nadir using the earth's surface as a target, as well as for profiling measurements from the ground using atmospheric backscatter. These systems need tunable, narrow-line-width lasers and sensitive detectors that operate in the 1.5 micron, 1.6 micron and 3.2-3.6 micron wavelength bands.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) A tunable external cavity semiconductor laser using an interband cascade laser would present many commercial, non-NASA-specific applications. Presently, interband cascade lasers are the only semiconductor lasers that have achieved cw, room-temperature operation in the 3.2-to-3.6 micron wavelength band. The correspondence of this wavelength band with the spectroscopic ""molecular fingerprints"" of the hydrocarbon molecules, based on the carbon-hydrogen stretch resonance, present numerous applications for a widely tunable laser-based instrument. For example, sensitive methane and ethane concentration measurements are important in oil and natural gas exploration. Measurement of alcohol in exhaled breath or at surface-capillary points can obviously be important to law enforcement. Over 200 organic compounds have been detected in exhaled human breath and some of these compounds have been correlated to various diseases, including cancer. Suspected cancer biomarkers include ethane, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Also, in-clinic measurement of certain gases in exhaled breath can be an important new medical diagnostic. For example, acetone in exhaled breath is linked to diabetes; ethane in exhaled breath has been correlated to oxidative stress and post-operative organ rejection. Thus, a widely tunable laser source is vital for realizing a small, portable, and inexpensive instrument that can sensitively detect hundreds of compounds throughout the 3.2-to-3.6 micron wavelength band.",Optical,,University of Maryland,"3112 Lee Building, College Park, MD 20742 - 5141",(301) 405-3684

The existing libraries such as PETSc or LAPACK are ""stretched"" to the limits by new generation application codes which create big, unsymmetric, often dense, and poorly conditioned matrices.

The adaptable monitoring system will provide information on current and predicted aircraft performance and controllability, alerting the pilot to any aerodynamic degradation of the control effectiveness. This includes high angle-of-attack, heavy rain, in-flight icing encounters, environmental contamination of surfaces, and structural or battle damage. The real-time monitoring system measures the time-averaged and RMS control surface hinge moment from all aircraft aerodynamic controls. Control surface hinge moment is sensitive to the aerodynamic characteristics of the flying surface, including separation. These data are processed and information on the current and predicted future state of aircraft control (including asymmetric cases) is made available to the pilot or flight management system. As opposed to other single-point monitoring systems, the proposed system has the distinct advantage that it functions by measuring the integrated effect over the entire control surface. The use of real-time control surface hinge moment monitoring is an innovative and robust concept for predicting aircraft flight envelope boundaries and controllability.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed control surface hinge moment based flight envelope monitoring system technology is synergistic with the national priorities in aerospace R/R&D. The new technology will mitigate environmental hazards for future operational concepts and provide increased safety for the expansion of flight envelopes for aerospace vehicles. The flight envelope monitoring system will provide state-of-the-art on-board envelope assessment including continuous diagnosis and prognosis. The proposed envelope monitoring system has significant potential application in several NASA programs. The robust and integrated sensing technology could be fielded in both manned and unmanned NASA aircraft systems.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The successful development of a control surface hinge moment based flight envelope monitoring system has a large potential for use on both existing and future air vehicles, including general aviation, military, commercial planes, and especially unmanned aircraft systems and commuter and turbo prop cargo aircraft. Commuter class and smaller cargo aircraft would be a very valuable application of the flight envelope monitoring system. These aircraft typically operate from smaller airports and spend a greater percentage of their flight time at lower altitudes and airspeeds. Operation at lower altitudes and airspeeds put the aircraft at greater risk of experiencing environmental or structurally based aerodynamic performance degradation, including ice accumulation, storm and rain encounters, and even bird strikes. The technology is equally valuable for unmanned platforms where it is difficult for a remote operator to sense envelope boundaries or any difference in performance due to environmental or battle damage. The flight envelope monitoring system can aid this class of aircraft either as a standalone warning system, or it can be licensed to the aircraft manufacturer and be built into a more complex, integrated system.","Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems; Testing Facilities",,The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois,"1901 South First Street, Suite A, Champaign, IL 61820 - 7473",(217) 333-2187

For risk reduction considerations, it is desirable that they be flown on other missions prior to use on vehicles such as Orion or Altair. An innovative and cost-effective approach to doing so is to use picosats, which are miniaturized spacecraft with masses on the order of a few kilograms. Because of their size, weight and power requirements, they are ideal for low-cost, quick-turn-around technology demonstration missions. Picosats are now being developed at universities by teams of students for ""hands on"" experience with real space hardware. The University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Texas A&M University (TAMU), for example, are working with NASA Johnson Space Center to implement a series of four picosat missions that would culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D). This is a mission-critical, system-level technology needed by Project Constellation, especially Orion. Accordingly, Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. (Emergent) proposes to team with UT to move the Platform for Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking with Innovative GN&C Methods (PARADIGM) picosats out of the university research realm and into the commercial marketplace. These spacecraft are being built by UT students to fly in concert with the picosats being built by their TAMU counterparts. The Flight 1 spacecraft are being readied for launch in early 2009 and are primed for transition to industry. Emergent will work with UT and TAMU in Phase 1 to design the 3 missions that will follow Flight 1. In Phase 2, we will use our considerable engineering expertise and AR&D spaceflight experience to help achieve a successful Flight 2. In Phase 3, we will successfully implement Flights 3 and 4 and in the process develop a picosat product line that can be applied to a variety of commercial space applications.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) There are many potential applications for picosats in the aerospace industry. For NASA, the primary application is the development and demonstration of new technologies and concepts. In particular, it is the achievement of TRL 9 for technologies required by Project Constellation. To explore the Moon, and eventually Mars, new technologies must be developed and tested before implementation on the vehicles that comprise Project Constellation. These include GN&C; autonomous flight software; systems health monitoring and fault detection, isolation and recovery, among others. With the Shuttle retiring and the launch date for Orion steadily moving to the right, picosats offer the opportunity for low-cost, quick-turn around technology demonstration flights. Another application is the use of picosats for space vehicle inspection and situational awareness. Any of the visiting vehicles to the International Space Station, going to and returning from the Moon, etc. would benefit from a safety standpoint if there were miniaturized inspection satellites to support the docking/undocking and re-entry phases of flight.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Picosats are ideal for the test and validation of Micro-Electrical/Micro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Making spacecraft subsystems and components lighter has always been a need for the space industry, and MEMS technology is being considered for use in smallsats, nanosats, and now picosats, which of these three are best matched for the purpose. Providing affordable platforms that are right-sized for the test and validation of MEMS technologies is a perfect application of picosats.Picosats are well suited for universities to continue to use as training grounds for future spacecraft engineers, instrument builders, software developers, etc. For those with more of a science focus, picosats can be used to inexpensively fly university-built payloads.Picosats represent a means to meet the need for more rapid response from space assets for the DoD. With the establishment of the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office at Kirtland AFB in 2007, the DoD took action to focus efforts to meet this need. The ORS Office is interested in finding ways to reduce the development time and cost of spacecraft that can help provide the warfighter in the field with timely and critical information. Picosats offer a means to meet the rapid and low development cost requirements and due to their size, offer flexibility when it comes to selecting a launch provider.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures",,The University of Texas at Austin,"P.

These will include the US Department of Defense, and the increasing number of cubesat projects that require attitude control and those that will require AR&D in the years ahead. Formation flying experiments and commercial ventures that propose dense satellite clusters as measurement platforms will need stationkeeping and maneuvering capabilities in very small form factors to manage launch vehicle costs.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Micro Thrusters; Telemetry, Tracking and Control",,The University of Texas at Austin,"Office of Sponsored Projects, PO Box 7726, Austin, TX 78713 - 7726",(512) 471-1422

However, at present commercially available TE devices typically offer limited heat to electricity conversion efficiencies, well below the fundamental thermodynamic limit, calling for the development of higher efficiency materials. The team of MicroXact Inc and UCLA DRL is proposing to develop a revolutionary ultrahigh efficiency thermoelectric material fabricated on completely new fabrication principles. The material comprises the three-dimensional ""wells"" of Ge/Si Quantum Quantum Dot Superlattices fabricated by a conformal coating of macroporous silicon (MPSi) pore walls. Such a material will provide very high ZT values at macroscopic thicknesses of the material, permitting 30% or more conversion efficiencies. In Phase I of the project the team will develop a thorough model of the proposed TE material, will theoretically predict the achievable efficiency of the material and will demonstrate the growth of the single layer of QDs on the pore walls. In Phase II the team will fabricate the proposed material and will demonstrate the efficiencies exceeding 30%. After the Phase II the team will attract VC funding to commercialize the technology.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The largest immediate NASA application of the proposed ultraefficient thermoelectric materials and devices is thermoelectric generators, already actively using in a large number of NASA missions. The advantages of the proposed technology (unmatched efficiency combined with the small size and low weight) would provide the competitive advantage to MicroXact sufficient for successful market penetration. Other potential NASA applications, including potential powering small devices from human thermal energy, etc. can be allowed by the proposed technology as well. Due to the unique benefits the proposed ultrahigh efficiency TE materials and devices are expected to penetrate these and other NASA applications. The proposed concept, when developed and commercialized, is expected to cause a significant impact on the cost, safety and reliability of future NASA missions.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) In addition to NASA applications, the proposed ultraefficient thermoelectric materials and devices are expected to find applications in such fields as electronic device cooling (microprocessors, focal plane arrays, etc.), food storage/processing (wine cellers, Freon-free refrigerators), automotive and aviation industry (to enhance the fuel consumption). Due to the unique performance expected from proposed materials and devices all these markets can be potrentially addressable with the proposed technology. The most promising market for initial penetration is believed to be the electronic component cooling market, where the behefits of the proposed technology (high efficiency combined with potentially reduced size) would provide the largest competitive advantage.",Thermoelectric Conversion,,University of California Los Angeles,"56-125B Engineering IV Building, Los Angeles, CA 90095 - 1594",(310) 825-1609

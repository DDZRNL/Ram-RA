These ionomers exhibit self-healing properties as a function of the ionic content of the material.  Previous work has focused on self-healing of puncture damage caused by projectiles, has shown that an airtight seal can be formed in real time seconds after the puncture has occurred.Since self-healing has already been demonstrated, the major technical challenge of this effort is to stimulate the localized melt elastic response that has been shown to initiate self-healing.  Our concept is to incorporate a magnetically-responsive phase into the insulating polymer using magnetic flux particle alignment to induce localized heating during high-frequency excitation of the polymer.  Tuning the frequency of the electrical signal to the critical frequency of the polymer associated with the glass transition temperature will produce localized heating of the insulation. Localized heating, initiated by a wiring damage event such as arcing, will cause flow into the crack and, upon cooling, the crack will close over the wire and eliminate the exposure of the bare wire.  With proper arrangement of nanoparticles the impact on material property can be minimized, while site-specific self-healing can be demonstrated.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  Potential NASA commercial applications include extraterrestrial vehicles that cannot be repaired on-site, systems that are too complex to be disassembled for repair, and critical components that cannot function with damage.

The AAN with a moveable spike for thrust vectoring and throttling could provide a more efficient alternative to traditional bell nozzles.  Cal Poly, which has a thrust vector research facility, has teamed with Rolling Hills Research Corporation, with CFD capability, to experimentally and analytically determine the optimal approach to thrust vectoring and throttling the AAN.  In Phase I, several scale AAN models were fabricated with movable spikes that could be displaced and/or gimballed.  One set of studies quantified thrust changes as a function of spike axial position for throttling.  Other studies examined the thrust vectoring effectiveness of various proprietary nozzle configurations.  Schlieren photography and 3-axis force measurements showed excellent correlation to predictions made with the OVERFLOW CFD code.  The most promising of the nozzle configurations for thrust vectoring and throttling were shown to produce stable flow that generates a resultant turn angle whose magnitude is in the neighborhood of current rocket booster technology.  These promising configurations have been selected for extensive laboratory testing and computational analysis for optimization in the Phase II program.

Thrust vectoring and throttling capabilities would provide control of flight regimes (speed, angle of incidence, transients, and other flight conditions).  In addition, flights with thrust vector control would have less dispersion and therefore could be confined to a smaller test area, which would improve range safety.

Due to their inherent altitude compensation, aerospike rocket nozzles are ideal for SSTO vehicles.

The sensors developed here are based on the GaN/AlGaN materials system and are sensitive in the wavelength range from 250-400nm. Target responsivities are > 0.1 A/W throughout the spectral interest range. The first arrays produced under phase 1 were sensitive both to 285 and 315 nm simultaneously. Multicolor sensitivity improves background noise rejection and provides much more detailed analysis of atmospheric aerosol scattering. Noise is dominated by diode reverse leakage and is less than 10-9A/cm2. The CE manufacturing process is enabled by the recognition that surfaces on which radiation sensitive materials are grown cannot be exposed to plasma etch effluents. To overcome this limitation, a dielectric lift-off-lithography process was developed. In this process, the growth surfaces only come in contact with organic solvents and photosensitive plastics during manufacture. Initial results were obtained on a 10 x 10 diode array. In subsequent work, we intend to produce 100 x 100 arrays. In addition, it the range of attainable spectral sensitivities will be mapped out by studying the range of achievable AlGaN stoichiometries that are practically attainable.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  Within NASA, there are several possible applications.  In addition to the astrophysics observatory, UV photo-detectors can be used in surveillance, rocket plume tracking and plume sensing, combustion and flame-out detection, and other similar applications.  The high signal-to-noise ratio and the fast response time accomplished by UV photodetectors make them especially useful for NASA and several defense applications in extremely harsh environments. The characteristics that make UV photodetectors suitable for NASA applications also benefit many industrial and scientific applications. Several applications in environmental monitoring and control use UV sensors. For example, UV based systems can detect ozone, sulphur dioxide, and benzene. Since many of these sub-system use an excimer laser (at 248 nm) as a source, it is important to use a solar blind detector in this application. Companies such as Honeywell are also evaluating UV detectors for furnace control functions. In addition, UV spectroscopy plays an important role in several medical and scientific applications.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS ( Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Most of the applications listed above are of high commercial value.

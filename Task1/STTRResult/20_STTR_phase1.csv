In response, Alphacore is proposing a meta-transmission line wave-space that will miniaturize a Rotman lens by a factor of 100, while retaining its time-delay properties. The Rotman lens is one of the simplest and most reliable low-cost multiple-beam phased array architectures used today. Alphacore’s novel design will include an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with a 12-bit current-steering segmented-DAC.

To achieve this goal, NASA requires a deeper understanding of the AM process, particularly for current alloy systems and existing AM manufacturing equipment. As a continuation of earlier internal research and development work at SwRI step towards an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework, we propose to develop an extensible framework of the AM process to provide Rapid Additive Manufacturing Build Outcomes - RAMBO. RAMBO will provide thermal histories, microstructure evolution, and material properties of an additively manufactured part built using the powder bed fusion process.

Microstructural features would ultimately in turn drive predictions of mechanical properties (e.g., stress-strain curves) for the additively manufactured material. The focused material system for this initial software development effort will be Ti-6Al-4V. By defining I/O through common interfaces, the RAMBO framework enforces modularity of the software components. As a result, RAMBO will readily accommodate additional physics, new material systems, and novel manufacturing processes provided that the underlying routines conform to the common interface.

For applications in deployable spacecraft structures, thin-ply composites are currently made from spread-tow carbon fabrics impregnated with epoxy polymer matrices. The polymer matrix exhibits a strongly time-dependent mechanical response, which means that its current stress or strain state is influenced by the loading and temperature histories. Polymers go through several distinct regimes of behavior as the strain level increases, which are characterized by linear viscoelasticity, nonlinear viscoelasticity, time-dependent yielding, viscoplasticity, and time-dependent fracture. A complete constitutive description of all these deformation stages, and incorporation of these behaviors in thin-ply composite laminates, is highly challenging and requires a multi-year effort, but is critical because composite deployable structures are folded to high curvatures for extended periods of time. Previous experiments have shown that an extended stowage time can lead to incomplete deployment, like in the case of the MARSIS instrument in the Mars Express Orbiter mission, and partially recovered deployed shape, resulting in low performance and reliability.The proposed effort is a step towards meeting this challenge by focusing on modeling the nonlinear viscoelastic response that precedes permanent deformation as well as the time-dependent yield limits of thin-ply composites. The underlying computational framework is based on the mechanics of structure genome (MSG) [ref msg paper], a recently discovered unified approach for multiscale constitutive modeling of composite structures, and formulated with finite kinematic measures.

It has become universally accepted that in order to increase the number, scope, and innovation of space missions, reusable, component-based software needs to be developed. That is, complex robot and flight software can be developed concurrently and more robustly by utilizing a common framework of shared software libraries and tools. Thus, components developed by different organizations for different missions can be shared and reused because all components use the same abstracted API to the underlying hardware, including a common communication bus. A variety of programming frameworks have been created over the years that do just this.The goal of TRACLabs and the Applied Physics Laboratory is to integrate two such frameworks--NASA's cFS (core Flight System) and Open Robotics' ROS 2--in order to leverage the advantages of each system, while helping validate ROS 2 for space flight in a measured way. cFS has a proven track record for supporting embedded, Class-B space systems, but it does not contain nearly the number of applications that exist in the ROS ecosystem. ROS is useful for quickly building state-of-the-art robot systems that use a large number of cutting-edge algorithms for perception, localization, manipulation, and human-robot interaction; however, little concern is given to resource usage (memory, CPU, bandwidth), longevity, or even failure recovery by individual ROS component developers. The new ROS 2 framework, which is built on DDS message passing middleware, has the potential to eventually replace cFS for robotic flight systems. In the meantime, advanced algorithms written by the ROS 2 community should not be ignored by upcoming NASA missions. By combining cFS for safety-critical components with ROS 2 for advanced-data-processing components, near-term space systems can benefit by achieving more autonomy and more scientific discovery.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Multiple near- and far-term missions will benefit from the technologies of this project, including: ISS robots like Astrobee and R2, lunar rovers like VIPER, the Lunar Gateway, OSAM systems like Restore-L and the Robotic Refueling Missions, Orbital Debris Mitigation, Artemis, the Lunar Surface Science Mobility System, Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), Mars sample return, New Frontiers exploration mission opportunities like Titan or Europa, and various STMD technology demonstrations.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Other organizations that utilize cFS, like JAXA, KARI, Astrobotic, and the Air Force SMC, will benefit from this technology.

While many technologies and program strategies focus in ISRU, propellant production substantially impacts the scope and duration of these missions. Through ISRU, missions can benefit from substantial mass savings, and size reduction which, in turn, result in longer durations and larger payloads. Moreover, reusable landers within situ propellant production can reduce cost and benefit critical functions such as life support, energy storage, and scientific payloads.With the potential benefit comes certain technical challenges. While pure methane is a well-characterized propellant, impurities that may be present in in situ production can cause a variety of issues. Beginning in the manufacturing process, the presence of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water can affect the success of liquefaction processes. Carbon dioxide and water both have freezing points above the saturation temperature of methane that could cause the build up of solids in liquefaction plumbing. Moreover, carbon monoxide has a lower saturated temperature so it may either, not condense and cause gas pocket, or condense and boil off later. It may require a conditioning stage to separate carbon monoxide from methane or maintaining temperatures low enough to keep it from boiling.In this effort GTL proposes to determine the effect of impure propellant on mission critical systems, including storage, pressurization systems, thermal management systems, and combustion instability.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)Since this effort is focused towards defining standards for impure propellant properties, the commercial marketplace is small.

The proposed technology builds on proven software – to enable flexible composition of collaborative mission concepts assessed in an open simulation environment. The focus of IN-PASS is rover autonomous navigation – specifically development of onboard algorithms to reduce uncertainty in rover localization minimizing use of onboard resources. The solution will apply to a heterogeneous swarm of lunar orbital and surface assets. For example, a constellation of CubeSats provides GPS-like navigation services to aid onboard estimation of rover state to inform onboard planning. When a limited number of satellites are deployed, the constellation cannot continually provide measurement support; hence the system will use Event-Trigged Distributed Data Fusion (ET-DDF) between swarm assets to maintain a high-degree of state knowledge with minimal data exchange.

Mission plan optimization determines resources to engage during certain mission phases to ensure success. This is particularly true for inter-asset communications or localization, which employ hardware components and processing that utilize significant stored energy. This STTR focuses on development of onboard planning algorithms based on formal methods that determine the degree of resource utilization required to successfully achieve mission activities.

Silver is known to react with some of the metallic (e.g. 316 stainless steel, Inconel 718, and titanium 6A1-4V) components of the water storage system, which result in a gradual loss of biocidal silver ions over time in the water. Various studies have been conducted to investigate these surface interactions over conventional spacecraft materials, e.g., stainless steel, Inconel, Teflon and titanium, as well as, different surface treatments, e.g., acid passivation, silver plating, electropolishing and heat treatment. In general, more favorable outcomes have been obtained at lower surface to volume (S/V) ratios, with thermal oxidation, electropolishing and silver pre-treatment whereas higher S/V shows ineffective results. The traditional materials on ISS are stainless steel 316L (¼ inch ID pipes), titanium (½ inch ID pipes), Inconel 718 (bellows tanks). The choice of materials for the water system will be an important factor to ensure the success of silver as a biocide for spacecraft water systems. Silver loss on surface is thought to be done through a galvanic deposition process, with a concomitant oxidation of the substrate and reduction of silver ions to metallic silver/silver oxides on the surface. The goal of this proposal is to address the challenges with surface with S/V of 2 cm-1 and higher using an innovative surface coating of redox insulator that is effective and has not experimented previously. This will be done by coating a two dimensional (2D) materials (below 100 nm) on the surface of the stainless steel. This of thin and homogeneous layer of insulating materials can reduce silver reduction and biocidal loss in the water.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)A potable water treatment process is needed to prevent microbial growth in the water storage and distribution system for long duration missions. there remain significant challenges on its fast dissolution rate for an effective solution at preventing biofilm formation.

Most power supplies are based on switching converters that require power transistors, diodes, gate drivers, and control ICs that regulate the power. These components in a COTS assembly will all be unhardened commercial components that are sensitive to single event effects (SEE). Our objective is to develop the tools to predict which of these components are capable of tolerating the SEE and later validate the tools by experiments.Inside an HSE in space, the residual particle spectrum after filtering the space heavy-ion environment will consist of neutrons, protons, and alpha particles. These particles, when incident on a semiconductor device can produce secondary ion species through collisions, resulting in short-range energetic ions that can cause single-event effects. Consequently, the question addressed in the proposed work is whether commercial power converters can tolerate the secondary ion effects that will occur when operated in a highly-shielded environment.Busek and Vanderbilt University propose to use radiation transport modeling to determine the particle spectrum inside packaging enclosures and the result of the particles in the interior package environment impinging on semiconductor devices and producing secondary ions. We will calculate the spectrum of the secondary ions in Phase I. We will support the modeling with a low-energy ion test on representative components with a low-cost ion beam to find experimentally their sensitivities to the secondary ions.In Phase II, a high-energy accelerator heavy-ion test will be conducted with the calculated secondary ion spectrum as a proxy test. We will also seek opportunities to demonstrate a COTS DC/DC converter in HSE such as the International Space Station as a validation of the modeling approach and prediction.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)NASA plans many missions that require human presence living in habitats that are substantially free of ionizing radiation. However, no habitat can block high energy galactic particles or heavy high energy ions. Hence all EEE parts in such habitat must be SEE tolerant. Conventional rad hard EEE parts are very costly, less capable, and advanced chips ubiquitous in terrestrial applications don’t exist for space applications. When SEE tolerant COTS power converters are available they will proliferate thought-out the space industry.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)SEE tolerant COTS power converters would bring dramatic cost benefits to DoD missions and commercial spacecraft industry.

Nanopaste, nanoresin and nanotape technologies have been used to make Continuous Fiber Ceramic Nano-Composites (CFCNCs), a very special type of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) with engineered properties and multifunctionality. We are proposing a purposefully engineered silicon carbide-based CFCNC innovation to NASA for this topic area which overcomes the issues of delamination and will have tremendous payoff for spacecraft TPS and hypersonics in general. Some of the enabling printable nanopaste technology originated with GT’s very first Phase I NASA SBIR Contract #NNX17CM29P, and we have shown the ability to join large parts via an additive manufacturing process to fabricate seemless, monolithic structures. We also have the ability to co-cure CMC with PMC and carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites. We have been able to join these materials to both aluminum and steel. We have also produced CMC fasterners with up to 100 threads per inch for precision mechanical joining. During the Phase I STTR we propose to manufacture sample CFCNC coupons, perform ASTM testing to obtain mechanical properties (strength, strain, toughness), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to look at the nano/micro-structure, and establish initial high-temperature performance via two different heating methods, one proprietary. We will evaluate the efficacy of our ""Cure-On-The-Fly"" technologies for co-curing, and explore both co-curing and post-curing for adhesive bonding the CFCNC to underlying substrates.

During a failure scenario, Gateway-MAESTRO would first detect the problem; immediately safe the spacecraft to minimize damage; diagnose the problem and determine the root cause; determine potential feasible courses of action (COAs) given the failed components or set of possible failed components; determine the impact and ramifications of each COA; select the most appropriate COA; generate the detailed schedule/sequence of actions to implement the COA; and finally adaptively execute the required actions.","(Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)The direct transition target is the Gateway.

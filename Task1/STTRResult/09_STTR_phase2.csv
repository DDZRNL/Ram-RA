A critical part of this process is the accurate modeling of nonlinear components and interface structures, structures that connect major substructures, and the quantification of their uncertainties. By developing uncertainty models for reduced order models of specific substructures, NASA will be able to quantify margins and uncertainties for structural systems outside the domain of model validation tests.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA has long been required to ground-test spacecraft and spacecraft components in their launch configuration for model verification, validation and flight qualification because of the severity of the dynamic environment.

In addition, it will allow for stable and structurally robust designs at much lower flow coefficients than previously thought possible (down to at least 0.02) for the capability to operate in near zero net positive suction pressure inlet environments. The innovation is based upon a synergistic coupling of Concepts NREC's patented cavitation control device with a new blade design approach that takes full advantage of the CCD's characteristics for optimal suction performance.

Advances in CFD methods and parallel computing have provided NASA the core flow solvers to perform these simulations. However, the ease of use of these flow solvers and the reliability of the results obtained are a strong function of the technologies used to discretize the domain. Many applications involve solutions with highly anisotropic features: boundary layers, shear layers, wakes, shocks etc. Efficient resolution of those features motivates matching the mesh resolution/anisotropy to the solution's anisotropy but, in the more challenging applications, the location and strength of those features is difficult to precisely estimate prior to solution. Currently available meshing tools are not capable of producing and controlling the required initial meshes, nor adapting the mesh to match evolving anisotropic features. This project will combine Simmetrix Inc. expertise in the development of meshing components for flow simulations, and Rensselaer's Scientific Computation Research Center expertise in the development of adaptive mesh control technologies, to provide NASA the mesh generation and adaptation technologies needed. New techniques will be developed to create highly anisotropic semi-structured and unstructured meshes suitable for CFD simulations with high Reynolds number flow features (e.g., boundary layers, bow shocks, free shear layers, wakes, contact surfaces). Techniques to adapt these meshes based on mesh correction indicators will be developed to enable fully automated adaptive simulations. All procedures to be developed will work effectively in parallel on large-scale parallel computers and will support a wide range of flow solvers. The overall capabilities will be demonstrated through execution of fully automated parallel adaptive simulations on problems relevant to NASA.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) NASA applications of this technology include any type of computational fluid dynamics simulations that involve complex geometry and/or complex flow features whose solution resolution needs cannot be precisely defined before starting the solution process. Applications in the aeronautics area include airflow around aircraft and engines. Applications to astronautics include propulsion, liftoff and reentry aerodynamics, and energy generation systems in space. Problems with a wide range of spatial scales resulting from complex geometry and flow features will benefit most from the proposed developments. Specific examples may include passive and/or active flow control devices, inlet configurations for blended wing body with boundary layer ingestion, hypersonic flight vehicles with scramjet engines, crew launch and exploration vehicles, launch vehicles, re-entry capsules, tethered ballute configurations. In addition to these ""high speed"" aerodynamics applications, there are also NASA commercial applications related to power generation and other spacecraft systems in a low gravity environment. The mesh resolution needs of two phase flow systems in such environments can also be addressed by the proposed developments. Finally, there are also biomedical applications of CFD such as the effects of low gravity on the cardiovascular system and the respiratory system.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) High speed flow simulations are also of interest to many organizations outside of NASA thus the majority of the NASA applications also apply to non-NASA organizations. Moreover, the generality of these procedures proposed to be developed will allow them to apply them for other flow applications such as cardiovascular flows to accurately predict wall shear stress, flow over wind turbines to obtain better designs, two-phase annular flows to predict liquid film thickness to avoid dry out conditions, etc. In addition there are other types of physics such as electromagnetics and heat transfer that have solutions with high gradients that can also utilize these types of meshes for simulations.",Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation,,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"110 8th St., Troy, NY 12180 - 3590",(518) 276-6283

One way to save on the cost of test operations is to recover these gases using an electrochemical system. This Hydrogen Recovery System (HRS) selectively removes hydrogen from the mixed stream, leaving behind high-value helium. The system then removes residual water vapor from this helium and compresses it to commercial storage pressure. The heart of the HRS is a system platform under commercial development by Sustainable Innovations, termed H2RENEWTM, an electrochemical system package that separates and compresses hydrogen using Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology. The system being developed in this Phase II STTR program targets a hydrogen removal rate of 1.77 scfm, an outlet hydrogen pressure of 200 psi, and a product helium pressure of 2,000 – 2,500 psi. This system leverages a robust novel Expandable Modular Architecture (EMA) electrochemical cell stack that is capable of being constructed with a very large production capacity and high operating pressure.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) There are several NASA applications that can take advantage of the underlying technologies that support Sustainable Innovations' HRS. Primary needs are to separate and recover hydrogen and helium from rocket engine test stands. For in-situ resource utilization there are needs for recirculation of hydrogen and to facilitate pneumatic transport. Terrestrial NASA applications include capturing, purifying and compressing purge gas for various experimental test stands. The requirement to separate hydrogen from CO2 and CO exists in life support applications. The HRS being developed here supports efficient separation of these constituents without moving parts. Hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell systems are being studied as a means of providing efficient energy storage for many different NASA missions. Long-term missions are hampered by the fact that residual helium often exists in the hydrogen fuel tanks. An HRS can alleviate this problem by removing the helium.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The emergence of hydrogen-based economy necessitates the ability to pump and compress large amounts of hydrogen. A range of products based on the HRS will help deliver hydrogen to fueling stations and provide compression for vehicular refueling. Assuming the adoption of a pipeline hydrogen-based infrastructure, there is a need to pump the hydrogen along the pipeline to fueling stations. A medium to large size fueling station would require 300 lbs per day of hydrogen, which at 500 psi is 1,730 cf. A 30 CFM HRS would allow a fueling station to store a day's worth of fuel in 2 hours. Hydrogen powered vehicles require hydrogen at 6,000 – 10,000 psi to facilitate efficient volumetric storage. Therefore an HRS with a high capacity, high pressure cell design would be a valuable tool to support a hydrogen-based economy.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Cooling; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; Energy Storage; Fluid Storage and Handling; In-situ Resource Utilization; Manipulation; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Portable Life Support; Power Management and Distribution; Production; Propellant Storage; Renewable Energy; Tankage; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures,,The University of Connecticut,"438 Whitney Road Ext.

As human explorers move further away from Earth, robotic precursors will scout destinations and robotic assistants will perform tasks to reduce astronaut risk and workload. 3D visualization is a key component of how humans will interact with robots for these missions. When the operator engages a robot using visualization, there is a risk that he or she will become too focused on what is happening now in the vicinity of the robot and will not be aware of other important events that are not apparent in the field of view. This risk only increases when operations involve multiple robots. It is essential to ensure that the user does not miss important events that do not manifest in the vicinity of the robot. TRACLabs, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies (SGT) propose to develop software for notifying users of 3D visualization about important notices without distracting users unnecessarily or adding to the visual clutter around the robot avatar. This software will monitor events from the robot or user, identify which events should be brought to the user's attention, and alert users in the 3D pane. The appearance of alerts is altered to shift a user's attention to new notices based on an assessment of the importance and urgency of the notice specific to the user. Thus the same notice may be presented to different users in different ways. Because notices are anchored to a screen overlay, they are visible regardless of what location the user is viewing in the 3D space. In Phase II we will implement this software and evaluate its effectiveness for NASA missions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The notification software produced in Phase II will be immediately useful for NASA's future analog robotic field tests where VERVE provides 3D robot visualization. NASA's Robonaut 2 mission to ISS in FY11 is another near-term mission that could benefit from the proposed notification technology by alerting the human operator to important events that occur while he or she is interacting with the robot. The modularization of notice construction from notice presentation should ease integration of the notification software with other 3D visualization software that NASA might use in the future. Longer term, the techniques for determining when to shift the user's attention from the visualization and how to notify without increasing visual clutter should be useful when specifying flight support software for future exploration missions, including robotic precursors for human exploration, ranging from missions to Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) to Mars.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The United States Department of Defense (DOD) is making significant investment in military robots, including unmanned air vehicles for surveillance and search and rescue, unmanned ground vehicles for logistics, and surface robots for reconnaissance. 3D visualization of robots for military operations includes supervising multiple robots operating concurrently to accomplish a military objective. In such multi-robot operations, it is essential to shift the user's focus when another robot outside the current field of view requires attention. Thus the proposed technology for notification should be directly applicable to remote supervision of military robots. Since the military is actively funding research on human attention shifting during complex operations and visual de-cluttering of geospatial displays, the proposed approach should be both interesting to a variety of DOD customers and compatible with military robotic operations.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Human-Robotic Interfaces,,Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley,"NASA Research Park, Bldg 23, Moffett Field, CA 94305 - 2823",(650) 335-2825

The single-sided CT TD-THz scanner will be an accessory which works with existing T-Ray 4000REG TD-THz NDE imaging instruments owned by NASA (and other aerospace firms). We will also develop, and deliver a software package which employs the model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) methods. The MBIR method allows the reconstruction of 2D slices in depth from the data acquired by the single-sided CT TD-THz scanner. These 2D slices can then be stacked laterally to generate 3D images of sub-surface structures, features and defects. Time-domain terahertz imaging in the 0.1 to 3 THz spectral range is currently being used to characterize defects in Space Shuttle insulation and related materials.

The introduction of these nanoscale features will enable realization of an intermediate band solar cell (IBSC), while simultaneously increasing the effective absorption volume that can otherwise limit short-circuit current generated by thin quantized layers. The triple junction cell follows conventional designs comprised of bottom Ge cell (0.67eV), a current-limiting middle GaAs (1.43eV) cell, and a top InGaP (1.90eV) cell. The GaAs cell will be modified to contain InAs nanowires to enable an IBSC, which is predicted to demonstrate ~45% efficiency under 1-sun AM0 conditions. The InAs nanowires will be implemented in-situ within the epitaxy environment, which is a significant innovation relative to conventional semiconductor nanowire generation using ex-situ gold nanoparticles. Successful completion of the proposed work will result in ultra-high efficiency, radiation-tolerant space solar cells that are compatible with existing manufacturing processes. Significant cost savings are expected with higher efficiency cells, enabling increased payload capability and longer mission durations.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The high efficiency (>40%) of the proposed PV cell will make it the obvious choice for NASA space-based applications. Another potential application revisits a NASA research thrust on virtual substrates. One important aspect of nanowires is the demonstrated capability to integrate widely mismatched nanowires and substrates. The restricted cross-sectional area of the nanowire reduces the opportunity for mismatch defect generation. Nanowires of highly mismatched systems (>7%) have been demonstrated in the literature and, more importantly, in the Phase 1 of this proposal. This flexibility in substrate/nanowire combinations can enable more optimum bandgap and material combinations for novel devices. Incorporating nanowires onto a recrystallized Ge/metal foil substrate would potentially solve the problem of grain boundary shunting of generated carriers by restricting the cross-sectional area of the nanowire (10s of nms diameter) to sizes smaller than the recrystallized grains (0.5-1 um2). In this approach, the nanowire PV device integrated with a low-cost foil substrate would have potential for high weight-specific power (W/kg).","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The high-efficiency of the proposed device represents a significant competitive advantage for any space-based power generation application. This proposed device offers a significant increase in efficiency which corresponds to a significant cost savings in terms of photovoltaic array size, array weight, and launch costs. The proposed cells would represent a disruptive technology within the space photovoltaic marketplace. Additionally, a path is proposed for commercial, low-cost nanowire growth with broad market implications. Nanowires of highly mismatched systems (>7%) have been demonstrated in the literature and, more importantly, in the Phase 1 of this proposal. This flexibility in substrate/nanowire combinations enables more optimum bandgap and material combinations for novel devices. One exciting possibility is the integration of III-V nanostructures on low-cost silicon substrates for photovoltaic applications. In addition, the use of core-shell geometry for photovoltaic applications decouples the absorption length from the carrier collection length, which allows low diffusion length material to be effective PV materials in the core-shell configuration.",Energy Storage; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics; Photovoltaic Conversion; Power Management and Distribution; Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Renewable Energy; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials,,Rochester Institute of Technology,"111 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623 - 5608",(330) 421-2104

The device is capable of simulating reduced gravity over an arbitrary terrain including such features as slopes, obstacles, and varying surface concavity.  The device consists of a linear movement system, a 2 degree-of-freedom manipulator, a passive force application mechanism, and a position tracking mechanism. The manipulator travels along the linear movement system and is positioned perpendicular to the linear movement system's direction of travel. The result is a rectangular working area whereby the gravity offload device can simulate reduced gravity in the area defined by the length of the linear movement system by the width (reach) of the 2 degree-of-freedom manipulator. The force application mechanism is principled upon precision maintenance of a pressure in an air cylinder. Precision regulation of supply pressure enables constant force over the throw of the air cylinder. Varying the regulator supply pressure to the air cylinder(s) modifies the force experienced by the test article and therefore enables a gravity offload device to simulate a range of gravity fields proportional to the ability to regulate pressure.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Notable applications relevant to NASA for reduced gravity include: terramechanics, wheel-soil interaction for Mars/Lunar wheeled vehicles, lightweight robotic excavation performance, habitat deployment, and astronaut mobility.

Reducing boundary layer detachment increases lift and reduce drag reducing fuel consumption and improving control for the pilot. Two methods known to improve boundary layer attachment are heating the air and supplying acoustic pressure at an airfoil dependent frequency. In Phase I we demonstrated that thin (<50 µm) ribbons made from carbon nanotubes can be used to produce heating elements which can be heated and cooled hundreds of times per second. When properly located on the surface of a wing they can maximize boundary attachment as demonstrated by improvements of up to 20% in lift.In Phase II we will improve our understanding of the function of these thermoacoustic elements and demonstrate their durability and their effectiveness with larger components.In Phase I we demonstrated multifrequency sound generation on surfaces in a wind tunnel using nanotube heating elements, and achieving improved lift and TRL 3.Phase II will include medium scale wind tunnel tests verifying the effects and achieving TRL 5.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) One of NASA's functions is to develop cutting edge technology for adoption by the civilian and military aviation sectors, technology like the technology in this project.

Frameworks and tools for uncertainty quantification are generally geared to individual codes, are research codes, or are single-purpose tools such as LHS matrix generators. The Reduced-Order-Clustering-Uncertainty-Quantification (ROCUQ) methodology discussed in this proposal is specifically designed to circumvent many of the issues associated with uncertainty quantification of large simulation codes. The ROCUQ methodology has been applied in several different physical disciplines with good results. The computational methodology is a combination of reduced-order modeling, stratified sampling (Latin Hypercube Sampling – LHS), statistical clustering of results (K-means clustering) and a few (five to ten) full-physics runs of the high-fidelity model under investigation. The method should be applicable to hundreds of uncertain variables when required. ROCUQ enables estimates of system response quantities (SRQ) uncertainty distributions for situations where it is not feasible to use purely sampling, collocation, or other techniques where many runs would be required. For some organizations, uncertainty analysis has never been possible due to resource limitations, and thus is not part of the organizational culture. Many analysts know that uncertainties can be important, but have no way to expend sufficient resources (money, CPU cycles, time) to do the work needed to quantify uncertainties. A methodology such as ROCUQ promises to open doors in organizations that know that they have the need, and may now be able to actually perform the analyses. Successful completion of the Phase II project will produce not only new software that will be able to be used by researchers and industry, but will assemble insights on the use of reduced order models in a variety of disciplines, and provide guidance and rules for the use of ROCUQ for the estimation of SRQ uncertainty distributions.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This program will provide pathways to two commercial products: software and engineering services. - Software: The completed module will be architected in such as manner as to allow introduction of specialized reduced-order model modules without requiring changes to the base software.

Increases in cost and shortages of helium will dramatically impact testing of rocket engines for launch vehicles and space propulsion systems as the global supply of this non-renewable element diminishes. Extremely large quantities of helium are being used during rocket engine testing each year at various test facilities. It is critical for program successes to minimize developmental and testing costs by reclaiming helium utilized in those programs and, equally important, to preserve this rare element for future generations. Phase I innovative solution efforts have proven the effectiveness of utilizing hydrogen (H2) Proton Exchange Membrane Electrochemical Cell (PEMEC) technology to purify an inert gas stream of helium (He) consisting of hydrogen contaminants in a cost-effective manner. This method allows in-situ, on-site helium re-utilization, returning the helium to cleanliness standards required for rocket engine test facility use. Phase I identified the challenges for dilute hydrogen operation of the PEMEC and provided viable solutions for improved efficiency, which allows the PEMEC's to provide high purity, 99.995% helium. Phase I also identified a possible configuration in which the exit stream of H2 can be added to a fuel cell operating in the galvanic mode to provide power back to the GHe reclamation system. Although Phase II efforts will not utilize that configuration, Phase I verified its feasibility and future system growth potential. Phase II efforts will build upon all the results of Phase I to deliver a fully functional prototype system for further evaluation in an operational environment. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the end of Phase I was five (5), while phase II will progress that level to six (6): System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) PEMECs are an attractive option for purifying inert gas streams containing hydrogen as an impurity because they can be operated efficiently in two methods, which enable separation of hydrogen from the inert gas stream. PEMECs can be operated in a galvanic cell mode where useful electricity can be obtained or, in an electrolytic mode, where the PEMEC is attached to an external power source. In the latter case, hydrogen is separated from the inert stream by electrically driving hydrogen ions across a membrane. Utilizing this technology will significantly reduce vented GHe into the atmosphere at all NASA test sites where helium is consumed in rocket engine testing and will allow the reclamation of GHe for future testing and launch services. This cost-saving technology will save NASA millions of dollars in helium costs over the course of each developmental/test program. Cost savings from our technology allows more funds to be applied to the development and testing of new rocket engines/rocket engine designs, instead of the helium required to test those engines, while minimizing the effects of helium cost increases. Further commercial applications of this technology will allow reclamation of unused hydrogen from the system. This potential NASA application can be used to generate power and water on future lunar vehicles while reclaiming on-board GHe. Our proposed technology allows NASA to continue using helium as a standard purge gas, while reducing operational costs.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Non-NASA commercial applications share the same benefits. Utilizing PEMEC technology to purify an inert gas stream of helium, reclaiming it, allows other Government agencies, private space companies, commercial space ventures, launch providers, and vehicle/system developers to benefit from cost savings. Helium, a non-renewable commodity, factors in the cost to develop and test newly designed rocket engines/systems and to test/maintain currently developed engines/systems. Cost savings from our technology allows more funds to be applied in the development and testing of these new rocket engines and systems/technologies, while minimizing the effects of helium cost increases. These savings allow for a bold new commercial approach that invests in the building blocks of a more capable method of space exploration and national defense. Millions in savings can be applied to various Government and commercial testing and design programs instead of helium operating costs associated with those programs. Other non-NASA commercial applications can also include hybrid systems that not only reclaim helium, but also provide electrical power and water by reclaiming hydrogen.

In meeting this goal we have been developing algorithms for all-terrain adaptive locomotion which include: 1. Advanced traction controls, which intelligently govern individual wheel commands as a function of terrain conditions in order to measurably decrease wheel slip; and, 2. Real-time incipient embedding detection controls, which monitors the rover's inertial signature to rapidly and robustly detect instances of incipient embedding in soft, low bearing-strength soils. The implementation of these controls will not only allow rovers to autonomously detect and avoid hazardous terrain regions, but also to travel with assured safety on terrain that is steeper and rougher than is currently possible. Moreover, these controls will allow rovers to drive with a reduced risk of catastrophic failure, while simultaneously increasing both the quantityand potential quality of science data products. This latter capability is enabled by the fact that rovers will be able to travel for long durations without requiring lengthy human interventions, and will be able to travel to sites of greater scientific interest (and proportionally greater mobility difficulty) than what is possible today.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The proposed research is expected to greatly enhance the mobility and tractive performance of robotic planetary rovers.

The 2020 Mars rover mission is an example of such mission that could directly benefit from the algorithms and control methods developed under this STTR project.

DUV (λ < 250 nm) excitation is critical for NASA missions because it shows an over 200-fold greater efficiency compared to commonly used 785 nm excitation and illumination as such short wavelengths minimizes the fluorescence background in the Raman spectra. The unavailability of compact, robust, and reliable deep-UV laser sources has constrained implementing DUV Raman spectroscopy in NASA's space-borne exploration and research. TIPD proposes to develop an ultrastable, compact, and robust DUV laser source for Raman spectroscopy based on our demonstrated capability in developing single-frequency fiber lasers and solid-state DUV laser sources. Cooperating with the University of Arizona, TIPD developed an ultrastable and compact single-frequency linearly polarized fiber laser system operating at 976 nm during the Phase I program. The team also developed a single-frequency fiber amplifier at 976 nm and single-pass frequency doubling of 976 nm light to demonstrate the viability of the compact design. Separately, the team has designed and delivered a 150 mW DUV laser for Raman spectroscopy operating at 244 nm using a BBO crystal and a resonant bow-tie cavity based upon a 976 nm VECSEL source. In phase II, the team will scale the power of the 976 nm fiber amplifier to achieve a 5-watt single-frequency output. The 5-watt single-frequency 976nm master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) will act as the pump to build a 100-mW deep-UV laser prototype that will be delivered to NASA.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Deep-UV Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to identify a variety of gas, liquid, and solid materials critical to understanding the evolution of the solar system and the universe.

The team will use their 'smart' material system to design and manufacture various scaled-up core-stiffened composite specimens in application-appropriate geometries, and subsequently test the specimens in a simulated operational environment that includes hypervelocity impact to simulate MMOD impacts, and thermal cycling to represent the large temperature gradients in space. Aurora and UMass Lowell will automate the resistive heating process by relying on changes in the flow of heat through the material as measured by sending electrical current through the structure and monitoring using infrared thermography. Based on the extent of damage, additional heat can be automatically triggered to accelerate healing. The team will consider the integration of the 'smart' material into a larger system in Phase II, including the storage of fluid within the honeycomb core cells to re-fill micro-channels. Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) from N12 Technologies, Inc. will be continuously transfer-printed onto the carbon fiber prepreg slit tape and spooled for automated fiber placement (AFP). When laid down by AFP, the VACNTs will ""stitch"" adjacent layers together to reinforce the interlaminar region and improve the damage tolerance of the overall structure with a negligible increase in weight and thickness. At the end of Phase II, the team will work with NASA Langley Research Center's new Integrated Structural Assembly of Advanced Composites facility to manufacture a scaled pressure vessel that will be damaged via hypervelocity impact multiple times to evaluate its self-healing performance. This scaled demonstration will enable the team to define further scale-up requirements and make cost and performance predictions for subsequent development phases.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The developed ""smart"" material has several applications within NASA. First, the smart aspects are integrated with a commercially available OOA prepreg material suitable for large, lightweight composite structures. Second, this material is compatible with AFP for cost-effective, rapid manufacture of such large, lightweight structures. Furthermore, the implementation of the smart aspects is done using automated, controlled processes. The microvascular channels for self-healing are fabricated using a FDM print-head that can be interfaced with the AFP machine, while the CNTs are transferred continuously to prepreg slit tape and spooled prior to AFP. This combination of materials and manufacturing processes lends itself attractive for applications within NASA's Space Exploration program such as large pressure vessels, vehicles, and habitat modules. The lifetime and reliability of these structures will be improved as they become larger and lighter weight, and are sent deeper into space for future missions. Clearly, after these structures are launched into space, it is often not practical to service them in the event of any damage. The ability to detect damage and to self-heal will be advantageous in such cases. With the success of this STTR program, Aurora will have positioned itself to compete for future NASA contracts that require the manufacture of large, composite space structures similar to the Orion heavy lift launch vehicle, the SLS, and NASA's COTS vehicle.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) As an aerospace company, Aurora designs, develops, and manufactures various primary and secondary composite structures for unmanned and manned, military and commercial aircraft. The structures, over repeated load cycles, will develop cracks that affect performance and require significant downtime and maintenance. Being able to integrate damage detection and self-healing capabilities with these structures will position Aurora to offer innovative new, ""smarter"" designs for commercial customers, that are more lightweight and damage tolerant. Aurora is already working on an application that detects damage and dynamically adjusts its flight parameters (e.g. lower altitude, different speed, etc.) to maximize performance prior to grounding for repairs. A self-healing system would enable the aircraft to fly for a longer period of time and complete its required mission without unnecessarily grounding the aircraft for maintenance and repairs. Furthermore, Aurora could leverage its relationship with major prepreggers such as Cytec, Hexcel, TenCate, and Toray to license the ""smart"" material out for subsequent sales to other industries including wind energy, automotive, and construction (e.g. buildings and bridges).",Composites; Nanomaterials; Polymers; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Processing Methods; Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Structures; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation),,University of Massachusetts - Lowell,"600 Suffolk Street Room 226, Lowell, MA 01854 - 3643",(978) 934-4723,Smart Structural Composites for Space is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

During the Phase I program, this phenomenon was demonstrated on multifunctional smart structural composites consisting of: carbon fiber plies, NanoSonic's Thoraeus Rubber Kevlar Lightweight Shieling Veils (LSV), and our conductive self-healing microcapsules. The innovative microcapsules are comprised of a corrosion resistant HybridShield polymer shell, a resin-rich core of self-repairing, room temperature curing polymer, and Al nanoparticles to impart EMI and radiation shielding as well as a conductive pathway between the conductive Thoraeus Rubber veils to monitor both damage and repair via RF measurements.

Therefore, engineers need optimization tools to incorporate the multidisciplinary constraints using appropriate fidelity during the early stages of concept design. Classic structural design of aircraft structures is based on the concept of a ""wing box"" that uses simple components such as straight spars and ribs, quadrilateral wing skin panels and straight stiffeners. A new design philosophy, using curvilinear SpaRibs has been introduced based on emerging manufacturing technologies such as Electron Beam Free Form Fabrication and Friction Stir Welding (FSW). In those innovative technologies, the wing structure is manufactured as an integrated part instead of using mechanically fastened structural components. This design approach makes it possible to design curved substructure that is a hybrid between spars and ribs, therefore called ""SpaRibs"". These can be designed to have favorable coupling between bending and torsion, and can improve the buckling resistance of local panels. The ability to tailor the bend-twist coupling has been shown to offer substantial improvement in aeroelastic behavior without a weight penalty (or alternately, a weight savings without aeroelastic problems). In this program we will advance this technology to a TRL of 5-6 (or to 6-7 in a Phase III) by designing a subsonic transport wing with better aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic performance, and by designing a test article and test program suitable for proving the performance benefits in flight.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) This technology has the potential to improve the performance of aircraft in subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight regimes, especially those vehicles whose performance is significantly impacted by aeroelastic phenomena such as flutter or unfavorable static aeroelastic interactions. As such, this could impact any NASA-sponsored aircraft program. The most immediate application would be to the X-56A program, but follow on applications are likely to include future technology demonstration aircraft such as low-boom demonstrators, HALE configurations, planetary exploration aircraft, etc.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) As with the NASA applications, this technology increases aircraft performance for multiple classes of aircraft, so this technology may be applied to aircraft including subsonic transports, UAV's, fighters, supersonic transports, bombers, military transports, and reconnaissance aircraft.

The current STTR addresses this strategic goal. The proto-type AOTF-based SWIR spectropolarimetric imaging system developed in Phase I (which will be further optimized and integrated with optimal algorithm/software in Phase II), will be a useful tool in determination of chemical composition and physical characteristics of planets of interest, short period comets, primitive meteorites and asteroid bodies, and in identifying the sources of simple chemicals important to prebiotic evolution and the emergence of life. The concept and proto-type instrument developed in this program operates as a hyper-spectral imager as well as a spectropolarimeter. It is capable of obtaining hyperspectral images and the polarization state at the pixel level. It is compact, rugged in nature, fully electronically controlled and has no moving parts. The images can be taken at any desired wavelength/s within the operational range, in any sequence. Hyperspectral data cubes will be collected using aforementioned systems. Before processing the spectral information in the data, system non-uniformity correction, spectral response correction, and atmospheric correction will be applied to the data.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) There are a number of potential NASA applications for the AOTF-based spectropolarimetric imaging. These include material data basing, structural validation, combustion spectroscopy, non-destructive testing of space compliant parts, and qualification of time-sensitive materials in space. As more and more missions are undertaken involving landers, diverse and accurate databases of the spectral and polarimetric characteristics of various materials will be needed to quickly and accurately identify surface solid, liquid and gaseous materials. The spectral and polarimetric data obtained via 2-dimensional spectropolarimetric imaging can be used to view warping, small fractures and other deficiencies/issues that may occur in the structure of space based mission equipment. The 2-dimensional nature of AOTF based hyperspectral imaging allows for area spectral data collection during combustion events such as in ramjet and scramjet studies. Spectropolarimetric imaging allows for the non-contact, non-destructive analysis of the surface of components. And data models will allow the qualification of time sensitive consumable items in space. For instance, the potency of pharmaceuticals. The proposed device can also be used in various missions for in situ, non-destructive analysis of dust and icy surfaces, identification of organics, atmospheric radiometry, and rheology.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The commercial product that will result from this work, an AOTF-based spectropolarimeter, has numerous non-NASA commercial applications. The spectropolarimetric system can be used in anomaly detection, countermine research, camouflage concealment and detection, and identification and discrimination of materials.  Moreover, such a fast system will have varied applications in atmospheric monitoring and other commercial applications. The proposed electro- and acousto-optic will provide fast and real time information about the status of the atmosphere, thus the impact of human activities on the environment can be evaluated more quickly and more accurately.

The anticipated technology would also be useful for the exploration of the Moon, asteroids, primitive meteorites, comets, and interplanetary dust particles. The relatively small size of the system will enable it to be inserted into a range of missions including landers and rovers. The capillary absorption spectrometer (CAS) at the heart of the system will also provide a new high precision, ultra-low-volume sensor relevant to a range of other NASA applications. These include water isotope ratio measurements, atmospheric sensing of Earth and other planets, environmental sensing from a small UAV, analysis of soil bacteria related to Carbon cycle, as well as full elemental analysis of various microscopic-sized samples and organisms.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The CAS sensor to be developed under this project will provide an extremely attractive alternative to both isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IRMS) and cavity ring down spectrometers (CRDS). The CAS will be relatively inexpensive, require only picomoles of material, and be much smaller than competing systems. CAS sensors will fill niche markets in forensic analysis, environmental sensing, human breath analysis, and industrial process control. This STTR will lead to a new class of sensors, not just a modification of an existing concept. The resulting ultra-small volume sensors could compete with and complement current commercial sensors, and potentially open up new opportunities to perform real-time, in-situ analysis of trace molecules and stable isotopes in remote and/or sample-limited situations.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Fire Protection; Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)",,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL),"902 Battelle Blvd., 902 Battelle Blvd., Richland, WA 99352 - 0999",(888) 375-7665,Technologies for Planetary Compositional Analysis and Mapping is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

This will allow more accurate predictions of structural responses to be made, potentially reducing vehicle weight and cost and improving the reliability of these structures. Empirical wind tunnel test data will be used as a basis to develop novel methods to characterize the surface fluctuating pressures encountered by launch vehicles during ascent, and then to accurately predict the random vibration environment caused by these loads. In Phase II, we will perform a wind tunnel test campaign at the University of Mississippi to measure both the surface fluctuating pressure and the resulting vibration in a flexible panel positioned on an expansion corner. The data from these tests will be used to develop more accurate models to predict the auto- and cross-spectra of surface fluctuating pressures during ascent, followed by the development of coupling models to predict the resulting spacecraft structural vibrations. A critical improvement over current methods will be the inclusion of a statistical basis which will enable prediction of both mean and maximum expected environments. The experimental data in Phase II can also be used as a source of validation for unsteady coupled fluid-structural dynamics simulations.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The methods and embodying software that will be developed under this project will provide unprecedented accuracy in predicting aeroacoustic loading and vibration response for any spacecraft or launch vehicle during ascent. One of the most noteworthy and immediate opportunities for infusion of this technology is in the design of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), an advanced heavy-lift launch vehicle being developed. The SLS will deliver the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle to space and will be involved in a number of commercial and International Space Station missions. The technologies proposed do not carry much risk and provide an opportunity early in the development process to make design decisions that can result in significant increases in affordability, reliability, and performance. Additionally, the design of systems and components aboard more near-term NASA spaceflight missions will benefit from the improved predictive capability, with specific examples including the proposed series of Commercial Crew and Cargo Program (C3PO) launches and prospective extraterrestrial missions such as Mars 2020. The proposed technology directly addresses the high-priority challenge for ""analytical capabilities that go far beyond existing modeling and simulation capabilities and reduce use of empirical approaches in vehicle design"" identified in NASA's Space Technology Roadmap for Technology Area 11: Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology, & Processing.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) As the aerospace industry adapts to the retirement of the Space Shuttle, it stands poised at the beginning of a new era of space exploration and commercial space activities. Numerous private sector companies are developing the next generation of commercial launch vehicles, space station resupply services, and spacecraft for the suborbital space tourism market. A common theme for these new systems is that they feature innovative designs that make a marked departure from the legacy spaceflight and rocket systems employed in the last half decade of orbital launches. New concepts such as Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two spaceplane and SpaceX's nine-engine Falcon 9 rocket provide a host of new vibroacoustic scenarios that must be understood and addressed as part of certifying payload survivability or human passenger safety. By enabling more accurate prediction of the vibroacoustic response of these systems, the methods developed in this project will contribute to the design of more efficient and reliable systems while reducing the mission risk from unaccounted aeroacoustic loads.

NASA customers include the Rocket Propulsion Test (RPT) program, the ISS, and the Orion deep space vehicle, all of which need wireless sensors to monitor and assess structural health. The ECM represents a major advancement in the use of wireless and self-powered devices by enabling the miniaturization of vibration-based energy harvesting devices suitable for powering sensors.Implications of the innovationThere exist two basic problems in reducing the size of vibration-based harvesters that plague all current commercially available devicesboth are addressed here. The first is addressed by eliminating the problem of frequency matching in compact devices. The second is addressed by providing a broadband device capable of energy conversion across a range of frequencies.Technical objectivesOur existing prototype is a TRL 5 unit that we used to demonstrate our ability to convert kinetic energy to useful electrical power. This prototype combines piezoelectric beam transducers with artificially induced magnetic fields to force a nonlinear broadband behavior. Phase II uses this approach for compact sizing of low center frequency transducers with the objective of delivering a field-validated compact ECM that provides a near order-of-magnitude improvement over current energy harvesters.Research descriptionPhase I created an efficient prototype and established feasibility. In Phase II we build a fully operational unit and perform field validation-tests compatible with SSC test beds.Anticipated resultsAnticipated results include a reduction in the amount of battery waste generated by self-powered devices that enables long-term wireless deployment.

Phase II validates and delivers a TRL 6 unit.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) Energy consumption is now often the most significant problem discussed whenever technology is considered. As the energy efficiency of computational devices increases, self-power via harvested energy becomes increasingly viable for a host of electronic devices for sensing and other applications. The ECM kinetic energy harvester provides self-power for a variety of wireless sensors that include those for in situ SHM of NASA vehicles and infrastructure like that supporting the RPT program. ECM directly supports non-destructive evaluation (NDE) systems for safety assurance of future vehicles. There is a major effort within NASA, the FAA, and the military to develop integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) technology that uses SHM information for computer controlled recovery actions aimed at avoiding catastrophe. ECM provides enabling technology for this effort. ECM supports the NASA Engineering and Safety Center with tools for independent testing, analysis, and assessment of high-risk projects. NASA applications include self-health monitoring of future exploration vehicles and support structures like habitats and Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs). ECM-powered sensors reduce maintenance, minimize crew interaction, and reduce spaceflight technical risks and needs. ECM is directly responsive to Topic T3.01, which calls for innovative and compact systems to harvest and convert kinetic energy sources.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The current market is seeing increased communication between equipment within an intelligent network that can automatically manage tasks in smart buildings, logistics, and monitoring. Within this so-called ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) the majority of sensors and devices will eventually be connected to other devices and the Internet. Implementing this vision requires portable devices that can be applied wherever needed, which introduces a significant challengehow can these millions of distributed devices be powered? One path to success is energy harvesting wireless technology. Furthermore, the current dependence on batteries to power pacemakers, defibrillators, and other medical devices raise numerous safety and reliability concerns. Energy harvesting promises to eliminate bulky batteries and the risk of battery-related defects. Besides medical, applications for wireless sensors include Homeland Security structural analysis to mitigate threats (preparedness) and assess damage (response), smart structures, and SHM of civil and military structures. This broader impact includes widespread monitoring with the potential for preventing catastrophic failures and saving lives. Civil structures include bridges, highway systems, buildings, power plants, underground structures, and wind energy turbines (alternative and renewable energy). SHM applications are also driven by a desire to lower costs by moving from schedule-based to condition-based maintenance.","Conversion; Distribution/Management; Generation; Quality/Reliability; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Space Transportation & Safety; Storage; Structures",,The Regents of the University of Michigan,"3003 South State Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 - 1274",(734) 764-7250,Innovative Energy Harvesting Technology Development is a Technology Available (TAV) subtopicthat includes NASA Intellectual Property (IP).

BHL composite cryotank technology provides a four times improvement over large aluminum iso-grid tanks, offering a 6 percentage point improvement in small stage PMF. Superior Stability Engine is an innovative liquid rocket engine configured to maximize combustion stability margin while also maximizing engine performance. NORPS is a non-helium gas generator system that can be used to pressurize the propellant tanks for 1/3 the mass and 1/10 the volume of a comparable helium based system.Using these and other technologies, GTL has developed the conceptual design for the Advanced Cryogenic Expendable (ACE) nano-launch vehicle. The 7700 lb gross lift-off weight ACE vehicle is capable of delivering a 154 lb payload to 400 nmi circular orbit at 28.5 deg inclination. With a launch cost of less than $1M at low launch rate, ACE is directly competitive with existing large launch vehicles on a $/lb basis. This affordability is enabled by a combination of high performance, reduced stages and parts count, and simplified operations.The proposed Phase II effort will seek to reduce the ACE vehicle development risk by increasing the technology readiness level of critical technologies. Specifically, GTL will fabricate and test a prototype NORPS gas generator and pressurization system. Along with this, GTL shall fabricate a full-scale BHL composite cryotank for use in the system testing using modular manufacturing techniques. The integrated system shall be tested for operational capabilities to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology and optimize the system design. The data from these tests will be used to refine and optimize the design of the ACE vehicle.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words) The ACE nano-launch vehicle offers small payload launch capability for a cost that is competitive on a $/kg basis with that of large launch vehicles. This represents more than an order of magnitude improvement in affordability over what can be achieved with existing small launch vehicles. This launch capability would provide NASA with the means to affordably launch numerous small scientific and exploratory spacecraft, without having to bundle them together on large launch vehicles. This will provide NASA with enhanced flexibility in mission design that will increase space mission effectiveness.When the ACE vehicle design is eventually scaled to heavy-lift size, the cost of payload delivery to orbit would be reduced to less than $500/kg to LEO.  This would represent an order of magnitude improvement in affordability compared to existing large heavy-lift launch vehicles. This level of launch affordability would enable large scale access to space that would facilitate permanent habitation of the Moon and Mars.In the near term, the suite of ACE technologies can be used to upgrade NASA space systems. For instance, the NORPS non-helium pressurization system could be used to reduce helium use on Orion and SLS. The high performance BHL cryotanks could be used to improve performance of SLS and other NASA vehicles under development.

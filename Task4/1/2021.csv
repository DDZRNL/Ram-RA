,Focus Area 1,In-Space Propulsion Technologies,"NASA is interested in technologies for advanced in-space propulsion systems to reduce travel time, increase payload mass, reduce acquisition costs, reduce operational costs, and enable new science capabilities for exploration and science spacecraft. The future will require demanding propulsive performance and flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation. This focus area seeks innovations for NASA propulsion systems in chemical, electric, nuclear thermal and advanced propulsion systems related to human exploration and science missions. Propulsion technologies will focus on a number of mission applications including ascent, descent, orbit transfer, rendezvous, station keeping, proximity operations and deep space exploration."
,Focus Area 2,"Power, Energy and Storage","Power is a ubiquitous technology need across many NASA missions including human exploration, space science, and space technology. New technologies are sought to better generate electrical power and distribute it efficiently to both human and robotic power mission users. In space power, mission applications include planetary surface power, large-scale spacecraft prime power, and small-scale robotic probe power. Applicable technology development is sought for: 1) megawatt-class dynamic power conversion from a nuclear heat source to electricity, 2) efficient means of transmitting, connecting, and managing kilowatt-class power over long distances on planetary surfaces, and 3) high-voltage, radiation tolerant switches and components that are needed to optimize mass and efficiency for new high power missions. An overarching objective is to mature technologies from analytical or experimental proof-of-concept (TRL3) to breadboard demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL5). Successful efforts will transition into NASA Projects where the SBIR/STTR deliverables will be incorporated into ground testbeds or flight demonstrations. Note that there are similar power technology development needs at higher power levels for electrified aircraft propulsion which is covered in Focus Area 18 – Air Vehicle Technologies."
,Focus Area 3,Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,"The exploration of space requires the best of the nation's technical community to provide the technologies that will enable human and robotic exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO): to establish a lunar presence, to visit asteroids, to extend human reach to Mars, and for increasingly ambitious robotic missions such as a Europa Lander. Autonomous Systems technologies provide the means of migrating mission control from Earth to spacecraft, habitats, and robotic explorers. This is enhancing for missions in the Earth-Lunar neighborhood and enabling for deep space missions. Long light-time delays, for example up to 42 minutes round-trip between Earth and Mars, require time-critical control decisions to be closed on-board autonomously, rather than through round-trip communication to Earth mission control. For robotic explorers this will be done through automation, while for human missions this will be done through astronaut-automation teaming.Long-term crewed spacecraft and habitats, such as the International Space Station, are so complex that a significant portion of the crew's time is spent keeping it operational even under nominal conditions in low-Earth orbit, while still requiring significant real-time support from Earth. The considerable challenge is to migrate the knowledge and capability embedded in current Earth mission control, with tens to hundreds of human specialists ready to provide instant knowledge, to on-board automation that teams with astronauts to autonomously manage spacecraft and habitats. For outer planet robotic explorers, the opportunity is to autonomously and rapidly respond to dynamic environments in a timely fashion.The “Deep Neural Net and Neuromorphic Processors for In-Space Autonomy and Cognition” subtopic specifically focuses on advances in signal and data processing. Neuromorphic processing will enable NASA to meet growing demands for applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms onboard a spacecraft to optimize and automate operations. Neuromorphic processors can enable a spacecraft to sense, adapt, act, and learn from its experiences and from the unknown environment without necessitating involvement from a mission operations team.The “Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration“ subtopic solicits intelligent autonomous agent cognitive architectures that are open, modular, make decisions under uncertainty, and learn in a manner that the performance of the system is assured and improves over time. Building upon the success of the previous solicitations, this extended scope will enable small businesses to develop both the learning technology and the necessary assurance technology within the scope of cognitive agents that forward base mission control to spacecraft and habitats, and multiply the cognitive assets available to the crew.The “Fault Management Technologies” subtopic has interest in onboard fault management capabilities (viz. onboard sensing approaches, computing, algorithms, and models to assess and maintain spacecraft health), with the goal of providing a system capability for management of future spacecraft.  Offboard components such as modeling techniques and tools, development environments, and verification and validation (V&V) technologies are also relevant, provided they contribute to novel or capable on-board fault management.The “Integrated Data Uncertainty Management & Representation for Trustworthy and Trusted Autonomy in Space” subtopic is seeking to improve autonomous systems performance within Multi-agent Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) teams. This effort concentrates on increasing autonomous systems performance towards the point where they may function as teammates with specified independence, but under the ultimate human direction, or alternatively, where they can exercise complete independence in decision-making and operations in pursuit of given mission goals; for instance, for control of uncrewed missions for planetary infrastructure development in preparation for human presence, or maintenance and operation of crew habitats during the crew’s absence.The “Coordination and Control of Swarms of Space Vehicles” subtopic addresses technologies for control and coordination of planetary rovers, flyers, and in-space vehicles in dynamic environments. Coordinated swarms can provide a more robust and sensor-rich approach to space missions, allowing simultaneous recording of sensor data from dispersed vehicles and co-ordination especially in challenging environments such as cave exploration. Primary interest is in technologies appropriate for low-cardinality (4- to 15-vehicle) swarms of small spacecraft, as well as planetary rovers and flyers (e.g., Mars helicopter).Please refer to the description and references of each subtopic for further detail to guide development of proposals within this technically diverse focus area."
,Focus Area 4,Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,"This focus area includes development of robotic systems technologies (hardware and software) that will enable and enhance future space exploration missions. In the coming decades, robotic systems will continue to change the way space is explored. Robots will be used in all mission phases: as independent explorers operating in environments too distant or hostile for humans, as precursor systems operating before crewed missions, as crew helpers working alongside and supporting humans, and as caretakers of assets left behind. As humans continue to work and live in space, they will increasingly rely on intelligent and versatile robots to perform mundane activities, freeing human and ground control teams to tend to more challenging tasks that call for human cognition and judgment. Technologies are needed for robotic systems to improve transport of crew, instruments, and payloads on planetary surfaces, on and around small bodies, and in-space. This includes hazard detection, sensing/perception, active suspension, grappling/anchoring, legged locomotion, robot navigation, end-effectors, propulsion, and user interfaces.Innovative robot technologies provide a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility, manipulation and human-robot interaction offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Enhancements and potentially new forms of robotic systems can be realized through advances in component technologies, such as actuation and structures (e.g. 3D printing). Mobility provides a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Manipulation provides a critical capability for positioning crew members and instruments in space and on planetary bodies. Robotic manipulation allows for the handling of tools, interfaces, and materials not specifically designed for robots, and it provides a capability for drilling, extracting, handling, and processing samples of multiple forms and scales. This increases the range of beneficial tasks robots can perform and allows for improved efficiency of operations across mission scenarios. Furthermore, manipulation is important for human missions, human precursor missions, and unmanned science missions.  Moreover, sampling, sample handling, transport, and distribution to instruments, or instrument placement directly on in-place rock or regolith, is important for robotic missions to locales too distant or dangerous for human exploration.Future space missions may rely on co-located and distributed teams of humans and robots that have complementary capabilities. Tasks that are considered ""dull, dirty, or dangerous"" can be transferred to robots, thus relieving human crew members to perform more complex tasks or those requiring real-time modifications due to contingencies. Additionally, due to the limited number of astronauts anticipated to crew planetary exploration missions, as well as their constrained schedules, ground control will need to remotely supervise and assist robots using time-delayed and limited bandwidth communications.  Advanced methods of human-robot interaction over time delay will enable more productive robotic exploration of the more distant reaches of the solar system.  This includes improved visualization of alternative future states of the robot and the terrain, as well as intuitive means of communicating the intent of the human to the robotic system."
,Focus Area 5,Communications and Navigation,"NASA seeks proposals to produce novel, innovative technologies in the communications and navigation discipline to support Exploration, Science and Space Technology missions, including the eventual return of humans to the Lunar surface. Missions are generating ever-increasing data volumes that require increased performance from communications systems while minimizing spacecraft impact. This requires higher peak throughput from the communications systems with lower flight communication system cost, mass, and power per bit transmitted.  Long range, deep-space optical communications systems are needed to support data-intensive missions to Mars and beyond. Reliable, secure communications on a non-interference basis are also required in complex radio frequency (RF) environments such as inside a launch vehicle fairing or spacecraft cavity, where new analysis methods are needed for predicting the RF environment. Future missions that perform rendezvous and docking; on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing; or precision landing need increased autonomy to reduce dependence on ground-based tracking, orbit determination and maneuver planning.This requires new and more efficient trajectory planning methods, robust autonomous onboard navigation, and improved precision of onboard instrumentation while minimizing cost, mass, and power. This focus area supports the development of innovative technologies for optical and quantum communications systems, cognitive communications, flight dynamics and navigation, transformational communications approaches, electric and magnetic field prediction methods, positioning and timing, guidance, navigation, and control that will provide a significant improvement over the current state of the art."
,Focus Area 6,Life Support and Habitation Systems,"The Life Support and Habitation Systems Focus Area seeks key capabilities and technology needs encompassing a diverse set of engineering and scientific disciplines, all of which provide technology solutions that enable extended human presence in deep space and on planetary surfaces such as Moon and Mars, including Orion, ISS, Gateway, Artemis and Human Landing Systems. The focus is on systems and elements that directly support human missions and astronaut crews, such as Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems, crew provisioning, plant growth for bioregenerative food production, and tools for systems engineering. Because spacecraft and their systems may involve multiple partnerships, with institutional, corporate, and governmental involvement, Model Based Systems Engineering approaches may enable and improve their distributed development.For future crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and into the solar system, regular resupply of consumables and emergency or quick-return options will not be feasible. New technologies must be compatible with attributes of the environments expected, including microgravity or partial gravity, varying atmospheric pressure and composition, space radiation, and the presence of planetary dust. Technologies of interest are those that enable long-duration, safe, economical, and sustainable deep-space human exploration. Special emphasis is placed on developing technologies that will fill existing gaps as described in this solicitation, that reduce requirements for consumables and other resources, including mass, power, volume and crew time, and which will increase safety and reliability with respect to the state-of-the-art. Spacecraft may be untended by crew for long periods, therefore systems must be operable after these intervals of dormancy.Environmental Control and Life Support Systems encompass process technologies and monitoring functions necessary to provide and maintain a livable environment within the pressurized cabin of crewed spacecraft, including environmental monitoring, water recycling, and atmosphere revitalization.  Of special note for this solicitation, these processes and functions include non-genetic methods for assessing the microbial burden within spacecraft, monitoring systems for identifying and quantifying a wide spectrum of inorganic and organic constituents in spacecraft wastewater and potable water, and use of novel additive manufacturing methods to print sorbent beds for removal of atmospheric contaminants. Novel methods for microbial assessment may also be useful assessing previously dormant spacecraft before crew entry and supporting planetary protection compliance.Unique needs exist for the Exploration Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), including innovations to improve the system to supply feed water to the Portable Life Support System (PLSS), and new technologies for the spacesuit’s Pressure Garment Bladder. For intra-vehicular activity (IVA), new flame retardant textiles are needed for crew apparel fabrics to be used in high oxygen environments expected during lunar and planetary exploration.Future human missions may include an in-situ capability to produce supplemental fresh food. Advanced technologies for remotely sensing the health status and performance of crop plants within space-based controlled environment production systems are sought. In addition, tailoring the rhizosphere with beneficial microbial consortia, through biopriming seeds or other methods, could potentially promote growth and yield or confer resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses.The current collaborative environment between government, commercial and international sectors will result in the distributed development of human spacecraft elements and systems for human missions of the future such as Gateway and lunar surface missions including Artemis. Their integration may benefit from advances in model-based systems engineering approaches.Please refer to the description and references of each subtopic for further detail to guide development of proposals within this technically diverse focus area."
,Focus Area 7,Human Research and Health Maintenance,"NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) investigates and mitigates the highest risks to astronaut health and performance for exploration missions. HRP achieves this through a focused program of basic, applied and operational research leading to the development and delivery of:Human health, performance, and habitability standards.Countermeasures and other risk mitigation solutions.Advanced habitability and medical support technologies.HRP has developed an Integrated Research Plan (IRP) to describe the requirements and notional approach to understanding and reducing the human health and performance risks. The IRP describes the Program's research activities that are intended to address the needs of human space exploration and serve HRP customers. The Human Research Roadmap (http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov) is a web-based version of the IRP that allows users to search HRP risks, gaps, and tasks.The HRP is organized into several research Elements:Human Health Countermeasures.Human Factors and Behavioral Performance.Exploration Medical Capability.Space Radiation.Each of the HRP Elements address a subset of the risks. A fifth Element, Research Operations and Integration (ROI), is responsible for the implementation of the research on various space and ground analog platforms. HRP subtopics are aligned with the Elements and solicit technologies identified in their respective research plans."
,Focus Area 8,In-Situ Resource Utilization,"In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) involves any hardware or operation that harnesses and utilizes ‘in-situ’ resources (natural and discarded) to create products and services for robotic and human exploration. Local resources include ‘natural’ resources found on extraterrestrial bodies such as water, solar wind implanted volatiles (hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, etc.), vast quantities of metals in mineral rocks and soils, and atmospheric constituents, as well as human-made resources such as trash and waste from human crew, and discarded hardware that has completed its primary purpose.  The most useful products from ISRU are propellants, fuel cell reactants, life support commodities (such as water, oxygen, and buffer gases), and feedstock for manufacturing and construction.  ISRU products and services can be used to i) reduce Earth launch mass or lander mass by not bringing everything from Earth, ii) reduce risks to the crew and/or mission by reducing logistics, increasing shielding, and providing increased self-sufficiency, and/or iii) reducing costs by either needing less launch vehicles to complete the mission or through the reuse of hardware and lander/space transportation vehicles.  Since ISRU systems must operate wherever the resource of interest exists, technologies and hardware will need to be designed to operate in harsh environments, reduced gravity, and potential non-homogeneous resource physical, mineral, and ice/volatile characteristics. This year’s solicitation will focus on critical technologies needed in the areas of Resource Acquisition and Consumable Production for the Moon and Mars. The ISRU focus area is seeking innovative technology for:Large, Lightweight, Deployable Solar Concentrators and Thermal Energy TransmissionCritical Components/Subsystems for Oxygen Extraction from Lunar RegolithLunar Ice Mining via In Situ Subsurface Heating, Sublimation, and CaptureAs appropriate, the specific needs and metrics of each of these specific technologies are described in the subtopic descriptions."
,Focus Area 9,"Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments","NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (https://science.nasa.gov/) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary Science. The National Academy of Science has provided NASA with recently updated Decadal surveys that are useful to identify technologies that are of interest to the above science divisions. Those documents are available at https://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/SSB_052297(link is external). A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable aerospace platforms so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in-situ instruments capable of making measurements across the electromagnetic spectrum is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in-situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2021 program year, we are continuing to update the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, adding new, rotating out, and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. We continue to emphasize Ocean Worlds and solicit development of in-situ instrument technologies and components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life, especially extant of life, in the Ocean Worlds. The microwave technologies continue as two subtopics, one focused on active microwave remote sensing and the second on passive systems such as radiometers and microwave spectrometers. NASA has additional interest in advancing quantum sensing technologies to enable wholly new quantum sensing and measurement techniques focused on the development and maturation towards space application and qualification of atomic systems that leverage their quantum properties.  Furthermore, photonic integrated circuit technology is sought to enable size, weight, power, and cost reductions, as well as improved performance of science instruments, subsystems, and components which is particularly critical for enabling use of affordable small spacecraft platforms.A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology."
,Focus Area 10,Advanced Telescope Technologies,"The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold as 4 K. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide and nanolaminates, innovative structures, including nanotechnology, and wavefront sensing and control are needed to build telescopes for Earth science."
,Focus Area 11,Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system, and the universe beyond. SMD’s future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems such as: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. High performance space computing technologies are also included in this focus area. Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs. For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115° C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending). The National Academies’ Decadal Surveys for Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science discuss some of NASA’s science mission and technology needs and are available at https://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/SSB_052297(link is external). In addition, the Heliophysics roadmap “The Solar and Space Physics of a New Era: Recommended Roadmap for Science and Technology 2009­2030” is available at   http://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov/2009_Roadmap.pdf."
,Focus Area 12,"Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","The SBIR focus area of Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) includes the suite of technologies for atmospheric entry as well as descent and landing on both atmospheric and non-atmospheric bodies. EDL mission segments are used in both robotic planetary science missions and human exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, and many technologies have application to emerging commercial space capabilities such as lunar landing, low-cost space access, small spacecraft, and asset return.Robust, efficient, and predictable EDL systems fulfill the critical function of delivering payloads to lunar and planetary surfaces through challenging environments, within mass and cost constraints. Future NASA Artemis and planetary science missions will require new technologies to break through historical constraints on delivered mass, enable sustained human presence, or to go to entirely new planets and moons. Even where heritage systems exist, no two planetary missions are exactly “build-to-print,” leading to frequent challenges from environmental uncertainty, risk posture, and resource constraints that can be dramatically improved with investments in EDL technologies. EDL relies on validated models, ground tests, and sensor technologies for system development and certification. Both new capabilities and improved assessment and prediction of state-of-the-art systems are important facets of this focus area.The subtopics in this Focus Area have been renamed, this year, with the intent of more comprehensive coverage of the Entry, Descent, and Landing flight regimes, as well as ground and flight test and instrumentation areas. In future solicitations, the intent is to maintain these four subtopic titles, and to rotate the content within the subtopics as Agency needs and priorities change and as technologies are matured. The renamed subtopics and their overarching content descriptions are:Z7.01 Entry, Descent and Landing Flight Sensors and Instrumentation: Seeks sensors and components for precision landing and hazard detection, as well as heatshield instrumentation and other EDL flight systems diagnostics and electronicsZ7.03 Entry and Descent Systems Technologies: Contains hypersonic materials, aeroshell systems, and modeling advances, including deployable aeroshells for EDL and asset return and recovery. Includes smaller-scale systems appropriate for small spacecraft applications.Z7.04 Landing Systems Technologies: Covers landing engines, plume-surface interaction modeling, testing, and instrumentation, and landing attenuation systemsZ7.06 EDL Terrestrial Testing Technologies: Solicits for new diagnostic, characterization, and uncertainty quantification capabilities related to EDL-specific ground test facilities, including arcjets, wind tunnels, shock tubes, and ballistic rangesPlease refer to the subtopic write-ups for the specific content and scope solicited this year."
,Focus Area 13,Information Technologies for Science Data,"NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our earth, our solar system, and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply these data and information to create knowledge. For example, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These tools allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA data and science information are used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public."
,Focus Area 14,"On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)","NASA is seeking technological innovations that will accelerate development and adoption of advanced serving, assembly and manufacturing technologies supporting a wide range of NASA Missions. In the area of on-orbit servicing, NASA is seeking technology developments related to end of robot arm force-torque sensors. Force torque sensors for robots are a major limiting factor in robot system designs on all of NASA's current robotic manipulator-based systems (including OSAM-1 and Mars Sample Return.) In the area of on-orbit assembly, NASA is seeking technology developments for trusted and certified-safe autonomous systems with machine intelligence and robotic capabilities of responding to both nominal and unexpected situations. In the area of on-orbit manufacturing, NASA is seeking technology developments centered around material joining technologies, large-scale additive manufacturing process developments and technologies focused on the ability to recycle and reuse metallic materials.  Cutting-edge servicing, assembly and manufacturing technologies offer the ability to dramatically increase performance and reduce the cost of NASA’s programs. The ability to improve cost, launch mass, system resiliency and extended life time by advancing technologies to enable large structures that can be deployed, assembled/constructed, reconfigured and serviced in-space or on planetary surfaces is also imperative to NASA’s Missions. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and prototype hardware development during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering an engineering development unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II that could be turned into a proof-of-concept system for flight demonstration. To understand the full technology needs and requests see the detailed topic and subtopic descriptions."
,Focus Area 15,"Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly","As NASA embarks on its mission for human exploration of the Moon as a step towards the human mission to Mars, taking full advantage of the potential offered by new and existing technologies will be critical to enable sustainable Lunar and Mars presence. The Advanced Manufacturing, Materials Research, Structures and NDE focus area seeks to address challenges such as lowering the cost of exploration, changing structural design paradigms to take advantage of advanced materials, enabling efficient, reliable operations on-surface and capitalizing on capabilities provided by sensor integration.  Improvement in all of these areas is critical to future missions. Since this focus area covers a broad area of interests, specific topics and subtopics are chosen to enhance and or fill gaps in the space and exploration technology development programs, as well as to complement other mission directorate manufacturing, structures, materials and NDE needs."
,Focus Area 16,Ground & Launch Processing,"Ground processing technology development prepares the agency to test, process and launch the next generation of rockets and spacecraft in support of NASA's exploration objectives by developing the necessary ground systems, infrastructure and operational approaches for terrestrial and off-planet surface systems.This topic seeks innovative concepts and solutions for both addressing long-term ground processing and test complex operational challenges and driving down the cost of government and commercial access to space. Technology infusion and optimization of existing and future operational programs, while concurrently maintaining continued operations, are paramount for cost effectiveness, safety assurance, and supportability.A key aspect of NASA's approach to long term sustainability and affordability is to make test, processing and launch infrastructure available to commercial and other government entities, thereby distributing the fixed cost burden among multiple users and reducing the cost of access to space for the United States.Unlike previous work focusing on a single kind of launch vehicle such as the Saturn V rocket or the Space Shuttle, NASA is preparing common infrastructure to support several different kinds of spacecraft and rockets that are in development. Products and systems devised at a NASA center could be used at other launch sites on earth and eventually on other planets or moons.Specific emphasis to substantially reduce the costs and improve safety/reliability of NASA's test and launch operations includes development of ground test and launch environment technology components, system level ground test systems for advanced propulsion, autonomous control technologies for fault detection, isolation, and recovery, including autonomous propellant management, and advanced instrumentation technologies including Intelligent wireless sensor systems."
,Focus Area 17,Thermal Management Systems,"From the smallest satellite to the most complicated human rated spacecraft, thermal is seen as an enabling function to a vehicle. Temperatures must be maintained within design limits, whether those be cryogenic systems for science instruments, or comfortable shirt sleeve operations temperatures for crew missions. As missions evolve and waste energy rejection becomes more of a demand, NASA seeks components for both active and passive thermal systems. Such components complete the thermal cycle which includes waste energy acquisition, transport, rejection/storage, and insulation. The intended goal for any advanced thermal development is to enable new mission concepts while maintaining minimal impact to thermal system mass, volume, and power to maintain a spacecraft at specific temperature limits."
,Focus Area 18,Air Vehicle Technology,"This focus area includes tools and technologies that contribute to both the Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP) and the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP) encompassing technologies in all six Strategic Thrusts within the NASA Aeronautics Mission Directorate (ARMD). AAVP studies, evaluates, and develops technologies and capabilities for new aircraft systems, and also explores far-future concepts that hold promise for revolutionary air-travel improvements. Innovative AAVP design concepts for advanced vehicles integrate technologies focus on fuel burn, noise, emissions, and intrinsic safety. The goal: to enable new aircraft to fly safer, faster, cleaner, quieter, and use fuel far more efficiently. Partnering with industry, academia, and other government agencies, AAVP pursues mutually beneficial collaborations to leverage opportunities for effective technology transition. TACP encourages revolutionary concepts, creates the environment for researchers to experiment with new ideas, performs ground and small-scale flight tests, and drives rapid turnover into potential future concepts to enable aviation transformation. Research is organized to aggressively engage both the traditional aeronautics community and non-traditional partners. Although TACP focuses on sharply focused studies, the program provides flexibility for innovators to assess new-technology feasibility and provide the knowledge base for radical aeronautics advances in noise reduction technology."
,Focus Area 19,Integrated Flight Systems,"This focus area includes technologies that contribute to the Integrated Aviation Systems Program's (IASP) objectives. IASP conducts flight-oriented, system-level research and technology development to effectively mature and transition advanced aeronautic technologies into future air vehicles and operational systems, including urban air mobility. IASP focuses on the rigorous execution of highly complex flight tests and related experiments to support all phases of NASA’s aeronautics research."
,Focus Area 20,Airspace Operations and Safety,"This focus area includes technologies addressing both the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP), and NASA's ARMD Strategic Thrusts 1, 5, and 6. AOSP is targeting system-wide operational benefits of high impact for NextGen and beyond, both in the areas of airspace operations and safety management. The SBIR Airspace Operations and Safety Topic is focused on research and technology development for enabling a modernized air transportation system that will achieve much greater capacity and operational efficiency while maintaining or improving safety and other performance measures. This will include the integration of new types of vehicles such as unmanned vehicles, advanced subsonic aircraft, supersonic or commercial space vehicles; new types of business models or operations (i.e., urban air mobility); and new architectures or services for enabling these operations within the NAS."
,Focus Area 21,Small Spacecraft Technologies,"NASA is pursuing rapid identification, development, and testing of capabilities that exploit small spacecraft platforms and responsive launch capabilities to increase the pace of space exploration, scientific discovery, and the expansion of space commerce. These emerging capabilities have the potential to enable new mission architectures, enhance conventional missions, and promote development and deployment on faster timelines.  This will, in turn, allow NASA and other space mission operators to achieve their objectives at significantly lower programmatic risk and cost than traditional approaches.Small spacecraft are typically defined as those weighing 180 kg or less and are often designed using standardized form factors and containerized deployment (e.g. CubeSats). Small spacecraft and responsive launch capabilities are proving to be disruptive innovations for exploration, discovery, and commercial applications. NASA seeks technical innovations that enable small spacecraft to rival the capabilities of their larger more expensive counterparts, while also striving to make them cheaper and quicker to build, and easier to launch and operate. NASA also seeks innovations to help further expand the reach of small spacecraft beyond Low Earth Orbit. Greatly improved capabilities are needed for lunar exploration missions, lunar communications and navigation infrastructure, and exploration at Mars and other deep space destinations. Technology and capability investment will be needed to meet these upcoming mission needs while keeping overall costs low, mission cadence high, and retaining the agile aerospace approach that has fueled what has been termed the “smallsat revolution”. Specific improvements required are: long-range high-bandwidth optical and RF communications; novel navigation devices and navigation references for use well beyond Earth; improved power management; and robust tolerance of the harsher thermal and radiation environment of deep space. Propulsion technologies with improved performance are sought for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), lunar orbit insertion and maintenance, return-to-Earth and Earth entry and descent mechanisms. Transfer stages that host small spacecraft are also sought. Innovations are wanted to increase economic and rapid production and availability; modular designs will facilitate reliable assembly and test of singly- or batch-produced small spacecraft. Specifically needed technologies include wirelessly interconnected sensors and modules and commercially available “stock” optics in place of expensive, long-lead custom designs. Affordable powerful computing hardware and intelligent software tools and infrastructure are needed for autonomous operation of distant spacecraft or for cooperation of spacecraft groups, minimizing human-in-the-loop bottlenecks. NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology Program will consider promising SBIR technologies for spaceflight demonstration missions and seeks partnerships to accelerate spaceflight testing and commercial infusion.The following references discuss some of NASA's small spacecraft technology activities: https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/index.htmlwww.nasa.gov/smallsats https://www.nasa.gov/smallsat-instituteAnother useful reference is the Small Spacecraft Technology State of the Art Report at:  http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/small_spacecraft_technology_state_of_the_art_2015_tagged.pdf"
,Focus Area 22,Low Earth Orbit Platform Utilization and Microgravity Research,"The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) provides mission critical space exploration services to both NASA customers and to other partners within the U.S. and throughout the world: operating the International Space Station (ISS); ensuring safe and reliable access to space; maintaining secure and dependable communications between platforms across the solar system; and ensuring the health and safety of astronauts. Additionally, the HEOMD is chartered with the development of the core transportation elements, key systems, and enabling technologies required for beyond-Low Earth Orbit (LEO) human exploration that will provide the foundation for the next half-century of American leadership in space exploration. In this topic area, NASA is seeking technologies that address how to improve and lower costs related to use of flight assets; maximize the utilization of the ISS for in-situ research; and utilize the ISS as a platform for in-space commercial science and technology opportunities.NASA seeks to accomplish these objectives by achieving following goals:Investing in the near- and mid-term development of highly-desirable system and technologies that provide innovative ways to leverage existing ISS facilities for scientific payloadsIncreasing investments in research to prepare for extended duration missions in near Earth space and beyondEnabling U.S. commercial spaceflight opportunities and technology development to support the commercialization of low Earth orbit (LEO)Through the potential projects spurred by this topic, NASA hopes to incorporate SBIR-developed technologies into current and future systems to contribute to the expansion of humanity across the solar system while providing continued cost-effective ISS operations and utilization for its customers, with a high standard of safety, reliability, and affordability.References:Space Station Research &Technology:  https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorerCenter for the Advancement of Science in Space: https://www.iss-casis.org/(link is external)Low-Earth Orbit Economy:  https://www.nasa.gov/leo-economy/low-earth-orbit-economy/"
,Focus Area 23,Digital Transformation for Aerospace,"Digital Transformation is the strategic transformation of an organization's products, processes, and capabilities, driven and enabled by rapidly advancing and converging digital technologies, to dramatically enhance the organization's performance and efficiency. These advancing digital technologies include software, cloud computing, data management and analytics, artificial intelligence, mobile access, Internet of Things (IoT), and others. Their convergence is producing major transformations across industries - media and entertainment, retail, advertising, publishing, health care, travel, transportation, etc. Through digital transformation, organizations seek to gain or retain their competitive edge by becoming more aware of and responsive to both customer and employee interests, more agile in testing and implementing new approaches, and more innovative and prescient in pioneering the next wave of products and services.Central to the success of digital transformation is the pervasive (and often automated) collection and use of data about everything that impacts success--the organization's infrastructure, processes, activities, competencies, products and services, customers, partners, industry, and so on. Organizations can mine this massive, complex, and often unstructured data to develop accurate insights into how to improve organizational performance and efficiency. An organization may also use this data to build models of systems in order to refine operations, or to train machine learning algorithms to automate processes, provide recommendations, or enhance customer experiences. The digital technologies listed above are essential to generate, collect, transform, mine, analyze, and utilize this data across the enterprise. NASA is undertaking a digital transformation journey to enhance mission success and impact. NASA is engaging digital transformation to:Accelerate innovation and knowledge growthSupport data-informed decisionsAchieve more complex missionsEnable pervasive collaborationEnhance cost-effectivenessBuild a digital-savvy workforceThrough this focus area, NASA is seeking to explore and develop technologies that are essential for the Agency's successful digital transformation. Specific innovations being sought in this solicitation are:Intelligent digital assistants that reduce the cognitive workload of NASA personnel, from scientists and engineers to operations and administrative staff to space mission crews.Model-based enterprise, which seeks to create digital models or twins of any aspect of NASA’s enterprise, to enable decision-making with increased insight and velocity.Details about these applications of digital transformation technologies are in the respective subtopic descriptions."
,Focus Area 24,Dust Mitigation,"A number of space exploration missions to planetary bodies have noted significant deleterious effects due to fine particulates. This fine dust can foul mechanisms, alter thermal properties, and obscure optical systems. It can abrade textiles and scratch surfaces. With near term goals to return to the Moon, lunar dust is of particular concern. It has the potential to negatively affect every lunar architecture system. The goal of this focus area is to develop dust mitigation technologies that can be incorporated into space exploration systems.All planetary exploration missions require a proactive strategy to lessen the effects of dust. Dust mitigation approaches include active and passive technologies and informed engineering design. Much of the dust can be mitigated through operational constraints and architecture consideration early on in the system design lifecycle. However, passive, and active technologies and novel engineering design are also needed to form a complete dust mitigation strategy. Proposed research may focus on development of new technologies, but there is particular interest in technologies that are approaching readiness for space environment testing.Exploration systems require dust mitigation technologies within the following capability areas:Optical Systems – Viewports, camera lenses, solar panels, space suit visors, mass spectrometers, other sensitive optical instruments.Thermal Surfaces – Thermal radiators, thermal painted surfaces, thermal connections.Fabrics – Space suit fabrics, soft wall habitats, mechanism covers.Mechanisms – Linear actuators, bearings, rotary joints, hinges, quick disconnects, valves, linkages.Seals and Soft Goods – Space suit interfaces, hatches, connectors, hoses; and,Gaseous Filtration – Atmosphere revitalization and ISRU processes.Specific dust mitigation innovations being sought in this solicitation will be outlined in the subtopic descriptions."

Space Operations,Topic O1,Space Communications,"
 NASA's communications capability is based on the premise that communications shall enable and not constrain missions. Communications must be robust to support the numerous missions for space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Technologies such as optical communications, RF including antennas and ground based Earth stations, surface networks, access links, reprogrammable communications systems, communications systems for EVAs, advanced antenna technology, transmit array concepts and communications in support of launch services including space based assets are very important to the future of exploration and science activities of the Agency. Emphasis is placed on size, weight and power improvements. Even greater emphasis is placed on these attributes as small satellites (e.g., micro and nano satellite) technology matures. Innovative solutions are needed which are centered on operational issues associated with the communication capability. Communication technologies enabling acquisition of range safety data from sensitive instruments is imperative. All technologies developed under this topic area to be aligned with the Architecture Definition Document and technical direction as established by the NASA Office of Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN).

Space Operations,Topic O2,Space Transportation,"
 Achieving space flight can be astonishing. It is an undertaking of great complexity, requiring numerous technological and engineering disciplines and a high level of organizational skill. Overcoming Earth's gravity to achieve orbit demands collections of quality data to maintain the security required of the range. The harsh environment of space puts tight constraints on the equipment needed to perform the necessary functions. Not only is there a concern for safety but the 2004 Space Transportation Policy directive states that the U.S. must maintain robust transportation capabilities to assure access to space. Given this backdrop, this topic is designed to address technologies to enable a safer and more reliable space transportation capability. Automated collection of range data, acquisition of specialized weather data, and instrumentation for space transportation system testing are all required. The following subtopics are required to secure technologies for these capabilities."
Space Operations,Topic O3,Processing and Operations,"
 The Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) is responsible for providing mission critical space exploration services to both NASA customers and to other partners within the U.S. and throughout the world: from flying the Space Shuttle, to assembling the International Space Station; ensuring safe and reliable access to space; maintaining secure and dependable communications between platforms across the solar system; and ensuring the health and safety of our Nation's astronauts. Each of the activities includes both ground-based and in-flight processing and operations tasks. Support for these tasks that ensures they are accomplished efficiently and accurately enables successful missions and healthy crew."
Space Operations,Topic O4,Navigation,"
 NASA is seeking innovative research in the areas of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) that have relevance to Space Communications and Navigation programs and goals, as described at http://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov. NASA's Space Communication and Navigation Office considers the three elements of PNT to represent distinct, constituent capabilities: (1) positioning, by which we mean accurate and precise determination of an asset's location and orientation referenced to a coordinate system; (2) navigation, by which we mean determining an asset's current and/or desired absolute or relative position and velocity state, and applying corrections to course, orientation, and velocity to attain achieve the desired state; and (3) timing, by which we mean an asset's acquiring from a standard, maintaining within user-defined parameters, and transferring where required, an accurate and precise representation of time. NASA has divided its PNT interests into six focus areas: (1) Global Positioning System (GPS) (2) Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS) (3) Flight Dynamics (4) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) (5) TDRSS Augmentation Service for Satellites (TASS) (6) Geodesy. This year, NASA seeks technology in focus areas (1), (3), (4), and (5), and related areas that provides PNT support and services for NASA's current tracking and communications networks and systems-including tracking during launch and landing operations, and research and technology relevant to the planning and development of PNT support and services for NASA's Project Constellation, including lunar surface operations, and other Exploration and Science Programs that NASA may undertake over the next two decades. Some of the subtopics in this topic could result in products that may be included in future flight opportunities. Please see the Science MD Topic S4 for more details as to the requirements for small satellite flight opportunities, and the Facilitated Access to the Space Environment for Technology Development and Training (FAST) website at http://ipp.nasa.gov/ii_fast.htm."
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1,Aviation Safety,"
 The Aviation Safety Program focuses on the Nation's future aviation safety challenges. This vigilance for safety must continue in order to meet the projected increases in air traffic capacity and realize the new capabilities envisioned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The Aviation Safety Program will conduct research to improve the intrinsic safety attributes of legacy and future aircraft and their operations in the Next Generation Air Transportation system, and to eliminate safety-related technology barriers. 

 The program has focused on furthering our understanding of the fundamental questions that need to be addressed for mid- and long-term improvements to aviation safety through engineering analysis and technology design. The results at the fundamental level will be integrated at the discipline and multi-discipline levels to ultimately yield system-level integrated capabilities, methods, and tools for analysis, optimization, prediction, and design that will enable improved safety for a range of operating concepts, vehicle classes, and crew configurations. The Aviation Safety Program is divided into four complementary and highly interlinked projects: 

   The Aircraft Aging and Durability Project performs foundational research in aging science that will ultimately yield multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization capabilities that will enable system-level integrated methods for the detection, prediction, and mitigation/management of aging-related hazards for future civilian and military aircraft. 
 The Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Project develops tools, methods, principles, guidelines, and technologies for revolutionary flight deck systems that enable transformations toward safer operations. 
 The Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control Project conducts research to advance the state of aircraft flight control to provide onboard control resilience for ensuring safe flight in the presence of adverse conditions. 
 The Integrated Vehicle Health Management Project develops validated tools, technologies and techniques for automated detection, diagnosis and prognosis that enable mitigation of adverse events during flight. 


 Examples areas of program interest include research directed at fundamental knowledge of legacy and future aircraft structures and systems durability; on-board detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction and mitigation of system failures and faults; monitoring vehicle and airspace issues to identify problems before they become accidents; understanding aircraft dynamics of current and future vehicles in damaged and upset conditions; robust control systems; aircraft guidance for emergency operation; airborne sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of external hazards to aircraft (e.g., in-flight icing conditions, wake vortices); design of robust collaborative work environments; effective and robust human-automation systems; and information management for effective decision making. In addition, general methods for dramatically advancing the community's capability for thorough, cost-effective and time-effective verification and validation of safety-critical systems are of interest to the program as a whole, including rigorous methods for validating design requirements for vehicles and aviation operations, verifying integrated and distributed aircraft and air traffic systems (including assumptions about human performance), and verifying software-intensive systems. 

 NASA seeks highly innovative proposals that will complement its work in science and technologies that build upon and advance the Agency's unique safety-related research capabilities vital to aviation safety.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2,Fundamental Aeronautics,"
 The Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) encompasses the principles of flight in any atmosphere, and at any speed. The program develops focused technological capabilities, starting with the most basic knowledge of underlying phenomena through validation and verification of advanced concepts and technologies at the component and systems level. Physics-based, multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization (MDAO) tools will be developed that make it possible to evaluate radically new vehicle designs and to assess, with known uncertainties, the potential impact of innovative technologies and concepts on a vehicle's overall performance. The development of advanced component technologies will realize revolutionary improvements in noise, emissions, and performance. The program also supports NASA's human and robotic exploration missions by advancing knowledge in aeronautical areas critical to planetary Entry, Descent, and Landing. NASA has defined a four-level approach to technology development: conduct foundational research to further our fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and our ability model that physics; leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions; integrate methods and technologies to develop multi-disciplinary solutions; and solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. 

 Structurally, the FAP is composed of four projects: hypersonic flight, supersonic flight, subsonic fixed-wing aircraft and subsonic rotary-wing aircraft. 

 Hypersonics 
   Fundamental research in all disciplines to enable very-high speed flight (for airbreathing launch vehicles) and re-entry into planetary atmospheres; 
 High-temperature materials, thermal protection systems, air-breathing propulsion, aero-thermodynamics, multi-disciplinary analysis and design, GNC, experimental capabilities. 


 Supersonics 
   Eliminate environmental and performance barriers that prevent practical supersonic vehicles (cruise efficiency, noise and emissions, vehicle integration and control); 
 Supersonic deceleration technology for Entry, Descent, and Landing into Mars. 


 Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) 
   Develop revolutionary technologies and aircraft concepts with highly improved performance while satisfying strict noise and emission constraints; 
 Focus on enabling technologies: acoustics predictions, propulsion/combustion, system integration, high-lift concepts, lightweight and strong materials, GNC. 


 Subsonic Rotary Wing (SRW) 
   Improve civil potential of rotary wing vehicles (vs. fixed wing) while maintaining their unique benefits; 
 Key advances in multiple areas through innovation in materials, aeromechanics, flow control, propulsion. 


 Each project addresses specific discipline, multi-discipline, sub-system and system level technology issues relevant to that flight regime. A key aspect of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program is that many technical issues are common across multiple flight regimes and may be best resolved in an integrated coordinated manner. As such, the FAP subtopics are organized by discipline, not by flight regime, with a special subtopic for rotary-wing issues.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A3,Airspace Systems,"
 NASA's Airspace Systems (AS) Program is investing in the development of innovative concepts and technologies to support the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS is also commonly known as NextGen). NASA is working to develop, validate and transfer advanced concepts, technologies, and procedures through partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other government agencies represented in the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), and in cooperation with the U.S. aeronautics industry and academia. As such, the AS Program will develop and demonstrate future concepts, capabilities, and technologies that will enable major increases in air traffic management effectiveness, flexibility, and efficiency, while maintaining safety, to meet capacity and mobility requirements of NextGen. The AS Program integrates the two projects, NextGen Airspace and NextGen Airportal, to directly address the fundamental research needs of NextGen vision in partnership with the member agencies of the JPDO. The NextGen Airspace Project develops and explores fundamental concepts and integrated solutions that address the optimal allocation of ground and air automation technologies necessary for NextGen. The project will focus NASA's technical expertise and world-class facilities to address the question of where, when, how and the extent to which automation can be applied to moving aircraft safely and efficiently through the NAS. The NextGen Airportal Project develops and validates algorithms, concepts, and technologies to increase throughput of the runway complex and achieve high efficiency in the use of airportal resources such as gates, taxiways, runways, and final approach airspace. NASA research in this project will lead to development of solutions that safely integrate surface and terminal area air traffic optimization tools and systems with 4-D trajectory operations. Ultimately, the roles and responsibilities of humans and automation influence in the ATM will be addressed by both projects. Key objectives of NASA's AS Program are to: 

   Improve mobility, capacity, efficiency and access of the airspace system; 
 Improve collaboration, predictability, and flexibility for the airspace users; 
 Enable accurate modeling and simulation of air transportation systems; 
 Accommodate operations of all classes of aircraft; and 
 Maintain system safety and environmental protection.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A4,Aeronautics Test Technologies,"


 NASA has implemented the Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) within its Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). The purpose of the ATP is to ensure the long term availability and health of NASA's major wind tunnels/ground test facilities and flight operations/test infrastructure that support NASA, DoD and U.S. industry research and development (R&D) and test and evaluation (T&E) needs. Furthermore, ATP provides rate stability to the aforementioned user community. The ATP facilities are located at the NASA Research Centers, including at Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center and Langley Research Center. Classes of facilities within the ATP include low speed wind tunnels, transonic wind tunnels, supersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, air-breathing engine test facilities, the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR), support aircraft, test bed aircraft, and the simulation and loads laboratories. A key component of ensuring a test facility's long term viability is to implement and continually improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of that facility's operations. To operate a facility in this manner requires the use of state-of-the-art test technologies and test techniques, creative facility performance capability enhancements, and novel means of acquiring test data. NASA is soliciting proposals in the areas of instrumentation, test measurement technology, test techniques and facility development that apply to the ATP facilities to help in achieving the ATP goals of sustaining and improving our test capabilities. Proposals that describe products or processes that are transportable across multiple facility classes are of special interest. The proposals will also be assessed for their ability to develop products that can be implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities. Additional information:  http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/atp/index.html."
Science,Topic S1,"Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","
NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/astrophysics), Earth Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/earth-science), Heliophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/heliophysics), and Planetary Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/planetary-science). A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2009 program year, we are actively encouraging proposal submissions for subtopic S1.10 that solicits technology for geodetic instruments and instruments to enable global navigation and very long baseline interferometry. A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development components that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path towards a Phase 2 prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology."
Science,Topic S2,Advanced Telescope Systems,"
 The NASA Science Missions Directorate seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4-degrees Kelvin. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide and nanolaminates, innovative structures, including nanotechnology, and wavefront sensing and control are needed to build telescope for Earth science that have the potential to cost between $50 to $150M.  
"
Science,Topic S3,Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"
 The Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our Solar System and beyond. SMD's future direction will be moving from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface of where we want to explore (landers, rovers, and sample returns), that would require new vantage points, or that would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once you get there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft systems development programs is to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost, that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. Innovations are sought in the areas of: Command, Data Handling, and Electronics; Thermal Control Systems; Power Generation and Conversion; Propulsion Systems; Power Management and Storage; Guidance, Navigation and Control; Sensor and Platform Data Processing & Control; Planetary Ascent Vehicles; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Terrestrial Balloons."
Science,Topic S4,Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies,"
 This subtopic is targeted at the development of technologies and systems, which can enable the realization of small spacecraft science and exploration missions. While small spacecraft have the benefit of reduced launch costs by virtue of their lower mass, they may be currently limited in performance and their capacity to provide on-orbit resources to payload and instrument systems. With the incorporation of smaller bus technologies, launch costs, as well as total life cycle costs, can continue to be reduced, while still achieving and expanding NASA's mission objectives. 

 The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies category is focused on the identification and development of specific key spacecraft technologies in the areas of avionics, attitude determination and control, and spacecraft integration planning and management. The primary thrust of this topic is directed at reducing the footprint and resources that these bus subsystems require (power, mass, and volume), allowing more of these critical resources to be shifted to payload and instrument systems, and to further reduce the overall launch mass and volume requirements for small spacecraft. 

 Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. 

 Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and/or software demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract."
Science,Topic S5,Robotic Exploration Technologies,"
 NASA is pursuing technologies to enable robotic exploration of the Solar System including its planets, their moons, and small bodies. NASA has a development program that includes technologies for the atmospheric entry, descent, and landing, mobility systems, extreme environments technology, sample acquisition and preparation for in situ experiments, and in situ planetary science instruments. Robotic exploration missions that are planned include a Europa Jupiter System mission, Titan Saturn System mission, Venus In Situ Explorer, sample return from Comet or Asteroid and lunar south polar basin and continued Mars exploration missions launching every 26 months including a network lander mission, an Astrobiology Field Laboratory, a Mars Sample Return mission and other rover missions. Numerous new technologies will be required to enable such ambitious missions. The solicitation for in situ planetary instruments can be found in the in situ instruments section of this solicitation. See URL: http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/index.cfm for mission information. See URL: http://marstech.jpl.nasa.gov/ for additional information on Mars Exploration technologies.
"
Science,Topic S6,Information Technologies,"
 NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our earth, our solar system and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply this data to create knowledge. In particular, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These are tools that allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, and provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA science information be used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public."
Exploration Systems,Topic X1,Avionics and Software,"
 The Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) leads the Agency in the development of advanced avionics, software and information technology capabilities and research for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate. The Avionics and Software elements perform mission-driven research and development to enable new system functionality, reduce risk, and enhance the capability for NASA's exploration missions. NASA's focus has clarified around Exploration, and the agency's expertise and capabilities are being called upon to support these missions. The Ares Launch Vehicle, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), the Altair Lunar Lander, and future lunar surface systems will each require unique advances in avionic and software technologies such as integrated systems health management, autonomous systems for the crew and mission operations, radiation hardened processing, and reliable, dependable software. Exploration requires the best of the nation's technical community to step up to providing the technologies, engineering, and systems to regain the frontiers of the Moon, to extend our reach to Mars, and to explore the beyond."
Exploration Systems,Topic X2,Environmental Control and Life Support,"
 Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) encompasses the process technologies and equipment necessary to provide and maintain a livable environment within the pressurized cabin of crewed spacecraft and to support associated human systems such as Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA). Functional areas of interest to this Solicitation include thermal control and ventilation, atmosphere resource management and particulate control, water recovery systems, solid waste management, habitation systems, environmental monitoring and fire protection systems. Technologies must be directed at Lunar transit and surface missions, including such vehicles as Lunar landers, surface habitats and pressurized rovers. 

 Requirements include operation in Lunar gravity and/or microgravity and compatibility with cabin atmospheres of up to 34% O2 by volume and pressures ranging from 1 atmosphere to as low as 7.6 psia, or for EVA, as low as 3.2 psia and 100% O2. Systems external to the spacecraft will be at vacuum. Special emphasis is placed on developing technologies that will fill existing gaps, reduce requirements for consumables and other resources including mass, power, volume and crew time, and which will increase safety and reliability with respect to the state-of-the-art. Non-venting processes may be of interest for technologies that have dual application to Lunar and Mars missions. Results of a Phase 1 contract should show feasibility of the technology and approach. A resulting Phase 2 contract should lead to development, evaluation and delivery of prototype hardware. Specific technologies of interest to this Solicitation are addressed in each subtopic. 

 Additional information may be found at the following websites: http://els.jsc.nasa.gov and http://aemc.jpl.nasa.gov."
Exploration Systems,Topic X3,Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization,"
 The purpose of In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is to harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration to create products and services which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration. In particular, the ability to make propellants, life support consumables, fuel cell reagents, and radiation shielding can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. To perform these tasks on the lunar surface, detailed knowledge of the terrain, local minerals and potential resources, and the behavior and characteristics of lunar regolith is extremely important. Lastly, since ISRU systems and operations have never been demonstrated before in missions, it is important that ISRU concepts and technologies be evaluated under relevant conditions (1/6 g and vacuum) as well as anchored through modeling to lunar soil and environmental conditions. With this in mind, the ISRU Project within the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) has initiated development and testing of hardware and systems in two main focus areas: (1) Oxygen Extraction from Regolith, including regolith feed/removal; and (2) ISRU Development & Precursor Activities to evaluate alternative resource processing and product concepts. 

 The purpose of the following subtopics is to develop and demonstrate hardware and software technologies that can be added to on-going analysis and ISRU capability development and demonstration activities in ETDP to meet Outpost architecture and surface manipulation objectives for near and long term human exploration of the Moon."
Exploration Systems,Topic X4,"Structures, Materials and Mechanisms","
 The SBIR topic area of Structures, Materials and Mechanisms centers on developing lightweight structures, advanced materials technologies, and low-temperature mechanisms for enabling Exploration Vehicles and Lunar Surface Systems. 

 Lightweight structures and advanced materials have been identified as a critical need since the reduction of structural mass translates directly to additional up and down mass capability that would facilitate additional logistics capacity and increased science return for all mission phases. The major technology drivers of the lightweight structure technology development are to significantly enhance structural systems by 1) lowering mass and/or improving efficient volume for reduced launch costs, 2) improving performance to reduce risk and extend life, and 3) improving manufacturing and processing to reduce costs. The targeted applications of the lightweight structures and materials technologies are Orion Crew Module, the Ares launch vehicles, Lunar Lander, and Lunar Surface Systems. For this Solicitation, the desired area of focus is Lunar Surface Systems, particularly for Lunar habitats. 

 Low-temperature mechanism technology is being developed for reliable and efficient operation of mechanisms in lunar temperatures including operations in lunar shadows at -230°C and sustained surface operations thru varying lunar temperatures of -230°C to +120°C for lunar surface rovers, robotics, and mechanized operations. The technology drivers of the low temperature mechanism technology development are to significantly enhance operation of mechanized parts by 1) lowering the operating temperature for life of the component and 2) improving mechanism performance (torque output, actuation performance, lubrication state) at the lunar environment conditions of cold and vacuum over the required life of the mechanism. The targeted application of the technology is to provide for operation of motors and drive systems, lubricated mechanisms, and actuators of lunar rovers and mobility systems, ISRU machinery, robotic systems mechanisms, and surface operations machinery (i.e., cranes, deployment systems, airlocks) for lunar surface operations. 

 This topic area is to enhance and fill gaps in technology development programs in the Exploration Technology Exploration Program's Structures, Materials, and Mechanisms (SMM) Project. Areas of development included in the SMM project include: low temperature drive system, motor, and gearbox system, personal kit radiation shielding materials, low density parachute material systems, expandable structural systems, and friction stir welded spun-domes. This topic area is responsible for mid-level technology research, development, and testing through experimental and/or analytical validation."
Exploration Systems,Topic X5,Advanced Composite Technology,"
 The SBIR Topic area of Advanced Composites Technologies (ACT) focuses on technologies to mature the use of composite structures and materials for launch vehicles and/or the lunar lander. 

 Organic matrix composite materials have the potential for a significant mass reduction compared to metallic materials by optimizing the structural architecture of applications including the Ares V Core Stage intertank, the Ares V Core-Stage-to-Earth-Departure-Stage interstage, the Ares V Payload Shroud, and the Altair lunar lander support struts. The major technology drivers for these applications of advanced composites technologies include large scale composites manufacturing, composite damage tolerance and detection, and primary structure durability in a lunar environment. Successful composites technologies will demonstrate concepts with reduced weight and cost with no loss in performance when compared to technologies for metallic concepts. 

 This Topic is to enhance and fill gaps in technology development activities in the Exploration Technology Development Program Advanced Composites Technologies Project. Areas of development in the ACT project include: materials; manufacturing; nondestructive evaluation/structural health monitoring; and structural concepts. This Topic is responsible for mid-level technology research, development, and testing through experimental and/or analytical validation."
Exploration Systems,Topic X6,Lunar Operations,"
 This call for technology development is in direct support of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate's (ESMD) Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP). The purpose of this research is to develop component and subsystem level technologies to support the Constellation Program's (CxP) human lunar return missions. The initial missions will be heavily engaged in construction methods, regolith excavation, establishing self-sustaining power generation, and producing life support consumables in-situ in order to establish continuous operational capability via earth based and lunar based human and robotic assets. 

 The objective is to produce new technology that will reduce lunar operations workloads associated with crew extra-vehicular activities (EVA) and intra-vehicular activities (IVA), and reduce the total mass-volume-power of equipment and materials required to support both short and long duration Lunar stays as well as maximizing crew and outpost safety during landing, launch and lunar operations. The proposals must focus on component and subsystem level technologies in order to maximize the return from current SBIR funding levels. Doing so increases the likelihood of successfully producing a technology that can be readily infused into the Constellation Program. 

 Lunar operations are a stepping-stone toward achieving long-term space exploration goals. This research focuses on technology development for the critical functions that will secure an extended human presence on the lunar surface and ultimately enable surface exploration for the advancement of scientific research. Surface exploration begins with short duration missions to establish a foundation which leads to extensible functional capabilities. Successive buildup missions establish a continuous operational platform from which to conduct scientific research while on the lunar surface. Reducing risk and ensuring mission success depends on the coordinated interaction of many functional surface systems including life support, power, communications infrastructure, and transportation. This topic addresses technology needs associated with lunar surface systems infrastructure, interaction of humans and machines, mobility systems, payload and resource handling, regolith excavation and mitigation of environmental contaminations.

Exploration Systems,Topic X7,Energy Generation and Storage,"
 This topic includes technology development for batteries, fuel cells, regenerative fuel cells, and fission and isotopic power systems for the Altair lunar lander and surface operations on the Moon and Mars. Technologies developed must be infused into these Constellation program elements: primary fuel cells for the Altair lunar lander descent stage, secondary batteries for the Altair ascent stage, secondary batteries for extravehicular activities (EVA) suits, and regenerative fuel cells, fission and isotopic power systems on the Moon and Mars to power habitats, in situ resource production, and mobility systems. Specific technology goals and component needs are given in the sub-topics. General mission priorities for energy storage and generation include: 

   EVA suits require secondary batteries sufficient to power all portable life support, communications, and electronics for an 8-hour mission with minimal volume. Battery operation required for six months and 100 recharge cycles with a shelf life of at least two years. Mission priorities include human-safe operation; 8-hr duration; high specific energy; and high energy-density. 
 Secondary batteries for the Altair ascent stage require nominally 10 recharge cycles with 1.7 kW nominal power and 2 kW peak power, operating for 7 hours continuously. Mission priorities include human-safe, reliable operation and high energy-density in a 0 - 30°C and 0 - 1/6 gravity environment. 
 The Altair descent stage requires a fuel cell with a nominal power level of 3 kW with 5.5 kW peak, operating for 220 hours continuously. Mission priorities include human-safe reliable operation; the ability to scavenge available fuel; and high energy-density. 
 Regenerative fuel cells, which combine a fuel cell with a water electrolyzer, have been baselined for lunar surface system operations. Mission priorities include reliable, long-duration maintenance-free operation; human-safe operation; high specific-energy; and high system efficiency in a 0 - 100°C, 1/6 gravity environment. 
 Architecture studies have identified nuclear power technology to effectively satisfy high power requirements for extended duration lunar surface missions. Nuclear power generation is especially attractive for missions with significant solar eclipse periods, including non-polar locations and inside lunar craters, as well as Mars outposts. 
 Power systems for lunar rovers require human-safe operation; reliable, maintenance-free operation; and high specific-energy."
Exploration Systems,Topic X8,Cryogenic Systems,"
 The Exploration Systems architecture presents cryogenic storage, distribution, and fluid handling challenges that require new technologies to be developed. Reliable knowledge of low-gravity cryogenic fluid management behavior is lacking and yet is critical for Altair and Ares in the areas of storage, distribution, and low-gravity propellant management. Additionally, Earth-based and lunar surface missions will require success in storing and transferring liquid and gas commodities. Some of the technology challenges are for long-term cryogenic propellant storage and distribution; cryogenic fluid ground processing and fluid conditioning; liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen liquefaction processes on the lunar surface. Furthermore, specific technologies are required in valves, regulators, instrumentation, modeling, mass gauging, cryocoolers, and passive and active thermal control techniques. The technical focus for component technologies is for accuracy, reduced mass, minimal heat leak, minimal leakage, and minimal power consumption. The anticipated technologies proposed are expected to increase reliability, increase cryogenic system performance, and are capable of being made flight qualified and/or certified for the flight systems and dates to meet Exploration Systems mission requirements."
Exploration Systems,Topic X9,Thermal Protection Systems,"
 The Thermal Protection System (TPS) protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. In general, there are two classes of TPS: reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry with a significant amount of energy being re-radiated from the heated surface and the remainder conducted into the TPS material. Typically, a surface coating with high emissivity (to maximize the amount of energy re-radiated) and with low surface catalycity (to minimize convective heating by suppressing surface recombination of dissociated boundary layer species) is employed. The primary insulation has low thermal conductivity to minimize the mass of material required to insulate the primary structure. Ablative TPS materials, in contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing organic resins as binders. When heated, the resin pyrolyzes producing gaseous products that are heated as they percolate toward the surface thus transferring some energy from the solid to the gas. Additionally, the injection of the pyrolysis gases into the boundary layer alters the boundary layer properties resulting in reduced convective heating. However, the gases may undergo chemical reactions with the boundary layer gases that could return heat to the surface. Furthermore, chemical reactions between the surface material and boundary layer species can result in consumption of the surface material leading to surface recession. Those reactions can be endothermic (vaporization, sublimation) or exothermic (oxidation) and will have an important impact on net energy to the surface. Clearly, in comparison to reusable TPS materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. 

 NASA has successfully tackled the complexity of thermal protection systems for numerous missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system in the past; the knowledge gained has been invaluable but incomplete. Future missions will be more demanding. Better performing ablative TPS than currently available is needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe CEV missions, e.g., Mars Landing with 8 km/s entry and Mars Sample Return with 12-15 km/s Earth entry. Beyond the improvement needed in ablative TPS materials, more demanding future missions such as large payload missions to Mars will require novel entry system designs that consider different vehicle shapes, deployable or inflatable configurations and integrated approaches of TPS materials with the entry system sub-structure."
Exploration Systems,Topic X10,Cryogenic and Non-Toxic Storable Propulsion,"
 The Exploration Systems architecture presents propulsion challenges that require new technologies to be developed.  Non-toxic engine technologies are being explored for use in lieu of the currently operational nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and monomethylhydrazine (MMH) systems.  Safety concerns with toxic propellants drive mission planners to the use of more costly propulsion modules that are fueled and sealed on the ground and can limit operational flexibility on the launch pad. There are also concerns with exhaust residue from toxic systems, which may be carried into habitats for lunar and Mars systems.   To address these challenges, the focus will be on the development of cryogenic and non-toxic propulsion technologies to support informed decisions on implementation in the Exploration architecture. The major components of this effort will focus on reaction control systems, main engine, and deep throttling descent engines.  A summary of some of the current activities is located at:

Exploration Systems,Topic X11,Exploration Crew Health Capabilities,"
 Human space flight is associated with losses in muscle strength, bone mineral density and aerobic capacity. Crewmembers returning from the International Space Station (ISS) can lose as much as 10-20% of their strength in weight bearing and postural muscles. Likewise; bone mineral density is decreased at a rate of ~1% per month. Although aerobic capacity has not been formally measured in returning ISS crew, short duration Space Shuttle crewmembers have been shown to undergo a 22% reduction in VO2max in response to space flight. During future exploration missions such physiological decrements represent the potential for a significant loss of human performance which could lead to mission failure and/or a threat to crewmember health and safety. The ability to estimate the physical cost of exploration tasks, monitor crew health and fitness, and to provide effective hardware for exercise countermeasures use will be valuable in supporting safe and successful space exploration.  Exercise systems is seeking technologies or devices to provide resistive and aerobic exercise in flight or simulate an Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) suit on the ground.

Exploration Systems,Topic X14,Space Radiation,"

 The goal of the NASA Space Radiation Research Program is to assure that we can safely live and work in the space radiation environment, anywhere, any time. Space radiation is different from forms of radiation encountered on Earth. Radiation in space consists of high-energy protons, heavy ions and secondary products created when the protons and heavy ions pass through spacecraft shielding and human tissue. The Space Radiation Program Element, within the Human Research Program uses the NASA Research Announcement as a primary means of soliciting research to understand the health risks and reduce the uncertainties in risk projection; however, there are areas where the SBIR program contributes. Specific areas where SBIR technologies can contribute to NASA's overall goal include: reliable radiation monitoring for manned and unmanned spaceflight; and radiation damage imaging.

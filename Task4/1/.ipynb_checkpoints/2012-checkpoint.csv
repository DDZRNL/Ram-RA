Aeronautics Research,Topic A2,Air Traffic Management Research and Development (ATM R&D),"
 Air Traffic Management Research and Development (ATM R&D) NASA has two Programs conducting ATM R&D. The Airspace Systems Program (ASP) is investing in the development, validation and transfer of advanced innovative concepts, technologies and procedures to support the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP) is conducting research at an integrated system-level on promising concepts and technologies and exploring, assessing or demonstrating their benefits in a relevant environment. All the investments include coordination with other NASA Programs and partnerships with other government agencies and joint activities with the U.S. aeronautics industry and academia. 

 ASP develops and demonstrates future concepts, capabilities, and technologies that will enable major increases in air traffic management effectiveness, flexibility, and efficiency, while maintaining safety, to meet capacity and mobility requirements of NextGen. ISRP explores and assesses new vehicle concepts and enabling technologies through system-level experimentation and focuses specifically on maturing and integrating technologies in major vehicle systems/subsystems for accelerated transition to practical application. One of ISRP's projects is the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS). The project's primary goal is to address technology development in five areas to reduce the technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges of routine UAS operations in the NAS. These areas include seamless integration of separation assurance/sense and avoid interoperability, evaluating the workload impact to human UAS operators, demonstration of secure UAS command and control datalink, document requirements for and to create an appropriate test environment for evaluating UAS concepts. 

 The A2 topic area solicits concepts that can reduce the technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges of routine UAS operations in the NAS.

Science,Topic S1,"Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","
 NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary Science. The National Academy of Science has provided NASA with recently updated Decadal surveys that are useful to identify technologies that are of interest to the above science divisions. Those documents are available at the following locations: 

   Astrophysics - (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_049810(link is external)). 
 Planetary - (http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/2013decadal/index.cfm). 
 Earth Science - (http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/decadal-surveys/). 
 Heliophysics - The 2009 technology roadmap can be downloaded here (http://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/). 


 A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2012 program year, we are restructuring the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, rotating out, combining and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. One new subtopic, S1.09 Surface and Sub-surface Measurement Systems was added this year. This new subtopic solicits proposals that are for ground-based surface vehicles, and submerged systems. Systems that will provide near-term benefit in a ground-based application but that are ultimately intended for flight or mobile platforms are in scope. A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology."
Science,Topic S2,Advanced Telescope Systems,"
 The NASA Science Missions Directorate seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4-degrees Kelvin. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide and nanolaminates, innovative structures, including nanotechnology, and wavefront sensing and control are needed to build telescopes for Earth science."
Science,Topic S3,Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"
 The Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system and the universe beyond. SMDs future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points, or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost, which would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems like:

Propulsion. 
Thermal control. 
Power and power distribution. 
Attitude control.
Telemetry command and control.
Transmitters/antenna. 
Computers/on-board processing/software. 
Structural elements. 


Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs. For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115 °C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending). Innovations for 2012 are sought in the areas of: 

Command and Data Handling, and Instrument Electronics. 
Power Generation and Conversion - Propulsion Systems. 
Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage. 
Unmanned Aircraft and Sounding Rocket Technologies.


Significant changes to the S3 Topic for 2011 are that the following areas will not be solicited in 2012, but may be solicited again in the 2013:

Thermal Control Systems - Guidance, Navigation and Control. 
Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons.

Science,Topic S4,Robotic Exploration Technologies,"
 NASA is pursuing technologies to enable robotic exploration of the Solar System including its planets, their moons, and small bodies. NASA has a development program that includes technologies for the atmospheric entry, descent, and landing, mobility systems, extreme environments technology, sample acquisition and preparation for in situ experiments, and in situ planetary science instruments. Robotic exploration missions that are planned include a Europa Jupiter System mission, Titan Saturn System mission, Venus In Situ Explorer, sample return from Comet or Asteroid and lunar south polar basin and continued Mars exploration missions launching every 26 months including a network lander mission, an Astrobiology Field Laboratory, a Mars Sample Return mission and other rover missions. Numerous new technologies will be required to enable such ambitious missions. The solicitation for in situ planetary instruments can be found in the in situ instruments section of this solicitation. See URL: (http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/index.cfm) for mission information. Planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements.

Science,Topic S5,Information Technologies,"
 NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our earth, our solar system and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply these data and information to create knowledge. For example, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These are tools that allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA data and science information are used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H1,In-Situ Resource Utilization,"
 The purpose of In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is to harness and utilize resources (both natural and discarded material) at the site of exploration to create products and services which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration. The ability to make propellants, life support consumables, fuel cell reagents, and radiation shielding from in-situ resources can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. Since ISRU may be performed wherever resources exist, ISRU systems need to operate in a variety of environments and gravities. Also, because ISRU systems and operations have never been demonstrated before in missions, it is important that ISRU concepts and technologies be evaluated under relevant conditions (gravity, environment, and vacuum) as well as anchored through modeling to regolith/soil, atmosphere, and environmental conditions. While the discipline of ISRU can encompass a large variety of different concept areas, resources, and products, the ISRU Topic will focus on technologies and capabilities associated with atmospheric and trash/waste resource collection, transfer, and processing."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H2,Space Transportation,"Achieving space flight remains a challenging enterprise. It is an undertaking of great complexity, requiring numerous technological and engineering disciplines and a high level of organizational skill. Human Exploration requires advances in operations, testing, and propulsion for transport to the earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond. NASA is interested in making space transportation systems more capable and less expensive. NASA is interested in technologies for advanced in-space propulsion systems to support exploration, reduce travel time, reduce acquisition costs, and reduce operational costs. The goal is a breakthrough in cost and reliability for a wide range of payload sizes and types (including passenger transportation) supporting future orbital flight vehicles. Lower cost and reliable space access will provide significant benefits to civil space (human and robotic exploration beyond Earth as well as Earth science), to commercial industry, to educational institutions, for support to the International Space Station National Laboratory, and to national security. While other strategies can support frequent, low-cost and reliable space access, this topic focuses on the technologies that dramatically alter acquisition, reusability, reliability, and operability of space transportation systems."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H3,Life Support and Habitation Systems,"
 Life support and habitation encompasses the process technologies and equipment necessary to provide and maintain a livable environment within the pressurized cabin of crewed spacecraft. Functional areas of interest to this solicitation include atmosphere revitalization and particulate control, environmental monitoring and fire protection systems, crew accommodations, water recovery systems, solid waste management and thermal control. Technologies must be directed at long duration missions in microgravity, including Earth orbit and planetary transit. Requirements include operation in microgravity and compatibility with cabin atmospheres of up to 34% oxygen by volume and pressures ranging from 1 atmosphere to as low as 7.6 psi (52.4 kPa). Special emphasis is placed on developing technologies that will fill existing gaps, reduce requirements for consumables and other resources including mass, power, volume and crew time, and which will increase safety and reliability with respect to the state-of-the-art. Non-venting processes may be of interest for technologies that have future applicability to planetary protection. Results of a Phase I contract should demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility of the technical approach. A resulting Phase II contract should lead to development, evaluation and delivery of prototype hardware. Specific technologies of interest to this solicitation are addressed in each subtopic."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H4,Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology,"
 Advanced Extra -Vehicular Activity (EVA) systems are necessary for the successful support of the International Space Station (ISS) beyond 2020 and future human space exploration missions for in-space microgravity EVA and for planetary surface exploration. Advanced EVA systems include the space suit pressure garment, airlocks, the Portable Life Support System (PLSS), Avionics and Displays, and EVA Integrated Systems. Future human space exploration missions will require innovative approaches for maximizing human productivity. Advanced EVA system must also provide the capability to perform useful tasks safely, such as assembling and servicing large in-space systems and exploring surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and small bodies. Top-level requirements for advanced EVA systems include reduction of system weight and volume, minimization of consumables usage, increased hardware reliability, durability, operating life, increased human comfort, and less restrictive work performance in the space environment. All proposed Phase I research must lead to specific Phase II experimental development that could be integrated into a functional EVA system."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H5,Lightweight Spacecraft Materials and Structures,"
 The SBIR topic area of Lightweight Spacecraft Materials and Structures centers on developing lightweight inflatable structures, solar array structures, and advanced manufacturing technologies for metallic materials. Applications are expected to include space exploration vehicles including launch vehicles, crewed vehicles, and surface and habitat systems, and solar electric propulsion tugs. The subtopic Expandable/Deployable Structures solicits innovative concepts to support the development of lightweight-structure technologies that would be viable solutions to high packaging efficiency, and of deployment mechanisms. Technologies are needed to minimize launch mass, volume and costs, while maintaining the required structural performance for the loads and environments. Of particular interest for expandable/inflatable systems are high-tenacity fibrous materials for the restraint layer of inflatable structures, and bladder materials with limited air permeation and good flexure properties at low temperatures. Analysis and test methods that verify the performance of highly loaded inflated structures are highly desired. For large solar arrays systems, mass-efficient solar array designs with a scalable path from 20-30 kW up to 300 kW and beyond are needed. Advanced analysis and test techniques to ensure reliable deployment of large solar array structures are of special interest. Novel design and packaging concepts, analysis techniques, and both ground and in-space test methods are sought for large deployable solar arrays as well as for individual components such as lightweight booms, ribs, or frames; flexible substrate materials; and mechanisms. The overall objective of the subtopic on Advanced Manufacturing and Material Development for Lightweight Metallic Structures is to advance technology readiness levels of lightweight metals and manufacturing techniques for launch vehicles and in-space applications resulting in structures having affordable, reliable, predictable performance with reduced costs. Proposals are sought that offer innovative manufacturing processes and/or materials to locally increase the stiffness and strength of structural elements added to NNS components. Manufacturing methods of interest include additive manufacturing methods that employ wire feedstock, fusion and friction stir welding. Of specific interest in materials are advances in aluminum wire and tape feedstock materials, including customized alloy chemistry and metal matrix composites (MMCs) incorporating either discontinuous or continuous reinforcements. Of specific interest in manufacturing and processing are proposals that address issues such as residual stress and distortion control, post-deposition processing to develop service mechanical properties, and energy source/reinforcement interactions. Research under this topic should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware demonstration, and when possible, deliver a full-scale demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H6,Autonomous and Robotic Systems,"
 NASA invests in the development of autonomous systems, advanced avionics, and robotics technology capabilities for the purpose of enabling complex missions and technology demonstrations supporting the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). The software, avionics, and robotics elements requested within this topic are critical to enhancing human spaceflight system functionality. These elements increase autonomy and system reliability; reduce system vulnerability to extreme radiation and thermal environments; and support human exploration missions with robotic assistants, precursors and caretaker robots. As key and enabling technology areas, autonomous systems, avionics and robotics are applicable to broad areas of technology use, including heavy lift launch vehicle technologies, robotic precursor platforms, utilization of the International Space Station, and spacecraft technology demonstrations performed to enable long duration space missions. All of these flight applications will require unique advances in software, robotic technologies and avionics. The exploration of space requires the best of the nation's technical community to provide the technologies, engineering, and systems to enable human exploration beyond LEO, to visit asteroids and the Moon, and to extend our reach to Mars."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H7,"Entry, Descent and Landing Technology","
 The Thermal Protection System (TPS) protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. In general, there are two classes of TPS - reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry with a significant amount of energy being re-radiated from the heated surface and the remainder conducted into the TPS material. Typically, a surface coating with high emissivity (to maximize the amount of energy re-radiated) and with low surface catalycity (to minimize convective heating by suppressing surface recombination of dissociated boundary layer species) is employed. The primary insulation has low thermal conductivity to minimize the mass of material required to insulate the primary structure. Ablative TPS materials, in contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing organic resins as binders. When heated, the resin pyrolyzes producing gaseous products that are heated as they percolate toward the surface thus transferring some energy from the solid to the gas. Additionally, the injection of the pyrolysis gases into the boundary layer alters the boundary layer properties resulting in reduced convective heating. However, the gases may undergo chemical reactions with the boundary layer gases that could return heat to the surface. Furthermore, chemical reactions between the surface material and boundary layer species can result in consumption of the surface material leading to surface recession. Those reactions can be endothermic (vaporization, sublimation) or exothermic (oxidation) and will have an important impact on net energy to the surface. Clearly, in comparison to reusable TPS materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. NASA has successfully tackled the complexity of thermal protection systems for numerous missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system in the past; the knowledge gained has been invaluable but incomplete. Future missions will be more demanding. Better performing ablative TPS than currently available is needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe missions, e.g., Near Earth Object Earth Return with velocities exceeding 11.5 km/s and Heavy Mass Mars Landing with 8 km/s entry. In addition, new low ballistic coefficient deployable systems may require flexible ablative TPS materials that can protect systems experiencing heat fluxes ranging from 30 W/cm2 to 300 W/cm2, depending on their missions. Beyond the improvement needed in ablative TPS materials, more demanding future missions such as large payload missions to Mars will require novel entry system designs that consider different vehicle shapes, deployable or inflatable configurations and integrated approaches of TPS materials with the entry system sub-structure."

Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H9,Space Communications and Navigation,"
 The Space Communication and Navigation Technology Area supports all NASA space missions with the development of new capabilities and services that make our missions possible. Communication links are the lifelines to our spacecraft that provide the command, telemetry, and science data transfers as well as navigation support. Advancement in communication and navigation technology will allow future missions to implement new and more capable science instruments, greatly enhance human missions beyond Earth orbit, and enable entirely new mission concepts. NASA's communication and navigation capability is based on the premise that communications shall enable and not constrain missions. Today our communication and navigation capabilities, using Radio Frequency technology, can support our spacecraft to the fringes of the solar system and beyond. As we move into the future, we are challenged to increase current data rates- 300 Mbps in LEO to about 6 Mbps at Mars- to support the anticipated numerous missions for space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Technologies such as optical communications, RF including antennas and ground based Earth stations, surface networks, cognitive networks, access links, reprogrammable communications systems, advanced antenna technology, transmit array concepts, and communications in support of launch services are very important to the future of exploration and science activities of the Agency. Additionally, innovative, relevant research in the areas of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) are desirable. NASA's Space Communication and Navigation (SCaN) Office considers the three elements of PNT to represent distinct, constituent capabilities: 
   Positioning, by which we mean accurate and precise determination of an asset's location and orientation referenced to a coordinate system. 
 Navigation, by which we mean determining an asset's current and/or desired absolute or relative position and velocity state, and applying corrections to course, orientation, and velocity to attain achieve the desired state. 
 Timing, by which we mean an assets acquiring from a standard, maintaining within user-defined parameters, and transferring where required, an accurate and precise representation of time, minimize the impact of latency on overall system performance. 


 This year, the following technology areas are being solicited to meet increasing data throughput and accuracy needs: Optical communications, RF communications, experiments involving reprogrammable communications systems, flight dynamics and breakthrough or high impact communication technologies. Emphasis is placed on size, weight and power improvements. Innovative solutions centered on operational issues are needed in all of the aforementioned areas. All technologies developed under this topic area to be aligned with the Architecture Definition Document and technical direction as established by the NASA SCaN Office. For more details, see (http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/haughton-field/)."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H10,Ground Processing and ISS Utilization,"
 The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) provides mission critical space exploration services to both NASA customers and to other partners within the U.S. and throughout the world: assembling and operating the International Space Station; ensuring safe and reliable access to space; maintaining secure and dependable communications between platforms across the solar system; and ensuring the health and safety of our Nation's astronauts. Activities include ground-based and in-flight processing and operations tasks, along with support that ensures these tasks are accomplished efficiently and accurately, enables successful missions and healthy crews. This topic area, while largely focused on operational space flight activities, is broad in scope. NASA is seeking technologies that address how to improve and lower costs related to ground and flight assets, and maximize the utilization of the International Space Station. A typical flight focused approach would include: 
   Phase I - Research to identify and evaluate candidate technology applications to demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path towards a hardware/software demonstration. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are desirable. 
 Phase II - Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under simulated flight conditions.

For ground processing and operations tasks, the proposal shall outline a path showing how the technology could be developed into ground or flight systems. The contract shall deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract and, if possible, demonstrate earth based uses or benefits."
Human Exploration and Operations,Topic H11,Radiation Protection,"
 The SBIR topic area of Radiation Protection focuses on the development and testing of mitigation concepts to protect astronaut crews and exploration vehicles from the harmful effects of space radiation, both in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and while conducting long-duration missions beyond LEO. Advances are needed in mitigation schema for the next generation of exploration vehicles inclusive of radiation shielding materials and structures technologies to protect humans from the hazards of space radiation during NASA missions. As NASA continues to form plans for long duration exploration, it has also become increasingly clear that the ability to mitigate the risks posed to both crews and vehicle systems by the space weather environment are also of central importance. This Radiation Protection Topic will concentrate on the Alert and Warning Systems. This area of interest is ways in which SBIR-developed technologies can contribute to NASA's overall mission requirements are advances in the understanding and predictability of space weather science. Current operational space weather support utilizes both inter- and extra-agency assets to maintain situational awareness and mitigate radiation risks associated with agency missions. Operational space weather support consists in the most basic terms of maintaining situational awareness of both the state of the Sun as a physical system and the radiation environment and its dynamics within the Heliosphere, and altering in real-time, a mission in order to minimize their effects. Therefore, advances are needed in the development of scientific research products for real-time operational forecasting tools to mitigate mission risk. Research under this topic should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path forward to Phase II hardware demonstration, and when possible, deliver a full-scale demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract."

 NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) investigates and mitigates the highest risks to astronaut health and performance in exploration missions. The goal of the HRP is to provide human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies, and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration, and to ensure safe and productive human spaceflight. The scope of these goals includes both the successful completion of exploration missions and the preservation of astronaut health over the life of the astronaut. HRP developed an Integrated Research Plan (IRP) to describe the requirements and notional approach to understanding and reducing the human health and performance risks. The IRP describes the Program's research activities that are intended to address the needs of human space exploration and serve HRP customers. The IRP illustrates the program's research plan through the timescale of early lunar missions of extended duration. The Human Research Roadmap (http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov) is a web-based version of the IRP that allows users to search HRP risks, gaps, and tasks. The HRP is organized into Program Elements: 
   Human Health Countermeasures. 
 Behavioral Health & Performance. 
 Exploration Medical Capability. 
 Space Human Factors and Habitability. 
 Space Radiation and ISS Medical Projects. 


 Each of the HRP Elements address a subset of the risks, with ISS Medical Projects responsible for the implementation of the research on various space and ground analog platforms. The overview and responsibilities of each of the Elements is described within the Human Research Roadmap (referenced above). With the exception of Space Radiation, the SBIR subtopics in this solicitation align with the HRP Program Elements: 
   H12.01 Exploration Countermeasure Capability - Portable Activity Monitoring System helps address Human Health Countermeasures musculoskeletal risks. 
 H12.02 Exploration Medical Capability - Medical Suction Capability addresses a specific Exploration Medical Capability technology gap. 
 H12.03 Behavioral Health and Performance - Innovative Technologies for A Virtual Social Support System for Autonomous Exploration Missions helps address Behavioral Health and Space Human Factors and Habitability risks. 
 H12.04 Advanced Food Systems Technology helps address the Space Human Factors and Habitability food system risks. 
 H12.05 In-Flight Biological Sample Analysis helps address an ISS Medical Project technology need to allow on-orbit biological sample analysis, limiting the need for biological sample return."

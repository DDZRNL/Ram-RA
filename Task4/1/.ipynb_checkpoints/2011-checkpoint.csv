Space Operations,Topic O1,Space Communications,"
 NASA's communications capability is based on the premise that communications shall enable and not constrain missions. Communications must be robust to support the numerous missions for space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Technologies such as optical communications, RF including antennas and ground based Earth stations, surface networks, cognitive networks, access links, reprogrammable communications systems, advanced antenna technology, transmit array concepts, and communications in support of launch services including space based assets are very important to the future of exploration and science activities of the Agency. Emphasis is placed on size, weight and power improvements, and even greater emphasis is placed on these attributes as small satellites (e.g., micro and nano satellite) technology matures. Communication technologies enabling acquisition of range safety data from sensitive instruments is imperative. Innovative solutions centered on operational issues are needed in all of the aforementioned areas. All technologies developed under this topic area to be aligned with the Architecture Definition Document and technical direction as established by the NASA Office of Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN).

Space Operations,Topic O2,Space Transportation,"
 Achieving space flight remains a challenging enterprise. It is an undertaking of great complexity, requiring numerous technological and engineering disciplines and a high level of organizational skill. Overcoming Earth's gravity to achieve orbit demands collections of quality data to maintain the security required of the range. The harsh environment of space puts tight constraints on the equipment needed to perform the necessary functions. Not only is there a concern for safety but the 2004 Space Transportation Policy directive states that the U.S. should maintain robust transportation capabilities to assure access to space. This crosscutting SBIR Topic seeks to enable commercial solutions for U.S. space transportation systems providing significant reductions in cost, and increases in reliability, flight-rate, and frequency of access to space. The goal is a breakthrough in cost and reliability for a wide range of payload sizes and types (including passenger transportation) supporting future orbital flight that can be demonstrated on interim suborbital vehicles. The vision is a competitive marketplace with multiple commercial providers of highly-reusable space transportation systems and services with aircraft-like operations, high-flight rates, and short turnaround times (days-to-hours, rather than months). Lower cost and reliable space access will provide significant benefits to civil space (human and robotic exploration beyond Earth as well as Earth science), to commercial industry, to educational institutions, for support to the International Space Station National Laboratory, and to national security. While other strategies can support frequent, low-cost and reliable space access, this topic focuses on the technologies that dramatically alter reusability, reliability and operability of next generation space access systems."
Space Operations,Topic O3,Processing and Operations,"
 The Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) provides mission critical space exploration services to both NASA customers and to other partners within the U.S. and throughout the world: from flying out the Space Shuttle, to assembling and operating the International Space Station; ensuring safe and reliable access to space; maintaining secure and dependable communications between platforms across the solar system; and ensuring the health and safety of our Nation's astronauts. Activities include ground-based and in-flight processing and operations tasks, along with support that ensures these tasks are accomplished efficiently and accurately enables successful missions and healthy crews. This topic area, while largely focused on operational space flight activities, is broad in scope. NASA is seeking technologies that address how to improve and lower costs related to ground and flight assets, and maximize and extend the life of the International Space Station. A typical flight focused approach would include: 

   Phase I: Research to identify and evaluate candidate technology applications to demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path towards a hardware/software demonstration. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are desirable. 
 Phase II: Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under simulated flight conditions. 


 The proposal shall outline a path showing how the technology could be developed into space-worthy systems. For ground processing and operations tasks, the proposal shall outline a path showing how the technology could be developed into ground or flight systems. The contract shall deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract and, if possible, demonstrate earth based uses or benefits."
Space Operations,Topic O4,Navigation,"
 NASA seeks innovative research in the areas of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) that have relevance to Space Communications and Navigation programs and goals, as described at (https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/default.cfm). NASA's Space Communication and Navigation Office considers the three elements of PNT to represent distinct, constituent capabilities: - positioning, by which we mean accurate and precise determination of an asset's location and orientation referenced to a coordinate system - navigation, by which we mean determining an asset's current and/or desired absolute or relative position and velocity state, and applying corrections to course, orientation, and velocity to attain achieve the desired state - timing, by which we mean an asset's acquiring from a standard, maintaining within user-defined parameters, and transferring where required, an accurate and precise representation of time. This year, NASA seeks technology in Metric Tracking of Launch Vehicles, Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Sensors and Components, and Flight Dynamics Technologies and Software. These areas include tracking during launch and landing operations, and research and technology relevant to the planning and development of PNT support and services that NASA may undertake over the next several years. Some of the subtopics in this topic could result in products that may be included in future flight opportunities. Please see the Science MD Topic S4 for more details as to the requirements for small satellite flight opportunities, and the Facilitated Access to the Space Environment for Technology Development and Training (FAST) website at (http://ipp.nasa.gov/ii_fast.htm)."

Aeronautics Research,Topic A3,Airspace Systems,"
 NASA's Airspace Systems Program (ASP) is investing in the development, validation and transfer of advanced innovative concepts, technologies and procedures to support the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). This investment includes partnerships with other government agencies represented in the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and joint activities with the U.S. aeronautics industry and academia. As such, ASP will develop and demonstrate future concepts, capabilities, and technologies that will enable major increases in air traffic management effectiveness, flexibility, and efficiency, while maintaining safety, to meet capacity and mobility requirements of NextGen. ASP integrates the two projects NextGen Concepts and Technology Development (CTD) and NextGen Systems Analysis Integration and Evaluation (SAIE), to directly address the fundamental research needs of NextGen vision in partnership with the member agencies of the JPDO. The CTD develops and explores fundamental concepts, algorithms, and air-borne and ground-based technologies to increase capacity and throughput of the national airspace system, to address demand-capacity imbalances, and achieve high efficiency in the use of resources such as airports, en route and terminal airspace. The SAIE Project is responsible for facilitating the Research and Development maturation of integrated concepts through evaluation in relevant environments, providing integrated solutions, characterizing airspace system problem spaces, defining innovative approaches, and assessing the potential system impacts and design ramifications of the program's portfolio. Together, the projects will also focus NASA's technical expertise and world-class facilities to address the question of where, when, how and the extent to which automation can be applied to moving air traffic safely and efficiently through the NAS and technologies that address optimal allocation of ground and air technologies necessary for NextGen. Additionally, the roles and responsibilities of humans and automation influence in the ATM will be addressed by both projects. Key objectives of NASA's AS Program are to: 

   Improve mobility, capacity, efficiency and access of the airspace system. 
 Improve collaboration, predictability, and flexibility for the airspace users. 
 Enable accurate modeling and simulation of air transportation systems. 
 Accommodate operations of all classes of aircraft.
 Maintain system safety and environmental protection."
Aeronautics Research,Topic A4,Aeronautics Test Technologies,"
 The Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) ensures the long term availability and health of NASA's major wind tunnels/ground test facilities and flight operations/test infrastructure that support NASA, DoD and U.S. industry research and development (R&D) and test and evaluation (T&E) requirements. Furthermore, ATP provides rate stability to the aforementioned user community. The ATP facilities are located at four NASA Centers made up of the Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center and Langley Research Center. Classes of facilities within the ATP include low speed, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, air-breathing engine test facilities, the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR), support & test bed aircraft, and the simulation and loads laboratories. A key component of ensuring a test facility's long-term viability is to implement and continually improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of that facility's operations along with developing new technologies to address the nation's future aerospace challenges. To operate a facility in this manner requires the use of state-of-the-art test technologies and test techniques, creative facility performance capability enhancements, and novel means of acquiring test data. NASA is soliciting proposals in the areas of instrumentation, test measurement technology, test techniques and facility development that apply to the ATP facilities to help in achieving the ATP goals of sustaining and improving our test capabilities. Proposals that describe products or processes that are transportable across multiple facility classes are of special interest. The proposals will also be assessed for their ability to develop products that can be implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities. Additional information: http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/atp/index.html."
Aeronautics Research,Topic A5,Integrated System Research Project  (ISRP),"
 The Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP), a new program effort that began in FY10, will conduct research at an integrated system-level on promising concepts and technologies and explore, assess or demonstrate their benefits in a relevant environment. The integrated system-level research in this program will be coordinated with on-going long-term, foundational research within the three other research programs, as well as efforts within other Federal Government agencies. As the NextGen evolves to meet the projected growth in demand for air transportation, researchers must address the national challenges of mobility, capacity, safety, and energy and the environment in order to meet the expected growth in air traffic. In particular, the environmental impacts of noise and emissions are a growing concern and could limit the ability of the system to accommodate growth. ISRP will explore and assess new vehicle concepts and enabling technologies through system-level experimentation to simultaneously reduce fuel burn, noise and emissions, and will focus specifically on maturing and integrating technologies in major vehicle systems/subsystems for accelerated transition to practical application. ISRP is comprised of two projects - the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project and the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Project. Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) The project's primary goal is to select vehicle concepts and technologies that can simultaneously reduce fuel burn, noise and emissions; it contains three subprojects: Airframe Technology, Propulsion Technology and Vehicle Systems Integration.

   Testing unconventional aircraft configurations that have higher lift to drag ratio, reduced drag and reduced noise around airports. 
 Achieving drag reduction through laminar flow. 
 Developing composite (nonmetallic) structural concepts to reduce weight and improve fuel burn; and 
 Testing advanced, fuel-flexible combustor technologies that can reduce engine NOx emissions. The Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) The project's primary goal is to address technology development in several areas to reduce the technical barriers related to the safety and operational challenges of UAS routine operations in the NAS. 
 Separation Assurance - Safely and seamlessly integrate UAS into NextGen separation assurance through demonstrate of 4DT applications that result in the same or fewer losses of separation as traditional separation services.

 Communication - Demonstrate a secure UAS command and control datalink which meets communication confidentiality, availability and integrity requirements and which meets FAA communication latency requirements. Certification - Document applicability of possible certification method meeting airworthiness requirements for the full range of UAS and collect UAS-specific data in a civil context to support development of standards and regulations. 
 Integrated Test and Evaluation - Creation of an appropriate test environment; Integration of the technical research to probe and evaluate the concepts; and Coordination and prioritization of facility and aircraft schedules."
Science,Topic S1,"Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","
 NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/astrophysics), Earth Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/earth-science), Heliophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/heliophysics), and Planetary Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/planetary-science). A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending). For the 2011 program year, we are encouraging proposals for two new subtopics, S1.10 for technologies in support of atomic interferometry to enable precise targeting, pointing, and tracking and S1.11 for technologies in support of the specific needs of planetary orbital remote sensing instruments. A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development components that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology."
Science,Topic S2,Advanced Telescope Systems,"
 The NASA Science Missions Directorate seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture lightweight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4-degrees Kelvin. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide and nanolaminates, innovative structures, including nanotechnology, and wavefront sensing and control are needed to build telescope for Earth science that have the potential to cost between $50 to $150M."
Science,Topic S3,Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"
 The Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system and the universe beyond. SMD's future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points, or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost, that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems like: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs. Innovations for 2011 are sought in the areas of: 
  Command and Data Handling, and Instrument Electronics
 Thermal Control Systems 
 Power Generation and Conversion 
 Propulsion Systems
 Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage 
 Guidance, Navigation and Control 
 Unmanned Aircraft and Sounding Rocket Technologies 
 Terrestrial and Planetary Balloons 

Significant changes to the S3 Topic for 2011 are: 

   Merged the 2010 subtopics of S3.08 Planetary Ascent Vehicles and S3.10 Earth Entry Vehicles into a broader ""Spacecraft Technology for Sample Return Missions"" sub-topic under the S5 Topic. 
 Moved power electronics/power processing unit content for electric propulsion systems from S3.04 Propulsion Systems to the revised sub-topic of S3.05 Power Electronics and Management, and Energy Storage.

Science,Topic S4,Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies,"
 Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies This subtopic is targeted at the development of technologies and systems that can enable the realization of small spacecraft science missions. While small spacecraft have the benefit of reduced launch costs by virtue of their lower mass, they may be currently limited in performance and their capacity to provide on-orbit resources to payload and instrument systems. With the incorporation of smaller bus technologies, launch costs, as well as total life cycle costs, can continue to be reduced, while still achieving and expanding NASA's mission objectives. The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies category is focused on the identification and development of specific key spacecraft technologies primarily in the areas of integrated avionics, attitude determination and control including de-orbit technologies, and spacecraft power generation and management. The primary thrust of this topic is directed at reducing the footprint and resources that these bus subsystems require (size, weight, and power), allowing more of these critical resources to be shifted to payload and instrument systems, and to further reduce the overall launch mass and volume requirements for small spacecraft. Note that related topics of interest to S4 Low-cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies may be found in other areas of the solicitation: S3.01 Command, Data Handling and Electronics; S3.03 Power Generation and Conversion; and S3.05 Power Management and Storage. Proposals should show an understanding of one or more relevant science needs, and present a feasible plan to fully develop a technology and infuse it into a NASA program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware and/or software demonstration, and when possible, deliver a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract."
Science,Topic S5,Robotic Exploration Technologies,"
 NASA is pursuing technologies to enable robotic exploration of the Solar System including its planets, their moons, and small bodies. NASA has a development program that includes technologies for the atmospheric entry, descent, and landing, mobility systems, extreme environments technology, sample acquisition and preparation for in situ experiments, and in situ planetary science instruments. Robotic exploration missions that are planned include a Europa Jupiter System mission, Titan Saturn System mission, Venus In Situ Explorer, sample return from Comet or Asteroid and lunar south polar basin and continued Mars exploration missions launching every 26 months including a network lander mission, an Astrobiology Field Laboratory, a Mars Sample Return mission and other rover missions. Numerous new technologies will be required to enable such ambitious missions. The solicitation for in situ planetary instruments can be found in the in situ instruments section of this solicitation. See URL: (http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/index.cfm) for mission information. See URL: (http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/) for additional information on Mars Exploration technologies. Planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending)."
Science,Topic S6,Information Technologies,"
 NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our Earth, our solar system and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply these data to create knowledge. In particular, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These are tools that allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, and provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA science information be used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public."
Exploration Systems,Topic X1,In Situ Resource Utilization,"
 The purpose of In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is to harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration to create products and services which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration. The ability to make propellants, life support consumables, fuel cell reagents, and radiation shielding can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. The ability to modify the landscape for safer landing and transfer of payloads, creation of habitat and power infrastructure, and extraction of resources for construction, power, and in-situ manufacturing can also enable long-term, sustainable exploration of the solar system. Since ISRU can be performed wherever resources may exist, both natural and discarded, ISRU systems will need to operate in a variety of environments and gravitations. Also, because ISRU systems and operations have never been demonstrated before in missions, it is important that ISRU concepts and technologies be evaluated under relevant conditions (gravity, environment, and vacuum) as well as anchored through modeling to regolith/soil and environmental conditions. While the discipline of ISRU can encompass a large variety of different concept areas, resources, and products, the ISRU Topic will focus on technologies and capabilities associated with solid in-situ material handling and processing along with atmospheric and trash/waste processing."
Exploration Systems,Topic X2,Propulsion,"
 Human Exploration requires advances in propulsion for transport to the moon, Mars, and beyond. A major thrust of this research and development activity will be related to space launch and in-space propulsion technologies. These efforts will include earth-to-orbit propulsion, in-space chemical propulsion, in-space nuclear propulsion, and in-space electric propulsion development and demonstrations. NASA is interested in making propulsion systems more capable and less expensive. NASA is interested in technologies for advanced in-space propulsion systems to support exploration, reduce travel time, reduce acquisition costs, and reduce operational costs."
Exploration Systems,Topic X3,Life Support and Habitation Systems,"
 Life support and habitation encompasses the process technologies and equipment necessary to provide and maintain a livable environment within the pressurized cabin of crewed spacecraft. Functional areas of interest to this solicitation include thermal control and ventilation, atmosphere resource management and particulate control, water recovery systems, solid waste management, habitation systems, food production, environmental monitoring and fire protection systems. Technologies must be directed at long duration missions in microgravity, including earth orbit and planetary transit. Requirements include operation in microgravity and compatibility with cabin atmospheres of up to 34% oxygen by volume and pressures ranging from 1 atmosphere to as low as 7.6 psi (52.4 kPa). Special emphasis is placed on developing technologies that will fill existing gaps, reduce requirements for consumables and other resources including mass, power, volume and crew time, and which will increase safety and reliability with respect to the state-of-the-art. Non-venting processes may be of interest for technologies that have future applicability to planetary protection. Technology solutions involving both physicochemical and biological approaches are sought. Results of a Phase I contract should demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility of the technical approach. A resulting Phase II contract should lead to development, evaluation and delivery of prototype hardware. Specific technologies of interest to this solicitation are addressed in each subtopic."
Exploration Systems,Topic X4,Extra-Vehicular Activity Technology,"
 Advanced Extra -Vehicular Activity (EVA) systems are necessary for the successful support of the International Space Station (ISS) beyond 2020 and future human space exploration missions for in-space microgravity EVA and for planetary surface exploration. Advanced EVA systems include the space suit pressure garment, airlocks, the Portable Life Support System (PLSS), Avionics and Displays, and EVA Integrated Systems. Future human space exploration missions will require innovative approaches for maximizing human productivity and for providing the capability to perform useful tasks safely, such as assembling and servicing large in-space systems and exploring surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and small bodies. Top-level requirements include reduction of system weight and volume, low or non-consuming systems, increased hardware reliability, durability, operating life, increased human comfort, and less restrictive work performance in the space environment. All proposed Phase I research must lead to specific Phase II experimental development that could be integrated into a functional EVA system."
Exploration Systems,Topic X5,Lightweight Spacecraft Materials and Structures,"
 The SBIR topic area of Lightweight Spacecraft Materials and Structures centers on developing lightweight inflatable structures, advanced manufacturing technologies for metallic and composite materials, structural sensoring techniques, and in-situ non-destructive evaluation systems. Applications are expected to include space exploration vehicles including launch vehicles, crewed vehicles, and surface and habitat systems. The area of expandable structures solicits innovative concepts to support the development of lightweight-structure technologies that would be viable solutions to high packaging efficiency and increasing the usable primary pressurized volume in habitats, airlocks, and other crewed vessels. Technologies are needed to minimize launch mass, size and costs, while maintaining the required structural performance for loads and environments. Advanced fabrication and manufacturing of lightweight structures focuses on the development of metallic alloys and hybrid materials, processing and fabrication technologies related to near-net shape forming. The goal is to reduce structural weight, assembly steps, and minimize welds, resulting in increased reliability and reduced cost. Research should evaluate material compatibility with forming methods and establish fundamental microstructure/processing/property correlations to guide full-scale fabrication. Laboratory scale test methods are needed to accurately simulate the deformation modes experienced in large-scale manufacturing. Polymer matrix composite (PMC) materials have been identified as a critical need for launch and in-space vehicles. The reduction of structural mass translates directly to additional performance, increased payload mass and reduced cost. PMC materials are also critical for other structures, such as cryogenic propellant tanks. Advances in PMC materials, automated manufacturing processes, non-autoclave curing methods, advances in damage-tolerant/repairable structures, and PMC materials with high resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperatures are sought. The objective is to advance technology readiness levels of PMC materials and manufacturing for launch vehicle and in-space applications resulting in structures having affordable, reliable, and predictable performance. Practical modular structural sensor systems and NDE technologies are sought for spaceflight missions. Smart, lightweight, low-volume, and stand-alone sensor systems should reduce the complexities of standard wires and connectors and enable sensing in locations not normally accessible. NDE sensor system technology should include modular, low-volume systems and have the ability to perform inspections with minimal human interaction. Systems need to provide the location and extent of damage with the minimal data transfer between the flight system and Earth. Mission application areas include space transportation vehicles, pressure vessels, ISS modules, inflatable structures, EVA suits, MMOD shields, and thermal protection structures. Research under this topic should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path toward a Phase II hardware demonstration, and when possible, deliver a full-scale demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract."
Exploration Systems,Topic X6,Autonomous Systems and Avionics,"
 NASA invests in the development of autonomy and automation software, advanced avionics, integrated system health management, and robust software technology capabilities for the purpose of enabling complex missions and technology demonstrations. The software and avionics elements requested within this topic are critical to enhancing flight system functionality, reducing system vulnerability to extreme radiation and thermal environments, reducing system risk, and increasing autonomy and system reliability through processes, operations, and system management. As a game-changing and cross-cutting technology area, autonomous software and avionics are applicable to broad areas of technology emphasis, including heavy lift launch vehicle technologies, robotic precursor platforms, utilization of the International Space Station, and spacecraft technology demonstrations performed to enable long duration space missions. All of these flight applications will require unique advances in software technologies and avionics such as integrated systems health management, autonomous systems for the crew and mission operations, radiation hardened, multi-core processors, and reliable, dependable software. The exploration of space requires the best of the nation's technical community to step up to providing the technologies, engineering, and systems to explore the beyond LEO, visit asteroids and the Moon, and to extend our reach to Mars."
Exploration Systems,Topic X7,Human-Robotic Systems,"
 This call for technology development is in direct support of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD). The purpose of this research is to develop component and subsystem level technologies to support robotic precursor exploration missions. To that end, it is the intent of this Topic to capitalize on advanced technologies that allow humans and robots to interact seamlessly and significantly increase their efficiency and productivity in space. The objective is to produce new technologies that will reduce the total mass-volume-power of equipment and materials required to support both short and long duration planetary missions. The proposals must focus on component and subsystem level technologies in order to maximize the return from current SBIR funding levels and timelines. Doing so increases the likelihood of successfully producing a technology that can be readily infused into existing robotic system designs. This research focuses on technology development for the critical functions that will ultimately enable surface exploration for the advancement of scientific research. Surface exploration begins with short duration missions to establish a foundation, which leads to extensible functional capabilities. Successive buildup missions establish a continuous operational platform from which to conduct scientific research while on the planetary surface. Reducing risk and ensuring mission success depends on the coordinated interaction of many functional surface systems including power, communications infrastructure, and mobility and ground operations. This topic addresses technology needs within three subtopic areas: 

   Mobility systems. 
 Dexterous manipulation. 
 The interfaces that facilitate productive and seamless interaction between humans and robots."
Exploration Systems,Topic X8,High-Efficiency Space Power Systems,"
 This topic solicits technology development for high-efficiency power systems to be used for the human exploration of space. Technologies applicable to both space exploration and clean and renewable energy for terrestrial applications are of particular importance. Power system needs include: electric energy generation and storage for human-rated vehicles, electrical energy generation for in-space propulsion systems, and electric energy generation, storage, and transmission for planetary and lunar surface applications. Technology development is sought in: Fuel cells and electrolyzers including both proton exchange membrane and solid oxide technologies; Battery technology including components for improved performance and safety; Nuclear power systems including fission and radioisotope power generation; Photovoltaic power generation including solar cell, blanket and array technology; reliable, radiation tolerant electronic devices; and robust high voltage electronics."
Exploration Systems,Topic X9,"Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) Technology","
 The Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) Technology includes developments in Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) and Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP). The Thermal Protection System (TPS) protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. Supersonic Retropropulsion has been identified in past studies to be enabling for putting human-scale payloads on the surface of Mars. Thermal Protection Systems: In general, there are two classes of TPS: reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry; a significant amount of energy is re-radiated from the heated surface and the remainder is conducted into the TPS material. Ablative TPS materials, in contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing organic resins as binders. In comparison to reusable TPS materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. Better performing ablative TPS is needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe missions, e.g., Mars Landing from 8 km/s entry and Mars Sample Return with 12-15 km/s Earth entry. Beyond the improvement needed in ablative TPS materials, more demanding future missions such as large payload missions to Mars will require novel entry system designs that consider different vehicle shapes, deployable or inflatable configurations and integrated approaches of TPS materials with the entry system sub-structure. Supersonic Retropropulsion: When decelerating a vehicle to land on a body with an atmosphere, it is generally more mass-effective to take advantage of the natural environment and use atmospheric drag to its full potential, rather than use a propulsion system. This approach works well at Earth where the atmosphere is dense, but the trade is less conclusive at Mars. Recent studies for landing human-scale payloads on Mars (40-60 mt) have shown that using Supersonic Retropropulsion is probably enabling for this challenge. The scale of an aerodynamic decelerator employed in this flight regime would be very large, and presents issues with payload extraction and deployment in the short time available. Since a terminal propulsion system is already needed for these large landers, starting the engines earlier in the descent profile is an attractive solution. Aerodynamic challenges with this approach center around the interaction of the engine plumes with the oncoming supersonic flowfield, and what instabilities this causes for the system. Controlled wind tunnel testing with high-fidelity instrumentation and subsequent modeling of these complex flowfields is key to predicting system behavior. The SRP system will also need to be flight-tested in a relevant environment as part of the technology maturation. Cost-effective, feasible concepts and vehicle configurations for Earth flight tests are needed, to prove feasibility in the near term."
Exploration Systems,Topic X10,Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer,"
 The Exploration Systems architecture presents cryogenic storage, distribution, and fluid handling challenges that require new technologies to be developed. Reliable knowledge of low-gravity cryogenic fluid management behavior is lacking and yet is critical for future manned and robotic exploration in the areas of storage, distribution, and low-gravity propellant management. Additionally, Earth-based and planetary surface missions will require success in storing and transferring liquid and gas commodities in applications. Some of the technology challenges are for long-term space use cryogenic propellant storage and distribution; cryogenic fluid processing and fluid conditioning; liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen liquefaction processes. Furthermore, specific technologies are required in valves, regulators, instrumentation, modeling, mass gauging, cryocoolers, and passive and active thermal control techniques. The technical focus for component technologies are for accuracy, reduced mass, minimal heat leak, minimal leakage, and minimal power consumption. The anticipated technologies proposed are expected to increase safety, reliability, economic efficiency over current state-of-the-art cryogenic system performance, and are capable of being made flight qualified and/or certified for the flight systems and dates to meet Exploration Systems mission requirements."
Exploration Systems,Topic X11,Radiation Protection,"
 The SBIR topic area of Radiation Protection focuses on the development and testing of mitigation concepts to protect astronaut crews and exploration vehicles from the harmful effects of space radiation, both in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and while conducting long-duration missions beyond LEO. Advances are needed in mitigation schema for the next generation of exploration vehicles inclusive of radiation shielding materials and structures technologies to protect humans from the hazards of space radiation during NASA missions. As NASA continues to form plans for long duration exploration, it has also become increasingly clear that the ability to mitigate the risks posed to both crews and vehicle systems by the space weather environment are also of central importance. This Radiation Protection Topic will have two sub-topics consisting of:

   Radiation Shielding. 
 Alert and Warning Systems. 


 This first area of interest for the 2011 solicitation is radiation shielding materials systems for long-duration Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) and Solar Particle Event (SPE) protection capable of providing structural integrity for architectural element design, while also providing sufficient radiation protection. These material systems should likely possess other multi-functional properties such as thermal and/or MMOD protection, etc., therefore negating the need for the addition of parasitic shield mass. Neutron protection and high-energy electron protection are also of interest. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and to show a path forward to Phase II technology demonstration. Physical, mechanical, structural, and/or other relevant characterization data to validate and qualify multifunctional radiation shielding materials and structures should be demonstrated. Advances are needed in: 

   Innovative tailored materials for lightweight radiation shielding of humans and electronics for NASA missions. 
 Innovative, multifunctional, integrated, or multipurpose structures (primary or secondary structure) for lightweight radiation shielding of humans and electronics for NASA missions. 


 Applications are expected to include space exploration vehicles including launch vehicles, crewed vehicles, and surface and habitat systems. Another area of interest in which SBIR-developed technologies can contribute to NASA's overall mission requirements are advances in the understanding and predictability of space weather science. Current operational space weather support utilizes both inter- and extra-agency assets to maintain situational awareness and mitigate radiation risks associated with agency missions. Operational space weather support consists in the most basic terms of maintaining situational awareness of both the state of the Sun as a physical system and the radiation environment and its dynamics within the Heliosphere, and altering in real-time, a mission in order to minimize their effects. Therefore, advances are needed in the development of scientific research products for real-time operational forecasting tools to mitigate mission risk. Research under this topic should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path forward to Phase II hardware demonstration, and when possible, deliver a full-scale demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract."
Exploration Systems,Topic X12,Exploration Crew Health Capabilities,"
 Human space flight is associated with losses in muscle strength, bone mineral density and aerobic capacity. Crewmembers returning from the International Space Station (ISS) can lose as much as 10-20% of their strength in weight bearing and postural muscles. Likewise, bone mineral density is decreased at a rate of ~1% per month. During future exploration missions such physiologic decrements represent the potential for a significant loss of human performance which could lead to mission failure and/or a threat to crewmember health and safety. NASA is conducting research to enhance and optimize exercise countermeasure hardware and protocols for these missions. In this solicitation, we are seeking portable technologies to collect foot ground reaction force data from current exercise hardware deployed on the International Space Station to be analyzed by research teams on the ground, as well as compact, low mass, low power, high life-cycle, force-generating components for application to future crew exercise concepts."
Exploration Systems,Topic X13,Exploration Medical Capability,"
 Further human exploration of the solar system will present significant new challenges to crew health including hazards created by traversing the terrain of asteroids or planetary surfaces and the effects of variable gravity environments. The limited communications with ground-based personnel for diagnosis and consultation of medical events creates additional challenges. Providing health care capabilities for exploration missions will require the definition of new medical requirements and development of technologies to ensure the safety and success of Exploration missions, pre-, in-, and post-flight. This SBIR Topic addresses some key medical technology and gaps that NASA will need to solve in order to proceed with exploration missions."
Exploration Systems,Topic X14,Behavioral Health and Performance,"
 The Behavioral Health and Performance topic is interested in developing strategies, tools, and technologies to mitigate Behavioral Health and Performance risks. The Behavioral Health and Performance topic is seeking tools and technologies to prevent performance degradation, human errors, or failures during critical operations resulting from: fatigue or work overload; deterioration of morale and motivation; interpersonal conflicts or lack of team cohesion, coordination, and communication; team and individual decision-making; performance readiness factors (fatigue, cognition, and emotional readiness); and behavioral health disorders. For 2011, the Behavioral Health and Performance topic is interested in the following technologies: Virtual reality and world technologies for team training approaches."
Exploration Systems,Topic X15,Space Human Factors and Food Systems,"
 The emphasis on developing new, innovative technologies to enable future space exploration encompasses a need for new approaches in the areas of Space Human Factors and Food Systems. Operations in confined, isolated, and resource-constrained environments can lead to suboptimal human performance. Research and development activities in this topic address challenges that are fundamental to design, development, and operation of the next generation crewed space vehicles. These challenges include: 

   Development of a software tool that automatically processes crew motion and interaction, either on orbit or on the ground, from video footage taken with a single conventional 2D camera to enable unobtrusive and non-invasive measurement of task performance and crew behavioral health. 
 A need to develop a technology or system capable to prevent vitamin degradation of naturally-occurring and supplemented vitamins within a food substrate stored at ambient temperatures for five years. (http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/, http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hefd/index.html)"
Exploration Systems,Topic X16,Space Radiation,"
 The goal of the NASA Space Radiation Research Program is to assure that we can safely live and work in the space radiation environment, anywhere, any time. Space radiation is different from forms of radiation encountered on Earth. Radiation in space consists of high-energy protons, heavy ions and secondary products created when the protons and heavy ions interact with matter such as a spacecraft, surface of a planet, moon, asteroid, or even the astronauts themselves. NASA requires instruments that can reliably measure these radiations. NASA has a need for compact active radiation detection systems that can meet stringent size, power, and performance requirements. These include real-time personal monitors and area monitors that can be used on the International Space Station (ISS) as well as on future missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO). Ending the Space Shuttle program will increase the need to replace the current passive monitoring technologies on the ISS with active ones to reduce up and down mass. Also, as missions extend beyond LEO there will be further premium on reduced size, mass, and power for radiation detection technologies. To achieve such reductions, there will be an increasing need for reliable miniaturized components such as sensors, photomultipliers, data processors, power supplies, and the like that can be used to enhance radiation detection technologies as they develop. Advanced technologies up to technology readiness level (TRL) 4 are requested in these and related areas."
Exploration Systems,Topic X17,Inflight Biological Sample Preservation and Analysis,"
 The Human Research Program (HRP) is an applied research and technology program aimed at providing human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies, and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration. HRP's specific objectives include development of technologies that serve to reduce human systems resource requirements, such as mass, volume, and power to maximize utilization of spaceflight platforms to perform the essential research and technology development tasks that can only be accomplished during a space mission. Addressing multiple HRP human health and performance risks and knowledge gaps across various disciplines requires collection, preservation and analysis of biological samples from human subjects during a space mission, a common practice in clinical diagnostic medicine. However, the spaceflight environment affords unique challenges for the processing, storage and transport of biological specimens, due to highly constrained resources, such as limited conditioned stowage (mass and volume requiring storage in refrigerators or freezers) available. This topic aims to mitigate those space mission constraints by means of innovative approaches for the collection, long duration ambient temperature preservation, and low-resource small-footprint in situ analysis of human biospecimens, such as blood and urine, for a wide array of biomedically significant analytes."

,Focus Area 1,In-Space Propulsion Technologies,"NASA is interested in technologies for advanced in-space propulsion systems to reduce travel time, increase payload mass, reduce acquisition costs, reduce operational costs, and enable new science capabilities for exploration and science spacecraft. The future will require demanding propulsive performance and flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation. This focus area seeks innovations for NASA propulsion systems in chemical, electric, nuclear thermal and advanced propulsion systems related to human exploration and science missions. Propulsion technologies will focus on a number of mission applications including ascent, descent, orbit transfer, rendezvous, station keeping, proximity operations and deep space exploration."
,Focus Area 2,Power Energy and Storage,"Power is a ubiquitous technology need across many NASA missions. Within the SBIR Program, power is represented across a broad range of topics in human exploration, space science, space technology and aeronautics. New technologies are needed to generate electrical power and/or store energy for future human and robotic space missions and to enable hybrid electric aircraft that could revolutionize air travel. A key goal is to develop technologies that are multi-use and cross-cutting for a broad range of NASA mission applications. In aeronautics, power technologies are needed to supply large-scale electric power and efficiently distribute the power to aircraft propulsors (see Focus Area 18 – Air Vehicle Technologies). In the space power domain, mission applications include planetary surface power, large-scale spacecraft prime power, small-scale robotic probe power, and smallsat/cubesat power. Applicable technology options include photovoltaic arrays, radioisotope power systems, nuclear fission, thermal energy conversion, motor/generators, fuel cells, batteries or other energy storage devices, power management, transmission, distribution and intelligent control. An overarching objective is to mature technologies from analytical or experimental proof-of-concept (TRL3) to breadboard demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL5). Successful efforts will transition into NASA Projects where the SBIR/STTR deliverables will be incorporated into ground testbeds or flight demonstrations."
,Focus Area 3,Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,"The exploration of space requires the best of the nation's technical community to provide the technologies that will enable human and robotic exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO): to establish a lunar presence, to visit asteroids, to extend human reach to Mars, and for increasingly ambitious robotic missions such as a Europa Lander. Autonomous Systems technologies provide the means of migrating mission control from Earth to spacecraft, habitats, and robotic explorers. This is enhancing for missions in the Earth-Lunar neighborhood and enabling for deep space missions. Long light-time delays, for example up to 42 minutes round-trip between Earth and Mars, require time-critical control decisions to be closed on-board autonomously, rather than through round-trip communication to Earth mission control. For robotic explorers this will be done through automation, while for human missions this will be done through astronaut-automation teaming.Long-term crewed spacecraft and habitats, such as the International Space Station, are so complex that a significant portion of the crew's time is spent keeping it operational even under nominal conditions in low-Earth orbit, while still requiring significant real-time support from Earth. The considerable challenge is to migrate the knowledge and capability embedded in current Earth mission control, with tens to hundreds of human specialists ready to provide instant knowledge, to on-board automation that teams with astronauts to autonomously manage spacecraft and habitats. For outer planet robotic explorers, the opportunity is to autonomously and rapidly respond to dynamic environments in a timely fashion.The “Deep Neural Network Accelerator and Neuromorphic Computing” subtopic addresses extrapolating new terrestrial computing paradigms related to machine learning to the space environment. For machine inferencing and learning computing hardware proposals, metrics related to energy expenditure per operation (e.g., multiply-add) and throughput acceleration in a space environment are especially relevant.The subtopic on swarms of space vehicles addresses technologies for control and coordination of planetary rovers, flyers, and in-space vehicles in dynamic environments. Co-ordinated swarms can provide a more robust and sensor-rich approach to space missions, allowing simultaneous recording of sensor data from dispersed vehicles and co-ordination especially in challenging environments such as cave exploration.Fault management is an integral part of space missions. The fault management subtopic spans the lifecycle of fault management for space missions from design through verification and validation to operations. In the past, the predominant operational approach to detected faults has been to safe the spacecraft, and then rely on Earth mission control to determine how to proceed. New mission concepts require future spacecraft to autonomously decide how to recover from detected anomalies and continue the mission. The fault management subtopic solicits proposals that advance fault management technology across architectures, design tools, verification and validation, and operations.The “Artificial Intelligence for the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway” subtopic solicits autonomy, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to manage and operate engineered systems to facilitate long-duration space missions, with the goal of testing proposed technologies on Gateway.  The Gateway is a planned lunar-orbit spacecraft that will have a power and propulsion system, a small habitat for the crew, a docking capability, an airlock and logistics modules. The Gateway is expected to serve as an intermediate way station between the Orion crew capsule and lunar landers as well as a platform for both crewed and un-crewed experiments. The Gateway is also intended to test technologies and operational procedures for suitability on long-duration space missions such as a mission to Mars. The “Coordination and Control of Swarms of Space Vehicles” subtopic addresses technologies for control and coordination of planetary rovers, flyers, and in-space vehicles in dynamic environments. Coordinated swarms can provide a more robust and sensor-rich approach to space missions, allowing simultaneous recording of sensor data from dispersed vehicles and co-ordination especially in challenging environments such as cave exploration."
,Focus Area 4,Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,"This focus area includes development of robotic systems technologies (hardware and software) that will enable and enhance future space exploration missions. In the coming decades, robotic systems will continue to change the way space is explored. Robots will be used in all mission phases: as independent explorers operating in environments too distant or hostile for humans, as precursor systems operating before crewed missions, as crew helpers working alongside and supporting humans, and as caretakers of assets left behind. As humans continue to work and live in space, they will increasingly rely on intelligent and versatile robots to perform mundane activities, freeing human and ground control teams to tend to more challenging tasks that call for human cognition and judgment. Technologies are needed for robotic systems to improve transport of crew, instruments, and payloads on planetary surfaces, on and around small bodies, and in-space. This includes hazard detection, sensing/perception, active suspension, grappling/anchoring, legged locomotion, robot navigation, end-effectors, propulsion, and user interfaces.Innovative robot technologies provide a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility, manipulation and human-robot interaction offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Enhancements and potentially new forms of robotic systems can be realized through advances in component technologies, such as actuation and structures (e.g. 3D printing). Mobility provides a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Manipulation provides a critical capability for positioning crew members and instruments in space and on planetary bodies. Robotic manipulation allows for the handling of tools, interfaces, and materials not specifically designed for robots, and it provides a capability for drilling, extracting, handling and processing samples of multiple forms and scales. This increases the range of beneficial tasks robots can perform and allows for improved efficiency of operations across mission scenarios. Furthermore, manipulation is important for human missions, human precursor missions, and unmanned science missions.  Moreover, sampling, sample handling, transport, and distribution to instruments, or instrument placement directly on in-place rock or regolith, is important for robotic missions to locales too distant or dangerous for human exploration.Future space missions may rely on co-located and distributed teams of humans and robots that have complementary capabilities. Tasks that are considered ""dull, dirty, or dangerous"" can be transferred to robots, thus relieving human crew members to perform more complex tasks or those requiring real-time modifications due to contingencies. Additionally, due to the limited number of astronauts anticipated to crew planetary exploration missions, as well as their constrained schedules, ground control will need to remotely supervise and assist robots using time-delayed and limited bandwidth communications.  Advanced methods of human-robot interaction over time delay will enable more productive robotic exploration of the more distant reaches of the solar system.  This includes improved visualization of alternative future states of the robot and the terrain, as well as intuitive means of communicating the intent of the human to the robotic system."
,Focus Area 5,Communications and Navigation,"NASA seeks proposals to produce high impact developments in communications and navigation technologies to support space science and exploration missions, including the return of humans to the lunar surface. Missions are generating ever-increasing data volumes that require increased performance from communications systems while minimizing spacecraft impact. This requires higher peak throughput from the communications systems with lower flight communication system cost, mass, and power per bit transmitted.  Long range, deep-space optical communications systems are needed to support data-intensive missions beyond Mars orbit. Effective communications on a non-interference basis are also required in complex RF environments such as inside a launch vehicle fairing or spacecraft cavity, where new analysis methods are needed for predicting the RF environment. Similarly, missions have a need for more precise timing, guidance, navigation, and control to meet their mission objectives while conserving resources. This requires new and more efficient trajectory planning methods, increased onboard autonomous navigation, and improved precision of onboard instrumentation while minimizing cost, mass, and power. This focus area supports development of innovative technologies for optical and quantum communications systems, cognitive communications, flight dynamics and navigation, transformational communications approaches, electric field prediction methods, and timing, guidance, navigation, and control that will provide a significant improvement over the current state of the art."
,Focus Area 6,Life Support and Habitation Systems,"The Life Support and Habitation Systems Focus Area seeks key capabilities and technology needs encompassing a diverse set of engineering and scientific disciplines, all of which provide technology solutions that enable extended human presence in deep space and on planetary surfaces, such as Moon and Mars. The focus is on those mission systems and elements that directly support astronaut crews, such as Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems, plant growth for bioregenerative food production, and radiation tolerant avionics and control systems. Because spacecraft and their systems may involve multiple partnerships, with institutional, corporate and governmental involvement, Model Based Systems Engineering approaches may enable and improve their distributed development.For future crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and into the solar system, regular resupply of consumables and emergency or quick-return options will not be feasible. New technologies must be compatible with attributes of the environments we encounter, including microgravity or partial gravity, varying atmospheric pressure and composition, space radiation, and the presence of planetary dust. Technologies of interest are those that enable long-duration, safe, economical and sustainable deep-space human exploration. Special emphasis is placed on developing technologies that will fill existing gaps as described in this solicitation, that reduce requirements for consumables and other resources, including mass, power, volume and crew time, and which will increase safety and reliability with respect to the state-of-the-art. Spacecraft may be untended by crew for long periods, therefore systems must be operable after these intervals of dormancy.Environmental Control and Life Support Systems encompass process technologies and monitoring functions necessary to provide and maintain a livable environment within the pressurized cabin of crewed spacecraft, including environmental monitoring, water recycling, and atmosphere revitalization.  These processes and functions include recovering resources from or repurposing gaseous, liquid and solid wastes. Unique needs exist for the Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit’s (EMU) pressure garment and Portable Life Support System (PLSS). These include targeted improvements to the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) along with new capabilities, including a regenerable trace contaminant control system, a thermal loop bypass relief valve capable of re-calibration, and a robust feed water supply assembly. Outside of the protection of the Earth’s magnetosphere, radiation in deep space will be a challenge. However, within the shielded environment of human spacecraft and habitats, non-critical electronic systems may be able to use commercial off the shelf (COTS) rather than expensive radiation hardened parts.The current collaborative environment between government, commercial and international sectors will result in the distributed development of human spacecraft elements and systems for human missions of the future such as Gateway and lunar surface missions including Artemis. Their integration may benefit from advances in model based systems engineering approaches.Please refer to the description and references of each subtopic for further detail to guide development of proposals."
,Focus Area 7,Human Research and Health Maintenance,"NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) investigates and mitigates the highest risks to astronaut health and performance for exploration missions. HRP achieves this through a focused program of basic, applied and operational research leading to the development and delivery of:Human health, performance, and habitability standards.Countermeasures and other risk mitigation solutions.Advanced habitability and medical support technologies.HRP has developed an Integrated Research Plan (IRP) to describe the requirements and notional approach to understanding and reducing the human health and performance risks. The IRP describes the Program's research activities that are intended to address the needs of human space exploration and serve HRP customers. The Human Research Roadmap (http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov) is a web-based version of the IRP that allows users to search HRP risks, gaps, and tasks.The HRP is organized into several research Elements:Human Health Countermeasures.Human Factors and Behavioral Performance.Exploration Medical Capability.Space Radiation.Each of the HRP Elements address a subset of the risks. A fifth Element, Research Operations and Integration (ROI), is responsible for the implementation of the research on various space and ground analog platforms. HRP subtopics are aligned with the Elements and solicit technologies identified in their respective research plans."
,Focus Area 8,In-Situ Resource Utilization,"In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) involves any hardware or operation that harnesses and utilizes ‘in-situ’ resources (natural and discarded) to create products and services for robotic and human exploration. ISRU encompasses a broad range of systems, and is typically divided into six focus areas:  Resource Assessment, Resource Acquisition, Resource Processing/Consumable Production, In Situ Manufacturing, In Situ Construction, and In-Situ Energy. ISRU products and services can be used to reduce Earth launch mass or lander mass by not bringing everything from Earth, reduce risks to the crew and/or mission by reducing logistics, increasing shielding, and providing increased self-sufficiency, or reduce costs by needing less launch vehicles to complete the mission and/or through the reuse of hardware and lander/space transportation vehicles. Since ISRU can be performed wherever resources may exist, ISRU technologies and systems may need to operate in a variety of environments and gravities, and may need to consider a wide variety of potential resource physical and mineral characteristics. This year’s solicitation will focus on critical technologies needed in the areas of Resource Acquisition and Consumable Production for the Moon and Mars. The ISRU focus area is seeking innovative technology for:Solar ConcentratorsOxygen Extraction from Lunar RegolithLunar Ice MiningPropellant RecoveryRelaxed Propellant Grade SpecificationChemical Flow CellsAs appropriate, the specific needs and metrics of each of these specific technologies are described in the subtopic descriptions."
,Focus Area 9,"Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (https://science.nasa.gov/) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary Science. The National Academy of Science has provided NASA with recently updated Decadal surveys that are useful to identify technologies that are of interest to the above science divisions. Those documents are available at https://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/SSB_052297(link is external).  A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in-situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in-situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2020 program year, we are continuing to update the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, adding new, rotating out, and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. We continue to emphasize Ocean Worlds and solicit development of in-situ instrument technologies and components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life, especially extant of life, in the Ocean Worlds. The microwave technologies continue as two subtopics, one focused on active microwave remote sensing and the second on passive systems such as radiometers and microwave spectrometers. A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology."
,Focus Area 10,Advanced Telescope Technologies,"The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4 K. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide and nanolaminates, innovative structures, including nanotechnology, and wavefront sensing and control are needed to build telescopes for Earth science."
,Focus Area 11,Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system, and the universe beyond. SMD’s future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems such as: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. High performance space computing technologies are also included in this focus area. Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs. For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115° C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending). The National Academies’ Decadal Surveys for Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science discuss some of NASA’s science mission and technology needs and are available at https://sites.nationalacademies.org/SSB/SSB_052297(link is external). In addition, the Heliophysics roadmap “The Solar and Space Physics of a New Era: Recommended Roadmap for Science and Technology 2009­2030” is available at   http://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov/2009_Roadmap.pdf."
,Focus Area 12,"Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","The SBIR focus area of Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) includes the suite of technologies for atmospheric entry as well as descent and landing on both atmospheric and non-atmospheric bodies. EDL mission segments are used in both robotic planetary science missions and human exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, and many technologies have application to emerging commercial space capabilities.Robust, efficient, and predictable EDL systems fulfill the critical function of delivering payloads to planetary surfaces through challenging environments, within mass and cost constraints. Future NASA missions will require new technologies to break through historical constraints on delivered mass, enable sustained human presence, or to go to entirely new planets and moons. Even where heritage systems exist, no two planetary missions are exactly “build-to-print,” so there are frequently issues of environmental uncertainty, risk posture, and resource constraints that can be dramatically improved with investments in EDL technologies. EDL relies on validated models, ground tests, and sensor technologies for system development and certification. Both new capabilities and improved knowledge are important facets of this focus area.Because this topic covers a wide area of interests, subtopics are chosen to enhance and or fill gaps in the existing technology development projects. Future subtopics will support one or more of four broad capability areas, which represent NASA’s goals with respect to planetary Entry, Descent and Landing:High Mass to Mars SurfacePrecision Landing and Hazard AvoidancePlanetary Probes and Earth Return VehiclesEDL Data Return and Model ImprovementA cross-cutting set of disciplines and technologies will help mature these four capability areas, to enable more efficient, reliable exploration missions.This year the Entry, Descent and Landing focus area is seeking innovative solutions for:Deployable Decelerator TechnologiesLander Systems Technologies, particularly for the MoonEDL Sensors, including those embedded in thermal protection systems and those used for proximity operations and landing3D Weaving DiagnosticsDiagnostic tools for specialized EDL facilitiesHot Structure Technology for Aerospace VehiclesThe specific needs and metrics of each of these specific technology developments are described in the subtopic descriptions."
,Focus Area 13,Information Technologies for Science Data,"NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our earth, our solar system and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply these data and information to create knowledge. For example, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These tools allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA data and science information are used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public."
,Focus Area 14,"On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)","NASA is seeking technological innovations that will accelerate development and adoption of advanced manufacturing and modular assembly technologies supporting a wide range of NASA Missions. NASA has an immediate need for more affordable and more capable materials and processes across its unique missions, systems, and platforms. Cutting-edge manufacturing technologies offer the ability to dramatically increase performance and reduce the cost of NASA’s programs. The ability to improve cost, launch mass, system resiliency and extended life time by advancing technologies to enable large structures that can be deployed, assembled/constructed, reconfigured and serviced in-space or on planetary surfaces is also imperative to NASA’s Missions. In the areas of manufacturing, this topic is focused on technologies for both the ground-based advancements and in-space manufacturing capabilities required for sustainable, long-duration space missions to destinations such as Mars. The terrestrial subtopic areas concentration is on research and development of advanced metallic materials, processes and additive manufacturing technologies for their potential to increase the capability and affordability of engines, vehicles, space systems, instruments and science payloads by offering significant improvements over traditional manufacturing methods. Technologies should facilitate innovative physical manufacturing processes combined with the digital twin modeling and simulation approach that integrates modern design and manufacturing. The in-space manufacturing focus area includes: a) manufacturing and recycling in an intravehicular environment (for production of spare parts and to achieve logistics reductions); b) manufacturing of large scale structures with dimensions exceeding current payload fairings with additive manufacturing in the external space environment; and, c) repair and assembly of structures using joining technologies. In addition, advances in lighter-weight metals processing (on ground and in-space) will enable the delivery of higher-mass payloads to Mars and beyond. In order to achieve necessary reliabilities and ensure parts meet requirements for intended use scenarios, development of in situ process assessment, feedstock control and monitoring, and volumetric inspection capabilities are urgently needed. This topic also includes autonomous assembly of structures in space, focused on four critical aspects including autonomy, system modularity, metrology, and modeling & simulation. The hardware and software components of an in-space assembled structure must be modular to facilitate servicing, component replacement, and reconfiguration of the spacecraft. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and prototype hardware development during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering an engineering development unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II that could be turned into a proof-of-concept system for flight demonstration. To understand the full technology needs and requests see the detailed topic and subtopic descriptions."
,Focus Area 15,"Materials, Materials Research, Structures, and Assembly","As NASA strives to explore deeper into space than ever before, lightweight structures and advanced materials have been identified as a critical need. The Lightweight Materials, Structures, Advanced Assembly and Construction focus area seeks innovative technologies and systems that will reduce mass, improve performance, lower cost, be more resilient and extend the life of structural systems. Reliability will become an enabling consideration for deep space travel where frequent and rapid supply and resupply capabilities are not possible. Improvement in all of these areas is critical to future missions. Applications include structures and materials for launch, in-space and surface systems, deployable and assembled systems, integrated structural health monitoring (SHM) and technologies to accelerate structural certification. Since this focus area covers a broad area of interests, specific topics and subtopics are chosen to enhance and or fill gaps in the space and exploration technology development programs as well as to complement other mission directorate structures and materials needs."
,Focus Area 16,Ground & Launch Processing,"Ground processing technology development prepares the agency to test, process and launch the next generation of rockets and spacecraft in support of NASA's exploration objectives by developing the necessary ground systems, infrastructure and operational approaches.This topic seeks innovative concepts and solutions for both addressing long-term ground processing and test complex operational challenges and driving down the cost of government and commercial access to space. Technology infusion and optimization of existing and future operational programs, while concurrently maintaining continued operations, are paramount for cost effectiveness, safety assurance, and supportability.A key aspect of NASA's approach to long term sustainability and affordability is to make test, processing and launch infrastructure available to commercial and other government entities, thereby distributing the fixed cost burden among multiple users and reducing the cost of access to space for the United States.Unlike previous work focusing on a single kind of launch vehicle such as the Saturn V rocket or the Space Shuttle, NASA is preparing common infrastructure to support several different kinds of spacecraft and rockets that are in development. Products and systems devised at a NASA center could be used at other launch sites on earth and eventually on other planets or moons.Specific emphasis to substantially reduce the costs and improve safety/reliability of NASA's test and launch operations includes development of ground test and launch environment technology components, system level ground test systems for advanced propulsion, autonomous control technologies for fault detection, isolation, and recovery, including autonomous propellant management, and advanced instrumentation technologies including Intelligent wireless sensor systems."
,Focus Area 17,Thermal Management Systems,"From the smallest satellite to the most complicated human rated spacecraft, thermal is seen as an enabling function to a vehicle. Temperatures must be maintained within design limits, whether those be cryogenic systems for science instruments, or comfortable shirt sleeve operations temperatures for crew missions. As missions evolve and waste energy rejection becomes more of a demand, NASA seeks components for both active and passive thermal systems. Such components complete the thermal cycle which includes waste energy acquisition, transport, rejection/storage, and insulation. The intended goal for any advanced thermal development is to enable new mission concepts while maintaining minimal impact to thermal system mass, volume, and power to maintain a spacecraft at specific temperature limits."
,Focus Area 18,Air Vehicle Technology,"This focus area includes tools and technologies that contribute to both the Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP) and the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP) encompassing technologies in all six Strategic Thrusts within the NASA Aeronautics Mission Directorate (ARMD). AAVP studies, evaluates and develops technologies and capabilities for new aircraft systems, and also explores far-future concepts that hold promise for revolutionary air-travel improvements. Innovative AAVP design concepts for advanced vehicles integrate technologies focus on fuel burn, noise, emissions and intrinsic safety. The goal: to enable new aircraft to fly safer, faster, cleaner, quieter, and use fuel far more efficiently. Partnering with industry, academia, and other government agencies, AAVP pursues mutually beneficial collaborations to leverage opportunities for effective technology transition. TACP encourages revolutionary concepts, creates the environment for researchers to experiment with new ideas, performs ground and small-scale flight tests, and drives rapid turnover into potential future concepts to enable aviation transformation. Research is organized to aggressively engage both the traditional aeronautics community and non-traditional partners. Although TACP focuses on sharply focused studies, the program provides flexibility for innovators to assess new-technology feasibility and provide the knowledge base for radical aeronautics advances.in noise reduction technology."
,Focus Area 19,Integrated Flight Systems,This focus area includes technologies that contribute to the Integrated Aviation Systems Program's (IASP) objectives to demonstrate integrated concepts and technologies to a maturity level sufficient to reduce risk of implementation for stakeholders in the aviation community through the rigorous execution of highly complex flight tests and related experiments.
,Focus Area 20,Airspace Operations and Safety,"This focus area includes technologies addressing both the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP), and NASA's ARMD Strategic Thrusts 1, 5, and 6. AOSP is targeting system-wide operational benefits of high impact for NextGen and beyond, both in the areas of airspace operations and safety management. The SBIR Airspace Operations and Safety Topic is focused on research and technology development for enabling a modernized air transportation system that will achieve much greater capacity and operational efficiency while maintaining or improving safety and other performance measures. This will include the integration of new types of vehicles such as unmanned vehicles, advanced subsonic aircraft, supersonic or commercial space vehicles; new types of business models or operations (i.e., urban air mobility); and new architectures or services for enabling these operations within the NAS."
,Focus Area 21,Small Spacecraft Technologies,"Small spacecraft can accomplish commercial, science and exploration missions in unique and more affordable ways than can large conventional spacecraft. Small spacecraft are typically defined as those weighing 180 kg or less, and often designed for “containerized” deployment – e.g. CubeSats. NASA seeks small spacecraft technical innovations to rival the capabilities of their larger more expensive counterparts, while also striving to make them cheaper and quicker to build, easier to launch and operate. Previously limited to low Earth orbit, NASA also seeks improvements for their long-term use in cislunar space for lunar exploration, as lunar communications and navigation infrastructure, and to explore Mars and other deep space destinations. For deep space missions, improvements are needed in: long-range high-bandwidth radios packaged for small spacecraft; creation of and use of novel navigation devices and navigation references for use well beyond Earth; improved power and thermal management technologies; and subsystems tolerant of radiation environment in deep space. Propulsion technologies are sought for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), lunar orbit insertion and maintenance, including transfer stages that host small spacecraft, return-to-Earth and Earth entry and descent mechanisms. Cooperatively operating ensembles and large swarms of small spacecraft require technical innovations that reduce small spacecraft delivery time and operations costs while increasing production, availability and reliability. Commercially available “stock” optics are needed in place of expensive, long-lead custom designs. Advancements are needed in reliable low-cost manufacturability, including modular and wirelessly interconnected subsystems, advancements in systems engineering, verification and test. Intelligent autonomous operations algorithms, spatial sensors and processors needed to interoperate in groups and to operate at long distances to relieve human-in-the-loop operations. NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology Program will consider promising SBIR technologies for spaceflight demonstration missions and seeks partnerships to accelerate spaceflight testing and commercial infusion. Some of the features that are desirable for small spacecraft technologies across all system areas are the following:  Simple design.High reliability.Tolerant of extreme thermal and/or radiation environments.Low cost or short time to develop.Low cost to procure flight hardware when technology is mature.Small system volume or low mass.Low power consumption in operation.Suitable for rideshare launch opportunities or storage in habitable volumes (minimum hazards).Able to be stored in space for several years prior to use.High performance relative to existing system technology.The following references discuss some of NASA's small spacecraft technology activities:www.nasa.gov/smallsats https://www.nasa.gov/smallsat-instituteAnother useful reference is the Small Spacecraft Technology State of the Art Report at:https://sst-soa.arc.nasa.gov"
,Focus Area 22,Low Earth Orbit Platform Utilization and Microgravity Research,"The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) provides mission critical space exploration services to both NASA customers and to other partners within the U.S. and throughout the world: operating the International Space Station (ISS); ensuring safe and reliable access to space; maintaining secure and dependable communications between platforms across the solar system; and ensuring the health and safety of astronauts. Additionally, the HEOMD is chartered with the development of the core transportation elements, key systems, and enabling technologies required for beyond-Low Earth Orbit (LEO) human exploration that will provide the foundation for the next half-century of American leadership in space exploration.

,Focus Area 23,Digital Transformation for Aerospace,"Digital Transformation is the strategic transformation of an organization's processes and capabilities, driven and enabled by rapidly advancing and converging digital technologies, to dramatically enhance the organization's performance and efficiency. These advancing digital technologies include cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain, mobile access, Internet of Things (IoT), agile software development and processes, social media, and others. Their convergence is producing major transformations across industries - media and entertainment, retail, advertising, software, publishing, health care, travel, transportation, etc. Through digital transformation, organizations seek to gain or retain their competitive edge by becoming more aware of and responsive to both customer and employee interests, more agile in testing and implementing new approaches, and more innovative and prescient in pioneering the next wave of products and services. Central to the success digital transformation is the pervasive (and often transparent) gathering of data about everything that impacts success--the organization's processes, activities, competencies, products and services, customers, partners, industry, and so on. Organizations can mine this massive, complex, and often unstructured data to develop accurate insights into how to improve organizational performance and efficiency. An organization may also use this data to train machine learning algorithms to automate processes, provide recommendations, or enhance customer experiences. The digital technologies listed above are essential to generate, collect, transform, mine, analyze, and utilize this data across the enterprise. NASA is undertaking a digital transformation journey to enhance mission success and impact. NASA intends to leverage digital transformation to:Boost innovation and creation of new knowledge.Reduce cost and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of processes for everything from human resources to science and engineering.Reduce the time to develop and mature new technologies.Facilitate efficient design and development of advanced aerospace vehicles.Ensure that increasingly complex missions are both cost-efficient and safe.Achieve data-driven insights and decisions.Increase autonomy in aerospace vehicles and ground facilities.Engage an enthusiastic and talented workforce.Maintain worldwide leadership in aerospace.Through this focus area, NASA is seeking to help explore and develop technologies that may be critical to the Agency's successful digital transformation. Specific innovations being sought in this solicitation are:Blockchain for aerospace applications, including its use in distributed space missions and in model-based systems engineering.Intelligent digital assistants that reduce the cognitive workload of NASA personnel, from scientists and engineers to business and administrative staff.Details about these applications of digital transformation technologies are in the respective subtopic descriptions."
,Focus Area 24,Dust Mitigation,"A number of space exploration missions to planetary bodies have noted significant deleterious effects due to fine particulates. This fine dust can foul mechanisms, alter thermal properties, and obscure optical systems. It can abrade textiles and scratch surfaces. With near term goals to return to the Moon, lunar dust is of particular concern. It has the potential to negatively affect every lunar architecture system. The goal of this focus area is to develop dust mitigation technologies that can be incorporated into space exploration systems.All planetary exploration missions require a proactive strategy to lessen the effects of dust. Dust mitigation approaches include active and passive technologies and informed engineering design. Much of the dust can be mitigated through operational constraints and architecture consideration early on in the system design lifecycle. However, passive and active technologies and novel engineering design are also needed to form a complete dust mitigation strategy. Proposed research may focus on development of new technologies, but there is particular interest in technologies that are approaching readiness for space environment testing.Exploration systems require dust mitigation technologies within the following capability areas:Optical Systems – Viewports, camera lenses, solar panels, space suit visors, mass spectrometers, other sensitive optical instruments;Thermal Surfaces – Thermal radiators, thermal painted surfaces, thermal connections;Fabrics – Space suit fabrics, soft wall habitats, mechanism covers;Mechanisms – Linear actuators, bearings, rotary joints, hinges, quick disconnects, valves, linkages;Seals and Soft Goods – Space suit interfaces, hatches, connectors, hoses; and,Gaseous Filtration – Atmosphere revitalization and ISRU processes.Specific dust mitigation innovations being sought in this solicitation will be outlined in the subtopic descriptions."

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications,"NASA's communications capability is based on the premise that communications shall enable and not constrain missions. Communications must be robust to support the numerous missions for space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Technologies such as optical communications, RF including antennas and ground based Earth stations, surface networks, access links, reprogrammable communications systems, advanced antenna technology, transmit array concepts and communications in support of launch services including space based assets are very important to the future of exploration and science activities of the Agency. Emphasis is placed on size, weight and power improvements. Even greater emphasis is placed on these attributes as small satellites (e.g., micro and nano satellite) technology matures. Innovative solutions centered on operational issues are needed in all of the aforementioned areas. Communication technologies enabling acquisition of range safety data from sensitive instruments is imperative. All technologies developed under this topic area to be aligned with the Architecture Definition Document and technical direction as established by the NASA Office of Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN).

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportation,"
 Achieving space flight remains a challenging enterprise. It is an undertaking of great complexity, requiring numerous technological and engineering disciplines and a high level of organizational skill. Overcoming Earth's gravity to achieve orbit demands collections of quality data to maintain the security required of the range. The harsh environment of space puts tight constraints on the equipment needed to perform the necessary functions. Not only is there a concern for safety but the 2004 Space Transportation Policy directive states that the U.S. should maintain robust transportation capabilities to assure access to space. This crosscutting SBIR Topic seeks to enable commercial solutions for U.S. space transportation systems providing significant reductions in cost, and increases in reliability, flight-rate, and frequency of access to space. The goal is a breakthrough in cost and reliability for a wide range of payload sizes and types (including passenger transportation) supporting future orbital flight that can be demonstrated on interim suborbital vehicles. The vision is a competitive marketplace with multiple commercial providers of highly reusable space transportation systems and services with aircraft-like operations, high-flight rates, and short turnaround times (days-to-hours, rather than months). Lower cost and reliable space access will provide significant benefits to civil space (human and robotic exploration beyond Earth as well as Earth science), to commercial industry, to educational institutions, for support to the International Space Station National Laboratory, and to national security. While other strategies can support frequent, low-cost and reliable space access, this topic focuses on the technologies that dramatically alter reusability, reliability and operability of next generation space access systems.","O2.01Secondary/Auxiliary Payload-to-Launch Vehicle Interface Technologies; O2.02Propulsion Technologies; O2.03Spaceport Enhancement & Improvements; O2.04Advanced Composite Tank and Materials Technologies; O2.05Reusable, Reliable, Low Cost Thermal Protection Systems",O2.01; O2.02; O2.03; O2.04; O2.05,"Secondary/Auxiliary Payload-to-Launch Vehicle Interface Technologies; Propulsion Technologies; Spaceport Enhancement & Improvements; Advanced Composite Tank and Materials Technologies; Reusable, Reliable, Low Cost Thermal Protection Systems"
Space Operations,Topic O3 Processing and Operations,"
The Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) is responsible for providing mission critical space exploration services to both NASA customers and to other partners within the U.S. and throughout the world: from flying out the Space Shuttle, to assembling and operating the International Space Station; ensuring safe and reliable access to space; maintaining secure and dependable communications between platforms across the solar system; and ensuring the health and safety of our Nation's astronauts. Each of the activities includes both ground-based and in-flight processing and operations tasks. Support that ensures these tasks are accomplished efficiently and accurately enables successful missions and healthy crews.

This topic area, while focused on operational space flight activities, is broad in scope. NASA is seeking technologies that range from addressing how better to improve and lower costs related to ground and flight assets to how best maximize and extend the life of the International Space Station. A typical approach would include: 


Phase I: Research to identify and evaluate candidate technology applications to demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path towards a hardware/software demonstration. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are desirable. 
Phase II: Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under simulated flight conditions.

Space Operations,Topic O4 Navigation,"
 NASA is seeking innovative research in the areas of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) that have relevance to Space Communications and Navigation programs and goals, as described at http://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov. NASA's Space Communication and Navigation Office considers the three elements of PNT to represent distinct, constituent capabilities: (1) positioning, by which we mean accurate and precise determination of an asset's location and orientation referenced to a coordinate system; (2) navigation, by which we mean determining an asset's current and/or desired absolute or relative position and velocity state, and applying corrections to course, orientation, and velocity to attain achieve the desired state; and (3) timing, by which we mean an asset's acquiring from a standard, maintaining within user-defined parameters, and transferring where required, an accurate and precise representation of time. This year, NASA seeks PNT technologies in three focus areas: metric tracking of launch vehicles, on-orbit PNT sensors and components, and flight dynamics technologies and software. Some of the subtopics in this topic could result in products that may be included in a future small satellite flight opportunity. Please see the SMD Topic S4 for more details as to the requirements for flight opportunities.","O4.01Metric Tracking of Launch Vehicles; O4.02On-Orbit PNT (Positioning, Navigation, and Timing) Sensors and Components; O4.03Flight Dynamics Software and Technologies",O4.01; O4.02; O4.03,"Metric Tracking of Launch Vehicles; On-Orbit PNT (Positioning, Navigation, and Timing) Sensors and Components; Flight Dynamics Software and Technologies"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety,"
 The Aviation Safety Program focuses on the Nation's future aviation safety challenges. This vigilance for safety must continue in order to meet the projected increases in air traffic capacity and realize the new capabilities envisioned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The Aviation Safety Program will conduct research to improve the intrinsic safety attributes of legacy and future aircraft and their operations in the Next Generation Air Transportation system, and to eliminate safety-related technology barriers. 

 The program has focused on furthering our understanding of the fundamental questions that need to be addressed for mid- and long-term improvements to aviation safety through engineering analysis and technology design. The results at the fundamental level will be integrated at the discipline and multi-discipline levels to ultimately yield system-level integrated capabilities, methods, and tools for analysis, optimization, prediction, and design that will enable improved safety for a range of operating concepts, vehicle classes, and crew configurations. The Aviation Safety Program is divided into four complementary and highly interlinked projects: 

   The Aircraft Aging and Durability Project performs foundational research in aging science that will ultimately yield multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization capabilities that will enable system-level integrated methods for the detection, prediction, and mitigation/management of aging-related hazards for future civilian and military aircraft. 
 The Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Project develops tools, methods, principles, guidelines, and technologies for revolutionary flight deck systems that enable transformations toward safer operations. 
 The Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control Project conducts research to advance the state of aircraft flight control to provide onboard control resilience for ensuring safe flight in the presence of adverse conditions. 
 The Integrated Vehicle Health Management Project develops validated tools, technologies and techniques for automated detection, diagnosis and prognosis that enable mitigation of adverse events during flight. 


 Examples areas of program interest include research directed at fundamental knowledge of legacy and future aircraft structures and systems durability; on-board detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction and mitigation of system failures and faults; monitoring vehicle and airspace issues to identify problems before they become accidents; understanding aircraft dynamics of current and future vehicles in damaged and upset conditions; robust control systems; aircraft guidance for emergency operation; airborne sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of external hazards to aircraft (e.g., in-flight icing conditions, wake vortices); design of robust collaborative work environments; effective and robust human-automation systems; and information management for effective decision making. In addition, general methods for dramatically advancing the community's capability for thorough, cost-effective and time-effective verification and validation of safety-critical systems are of interest to the program as a whole, including rigorous methods for validating design requirements for vehicles and aviation operations, verifying integrated and distributed aircraft and air traffic systems (including assumptions about human performance), and verifying software-intensive systems. 

 NASA seeks highly innovative proposals that will complement its work in science and technologies that build upon and advance the Agency's unique safety-related research capabilities vital to aviation safety.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics,"
 The Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) encompasses the principles of flight in any atmosphere, and at any speed. The program develops focused technological capabilities, starting with the most basic knowledge of underlying phenomena through validation and verification of advanced concepts and technologies at the component and systems level. Physics-based, multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization (MDAO) tools will be developed that make it possible to evaluate radically new vehicle designs and to assess, with known uncertainties, the potential impact of innovative technologies and concepts on a vehicle's overall performance. The development of advanced component technologies will realize revolutionary improvements in noise, emissions, and performance. The program also supports NASA's human and robotic exploration missions by advancing knowledge in aeronautical areas critical to planetary Entry, Descent, and Landing. NASA has defined a four-level approach to technology development: conduct foundational research to further our fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and our ability model that physics; leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions; integrate methods and technologies to develop multi-disciplinary solutions; and solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. 

 Structurally, the FAP is composed of four projects: hypersonic flight, supersonic flight, subsonic fixed-wing aircraft and subsonic rotary-wing aircraft. 

 Hypersonics (HYP) 
   Fundamental research in all disciplines to enable very-high speed flight (for airbreathing launch vehicles) and Entry, Descent and Landing into planetary atmospheres 
 High-temperature materials, thermal protection systems (single and multi-use), airbreathing propulsion, aero-thermodynamics, multi-disciplinary analysis and design, guidance, navigation, and control GN&C, advanced experimental capabilities, and supersonic decelerator technologies 


 Supersonics (SUP)
   Eliminate environmental and performance barriers that prevent practical supersonic vehicles (cruise efficiency, noise and emissions, vehicle integration and control) 


 Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) 
   Develop revolutionary technologies and aircraft concepts with highly improved performance while satisfying strict noise and emission constraints 
 Focus on enabling technologies: acoustics predictions, propulsion / combustion, system integration, high-lift concepts, lightweight and strong materials, GNC 


 Subsonic Rotary Wing (SRW) 
   Improve civil potential of rotary wing vehicles (vs. fixed wing) while maintaining their unique benefits 
 Key advances in multiple areas through innovation in materials, aeromechanics, flow control, propulsion 


 Each project addresses specific discipline, multi-discipline, sub-system and system level technology issues relevant to that flight regime. A key aspect of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program is that many technical issues are common across multiple flight regimes and may be best resolved in an integrated coordinated manner. As such, the FAP subtopics are organized by discipline, not by flight regime, with a special subtopic for rotary-wing issues.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Airspace Systems,"
 NASA's Airspace Systems Program (ASP) is investing in the development, validation and transfer of advanced innovative concepts, technologies and procedures to support the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). This investment includes partnerships with other government agencies represented in the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and joint activities with the U.S. aeronautics industry and academia. As such, ASP will develop and demonstrate future concepts, capabilities, and technologies that will enable major increases in air traffic management effectiveness, flexibility, and efficiency, while maintaining safety, to meet capacity and mobility requirements of NextGen. ASP integrates the two projects NextGen Concepts and Technology Development (CTD) and NextGen Systems Analysis Integration and Evaluation (SAIE), to directly address the fundamental research needs of NextGen vision in partnership with the member agencies of the JPDO. The CTD develops and explores fundamental concepts, algorithms, and air-borne and ground-based technologies to increase capacity and throughput of the national airspace system, to address demand-capacity imbalances, and achieve high efficiency in the use of resources such as airports, en route and terminal airspace. The SAIE Project is responsible for facilitating the Research and Development maturation of integrated concepts through evaluation in relevant environments, providing integrated solutions, characterizing airspace system problem spaces, defining innovative approaches, and assessing the potential system impacts and design ramifications of the program's portfolio. Together, the projects will also focus NASA's technical expertise and world-class facilities to address the question of where, when, how and the extent to which automation can be applied to moving air traffic safely and efficiently through the NAS and technologies that address optimal allocation of ground and air technologies necessary for NextGen. Additionally, the roles and responsibilities of humans and automation influence in the ATM will be addressed by both projects. Key objectives of NASA's AS Program are to: 

   Improve mobility, capacity, efficiency and access of the airspace system; 
 Improve collaboration, predictability, and flexibility for the airspace users;

Aeronautics Research,Topic A4 Aeronautics Test Technologies,"
 The Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) ensures the long term availability and health of NASA's major wind tunnels/ground test facilities and flight operations/test infrastructure that support NASA, DoD and U.S. industry research and development (R&D) and test and evaluation (T&E) requirements. Furthermore, ATP provides rate stability to the aforementioned user community. The ATP facilities are located at four NASA Centers made up of the Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center and Langley Research Center. Classes of facilities within the ATP include low speed, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, air-breathing engine test facilities, the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR), support and test bed aircraft, and the simulation and loads laboratories. A key component of ensuring a test facility's long term viability is to implement and continually improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of that facility's operations along with developing new technologies to address the nation's future aerospace challenges. To operate a facility in this manner requires the use of state-of-the-art test technologies and test techniques, creative facility performance capability enhancements, and novel means of acquiring test data. NASA is soliciting proposals in the areas of instrumentation, test measurement technology, test techniques and facility development that apply to the ATP facilities to help in achieving the ATP goals of sustaining and improving our test capabilities. Proposals that describe products or processes that are transportable across multiple facility classes are of special interest. The proposals will also be assessed for their ability to develop products that can be implemented across government-owned, industry and academic institution test facilities.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A5 Integrated System Research Project  (ISRP),"
 The Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP), a new program effort that began in FY10, will conduct research at an integrated system-level on promising concepts and technologies and explore, assess or demonstrate their benefits in a relevant environment. The integrated system-level research in this program will be coordinated with on-going long-term, foundational research within the three other research programs, as well as efforts within other Federal Government agencies. As the NextGen evolves to meet the projected growth in demand for air transportation, researchers must address the national challenges of mobility, capacity, safety, and energy and the environment in order to meet the expected growth in air traffic. In particular, the environmental impacts of noise and emissions are a growing concern and could limit the ability of the system to accommodate growth. ISRP will explore and assess new vehicle concepts and enabling technologies through system-level experimentation to simultaneously reduce fuel burn, noise and emissions, and will focus specifically on maturing and integrating technologies in major vehicle systems/subsystems for accelerated transition to practical application. 
ISRP is comprised of one project - the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project.

Science,"Topic S1 Sensors, Detectors and Instruments","NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/astrophysics), Earth Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/earth-science), Heliophysics (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/heliophysics), and Planetary Science (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/planetary-science). A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2010 program year, we are actively encouraging proposal submissions for subtopic S1.10 that solicits technology for geodetic instruments and instruments to enable global navigation and very long baseline interferometry. A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development components that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration.

Science,Topic S2 Advanced Telescope Systems,"
 The NASA Science Missions Directorate seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4-degrees Kelvin. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective.

Science,Topic S3 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"
 The Science Mission Directorate will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our Solar System and beyond. SMD's future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points, or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost, that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. 

 A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems like: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs. Innovations for 2010 are sought in the areas of: 

   Command and Data Handling, and Instrument Electronics 
 Thermal Control Systems 
 Power Generation and Conversion 
 Propulsion Systems

Science,Topic S4 Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies,"
 This subtopic is targeted at the development of technologies and systems, which can enable the realization of small spacecraft science missions. While small spacecraft have the benefit of reduced launch costs by virtue of their lower mass, they may be currently limited in performance and their capacity to provide on-orbit resources to payload and instrument systems. With the incorporation of smaller bus technologies, launch costs, as well as total life cycle costs, can continue to be reduced, while still achieving and expanding NASA's mission objectives. 

 The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies category is focused on the identification and development of specific key spacecraft technologies primarily in the areas of integrated avionics, attitude determination and control including de-orbit technologies, and spacecraft power generation and management. The primary thrust of this topic is directed at reducing the footprint and resources that these bus subsystems require (size, weight, and power), allowing more of these critical resources to be shifted to payload and instrument systems, and to further reduce the overall launch mass and volume requirements for small spacecraft. 

 Note that related topics of interest to S4 Low-cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies may be found in other areas of the solicitation: S3.01 Command, Data Handling and Electronics; S3.03 Power Generation and Conversion; and S3.05 Power Management and Storage.

Science,Topic S6 Information Technologies,"
NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our earth, our solar system and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply this data to create knowledge. In particular, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These are tools that allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, and provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA science information be used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public.",S6.01Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation; S6.02Earth Science Applied Research and Decision Support; S6.03Algorithms for Science Data Processing and Analysis; S6.04Science Data Discovery in Extremely Large Data Environments; S6.05Software Engineering Tools for Scientific Models,S6.01; S6.02; S6.03; S6.04; S6.05,Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation; Earth Science Applied Research and Decision Support; Algorithms for Science Data Processing and Analysis; Science Data Discovery in Extremely Large Data Environments; Software Engineering Tools for Scientific Models
Exploration Systems,Topic X1 In Situ Resource Utilization,"
 The purpose of In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is to harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration to create products and services, which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration. the ability to make propellants, life support consumables, fuel cell reagents, and radiation shielding can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. The ability to modify the landscape for safer landing and transfer of payloads, creation of habitat and power infrastructure, and extraction of resources for construction, power, and in-situ manufacturing can also enable long-term, sustainable exploration of the solar system. Since ISRU can be performed wherever resources may exist, both natural and discarded, ISRU systems will need to operate in a variety of environments and gravitations. Also, because ISRU systems and operations have never been demonstrated before in missions, it is important that ISRU concepts and technologies be evaluated under relevant conditions (gravity, environment, and vacuum) as well as anchored through modeling to regolith/soil and environmental conditions. While the discipline of ISRU can encompass a large variety of different concept areas, resources, and products, the ISRU Topic has been divided into two subtopics dealing with the fundamental difference in technologies associated with solid in-situ material handling and processing versus gaseous and gaseous/solid processing. An attempt was made to minimize the potential overlap in technologies and processes between the two subtopics.","X1.01Regolith/Soil Transfer, Handling, & Processing of Extraterrestrial Material; X1.02Gas, Liquid, and Solid Processing to Produce Oxygen and Fuels from In-Situ Resources",X1.01; X1.02,"Regolith/Soil Transfer, Handling, & Processing of Extraterrestrial Material; Gas, Liquid, and Solid Processing to Produce Oxygen and Fuels from In-Situ Resources"

Exploration Systems,Topic X5 Lightweight Spacecraft Materials and Structures,"
 The SBIR topic area of Lightweight Spacecraft Materials and Structures centers on developing lightweight expandable structures, advanced manufacturing technologies for metallic and composite materials, structural sensoring techniques, in-situ non-destructive evaluation systems, and low-temperature mechanisms. Applications are expected to include space exploration vehicles including launch vehicles, crewed vehicles, and surface and habitat systems.

 The area of expandable structures solicits innovative concepts to support the development of lightweight-structure technologies that would be viable solutions to high packaging efficiency and increasing the usable primary pressurized volume in habitats, airlocks, and other crewed vessels. Technologies are needed to minimize launch mass, size and costs, while maintaining the required structural performance for loads and environments. 

 Advanced fabrication and manufacturing of lightweight structures focuses on the development of metallic alloys and hybrid materials, processing and fabrication technologies related to near-net shape forming. The goal is to reduce structural weight, assembly steps, and minimize welds, resulting in increased reliability and reduced cost. Research should evaluate material compatibility with forming methods and establish fundamental microstructure/processing/property correlations to guide full-scale fabrication. Laboratory scale test methods are needed to accurately simulate the deformation modes experienced in large-scale manufacturing. 

 Polymer matrix composite (PMC) materials have been identified as a critical need for launch and in-space vehicles. The reduction of structural mass translates directly to additional performance, increased payload mass and reduced cost. PMC materials are also critical for other structures, such as cryogenic propellant tanks. Advances in PMC materials, automated manufacturing processes, non-autoclave curing methods, advances in damage-tolerant/repairable structures, and PMC materials with high resistance to microcracking at cryogenic temperatures are sought. The objective is to advance technology readiness levels of PMC materials and manufacturing for launch vehicle and in-space applications resulting in structures having affordable, reliable, and predictable performance.

 Practical modular structural sensor systems and NDE technologies are sought for spaceflight missions. Smart, lightweight, low-volume, and stand-alone sensor systems should reduce the complexities of standard wires and connectors and enable sensing in locations not normally accessible. NDE sensor system technology should include modular, low-volume systems and have the ability to perform inspections with minimal human interaction. Systems need to provide the location and extent of damage with the minimal data transfer between the flight system and Earth. Mission application areas include space transportation vehicles, pressure vessels, ISS modules, inflatable structures, EVA suits, MMOD shields, and thermal protection structures. 

 Low-temperature mechanism technology is being developed for reliable and efficient operation of mechanisms in low temperature environments at -230°C and sustained performance thru temperature cycles of -230°C to +120°C. The goal is to enhance operation of mechanized parts by lowering the operating temperature of the component, and by improving performance at cold conditions under vacuum over the life of the mechanism. The targeted application of the technology is to provide for operation of motors and drive systems, lubricated mechanisms, and actuators of rovers, mobility systems, and robotic mechanisms.

Exploration Systems,"Topic X9 Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) Technology","
 The Thermal Protection System (TPS) protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. In general, there are two classes of TPS: reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry with a significant amount of energy being re-radiated from the heated surface and the remainder conducted into the TPS material. Typically, a surface coating with high emissivity (to maximize the amount of energy re-radiated) and with low surface catalycity (to minimize convective heating by suppressing surface recombination of dissociated boundary layer species) is employed. The primary insulation has low thermal conductivity to minimize the mass of material required to insulate the primary structure. Ablative TPS materials, in contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing organic resins as binders. When heated, the resin pyrolyzes producing gaseous products that are heated as they percolate toward the surface thus transferring some energy from the solid to the gas. Additionally, the injection of the pyrolysis gases into the boundary layer alters the boundary layer properties resulting in reduced convective heating. However, the gases may undergo chemical reactions with the boundary layer gases that could return heat to the surface. Furthermore, chemical reactions between the surface material and boundary layer species can result in consumption of the surface material leading to surface recession. Those reactions can be endothermic (vaporization, sublimation) or exothermic (oxidation) and will have an important impact on net energy to the surface. Clearly, in comparison to reusable TPS materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. NASA has successfully tackled the complexity of thermal protection systems for numerous missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system in the past; the knowledge gained has been invaluable but incomplete. Future missions will be more demanding. Better performing ablative TPS than currently available is needed to satisfy requirements of the most severe missions, e.g., Mars Landing with 8 km/s entry and Mars Sample Return with 12-15 km/s Earth entry. Beyond the improvement needed in ablative TPS materials, more demanding future missions such as large payload missions to Mars will require novel entry system designs that consider different vehicle shapes, deployable or inflatable configurations and integrated approaches of TPS materials with the entry system sub-structure.",X9.01Ablative Thermal Protection Systems; X9.02Advanced Integrated Hypersonic Entry Systems,X9.01; X9.02,Ablative Thermal Protection Systems; Advanced Integrated Hypersonic Entry Systems
Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer,"

Exploration Systems,Topic X11 Exploration Crew Health Capabilities,"
 Human space flight is associated with losses in muscle strength, bone mineral density and aerobic capacity. Crewmembers returning from the International Space Station (ISS) can lose as much as 10-20% of their strength in weight bearing and postural muscles. Likewise, bone mineral density is decreased at a rate of ~1% per month. During future exploration missions such physiological decrements represent the potential for a significant loss of human performance which could lead to mission failure and/or a threat to crewmember health and safety. The ability to perform motion capture and kinematic analysis on-orbit to understand the similarities and differences of exercising in microgravity, estimate the physical cost of exploration tasks, monitor crew health and fitness, and to provide effective hardware for exercise countermeasures use will be valuable in supporting safe and successful space exploration.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications and Navigation,"

 NASA's communications capability is based on the premise that communications shall enable and not constrain missions. Communications must be robust to support the numerous missions for space science, Earth science and exploration of the universe. Technologies such as optical communications, RF including antennas and ground based Earth stations, surface networks, access links, navigation and timing, reprogrammable communications systems, communications systems for EVAs, advanced antenna technology, transmit array concepts and communications in support of launch services including space based assets are very important to the future of  exploration and science activities of the Agency. Emphasis is placed on size, weight and power improvements. Even greater emphasis is placed on these attributes as smaller spacecraft (eg., micro and nano satellite) technology matures. Innovative solutions centered around operational issues associated with the communications capability are needed. Communications that enable the range safety data from sensitive instruments is imperative. These technologies are to be aligned with the Space Communications and Navigation Architecture as being developed by the Agency. A typical approach for flight hardware would include: Phase 1 - Research should identify and evaluate candidate telecommunications technology applications to demonstrate the technical feasibility and show a path towards a hardware/ software demonstration. Plan a demonstration to validate the technologies/tools/processes. Bench or lab-level demonstrations showing concept viability is encouraged. Commercial applicability should be addressed. Phase 2 - Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under simulated flight conditions. Additionally, a path should be outlined that shows how the technology could be commercialized or further developed into space-worthy systems defining interfaces (both on the spacecraft and to candidate ground segments). When applicable, researchers should deliver a demonstration unit for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.","O1.01Coding, Modulation, and Compression; O1.02Precision Spacecraft and Lunar/Planetary Surface Navigation and Tracking; O1.03Communication for Space-Based Range; O1.04Antenna Technology; O1.05Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems; O1.06Miniaturized Digital EVA Radio; O1.07Transformational Communications Technology; O1.08Long Range Optical Telecommunications; O1.09Long Range Space  RF Telecommunications; O1.10Surface Networks and Orbit Access Links; O1.11Software for Space Communications Infrastructure Operations",O1.01; O1.02; O1.03; O1.04; O1.05; O1.06; O1.07; O1.08; O1.09; O1.10; O1.11,"Coding, Modulation, and Compression; Precision Spacecraft and Lunar/Planetary Surface Navigation and Tracking; Communication for Space-Based Range; Antenna Technology; Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems; Miniaturized Digital EVA Radio; Transformational Communications Technology; Long Range Optical Telecommunications; Long Range Space  RF Telecommunications; Surface Networks and Orbit Access Links; Software for Space Communications Infrastructure Operations"

Aeronautics Research,Topic A1 Aviation Safety,"
 The Aviation Safety Program focuses on the Nation's aviation safety challenges of the future. This vigilance for safety must continue in order to meet the projected increases in air traffic capacity and realize the new capabilities envisioned for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). The Aviation Safety Program will conduct research to improve the intrinsic safety attributes of future aircraft and to eliminate safety-related technology barriers. The program is focusing on a foundational approach to advancing knowledge in core disciplines (e.g., fluid dynamics, computational methods, material science), which in turn is used to build integrated multidisciplinary system-level models, tools, and technologies. 

 This approach focuses on furthering our understanding of the underlying physics, chemistry, materials, etc., of aeronautics phenomena when broken down to these most basic elements. The results at the fundamental level will be integrated at the discipline and multi-discipline levels to ultimately yield system-level integrated capabilities, methods, and tools for analysis, optimization, prediction, and design that will enable improved safety for a range of missions, vehicle classes, and crew configurations. 

 Example areas of program interest include research directed at the detection, prediction and mitigation/management of aging-related hazards of future civilian and military aircraft; designs of revolutionary adaptive flight decks; in-flight prognosis of aircraft health, preventative and adaptive systems for in-flight operability; informed logistics and maintenance graceful recovery from in-flight failures; software safety assurance and formal verification methods for safety-critical systems; as well as system-level integrated resilient control technologies.

Aeronautics Research,Topic A2 Fundamental Aeronautics,"NASA is the Nation's leading government organization for civil aeronautical research. Within NASA's overall strategic plan, Aeronautics has the goal to ""Advance knowledge in the fundamental disciplines of aeronautics and develop technologies for safer aircraft and higher capacity airspace systems."" To address this goal, NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is organized into three separate Programs: Fundamental Aeronautics, Aviation Safety, and Airspace Systems. 


 The Fundamental Aeronautics Program encompasses cutting-edge research in traditional aeronautical disciplines, as well as emerging fields with promising application to aeronautics. The overall program is long-term in scope as well as focused and integrated across disciplines. It is implemented through NASA's four research centers: the Ames Research Center, in Mountain View, California; the Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards, California; the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio; and the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. 


 To achieve these objectives NASA has defined a four-level approach to technology development: (1) conduct foundational research to further our fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and our ability model that physics, (2) leverage the foundational research to develop technologies and analytical tools focused on discipline-based solutions, (3) integrate methods and technologies to develop multi-disciplinary solutions, and (4) solve the aeronautics challenges for a broad range of air vehicles with system-level optimization, assessment and technology integration. 


 The Fundamental Aeronautics Program will provide for results yielding the following: 

   Technology innovation and integrated, multidisciplinary analysis tools;
 Rapid evaluation of new concepts and technology;
 Accelerated application of new technology to a wide array of vehicles;
 Reduced environmental impact and increased public benefit of future aircraft through lower emissions, less noise, higher efficiency, and safer operation. 



 Structurally, the program is composed of four projects: hypersonic flight, supersonic flight, subsonic fixed-wing aircraft and subsonic rotary-wing aircraft. Each project, in turn, addresses specific discipline, multi-discipline, sub-system and system level technology issues relevant to that flight regime. However, a key aspect of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program is that many technical issues are common across multiple flight regimes and may be best resolved in an integrated coordinated manner. As such, the Fundamental Aeronautics subtopics are organized by discipline, not by flight regime, with a special subtopic for rotary-wing issues. 


 The full list of Fundamental Aeronautics subtopics are: (1) Materials and Structures for Future Aircraft, (2) Combustion for Aerospace Vehicles, (3) Aero-Acoustics, (4) Aeroelasticity, (5) Aerodynamics, (6) Aerothermodynamics, (7) Flight and Propulsion Control and Dynamics, (8) Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research, (9) Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization, and (10) Rotorcraft. Each of the subsequent subtopic sections will describe the scope, key issues and technical content of the subtopic. It will also include the specific areas of interest spanning the four flight regimes. Individual proposals are not restricted to any one specific technical area or any single part of the full flight regime. They may address any or all areas included in a subtopic and may cover any or all parts of the entire flight regime.","A2.01Materials and Structures for Future Aircraft; A2.02Combustion for Aerospace Vehicles; A2.03Aero-Acoustics; A2.04Aeroelasticity; A2.05Aerodynamics; A2.06Aerothermodynamics; A2.07Flight and Propulsion Control and Dynamics; A2.08Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research; A2.09Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization; A2.10Rotorcraft",A2.01; A2.02; A2.03; A2.04; A2.05; A2.06; A2.07; A2.08; A2.09; A2.10,"Materials and Structures for Future Aircraft; Combustion for Aerospace Vehicles; Aero-Acoustics; Aeroelasticity; Aerodynamics; Aerothermodynamics; Flight and Propulsion Control and Dynamics; Experimental Capabilities and Flight Research; Aircraft Systems Analysis, Design and Optimization; Rotorcraft"
Aeronautics Research,Topic A3 Airspace Systems,"

 NASA's Airspace Systems (AS) Program is investing in the development of innovative concepts and technologies to support the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). NASA is working to develop, validate and transfer advanced concepts, technologies, and procedures through partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other government agencies represented in the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), and in cooperation with the U.S. aeronautics industry and academia. As such, the AS Program will develop and demonstrate future concepts, capabilities, and technologies that will enable major increases in air traffic management effectiveness, flexibility, and efficiency, while maintaining safety, to meet capacity and mobility requirements of the NGATS. The AS Program integrates the two projects, NGATS ATM Airspace and NGATS ATM Airportal, to directly address the fundamental research needs of NGATS vision in partnership with the member agencies of the JPDO. The NGATS ATM Airspace Project develops and explores fundamental concepts and integrated solutions that address the optimal allocation of ground and air automation technologies necessary for NGATS. The Project will focus NASA's technical expertise and world-class facilities to address the question of where, when, how and the extent to which automation can be applied to moving aircraft safely and efficiently through the NAS. The NGATS ATM Airportal Project develops and validates algorithms, concepts, and technologies to increase throughput of the runway complex and achieve high efficiency in the use of airportal resources such as gates, taxiways, runways, and final approach airspace. NASA research in this project will lead to development of solutions that safely integrate surface and terminal area air traffic optimization tools and systems with 4-D trajectory operations. Ultimately, the roles and responsibilities of humans and automation influence in the ATM will be addressed by both projects. Key objectives of NASA's AS Program are to: 

   Improve mobility, capacity, efficiency and access of the airspace system; 
 Improve collaboration, predictability, and flexibility for the airspace users;

Aeronautics Research,Topic A4 Aeronautics Test Technologies,"NASA has implemented the Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) within its Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). The purpose of the ATP is to ensure the long term availability and health of NASA's major wind tunnels/ground test facilities and flight operations/test infrastructure that support NASA, DoD and U.S. industry research and development (R&D) and test and evaluation (T&E) needs. Furthermore, ATP provides rate stability to the aforementioned user community.


 The ATP facilities are located at the NASA Research Centers, including at Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center and Langley Research Center. Classes of facilities within the ATP include low speed wind tunnels, transonic wind tunnels, supersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic wind tunnels, hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities, air-breathing engine test facilities, the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR), support aircraft, test bed aircraft, and the simulation and loads laboratories.


 A key component of ensuring a test facility's long term viability is to implement and continually improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of that facility's operations. To operate a facility in this manner requires the use of state-of-the-art test technologies and test techniques, creative facility performance capability enhancements, and novel means of acquiring test data.


 NASA is soliciting proposals in the areas of instrumentation, test measurement technology, test techniques and facility development that apply to the ATP facilities to help in achieving the ATP goals of sustaining and improving our test capabilities.

Science,"Topic S1 Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments","NASAs Science Mission Directorate (SMD) encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science. A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive, large format detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors which can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. Consequently, the objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. The following subtopics are concomitant with this objective and are organized by technology.

Science,Topic S4 Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies,"The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies Topic focuses on the technologies, subsystems, methodologies, and mission concepts for space missions which lower the over-all cost for scientific exploration. The ""Small"" of spacecraft and missions refer to small spacecraft that have ""wet"" masses below 500 Kg. (micro satellites 10-100kg, nano satellite 1-10kg, pico satellite <1kg), are substantially less expensive, and will require different approaches to solve traditional problems in development, operations and capability. The goal of these low-cost missions is not to replace the major missions, but rather to reduce the risks to, as well as the costs of, future major missions. Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies Missions will be used as test beds for new technologies, provide flight ""heritage"" for new instruments and components. Increasing the number of flight opportunities per year enables missions to be designed and flown during typical graduate and post-doctoral tenures, provide training for a new generation of scientists and engineers. These small spacecraft missions can also accomplish specific scientific investigations that would be too narrow for a major mission but still scientifically important. This topic is divided into two categories of subtopics: Small Spacecraft Technologies and Enablers and Small Spacecraft Build. Small Spacecraft Technologies and Enablers subtopics will lower the barrier to entry for small spacecraft missions by encouraging launch opportunities and creating open design and spacecraft management tools. These subtopics include nanosat launch vehicles and technologies, secondary and tertiary launch technologies, low-cost, rapid spacecraft design and multi-subsystem functionality, and project management, systems engineering and mission assurance tools. The Small Spacecraft Build subtopics, when used together, could create a small spacecraft mission. These subtopics include smart, autonomous command and data handling system, algorithms and data management, advanced avionics, mini-micro thrusters, LOX/hydrocarbon propulsion, and attitude control systems, low-cost assembly, integration, and testing, autonomous multi-mission virtual ground and spacecraft operations. The spacecraft is a modular spacecraft that operate using standard protocols (high speed: Ethernet, SpacewireTM; low speed: RS-422, I2C) and operate at 28V +/- 6V. With this modularity a requirement for the Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies, components can be interchanged from a basic spacecraft design to tailor for specific missions.

By January 2010, the Phase 2 SBIR teams are encouraged to deliver to NASA the hardware to be integrated and ready for launch in July 2010. The Low-Cost Small Spacecraft and Technologies topic is envisioned to launch one satellite per year starting in 2010, kicking off a new team each year. NASA cannot direct SBIR awardees to conform to the provisional schedule outlined above, however when brought together this could create the opportunity for a spacecraft build.

Exploration Systems,Topic X5 Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU),"

 The purpose of In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), or ""living off the land"", is to harness and utilize space resources to create products and services which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration. By producing propellants, life support and fuel cell power consumables, and other items from in situ resources and eliminating the need to launch everything from the Earth, long-term launch and mission costs can be reduced, while potentially increasing science and exploration capabilities and mission safety. In Dec. 2006, NASA unveiled a draft lunar architecture that involves the deployment and buildup of an Outpost at a single location on the Moon that could take advantage of the sunlight and potential water resources at the lunar poles. The architecture also proposed the deployment of an ISRU system to make oxygen and water for life support and Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) by 2023 and potentially for propulsion applications by 2027. Besides consumable production, the ability to excavate and manipulate lunar soil (or regolith) and modify surface features and terrain for crew radiation protection, landing plume mitigation and shielding, habitat and nuclear reactor deployment, and minimizing dust generation during surface activities were also considered as potentially important capabilities for Outpost deployment and operations. The purpose of the following subtopics is to demonstrate and/or develop critical technologies and capabilities to meet Outpost architecture and surface manipulation objectives for near and long term human exploration of the Moon.",X5.01Oxygen Production from Lunar Regolith; X5.02Lunar Regolith Excavation and Material Handling; X5.03Lunar Volatile Resource Prospecting and Collection,X5.01; X5.02; X5.03,Oxygen Production from Lunar Regolith; Lunar Regolith Excavation and Material Handling; Lunar Volatile Resource Prospecting and Collection
Exploration Systems,"Topic X6 Structures, Materials and Mechanisms","
 The SBIR topic area of Structures, Materials and Mechanisms centers on (1) developing lightweight structures and advance materials technologies to support Lunar Landers and Lunar Habitats and (2) low-temperature mechanisms to improve and or allow for reliable and efficient mechanism operation for long duration in the cold polar and crater regions of the lunar surface. Lightweight structures and advanced materials have been identified as a critical need since the reduction of structural mass translates directly to additional up and down mass capability that would facilitate additional logistics capacity and increased science return for all mission phases. The structures and materials program utilizes and combines multi-center R&D teams into focused activities for developing lightweight structure technology for the primary load bearing structure of the pressurized elements of the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) program. The major technology drivers of the lightweight structure technology development are to significantly enhance structural systems for man-rated pressurized structures by (1) lowering mass and/or improving efficient volume for reduced launch costs, (2) improving performance to reduce risk and extend life, and (3) improving manufacturing and processing to reduce costs. This topic area is responsible for mid-level technology research, development, and testing through experimental and/or analytical validation. Three subtopics represent the structures and materials area: (1) Lightweight Structures; (2) Low Temperature Mechanisms; and (3) Advanced Radiation Shielding Materials.  In missions to the lunar surface, permanently shadowed regions of the Moon, e.g., the bottoms of craters in the Polar Regions, are high interest to science and exploration. These areas appear to remain at temperatures of 50 to 80K (-223°C to -193°C). Current surface exploration hardware has demonstrated capability to operate in the range of -115°C to 0°C on Mars. However, the technical challenges of developing and demonstrating hardware that can operate over 100°C colder than current capabilities are significant. The major technology drivers of the low temperature mechanism technology development are to significantly enhance operation of mechanized parts by (1) lowering the operating temperature for the life of the component and (2) improve mechanism performance (torque out put, actuation performance, lubrication state) at the lunar environment conditions of cold and vacuum. The targeted application of the technology is to provide for operation of motors and drive systems, lubricated mechanisms, and actuators of lunar rovers and mobility systems, ISRU machinery, robotic systems mechanisms, and surface operations machinery (i.e., cranes, deployment systems, airlocks), for lunar surface operations. This topic area is responsible for mid-level technology research, development, and testing through experimental and/or analytical validation.

Exploration Systems,Topic X7 Lunar Operations,"
 This call for technology development is in direct support of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Technology Development Program. The purpose of this research is to develop new technologies to support lunar exploration missions, providing systems that interact with humans, handle surface equipment and move people and their payloads at, and away from, a lunar outpost. The objective is to produce new technology that will reduce crew extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and intra-vehicular activity (IVA) workloads, lunar operations and reduce the total mass and volume of equipment and materials required to support missions. The proposals should focus on component technologies to improve the operations of exploration equipment, allowing for less expensive, more productive and less risky missions. This research will focus on technology development for the critical functions that fall into three phases of surface exploration. The first phase of surface exploration will be functions that are needed prior to crew arriving at a site. These precursors may be hours, days, weeks or years ahead of the crew landing on the surface. The second phase of surface exploration will be during a crew's stay at the site. This work will include supporting the crew in IVA and in EVA tasks. The third phase of surface exploration will include long-term maintenance of the facility, as well as supporting activities performed between crews.",X7.01Supportability; X7.02Human Systems Interaction; X7.03Surface Mobility and Transportation; X7.04Surface System Dust Mitigation,X7.01; X7.02; X7.03; X7.04,Supportability; Human Systems Interaction; Surface Mobility and Transportation; Surface System Dust Mitigation
Exploration Systems,Topic X8 Energy Generation and Storage,"
 This topic includes the development of power capabilities that are on the critical path to enabling the Exploration Vision including human and robotic exploration missions from Earth orbit to the Moon and ultimately, Mars. Areas of primary interest are: orbital and planetary surface energy storage and non-solar power generation. Flight elements of the Exploration Vision initially include the Orion and ARES crew and launch vehicles, respectively. For lunar capability, additional elements include the Lunar Lander or Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), robotic missions, and surface systems. Surface systems include human habitats, Extravehicular Activities (EVA), science measurements, and the utilization of in situ resources. These flight systems require energy storage capabilities up to and greater than 10 kW-hr. Effective solutions require high-capacity, high-energy density, and long-life energy storage systems. Rechargeable lithium-based batteries (e.g., ion, sulphur) that provide energy storage for Exploration missions are required to be human-rated. For the lunar environment, batteries must operate over a greater range of temperatures than current state-of-the-art systems. The Exploration architecture calls for advanced fuel cells to meet the LSAM and surface system power requirements. Fuel cell systems provide power largely independent of environment (solar incidence), which allows greater mission flexibility and provide more power than other energy storage systems. Regenerative fuel cell systems, which combine a fuel cell with a water electrolyzer, will be required to meet long duration surface power energy storage needs. Prior architecture studies have identified nuclear power technology to effectively satisfy high power requirements for extended duration lunar surface missions. Nuclear power generation is especially attractive for missions with significant solar eclipse periods, including non-polar locations and inside lunar craters. Likewise, nuclear power has been identified as a critical power technology for Mars exploration and a lunar deployment is proposed to reduce risk through demonstration and validation of capabilities.",X8.01Fuel Cells for Surface Systems; X8.02Advanced Space Rated Batteries; X8.03Nuclear Surface Power,X8.01; X8.02; X8.03,Fuel Cells for Surface Systems; Advanced Space Rated Batteries; Nuclear Surface Power

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Protection Systems,"
 The Thermal Protection System (TPS) protects a spacecraft from the severe heating encountered during hypersonic flight through a planetary atmosphere. In general, there are two classes of TPS: reusable and ablative. Typically, reusable TPS applications are limited to relatively mild entry environments like that of Space Shuttle. No change in the mass or properties of the TPS material results from entry with a significant amount of energy being re-radiated from the heated surface and the remainder conducted into the TPS material. Typically, a surface coating with high emissivity (to maximize the amount of energy re-radiated) and with low surface catalycity (to minimize convective heating by suppressing surface recombination of dissociated boundary layer species) is employed. The primary insulation has low thermal conductivity to minimize the mass of material required to insulate the primary structure. Ablative TPS materials, in contrast, accommodate high heating rates and heat loads through phase change and mass loss. All NASA planetary entry probes to date have used ablative TPS. Most ablative TPS materials are reinforced composites employing organic resins as binders. When heated, the resin pyrolyzes producing gaseous products that are heated as they percolate toward the surface thus transferring some energy from the solid to the gas. Additionally, the injection of the pyrolysis gases into the boundary layer alters the boundary layer properties resulting in reduced convective heating. However, the gases may undergo chemical reactions with the boundary layer gases that could return heat to the surface. Furthermore, chemical reactions between the surface material and boundary layer species can result in consumption of the surface material leading to surface recession. Those reactions can be endothermic (vaporization, sublimation) or exothermic (oxidation) and will have an important impact on net energy to the surface. Clearly, in comparison to reusable TPS materials, the interaction of ablative TPS materials with the surrounding gas environment is much more complex as there are many more mechanisms to accommodate the entry heating. NASA has successfully tackled the complexity of thermal protection systems for numerous missions to inner and outer planets in our solar system in the past; the knowledge gained has been invaluable but incomplete. Future missions will be more demanding. For example, if existing materials were to be used for the proposed Mars Sample Return mission, the TPS mass fraction would be on the order of 40%. The potential savings that could be achieved with some investment in TPS technology development is sizeable.","X10.01Detachable, Human-rated, Ablative Environmentally Compliant TPS",X10.01,"Detachable, Human-rated, Ablative Environmentally Compliant TPS"

Aerospace Technology,Topic A1 Aviation Safety and Security,"
 The worldwide commercial aviation accident rate has been nearly constant over the past two decades. Although the rate is very low, increasing traffic over the years may result in the absolute number of accidents also increasing. Without improvements, doubling or tripling of air traffic by 2017 could lead to 50 or more major accidents a year. This number of accidents would have an unacceptable impact on the air transportation system. The goal of NASAs Aviation Safety and Security Program (AvSSP) is to develop and demonstrate technologies that contribute to a reduction in the fatal aviation accident rate. Research and technology will address accidents involving hazardous weather, controlled flight into terrain, human-error caused accidents and incidents, and mechanical or software malfunctions. The Program will also develop and integrate information technologies needed to build a safer aviation system and provide information for the assessment of situations and trends that indicate unsafe conditions before they lead to accidents. NASA researchers are also looking at ways to adapt aviation technologies already being developed to improve aviation security. The AvSSP is focusing on areas where NASA expertise could make a significant contribution to security: 1) the hardening of aircraft and their systems, 2) secure airspace operation technologies, 3) improved systems to screen passenger and cargo information, and 4) sensors designed to better detect threats. NASA seeks highly innovative proposals that will complement its work in Aviation Safety and Security in the following subtopic areas:

Earth Science,Topic E1 Instruments for Earth Science Measurements,"
 NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) is studying how our global environment is changing. Using the unique perspective available from space and airborne platforms, NASA is observing, documenting, and assessing large-scale environmental processes with emphasis on atmospheric composition, climate, carbon cycle and ecosystems, the Earths surface and interior, the water and energy cycles, and weather. A major objective of the ESE instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with small or more affordable spacecraft so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore, make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. Consequently, the objective of the Instruments for Earth Science Measurements SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of Earth observing instruments, and enable new Earth observation measurements. The following subtopics are concomitant with this objective and are organized by measurement technique.

Earth Science,Topic E2 Platform Technologies for Earth Science,"
 NASA is fostering innovations that support implementation of the Earth Science (ES) Enterprise program, an integrated international undertaking to study the Earth system. ES uses the unique perspective available from orbit to study land cover and land use changes, short and long term climate variability, natural hazards, and environmental changes. Additionally, ES uses terrestrial and airborne measurements to complement those acquired from Earth orbit. ES has a parallel development effort to these platforms that includes the largest ground and data system ever undertaken, which will provide the facility for command and control of flight segments and for data processing, distribution, storage, and archival of vast amounts of Earth science research data. The Earth Science Program defines platforms as the host systems for ES instruments, i.e., they provide the infrastructure for an instrument or suite of instruments. Traditionally, the term 'platform' would be synonymous with 'spacecraft,' and it certainly does include spacecraft. 'Platform,' however, is intended to be much broader in application than spacecraft and is intended to include non-traditional hosts for sensors and instruments such as airborne platforms (piloted and unpiloted aircraft, balloons, and drop sondes), terrestrial platforms, sea surface and subsurface platforms, and even surface penetrators. These application examples are given to illustrate the wide diversity of possibilities for acquiring ES data consistent with the future vision of the Earth Science Program and indicate types of platforms for which technology development is required.

Space Science,Topic S1 Sun Earth Connection,"
 The overarching goal of the SunEarth Connection (SEC) theme in Space Science is an understanding of how the Sun, heliosphere, and planetary environments are connected in a single system. The three principal science objectives spring from this goal: 

1. Understanding the changing flow of energy and matter throughout the Sun, heliosphere, and planetary environments; 
2. Exploring the fundamental physical processes of plasma systems in the solar system; and
3. Defining the origins and societal impacts of variability in the SunEarth Connection. 
 
 SEC missions investigate the physics of the Sun, the heliosphere, the local interstellar medium, and all planetary environments within the heliosphere. They address problems such as solar variability, the responses of the planets to such variability, and the interaction of the heliosphere with the galaxy. Increasingly, SEC investigations have focused upon space weather, the diverse array of dynamic and interconnected space phenomena that affects life, society, and exploration systems. Technology plays an important role in maximizing the science return from all SEC missions.

Space Science,Topic S3 Astronomical Search for Origins,"
 The questions How did we get here? and Are we alone? have driven mankind to explore and expand our understanding of the universe and our role in it since before recorded history. Today, we move our attention to the cosmos. Understanding of how galaxies, stars, and planetary systems formed in the early universe will provide a basis for future exploration. Are planetary systems and Earth-like planets typical? Is life beyond the Earth rare or non-existent? If life in the universe is robust, has it spread throughout the galaxy? Current missions using innovative technology research are Space Interferometer Mission (SIM) and Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF). New missions in the planning phase, which requires innovative technology, are Space Astronomy Far Infrared Telescope (SAFIR), Life Finder and Planet Imager. The Origins technology program develops the means to achieve the most ambitious and technically challenging measurements ever made. New large space telescopes and instruments are required to detect the extremely faint signatures from the deep universe. Innovations are needed in these areas: Precision constellations for interferometry, advanced astronomical instrumentation, deployable precision structures, high-contrast astrophysical imaging, large aperture lightweight telescope mirrors, and wavefront sensing and control. These technologies will enable NASA to explore the early universe, find planets around other stars, and search for life beyond Earth.

 NASA's program for Exploration of the Solar System seeks to answer fundamental questions about the Solar System and life: How do planets form? Why are planets different from one another? Where did the makings of life come from? Did life arise elsewhere in the solar system? What is the future habitability of Earth and other planets? The search for answers to these questions requires that we augment the current remote sensing approach to solar system exploration with a robust program that includes in situ measurements at key places in the solar system, and the return of materials from them for later study on the Earth. We envision a rich suite of missions to achieve this, including a comet nucleus sample return, a Europa lander, and a rover or balloon-borne experiment on Saturn's moon Titan, to name a few. Numerous new technologies will be required to enable such ambitious missions.

,Focus Area 1 In-Space Propulsion Technologies,"NASA is interested in technologies for advanced in-space propulsion systems to reduce travel time, increase payload mass, reduce acquisition costs, reduce operational costs, and enable new science capabilities for exploration and science spacecraft.  The future will require demanding propulsive performance and flexibility for more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation.  This focus area seeks innovations for NASA propulsion systems in chemical, electric, nuclear thermal and advanced propulsion systems related to human exploration and science missions.  Propulsion technologies will focus on a number of mission applications including ascent, descent, orbit transfer, rendezvous, station keeping, and proximity operations and deep space explorations.","Z10.01Cryogenic Fluid Management; Z10.04Materials, Processes, and Technologies for Advancing In-Space Electric Propulsion Thrusters; Z10.05Rotating Detonation Rocket Engines (RDRE)",Z10.01; Z10.04; Z10.05,"Cryogenic Fluid Management; Materials, Processes, and Technologies for Advancing In-Space Electric Propulsion Thrusters; Rotating Detonation Rocket Engines (RDRE)"
,"Focus Area 2 Power, Energy and Storage","Power is a ubiquitous technology need across many NASA missions, and new technologies are sought to improve and/or enable the generation, storage, and distribution of electrical power for both human and robotic missions. In space power, mission applications include planetary surface power, large-scale spacecraft prime power, and small-scale robotic probe power. Applicable technology development is sought for: 1) efficient means of transmitting, connecting, and managing kilowatt-class power over long distances on planetary surfaces, 2) high-voltage, radiation tolerant switches and components that are needed to optimize mass and efficiency for new high power missions, and 3) components and systems to enable space-rated fuel cells in both primary generation and secondary energy storage applications. Finally, various power generation and storage technologies are sought for extreme-environment planetary science missions. An overarching objective is to mature technologies from analytical or experimental proof-of-concept (TRL3) to breadboard demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL5). Successful efforts will transition into NASA Projects where the prototype deliverables will be incorporated into ground testbeds or flight demonstrations. Note that there are similar power technology development needs at higher power levels for electrified aircraft propulsion which is covered in Focus Area 18 – Air Vehicle Technologies.","S13.07Energy Storage for Extreme Environments; S16.01Photovoltaic Power Generation and Conversion; Z1.05Lunar and Planetary Surface Power Management and Distribution; Z1.06Radiation-Tolerant High-Voltage, High-Power Electronics; Z1.08Space-Rated Fuel Cell Technologies",S13.07; S16.01; Z1.05; Z1.06; Z1.08,"Energy Storage for Extreme Environments; Photovoltaic Power Generation and Conversion; Lunar and Planetary Surface Power Management and Distribution; Radiation-Tolerant High-Voltage, High-Power Electronics; Space-Rated Fuel Cell Technologies"
,Focus Area 3 Autonomous Systems for Space Exploration,"The exploration of space requires the best of the nation's technical community to provide the technologies that will enable human and robotic exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO): to establish a lunar presence, to visit asteroids, to extend human reach to Mars, and for increasingly ambitious missions. Examples of such missions include robotic platforms like the Europa Lander or crewed missions with extended periods of dormancy such as Gateway. Gateway represents a vital component of NASA’s Artemis program, which will serve as a multi-purpose orbital lunar outpost that provides essential support for a long-term human return to the lunar surface. It will serve as a staging point for deep space exploration. Autonomous Systems technologies provide the means of migrating mission control from Earth to spacecraft, habitats, and robotic explorers. This is enhancing for missions in the Earth-Lunar neighborhood and enabling for deep space missions. Long light-time delays, for example up to 42 minutes round-trip between Earth and Mars, require time-critical control decisions to be closed on-board autonomously, rather than through round-trip communication to Earth mission control. For robotic explorers, this will be done through automation, while for human missions this will be done through astronaut-automation teaming.Long-term crewed spacecraft and habitats, such as the International Space Station, are so complex that a significant portion of the crew's time is spent keeping it operational even under nominal conditions in low-Earth orbit, while still requiring significant real-time support from Earth. The considerable challenge is to migrate the knowledge and capability embedded in current Earth mission control, with tens to hundreds of human specialists ready to provide instant knowledge, to onboard automation that teams with astronauts to autonomously manage spacecraft and habitats. For outer planet robotic explorers, the opportunity is to autonomously and rapidly respond to dynamic environments in a timely fashion.Specific innovations being sought in this solicitation are described below:Deep neural nets and neuromorphic processing have substantial benefit for in-space autonomy and cognition. Advances in signal and data processing for neuromorphic processors promise to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning for autonomous spacecraft operations.Intelligent autonomous agent cognitive architectures are sought after as an onboard spacecraft capability. Their open, modular framework has the potential to enable decision-making under uncertainty and learn in a manner that the performance of the system is assured and improves over time.Onboard fault management capabilities, such as onboard sensing, computing, algorithms, and models are a critical element of health management for future spacecraft. Offboard components that contribute to onboard fault management are also relevant.Improvements in autonomous systems performance are needed, in the context of multi-agent Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) teams with either some independence under general human direction or complete independence. This capability will help to address the need for integrated data uncertainty management and a robust representation of “trustworthy and trusted” autonomy in space.The control and coordination of swarms such as planetary rovers, flyers, and in-space vehicles in dynamic environments is emerging as a critical technological need for future space missions.Gateway is seeking capabilities using autonomy and artificial intelligence for operations and health management individually and/or jointly under crewed and un-crewed conditions.Please refer to the description and references of each subtopic for further detail to guide development of proposals within this technically diverse focus area.",H6.22Deep Neural Net and Neuromorphic Processors for In-Space Autonomy and Cognition; H6.23Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration; S17.03Fault Management Technologies,H6.22; H6.23; S17.03,Deep Neural Net and Neuromorphic Processors for In-Space Autonomy and Cognition; Spacecraft Autonomous Agent Cognitive Architectures for Human Exploration; Fault Management Technologies
,Focus Area 4 Robotic Systems for Space Exploration,"This focus area includes development of robotic systems technologies (hardware and software) that will enable and enhance future space exploration missions. In the coming decades, robotic systems will continue to change the way space is explored. Robots will be used in all mission phases: as independent explorers operating in environments too distant or hostile for humans, as precursor systems operating before crewed missions, as crew helpers working alongside and supporting humans, and as caretakers of assets left behind. As humans continue to work and live in space, they will increasingly rely on intelligent and versatile robots to perform mundane activities, freeing human, and ground control teams to tend to more challenging tasks that call for human cognition and judgment. Technologies are needed for robotic systems to improve transport of crew, instruments, and payloads on planetary surfaces, on and around small bodies, and in-space. This includes hazard detection, sensing/perception, active suspension, grappling/anchoring, legged locomotion, robot navigation, end-effectors, propulsion, and user interfaces.Innovative robot technologies provide a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility, manipulation and human-robot interaction offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Enhancements and potentially new forms of robotic systems can be realized through advances in component technologies, such as actuation and structures (e.g. 3D printing). Mobility provides a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Manipulation provides a critical capability for positioning crew members and instruments in space and on planetary bodies. Robotic manipulation allows for the handling of tools, interfaces, and materials not specifically designed for robots, and it provides a capability for drilling, extracting, handling, and processing samples of multiple forms and scales. This increases the range of beneficial tasks robots can perform and allows for improved efficiency of operations across mission scenarios. Furthermore, manipulation is important for human missions, human precursor missions, and unmanned science missions.  Moreover, sampling, sample handling, transport, and distribution to instruments, or instrument placement directly on in-place rock or regolith, is important for robotic missions to locales too distant or dangerous for human exploration.Future space missions may rely on co-located and distributed teams of humans and robots that have complementary capabilities. Tasks that are considered ""dull, dirty, or dangerous"" can be transferred to robots, thus relieving human crew members to perform more complex tasks or those requiring real-time modifications due to contingencies. Additionally, due to the limited number of astronauts anticipated to crew planetary exploration missions, as well as their constrained schedules, ground control will need to remotely supervise and assist robots using time-delayed and limited bandwidth communications.  Advanced methods of human-robot interaction over time delay will enable more productive robotic exploration of the more distant reaches of the solar system.  This includes improved visualization of alternative future states of the robot and the terrain, as well as intuitive means of communicating the intent of the human to the robotic system.","S13.01Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling; Z5.04Intravehicular Robot (IVR) Technologies; Z14.01Lunar Surface Excavation",S13.01; Z5.04; Z14.01,"Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling; Intravehicular Robot (IVR) Technologies; Lunar Surface Excavation"
,Focus Area 5 Communications and Navigation,"NASA seeks proposals to produce innovative technologies in the communications and navigation discipline to support Exploration, Operations, Science, and Space Technology missions, including the eventual return of humans to the Lunar surface. Missions are generating ever-increasing data volumes that require increased performance from communications systems while minimizing spacecraft impact. This requires higher peak throughput from the communications systems with lower flight communication system cost, mass, and power per bit transmitted. Missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond will require reliable, autonomous, and secure communications systems operating in the radio frequency bands and optical wavelengths to reduce mission operations burden and support data-intensive operations. These missions will rely on enhanced autonomous navigation techniques to support rendezvous and docking; on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing; and precision landing. This focus area supports the development of novel communications and navigation technologies spanning from radio frequency to optical to quantum communications systems, applications of autonomy and cognition to navigation and networking, data routing and security, and positioning, timing, guidance, navigation, and control techniques that will provide a significant improvement over the current state of the art.","H9.01Long-Range Optical Telecommunications; H9.03Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technologies; H9.07Cognitive Communication; S16.03Guidance, Navigation, and Control",H9.01; H9.03; H9.07; S16.03,"Long-Range Optical Telecommunications; Flight Dynamics and Navigation Technologies; Cognitive Communication; Guidance, Navigation, and Control"
,Focus Area 6 Life Support and Habitation Systems,"The Life Support and Habitation Systems Focus Area seeks key capabilities and technology needs encompassing a diverse set of engineering and scientific disciplines, all of which provide technology solutions that enable extended human presence in deep space and on planetary surfaces such as Moon and Mars, including Orion, ISS, Gateway, Artemis and Human Landing Systems. The focus is on systems and elements that directly support human missions and astronaut crews, such as Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems, Human Accommodations, including crew and cabin provisioning, hygiene and clothing systems, and Bioregenerative Life Support, including plant growth for food production.For future crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and into the solar system, regular resupply of consumables and emergency or quick-return options will not be feasible. New technologies must be compatible with attributes of the environments expected, including microgravity or partial gravity, varying atmospheric pressure and composition (both internal to the cabin and external to the vehicle), space radiation, and the presence of planetary dust. Technologies of interest are those that enable long-duration, safe, economical, and sustainable deep-space human exploration. Special emphasis is placed on developing technologies that will fill existing gaps as described in this solicitation, that reduce requirements for consumables and other resources, including mass, power, volume, and crew time, and which will increase safety and reliability with respect to the state-of-the-art. Spacecraft may be untended by the crew for long periods, therefore systems must be operable after these intervals of dormancy.ECLSS encompasses process technologies and monitoring functions necessary to provide and maintain a livable environment within the pressurized cabin of crewed spacecraft, including environmental monitoring, water recycling, waste management, and atmosphere revitalization including particulate removal.  There are two specific technical areas of interest for ECLSS submissions. Advancements in heaters and thermal swing components are needed for thermally desorbed carbon dioxide removal and compression beds, including considerations for structured monolithic sorbents created by additive manufacturing or slip casting of the sorbent itself. Secondly, proposals are sought to address challenges in carbon dioxide reduction systems, including separation, collection, removal, and storage of carbon particulates, methods to recharge or recycle catalysts, and solutions to prevent clogging of frits and filters in recycle gas streams. Also, of interest to ECLSS but included elsewhere in this solicitation, is lunar dust filtration and monitoring for spacecraft cabins.For Human Accommodations, the focus in this solicitation includes advanced heating and refrigeration systems for stored food, personal hygiene including handwash, combination clothes washers, and dryer systems and volumetrically efficient concepts for equipment, flexible work surfaces and storage. In addition, textiles are sought for extreme surface environments and high oxygen atmospheres, applicable to crew clothing. Lastly, of interest to the focus area but included elsewhere, is the subtopic Plant Research Capabilities in Space, which is applicable to Bioregenerative Life Support.Unique needs also exist for the Exploration Extra-vehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU), commonly called spacesuits. Textiles used for the xEMU Environmental Protection Garment (EPG), the outermost component of the xEMU, must resist extreme surface environments including planetary dust, and also be suitable for oxygen-rich atmospheres. Applicable to the xEMU’s Portable Life Support System (PLSS), sorbent technologies are sought for a low volume, low power and low mass carbon dioxide and humidity control system. In addition, miniaturized gas sensor technologies are needed for the measurement of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor within the suit.Please refer to the description and references of each subtopic for further detail to guide the development of proposals within this technically diverse focus area.","H3.08Challenges in Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reduction: Carbon Particulate and Thermal Management; H3.09Human Accommodations; H4.06Low-Power Multi-Gas Sensor for Spacesuits; H4.07Low Volume, Power and Mass CO2 and Humidity Control for xEMU",H3.08; H3.09; H4.06; H4.07,"Challenges in Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reduction: Carbon Particulate and Thermal Management; Human Accommodations; Low-Power Multi-Gas Sensor for Spacesuits; Low Volume, Power and Mass CO2 and Humidity Control for xEMU"
,Focus Area 7 Human Research and Health Maintenance,"NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) investigates and mitigates the highest risks to astronaut health and performance for exploration missions. HRP achieves this through a focused program of basic, applied and operational research leading to the development and delivery of:Human health, performance, and habitability standards.Countermeasures and other risk mitigation solutions.Advanced habitability and medical support technologies.HRP has developed an Integrated Research Plan (IRP) to describe the requirements and notional approach to understanding and reducing the human health and performance risks. The IRP describes the Program's research activities that are intended to address the needs of human space exploration and serve HRP customers. The Human Research Roadmap (http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov) is a web-based version of the IRP that allows users to search HRP risks, gaps, and tasks.The HRP is organized into several research Elements:Human Health Countermeasures.Human Factors and Behavioral Performance.Exploration Medical Capability.Space Radiation.Each of the HRP Elements address a subset of the risks. A fifth Element, Research Operations and Integration (ROI), is responsible for the implementation of the research on various space and ground analog platforms. HRP subtopics are aligned with the Elements and solicit technologies identified in their respective research plans.",H12.07Protective Pharmaceutical Packaging,H12.07,Protective Pharmaceutical Packaging
,Focus Area 8 In-Situ Resource Utilization,"In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) involves any hardware or operation that harnesses and utilizes ‘in-situ’ resources (natural and discarded) to create products and services for robotic and human exploration. Local resources include ‘natural’ resources found on extraterrestrial bodies such as water, solar wind implanted volatiles (hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, etc.), vast quantities of metals in mineral rocks and soils, and atmospheric constituents, as well as human-made resources such as trash and waste from human crew, and discarded hardware that has completed its primary purpose.  The most useful products from ISRU are propellants, fuel cell reactants, life support commodities (such as water, oxygen, and buffer gases), and feedstock for manufacturing and construction.  ISRU products and services can be used to i) reduce Earth launch mass or lander mass by not bringing everything from Earth, ii) reduce risks to the crew and/or mission by reducing logistics, increasing shielding, and providing increased self-sufficiency, and/or iii) reducing costs by either needing less launch vehicles to complete the mission or through the reuse of hardware and lander/space transportation vehicles.  Since ISRU systems must operate wherever the resource of interest exists, technologies and hardware will need to be designed to operate in harsh environments, reduced gravity, and potential non-homogeneous resource physical, mineral, and ice/volatile characteristics. This year’s solicitation will focus on critical technologies needed in the areas of Resource Acquisition and Consumable Production for the Moon and Mars. The ISRU focus area is seeking innovative technology for:Novel Silicate Reduction MethodsNoncontact High Temperature MeasurementRegolith Feed/Removal Systems and Mineral Measurement for Oxygen RemovalNon-Water Volatile CaptureRegolith/Ice CrushingSize-SortingBeneficiation of Water IceMineral BeneficiationMetal Production As appropriate, the specific needs and metrics of each of these specific technologies are described in the subtopic descriptions.","Z12.01Extraction of Oxygen, Metal, and Water from Lunar Regolith",Z12.01,"Extraction of Oxygen, Metal, and Water from Lunar Regolith"
,"Focus Area 9 Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments","NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD), https://science.nasa.gov/ encompasses research in the areas of Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary Science. The National Academies of Science have provided NASA with recently updated Decadal surveys that are useful to identify technologies that are of interest to the above science divisions. Those documents are available at https://www.nationalacademies.org/(link is external)A major objective of SMD instrument development programs is to implement science measurement capabilities with smaller or more affordable aerospace platforms so development programs can meet multiple mission needs and therefore make the best use of limited resources. The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in-situ instruments capable of making measurements across the electromagnetic spectrum is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on remote sensing (active and passive) and in situ instrument development for space-based, airborne, and uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms.  A strong focus is placed on reducing the size, weight, power, and cost of remote and in situ instruments to allow for deployment on more affordable and wider range of platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in-situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2022 program year, we are continuing to update the included subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. We continue to emphasize Ocean Worlds and solicit development of in-situ instrument technologies and components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life, especially extant of life, in the Ocean Worlds. The microwave technologies continue as two subtopics, one focused on active microwave remote sensing and the second on passive systems such as radiometers and microwave spectrometers. NASA has additional interest in advancing quantum sensing technologies to enable wholly new quantum sensing and measurement techniques focused on the development and maturation towards space application and qualification of atomic systems that leverage their quantum properties.  Furthermore, photonic integrated circuit technology is sought to enable size, weight, power, and cost reductions, as well as improved performance of science instruments, subsystems, and components which is particularly critical for enabling use of affordable small spacecraft platforms.A key objective of this SBIR Focus Area is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for the development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration.

,Focus Area 10 Advanced Telescope Technologies,"The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) seeks technology for cost-effective high-performance advanced space telescopes for astrophysics and Earth science. Astrophysics applications require large aperture lightweight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures, innovative wavefront, and structural metrology, and cryogenic optics to enable far-infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold as 4 K. This focus area will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories to collect electromagnetic bands, ranging from X-rays to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide, and nanolaminates, and innovative structures and deployments are needed on scales ranging from cubesats to flagship class missions. Instruments commonly benefit in size and cost from the use of free-form optics and require innovative fabrication and metrology systems. Instrument technologies for high-contrast exoplanet imaging include deformable mirrors and active structures for high-precision wavefront control and stabilization, as well as technologies to accurately deploy and control scattered light with large-scale deployable occulters.  Wavelength control and stabilization approaches are critical to the success of high-precision radial velocity measurements. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4-meter size category that are cost-effective.

,Focus Area 11 Spacecraft and Platform Subsystems,"The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) will carry out the scientific exploration of our Earth, the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids of our solar system, and the universe beyond. SMD’s future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems such as: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. High performance space computing technologies are also included in this focus area. Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs. For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115° C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending).

,"Focus Area 12 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems","The SBIR focus area of Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) includes the suite of technologies for atmospheric entry as well as descent and landing on both atmospheric and non-atmospheric bodies. EDL mission segments are used in both robotic planetary science missions and human exploration missions beyond Low Earth Orbit, and many technologies have application to emerging commercial space capabilities such as lunar landing, low-cost space access, small spacecraft, and asset return.Robust, efficient, and predictable EDL systems fulfill the critical function of delivering payloads to lunar and planetary surfaces through challenging environments, within mass and cost constraints. Future NASA Artemis and planetary science missions will require new technologies to break through historical constraints on delivered mass, enable sustained human presence, or to go to entirely new planets and moons. Even where heritage systems exist, no two planetary missions are exactly “build-to-print,” leading to frequent challenges from environmental uncertainty, risk posture, and resource constraints that can be dramatically improved with investments in EDL technologies. EDL relies on validated models, ground tests, and sensor technologies for system development and certification. Both new capabilities and improved assessment and prediction of state-of-the-art systems are important facets of this focus area.The subtopics in this Focus Area generally align with the Entry, Descent, and Landing flight regimes, including the flight instrumentation area.

,Focus Area 13 Information Technologies for Science Data,"NASA Missions and Programs create a wealth of science data and information that are essential to understanding our earth, our solar system and the universe. Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply these data and information to create knowledge. For example, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These tools allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA data and science information are used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public.",S11.06Earth Science Decision Support Tools Focused on the Mitigation of Climate Change Impacts; S14.01Space Weather Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) Technology Development; S17.02Integrated Science Mission Modeling; S17.04Application of Artificial Intelligence for Science Modeling and Instrumentation,S11.06; S14.01; S17.02; S17.04,Earth Science Decision Support Tools Focused on the Mitigation of Climate Change Impacts; Space Weather Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) Technology Development; Integrated Science Mission Modeling; Application of Artificial Intelligence for Science Modeling and Instrumentation

,Focus Area 16 Ground & Launch Processing,"Ground processing technology development prepares the agency to test, process and launch the next generation of rockets and spacecraft in support of NASA's exploration objectives by developing the necessary ground systems, infrastructure and operational approaches for terrestrial and off-planet surface Systems.This topic seeks innovative concepts and solutions for both addressing long-term ground processing and test complex operational challenges and driving down the cost of government and commercial access to space. Technology infusion and optimization of existing and future operational programs, while concurrently maintaining continued operations, are paramount for cost effectiveness, safety assurance, and supportability. A key aspect of NASA's approach to long term sustainability and affordability is to make test, processing and launch infrastructure available to commercial and other government entities, thereby distributing the fixed cost burden among multiple users and reducing the cost of access to space for the United States. Unlike previous work focusing on a single kind of launch vehicle such as the Saturn V rocket or the Space Shuttle, NASA is preparing common infrastructure to support several different kinds of spacecraft and rockets that are in development. Products and systems devised at a NASA center could be used at other launch sites on earth and eventually on other planets or moons. Specific emphasis to substantially reduce the costs and improve safety/reliability of NASA's test and launch operations includes development of ground test and launch environment technology components, system level ground test systems for advanced propulsion, autonomous control technologies for fault detection, isolation, and recovery, including autonomous propellant management, and advanced instrumentation technologies including Intelligent wireless sensor systems.",H10.01Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology; H10.02Autonomous Operations Technologies for Ground and Launch Systems,H10.01; H10.02,Advanced Propulsion Systems Ground Test Technology; Autonomous Operations Technologies for Ground and Launch Systems
,Focus Area 17 Thermal Management Systems,"From the smallest satellite to the most complicated human rated spacecraft, thermal is seen as an enabling function to a vehicle.

,Focus Area 21 Small Spacecraft Technologies,"NASA is pursuing rapid identification, development, and testing of capabilities that exploit small spacecraft platforms and responsive launch capabilities to increase the pace of space exploration, scientific discovery, and the expansion of space commerce in a sustainable manner. These emerging capabilities have the potential to enable new mission architectures, enhance conventional missions, and promote development and deployment on faster timelines.  This will, in turn, allow NASA and other space mission operators to achieve their objectives at significantly lower programmatic risk and cost than traditional approaches.   Small spacecraft are typically defined as those weighing 180 kg or less and are often designed for shared launch using standardized form factors and interfaces and containerized deployment (e.g. CubeSats). Small spacecraft and responsive launch capabilities are proving to be disruptive innovations for exploration, discovery, and commercial applications. NASA seeks technical innovations that enable small spacecraft to rival the capabilities of their larger, more expensive counterparts, while also striving to make them cheaper and quicker to build, and easier to launch and operate. In addition, NASA seeks innovations to help address the looming concern of space debris growth in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) following the expected launch of constellations consisting of thousands of satellites, whilst also further expanding the reach of small spacecraft beyond LEO. Greatly improved capabilities are needed for lunar exploration missions, lunar communications and navigation infrastructure, and exploration at Mars and other deep space destinations. Technology and capability investment will be needed to meet these upcoming mission needs while keeping overall costs low, mission cadence high, and retaining the agile aerospace approach that has fueled what has been termed the “smallsat revolution”.  Specific improvements required are long-range high-bandwidth optical and RF communications; novel navigation devices and navigation references for use well beyond Earth; improved power management; and robust tolerance of the harsher thermal and radiation environment of deep space. Propulsion technologies with improved performance are sought for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), lunar orbit insertion and maintenance, return-to-Earth and Earth entry and descent mechanisms. Transfer stages that host small spacecraft and can provide support services to the deployed spacecraft are also desired. Innovations are wanted to increase the speed, economy, and reliability of production; modular designs will facilitate reliable assembly and test of singly- or batch-produced small spacecraft, with specifically sought-after technologies including wirelessly interconnected sensors and modules. De-orbit or rapid disposal devices for single spacecraft, and autonomous space traffic management technologies for small spacecraft swarms and constellations are also needed. These include affordable powerful computing hardware and intelligent software tools and infrastructure for autonomous operation of spacecraft or for cooperation of spacecraft groups, minimizing human-in-the-loop bottlenecks, that are applicable to both the space debris management environment, as well as deep space missions.NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology Program will consider promising SBIR technologies for spaceflight demonstration missions and seeks partnerships to accelerate spaceflight testing and commercial infusion.

,Focus Area 24 Dust Mitigation and Extreme Lunar Environment Mitigation Technologies,"A number of space exploration missions to planetary bodies have noted significant deleterious effects due to fine particulates. This fine dust can foul mechanisms, alter thermal properties, and obscure optical systems. It can abrade textiles and scratch surfaces. With near term goals to return to the Moon, lunar dust is of particular concern. It has the potential to negatively affect every lunar architecture system. In addition, temperatures on the lunar surface vary from 35 K to 400 K imposing extreme operational constraints on architectural elements.  The goal of this focus area is to develop dust mitigation and extreme lunar environment mitigation technologies that can be incorporated into space exploration systems. All planetary exploration missions require a proactive strategy to lessen the effects of dust, extreme temperature variations, plasma, and radiation. Passive and active dust mitigation technologies and novel engineering design are needed to form a complete dust mitigation strategy.  Spacesuits and mechanisms must be developed for operation in the extreme environments of the Moon.  Proposed research may focus on development of new technologies, but there is particular interest in technologies that are approaching readiness for space environment testing. Exploration systems require dust mitigation and extreme lunar environment mitigation technologies within the following capability areas:Optical Systems – Viewports, camera lenses, solar panels, space suit visors, mass spectrometers, other sensitive optical instruments.Thermal Surfaces – Thermal radiators, thermal painted surfaces, thermal connections.Fabrics – Space suit fabrics, soft wall habitats, mechanism covers.Mechanisms – Linear actuators, bearings, rotary joints, hinges, quick disconnects, valves, linkages.Seals and Soft Goods – Space suit interfaces, hatches, connectors, hoses; and,Gaseous Filtration – Atmosphere revitalization and ISRU processes.

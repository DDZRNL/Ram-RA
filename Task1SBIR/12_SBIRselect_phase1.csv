The proposed AlGaN/GaN-Si power converters to be developed in this program will usher in a new generation of high-efficiency, low-cost, and radiation-hard power conversion units on-board future NASA spacecraft. Phase I of this proposed work will focus on the optimization of the design and fabrication of the AlGaN/GaN-Si MOS-HFET and NSJ SBR devices. Phase II will be focused on the design and integration of Si/GaN gate-drive circuitry with the power SBRs and transistors to create high-power integrated circuits. Another major objective during Phase II will be the construction of Rad-Hard packaging for the power ICs. At the end of Phase II of this program, a fully-functional 15 kW/300�C rated power converter IC equipped with AlGaN/GaN-on-Si  MOS-HFETs, Natural SuperJunction (NSJ) SBRs as free-wheeling diodes and on-chip SiC or III-Nitride gate drive circuitry will be demonstrated at a switching frequency of ≥ 1 MHz and at a temperature of  ≥ 300 �C. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art power electronics technology, the proposed AlGaN/GaN-on-Si power converters will offer (A) Lower on-state losses, 300 �C operation and 1 MHz switching capability (B) A Lateral device architecture, which is highly desirable for construction for monolithic power integrated circuits (C) Possibility of hybrid interconnection of III-Nitride Power Devices with on-chip Rad-Hard AlGaN/GaN Gate Drive Circuitry (D) Desirable Normally-OFF Power Switches.","The technology developed here is fundamental to a wide range of NASA PMAD and motor control applications. For DC-DC converters, the power ICs developed in this program will connect power sources in a wide variety of NASA mission systems with power sources as Solar arrays, Brayton rotating unit, stirling radioscopes, and fuel cells with various loads like electric propulsion, communications systems, instruments and actuators. The radiation-hardness, high-temperature capability, fast switching speeds, compact form factor and low mass offered by the proposed AlGaN/GaN-on-SiC power integrated circuit will be invaluable for future NASA science missions. A power IC is also the building block for the interface between energy storage devices like batteries and flywheels with the energy sources and loads. Switchmode power supplies improved by high frequency, high temperature power switch is critical for NASA synthetic aperture RADAR's (SAR) antenna array T/R modules. T/R modules typically operate in a pulsed mode, drawing current pulses from a power supply on a periodic basis determined by the operation of the overall RADAR system. The ripple in the output voltage of the T/R module power supply impacts the performance of the RADAR system.","The specifications of the power switch to be developed in this program are ideally suited for most Air Force applications. This includes propulsion system externals like actuators, pumps, and starters, weapons ejection, fuel transfer, lighting, avionics, RADAR, landing gears & breaks, steering, powered doors and ramps, gun drives, anti-icing, environmental control and auxiliary emergency power systems. Conventional bus voltage of military and commercial aircrafts is 270 V, which requires a 600 V power switch to be developed in this program. The realization of a high power density switchmode power supplies and DC-DC conversion circuits will benefit Army's Future Combat System (FCS) by offering it an important part of the subsystem.  An electric and hybrid vehicle technology directly affects the M113 APC, Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, HMMWV, 5-ton M939A1 truck, AAAV, 50-ft personnel boat and a more electric aircraft by making them highly deployable, sustainable, survivable, lethal and affordable.  An integrated electric power system made using SiC high power devices will increase component placement flexibility within vehicles, double fuel economy by continuously operating smaller engines under optimum conditions, and reduce armor protected volume.  It will also enable an increased acceleration and maneuverability due to immediate torque to the wheels or tracks, reduce vehicle thermal and acoustic signatures and reduce system cost and logistics requirements.","Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Conversion; Distribution/Management; Electromagnetic; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); In Situ Manufacturing; Inertial; Ionizing Radiation; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Navigation & Guidance; Nonspecified; Project Management; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Storage"

Box 131460, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 - 1570",(734) 786-1434,2,4,"The presence of  energetic ions, that appear under high cathode current operation, stand as a showstopper to the realization of high power electric propulsion.  Physical barriers such as the use of carbon electrodes (e.g. NEXT) are no longer sufficient as ion energies measured greatly exceed the sputter threshold of even carbon.  Unless this problem is addressed, the prospect of inadequate life looms. The benefits of high power electric propulsion missions supporting human operations in particular would be left unfulfilled.   This effort aims to fully characterize the conditions under which energy ions occur by documenting ion energy spectra over a range of representative operating conditions.   At these conditions, the effort will implement two novel methods of essentially defeating the energetic ion production mechanism: 1) magnetic shorting and 2) gas injection.  While the concept of injecting gas to quench energetic ion production has been demonstrated in the past, we take the approach a step further by 1) elucidating the mechanism by which gas injection actually quenches energetic ion production and 2) implementing a novel gas applicator that would conserve propellant thereby allowing for gas implementation without a significant efficiency sacrifice.  Past studies have shown that energetic ions form under conditions of high current.  No satisfactory understanding of how these are formed or how to mitigate has been communicated. This effort aims to address both issues.   The focus of the proposed effort directly addresses a problem that stands in the critical path for the development of high power electric propulsion.  Without a solution to the energetic ion lifetime issue, it is difficult to imagine the actual implementation of high power electric propulsion for actual missions.  This proposed effort aims to generate a methodology and apparatus for the elimination of energy ions in high current cathodes.","The direct application of long life, high current hollow cathodes is that of supporting NASA missions involving high power electric propulsion. This includes those high power missions, which are envisioned to support human operations in space. Under this phase I effort, contact will be made with hollow cathode stake holders to fully assess the impact of successful implementation of this technology. In particular, findings will be directly communicated to NASA.  Successful embodiments will be sent to NASA for validation testing.","The presence of energetic ions is not germane to high current cathodes though as was observed in the NSTAR long duration test.  In this regard, the technology developed from this effort would also eliminate this failure mechanism for cathodes presumably over essentially all operating ranges.  The technology therefore is generally applicable to Hall and ion thrusters used for government and commercial satellite station keeping. Indeed, the technology would be a life extender for commercial sector satellite makers. Commercial GSO market expects to launch of order 21 satellites per year and commercial NGSO of order 13 launches per year over the next 10 years. Electric propulsion is an onboard propulsion option for these vehicles and in this regard there is a stable market for this cathode life extension technology. The approach investigated here does not constitute a significant modification to the cathode rather it's essentially a retrofit featuring a novel, adaptable technology. This would in turn save costs to satellite venders by reducing development time of long life cathodes based on this technology proposed.  Additionally, the long life cathodes can also be used in commercial materials processing application such as vacuum plasma assisted CVD coatings.  Hollow cathodes are desirable for such applications because of the associated high plasma densities.",Quality/Reliability; Spacecraft Main Engine

In Phase I, Busek Co. Inc. will design, fabricate and test a nominal 7.5kW breadboard discharge converter module.  Busek proposes a converter topolgy called the Leading Edge Auxiliary Phase Shifted (LEAPS) Bridge, which is a modification of the standard phase shifted bridge that uses an energy-recovering auxiliary circuit to force the transition from output inductor freewheel to power flowing through the main transformer.  Based on preliminary measurements with this topology the converter module demonstrated >97% efficiency at reduced power.  A 300V line input and 300-400V output range are the benchmark for the discharge converter in Phase 1.  The most reasonable path with higher input voltage for higher power converters involves the use Wide Band Gap FETs.  MOSFETS represent the greatest payoff in terms of efficiency improvements and are a primary focus for a discharge converter to achieve an efficiency of 98% or greater.  With the design maturity gained from the Phase I breadboard, the Phase II objective will be the production of a 15kW brassboard PPU in a flight-like form factor that incorporates conductive cooling.",NASA has identified 30kW-class SEP systems as a high-value intermediate step toward higher power systems due to broad cross-cutting capability.

These direct drive system designs eliminate the power processing unit (PPU) and therefore have a substantial advantage in terms of overall electrical efficiency and mass savings. This Phase I/II proposal effort is comprised of the development of a Hall thruster direct drive unit (DDU).  The DDU will include a method for cathode current sharing such that multiple thrusters can be operated in parallel from a single power source.  In Phase I cathode current sharing approaches will be experimentally investigated.  Approaches to be evaluated include passive and active methods of cathode current control.  Active approaches involves independently controlled voltage sources placed in series with each cathode while passive approaches involve controlling cathode emission using  heater and keeper power.  In Phase II we will develop a nominal 15kW proto-flight brassboard level DDU and deliver it to NASA for additional characterization testing.  The DDU unit will include the balance of PPU per specifications provided by NASA for thruster magnets, cathode heater and keeper etc. operation.","NASA has identified 30kW-class SEP systems as a high-value intermediate step toward higher power systems due to broad cross-cutting capability.

This company has recently demonstrated breakthrough performance on these cathodes in other formats.  We have demonstrated emission of 5 Amps/cm2 at 850 degrees CB, which is 200 degrees C below that of conventional cathodes.  At this temperature they should live at least 100,000 hours.  This makes scandate cathodes a candidate for use in deep space missions.  In Phase I we propose construction and testing of several hollow scandate cathodes.  We propose to do both vacuum and ion environment characterization on them.  In Phase II we will begin active collaboration with NASA to test these cathodes in complete ion thrusters.","NASA needs the cathode in ion thrusters, amplifiers for RF space communications, and terahertz sources and amplifiers.  These tubes need very small cathodes with very high emission levels.  The most pressing need is for space communications, primarily high-speed transmissions of video images from outer space.  The frequencies most likely to use this cathode are 32 GHz and higher.  This cathode must be miniaturized, an e beam specialty.  But a larger cathode with low beam convergence in tubes below 32 GHz is also an option.  In space applications, long life has been the overruling priority and cathode loading was secondary.  But given the upsurge in high data rate applications, cathode loading is going up. e beam has worked with NASA Glenn and JPL to develop cathodes for these applications.Another NASA application is atmospheric research to excite molecular resonances in the 600 GHz to 1200 GHz region.  JPL has been looking for sources and amplifiers such as reflex klystrons, BWOs (backward wave oscillators) or traveling wave tubes.   The third NASA requirement is for ion thrusters.   e beam received a contract from NASA Glenn to produce the RF source for the ion engine for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter in 2004.  Two approaches were taken:  1) use an RF source to excite the ions inside the ion chamber; 2) directly excite the ions with electrons produced by a hollow cathode.  Both approaches require long life, and high cathode loading, such as proposed here.","The Department of Defense is also interested in ion thrusters, but its interest is confined to near-earth applications.  Its primary interest is for linear beam amplifiers for communications and radars.  It is also interested in terahertz sources and amplifiers.  In the commercial sector, there are several requirements for highly loaded, long-life cathodes.  For example, e-beam stimulated lasers could be used as backlights for high power projection displays.  These could also be used to generate high intensity UV light for curing inks and sterilization.  E-beam lithography systems for making 20-30 nanometer line width masks for the semiconductor industry are now cathode limited.  These systems need electron beams in the 20-30 Amps/cm2 range.

This proposed phase 1 research is innovative in that it combines proven NASA-developed AFS algorithms, real-time hazard assessment algorithms and hazard envelopes generated from Joint Advanced Range Safety System Real Time (JARSS RT)  and an on-board vehicle simulator into a refined onboard software inference engine that monitors navigation states, mission flight rules and onboard anomaly instrumentation.  An autonomous flight safety system must be able to reliably perform accurate and autonomous navigation so as to determine the vehicle position, velocity and attitude states in real time. Reliability requirements for AFS are high due to stringent loss-of-life constraints, often leading to redundant navigation sensors with attendant cost impacts. Our innovative solution proposes to satisfy RCC accuracy and reliability requirements by exploiting the low-cost COTS sensor and processor architectures that are currently being baselined for the Common NanoSat/Launcher Avionics Technology (CNAT) study and a Nano launch vehicle avionics design. This dual use hardware implementation will greatly reduce the recurring costs for the production of an autonomous flight safety system.   This has significant implications for reducing the costs for launch vehicles, particularly Nano and Micro Satellite Launch Vehicles (NMSLV), where range safety costs currently consume a burdensome percentage of the launch cost.  Under this proposed phase 1 effort, we will 1) identify the range requirements and develop a plan for range safety for approval of the system, 2) identify reliable low-cost COTS hardware that satisfies the range accuracy and reliability requirements and, 3) develop an end to end simulation to demonstrate the AFSIE Concept of Operations.","Once developed and demonstrated our  Autonomous Flight Safety and Inference Engine Systems (AFSIE) will radically reduce range and operations costs and provide a commercial device that NASA can use for both  Launch Vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Systems.

The use of an automated flight safety system will allow more responsive launches, significantly reducing the time required for launch preparation.  Our Inference Engine monitors navigation and vehicle condition sensors to detect anomalous conditions and predict fault conditions that will result in a violation of the safe flight rules.  This robust module system capability is applicable to a broad spectrum of NanoLauncher and Unmanned Systems.  Commercial production of these units will enable NASA to improve the frequency of Nano and Micro Satellite launches and reduce the lead time.","Our AFSEI system is applicable to multiple vehicle types that may operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) or at a federal range that is required to have a Flight Safety System (FSS).

The documented autonomy, redundancy, precision and implicit cost requirements currently differ greatly by vehicle type and purpose, so the inherent software and hardware modularity of our AFSIE system will support the broad application spectrum. Further, we wish to develop and qualify a future modification of AFSIE that is able to support vehicle GNC functions Autonomous Flight Safety and Guidance System (AFSGS), with options for providing navigation services via electrically-isolated communications, or directly providing GNC services from AC-AFSS.   The vehicles that might fly an AFSEI include, but are not limited to, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs), sounding rockets, Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs) and Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs). Per the CFR, the Flight Safety System (FSS) may result in the following actions:  flight termination (i.e. mid-flight destruct); thrust termination where the vehicle glides to a safe landing (UAS, RLV) or crashes into an uninhabited region, or even a flight trajectory modification to an alternate safe landing site.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Intelligence; Space Transportation & Safety

Initial orbital operational capability for delivering 10 kg to a 250 km circular LEO is achieved with a two-stage, pressure-fed ""10/250"" Nanosat Launch Vehicle (NLV) that will pathfind performance, production, regulatory and operational challenges.  This NLV will then be followed by a clustered ""20/450"" Nano/Micro Satellite Launch Vehicle (NMSLV) that addresses this topic's primary objective of providing a capability to place nano and micro satellites weighing up to 20 kg into 450 km circular LEO.Aggressive leveraging of our team's existing NLV development initiative enables significant hardware development and the start of static fire testing during Phase I, followed by actual flight testing in Phase II for TRL-7 technology evaluations.  These tests have incrementally introduced state of the art capabilities like advanced propellants (LOX/propylene) and structures (composite cryogenic tanks).  The Phase I effort focuses on the development of the next class of test vehicle – a high altitude suborbital single booster stage (the ""P-K"") that features closed-loop thrust vector control (TVC) and candidate avionics technologies for guidance and navigation, as well as eventual autonomous flight termination systems (AFTS) for range safety, TRDRSS-based telemetry and tracking functions.  In addition, it will incorporate features needed to implement the clustered first stage configuration and second stage separation method associated with the 20/450 NMSLV. The Phase II effort will then focus on the further development of an NMSLV-type first stage with two additional  core boosters, for a total of three, and the conducting of a high-altitude demonstration flight.","Currently, 10/250 NLV-class test vehicles are already providing suborbital reusable launch services for NASA.  The next generation of such pathfinder test vehicles developed under this program will extend the test envelope for enabling launch technologies and operations needed to effectively implement orbital NMSLV-based operations.Longer term, the NMSLV configuration that emerges from this effort will be able to support such NASA programs like LSP's ELaNA and the Edison small satellite research initiative.  These can then be followed by launch and maintenance of global monitoring systems that feature low-cost CubeSat-class spacecraft.","Current NLV-class test vehicles are now being used to manifest and evaluate a variety of new launch vehicle technologies, including composite cryo propellant tanks, alternative hydrocarbon fuels (methane, propane and propylene), wireless data networking, and advanced vortex engines under TRL-6 and 7 environments.  The next generation of NMSLV-based test vehicles will expand these to TRL 8 and 9 conditions, while still providing secondary payload opportunities for small developers and STEM initiatives.Longer term, the resulting operational NMSLV can support the implementation of CubeSat-based commercial earth monitoring constellations, global space weather monitoring constellations for the Air Force, and rapid response for such organizations as the Army's SMDC and DOD Special Operations Command, as well as providing dedicated launch services for the DOD Space Test Program, Operationally Responsive Launch Office and the NRO's Colony II initiative.","Actuators & Motors; Attitude Determination & Control; Command & Control; Fasteners/Decouplers; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Launch Engine/Booster; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Space Transportation & Safety; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

To meet this demand, multiple private companies are pursuing the development of nano- and micro-launch vehicles (NMLV). However, NMLV builders lack suitable avionics platforms for both development and operational needs. Traditional launch vehicle avionics platforms exceed the SWaP requirements of an NMLV due to their use of redundant, aerospace grade components. To service the needs of NMLV builders, TUI proposes to develop the SWIFT-nanoLV avionics platform by leveraging its existing portfolio of SWIFT software-defined radios and other small satellite component technologies. Through the careful use of COTS components, modular design techniques, and software-defined architectures, the SWIFT-nanoLV avionics platform will not only meet the SWaP requirements of an NMLV, but will also help minimize the operating costs of NMLVs.

It will reduce the cost of these vehicles in primarily three ways:1. Minimizing vehicle weight by decreasing bulky cables and connectors - this increases the useful payload and decreases the propulsion requirements.2. Minimizing physical interconnects - this simplifies integration, testing, and launch control and thereby decreases the labor involved in these tasks.3. Enabling testing at the vehicle or module level - this reduces the total amount of testing at the component level resulting in a smaller required test budget.  It also reduces the mass of enclosures required in the vehicle.WICS will operate wireless networks as part of the closed-loop Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system and the vehicle's data acquisition system.  The two networks share many characteristics while diverging in a few areas based on their specific constraints.  The TVC network must minimize latency and maximize both throughput and reliability.  The data acquisition network must include paths from many locations througout the vehicle.  In order to maximize the return from Phase I, Invocon will concentrate its effort on developing proof-of-concept hardware and emphasize initial software development for the critical control application.","The primary NASA applications include the enabling of low cost launch vehicles and sounding rockets.

The Rapid Multiplex Microbial Detector (RMMD) amplifies the genetic material in a liquid sample to allow near real-time identification of specific genetic sequences of predetermined bacteria and fungi. This easy-to-use device incorporates a patented polymerase enzyme that enables rapid RNA amplification by reagents with superior long-term shelf life and thermal stability. To operate, a water sample is injected into the RMMD, where it is concentrated and mixed with the reagent. The RMMD is rapidly heated and maintained at an elevated temperature for approximately 15 minutes, then quickly cooled back to room temperature to amplify the genetic material in the sample, which is detected in real time by changes in fluorescence due to dye binding, thus providing quantification. pathogenic cells in the water sample can be rapidly detected quantitatively based on the time of development of fluorescence. Phase 1 activity will result in prototype hardware and software genetic amplification and detection of several pathogenic bacteria and fungi that will bring the technology to TRL 5. The anticipated results of the Phase 2 are an engineering development unit that consists of an amplification/detection process controller, sample cartridges, and reagents, that can be tested in space.","The RMMD provides quantitative indication of the presence of multiple waterborne pathogenic bacteria and fungi simultaneously within 60 minutes of sampling, with minimal consumable hardware. The RMMD reduces crew time by eliminating the need to unstow, check, and restow a test kit after 2 days, and again after 5 days. Unlike the Water Microbiology Kit (WMK), there is no need for a syringe of growth media, and the RMMD microbial capture device is smaller and lighter than that of the WMK. Another advantage of the rapid test is that if an infection is suspected in space, potential sources can be tested, and results determined quickly, so additional infections can be avoided. This technology can be used on the ISS and on future long-duration spaceflight missions.","The combined goals of this proposal will have a significant impact on terrestrial water quality management and on current diagnostic capability for detection of waterborne disease, especially in areas that are currently not well served. Enhanced access to in-the-field diagnosis of locally relevant diseases will improve sanitation among populations in resource-limited settings. The technology will also promote better understanding of the epidemiology of emerging zoonotic and pandemic pathogens in real-time, will significantly reduce the response time to serious outbreaks, and could help combat any potential future biological threats. The military can use the product for water testing in remote or resource limited environments. RMMD technology can be used for surface water quality testing for research and surveillance. In the area of potable water monitoring for pathogenic bacteria and fungi, the rapid turn-around time offered by the RMMD approach provides a benefit to the consumers wishing to quickly test samples for real estate, new well, and new construction applications. In addition, RMMD technology can be used for water quality assessment for aquaculture, an industry that provides the primary protein source for approximately one billion people. Production and food safety of all species are dramatically impacted by water quality.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Medical"

This need arises because of the high cost associated with returning samples to Earth for analysis, the limited availability of crew time, and the relatively modest capabilities and interfaces of the existing hardware on the International Space Station (ISS).  The goal of this project is the development of a miniature variable-pressure scanning electron microscope (MVP-SEM) that can be rapidly developed, space qualified, and deployed on the ISS.  The MVP-SEM is a cross-cutting tool for in situ topographical imaging and compositional X ray fluorescence mapping of uncoated conductive and non-conductive samples useful to multiple disciplines, including nondestructive imaging of inorganic and organic materials, surface contamination analyses, and scientific studies.  We can achieve our goal by leveraging previous NASA investments in the development of an electron gun control system, an electron focusing column design, and scanning and imaging system technology at NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center; a novel cathode from Applied Physics Technologies Incorporated (APTech); and space-qualified vacuum system technology and electronics from Creare.  With the head start provided by these previous investments, the MVP-SEM technology will provide flight qualified hardware that is similar to commonly used tools in biological and material science laboratories and could allow for an increased capacity of on-orbit analysis.","An MVP-SEM will provide the ISS with an additional on-orbit analytical tool which will allow for increased capacity of on-orbit analysis, thereby reducing the number of samples that must be returned to Earth.

For Mars exploration, a variable-pressure SEM will allow for the simultaneous study of organisms and the geological substrates they might live on, provide shape and size-scale information, detail how they interact with their environment, and impart context for other studies that provide detailed chemical information.Morphological and chemical characterization of lunar regolith in laboratories on Earth has been routinely accomplished using a SEM and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS).  Our SEM would allow similar analysis in situ.  A miniature variable pressure SEM would support both Medium (New Frontiers) and Large (Max-C) type missions, as outlined in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey 2013-2022.","Scanning electron microscopes are one of the most indispensable laboratory tools for making analytical measurements.

Our miniature variable pressure scanning electron microscope will be uniquely positioned to benefit from growth in this segment of the market due to its small size, low power, small mass, and excellent measurement capabilities.  The fact that our system will facilitate measurements in support of biology and biotechnology, Earth science, physical science, human research, technology development, and will also facilitate assessment of the health of materials and structures, suggests that potential commercial applications for the technology are wide and deep.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)"

LIDAR has proven its value in a number of applications, including the detection of clear-air turbulence, wind shear, and aircraft wake vortices.Of interest under this NASA sub-topic is the development of Lidar systems capable of detecting and measuring aircraft wake vortices in order to enhance aircraft separation criteria. To perform this task well a Lidar must have certain characteristics and be paired with a highly optimized wake processing algorithm.  Key areas of development include:- Pulse energy / pulse repetition frequency (PRF) combination to adequately sample a region of space containing the wake vortices. - Pulse width for optimally sampling the wake disturbance. Determination of the optimal range resolution for measuring wakes is algorithm dependent and is an area of current research.  - Scanner capable of efficiently scanning the region of interest.  The scanner needs to be able to report the elevation and azimuth accurately so that wake positions can be estimated.- Raw data acquisition and signal processing for generating range resolved Doppler spectral estimates. Processing should produce periodograms over the 2D or 3D region of interest with adequate frequency resolution, velocity bandwidth and with minimal distortion.  - Wake vortex algorithm for detecting, tracking and estimating the circulation strength and position of the vortices from the Doppler spectral estimates.SIBELLOPTICS proposes a Phase 1 SBIR to determine the feasibility of its compact, innovative fiber LIDAR sensor, now in Phase II development, to detect and measure wake vortices using spatially dependent spectral matched filter algorithms similar to those currently being developed for NASA by Coherent Research Group.","The Next Generation Air Transportation System program was developed to address the problems associated with the ever-increasing growth of aviation by improving efficiency at airports around the US. A major component of this effort is to reduce aircraft separation, which is highly dependent upon the development of instrumentation that can accurately monitor and measure wake vortices. The development and assessment of fast-time vortex models for use in optimizing aircraft separation during approach and departure operations is one example for which a thorough understanding of wake vortex dynamics is needed. At present there is no current operational system that will meet all of the requirements of a useful wake vortex sensor.  In the wake vortex sensing mode Windimager operates at a high PRF (20 kHz) and transmit a narrow pulse in order to sample the wake region with high longitudinal spatial resolution.  The localized scan and high PRF will allow Windimager to measure a tighter array of radial wind velocities commensurate with wake vortex estimation transvers resolution requirements, with range gates as short as 7.5m.  With regard to wake vortices, of significant interest is Windimager's potential to achieve relatively short pulses (<100 ns) of sufficient energy (~200 uJ). This capability, coupled with a near optimal wake vortex estimation algorithm, has the potential to yield a system that can provide very accurate estimates of vortex circulation strength and position.","Windimager has been designed to be an extraordinarily flexible, general purpose, wind measurement platform with applications in a number of different industries, including: 1. Wind EnergyWind energy generation is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and LIDAR technology is gaining a great deal of momentum in this market segment. Windimager can perform both wind assessment and power operations improvement, replacing multiple LIDARS or anemometer towers.  2. YachtingMaritime markets potentially include ocean-going vessels as well as subscription wind data and weather sales to harbors and ports.  There are four opportunities to address in this market: (1) the owners of luxury yachts, (2) the yacht manufacturers, (3) the yacht charter operators and (4) the harbor market where ships of all types operate. 3. MeteorologyEnvironmental scientists have successfully used Lidar systems to accurately track the direction and dispersion of factory atmospheric emissions and volcanic ash, as well conduct studies of the formation of typhoons.  4. Homeland SecurityWith its ability to monitor aerosol movements over large areas Windimager is an ideal platform to track the dispersion of atmospheric contaminants.  5. FirefightingSuccessful suppression of any large scale fire depends on an understanding of environmental factors which effect fire behavior.  Wind speed and direction are among the most important environmental influences.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Processing; Transport/Traffic Control"

Some of the delay that is imposed through the TDS process is necessary, but some of the delay may be unnecessary. The current TDS process is implemented through the Call for Release (CFR) process, which is also referred to as the Approval Request (APREQ) process. In this process, the Traffic Management Unit (TMU) informs the Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) that a specific group of flights cannot be cleared by the ATCT to take off until the departure release is approved by the TMU on an individual flight basis. When such CFR programs are in place, an ATC Specialist (ATCS) in the ATCT must contact the TMU via a voice line to request approval for a flight to depart. Once the TMU provides a release time window for the flight, the ATCS in the ATCT must then maneuver the flight to make sure that it takes off within the release time window, or else a new release time must be requested.The purpose of this proposal is to address research and development on the TDS by Exception process, or TDS-E. The TDS-E concept includes a computer automation system that monitors traffic demand in the en route streams of traffic, as well as demand of flights that will depart from airports under the en route stream and climb into the overhead stream. Instead of requiring all such departures to receive individual approval before they take off, under the TDS-E concept, the computer automation system will provide advisories to the TMU and to the ATCT to indicate when CFR procedures are required, and specifically which flights should be subject to CFR. Additional features of the TDS-E capability may provide guidance indicating that some of the normal CFR restrictions can be relaxed.","As this innovative concept is directly related to the air transportation system, the most appropriate application of the TDS-E concept and prototype will be further research on ATM operational improvements. NASA currently operates the NTX research station at the Ft. Worth FAA ARTCC facility. The TDS-E concept is well positioned for continued evaluation within NASA's Airspace Systems Program. Mosaic ATM has provided significant support on numerous projects in the successful transfer of NASA research into the operational inventory of the FAA. Our approach to this technology transfer is to provide support for the transfer process, but to remain within the direction of NASA and the FAA at all times. Using this approach, the research is properly recognized as NASA technology, and the FAA receives in-depth support from an organization that already knows the details of the technology.","The TDS-E concept can provide valuable information for airlines and other flight operators about the potential constraints and congestion that flights will experience in the NAS. The ability of TDS-E to predict when a CFR program is needed can be used by flight operators to know which of their flights may be subject to additional ground delays within a CFR program. Flight operators can then use this information to make operational decisions such as flight prioritization, crew and resource scheduling, and passenger notification and accommodation.Additional areas of potential use of the prediction and scheduling capabilities of the TDS-E concept include the management of complex coordination processes in the presence of uncertainty. Such operations may include the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in civilian airspace in the near future.",Air Transportation & Safety; Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling

Bridger will employ mechanically robust and environmentally insensitive monolithic laser and OPO designs making the transmitter well suited for continuous DIAL measurements from ground-based, airborne and space-based platforms.  Bridger estimates that the high efficiency and compact packaging offered by the proposed pump laser and OPO will result in an ozone DIAL transmitter that weighs <30 kg (including the control electronics), consumes less than 550 W of power at 110VAC, and costs less than $75,000 per unit.","NASA's primary application for the proposed transmitter would be widespread deployment of ground-based, airborne and space-based DIAL sensors to map atmospheric ozone with high spatial and temporal resolution.  This application is well aligned with NASA's Earth Science Directorate and immediately relevant to the TOLNet program.  This proposal will allow NASA to deploy networks of ozone sensors with smaller and/or more affordable DIAL transmitters than are currently available to meet multiple mission needs and make the best use of limited resources.  Additionally, our base pump laser can be parametrically shifted to the SWIR with a laser diode seeded OPO for sensing other atmospheric trace gasses including: CO, CO2, CH4, H2O and N2O.

The need for high temperature motors and actuators for robotic mechanisms is critical to explore the surface and atmosphere of Venus, Jupiter and/or Saturn.  Bear Technologies, LLC (Bear) proposes to create environmentally tolerant motors for robotic missions.  As identified by NRC and NASA there are no commercial actuators or motors that can work in wide variation and high temperature environments (-50 degrees Centigrade to 500 degrees Centigrade).  The current approach has been to shield or isolate the environment from these systems. The problem with this approach is that it limits the ability to explore on surface, increases the bulk and is expensive with temperature control systems.  The need is to create tolerant technologies that can operate in the extreme environment. Bear Technologies has been exploring motor design for more than 5 years.  Currently, Bear is working on a high torque direct drive electric motor under a Phase II award.   The concept proposed uses new design concepts coupled with tolerant material to create a temperature tolerant motor (TTM). The proposed motor concept has a fundamentally different design that offers offers higher torque and lower speed than traditional motor design.  This novel design will help minimize failure risks at extreme temperatures.  By combining certain extreme temperature materials with no ball bearing or lubrication, the Principle Investigator (PI) believes the motor concept has the potential to function for an increased period of time in extreme environments. Motor and actuator technologies that are capable of operating in the high-temperature (460 degrees C) and high-pressure (90 bars) Venus surface environment are needed for multiple robotic systems.","If the concept proves out for Venus conditions, it will work for cryogenic and hard vacuum environments.","Earth/Commercial/Science ApplicationsHigh pressure and high temperature motors are needed in the oil and gas exploration industry.

Operational data and domain knowledge from pilot and air traffic controller interviews are used to identify how pilots react to these elements in the National Airspace System (NAS).  The algorithm imbeds operational data and domain knowledge into human decision-making computer models; these models are then used to predict the future motion of the vehicle and to identify intent.

Existing fire sensors detect smoke or flame, indicating that the fire is in a relatively advanced stage, but these systems produce false alarms 199 times out of 200.  Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a fire onset detection system (FODS) that will: (a) detect fire at a very early stage, without false alarm, by performing trend analysis on key chemical markers and temperature, and (b) provide a continuous status update for intelligent decision making by the crew.

In 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that the incorporation of fire detectors in Class D cargo holds would result in a savings to the airlines of $458 million in incident and accident reductions over the lifetime of the aircraft that existed at that time. The dramatic reduction in false alarm, and increase in the sensitivity that IOS?s system offers will nearly double these savings. The system will also have applications in manufacturing facilities, buildings, and on ships.Other possible applications include: a) environmental gas sensing; b) flammable gas detection in the fire hazard areas; and c) evaluation of gas mixtures in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.Another potential application includes chemical and biological warfare agent detection by remotely tracing vapors of the explosives and chemicals. The market for chemical and biological warfare agent detectors could reach nearly $400 million in 2002, rising to $490 million by 2007."

Benefits of the PAS process such as a two-order magnitude reduction in oxygen contamination, enhanced flow characteristics, ability to produce pre-alloyed refractory metal powders and the ability to reduce heat treatment processing time were demonstrated during Phase I.  During Phase II, the PAS process will be optimized.  The optimized PAS Mo-Re and W-Re powders will be used for the production of robust, high temperature QMI and GEDS cartridges for microgravity processing experiments.",,"Commercial potential of the technology being developed during this effort is very high. The improved powder characteristics obtained by PAS processing will directly affect the coatings and powder industries, which represent multi-billion dollar markets.Other potential applications for the SBIR technology include, chemical processing, high temperature furnace and retort components, rocket motor throat inserts, radiation shields, heat pipes, power generation equipment, nuclear components, beam and sputter targets, solid waste incineration, automotive, printing industry."

Consequently, systems that have been designed for low Earth orbit may not be suitable for a mission to Mars.  One example of this is the system to recycle waste water.  A system that utilizes vacuum distillation and catalytic oxidation (VPCAR) is being developed for Mars missions.  A key step in the VPCAR process is the gas phase oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen and water without forming NOX.  In Phase I TDA Research Inc. developed catalysts for this reaction.  Our approach to the problem was centered on the development of a bifunctional catalyst, which could separate adsorbed oxygen and nitrogen atoms, thereby reducing NOX formation.  In Phase I we identified a catalyst formulation, which converted 100% of the ammonia feed at temperatures where very low concentrations of NOX were produced.  In Phase II, we will refine the catalyst composition, test both ammonia and hydrocarbon oxidation reactions in a pilot scale reactor, and then, in work carried out at Hamilton Sundstrand, we will test the reactor on a full-scale unit.",,"In addition to use on the VPCAR, a selective ammonia oxidation catalyst would have several major commercial applications.  One such application is in environmental catalysis, a field that generates approximately $2 billion in revenue per year.  Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is an effective method for controlling NOX emissions from stationary sources including coal-fired power plants power plants.  In this method ammonia is injected into the effluent, and, in the presence of a catalyst, and it reduces NOX to nitrogen.  However to be effective, excess ammonia must be present.  Unfortunately, this results in ammonia emissions.  Thus, if an ammonia oxidation catalyst were located downstream of the SCR unit, the excess ammonia could be oxidized to nitrogen and thus the ammonia slip problem could be eliminated.  Another application is to oxidize ammonia in stripped sour gas streams.  If ammonia is present in these streams, undesirable reactions occur, causing a number of problems in the refinery.  Thus, a catalyst that would completely oxidize ammonia to nitrogen would eliminate these problems.  In both of these cases, the catalyst must have high selectivity for nitrogen and water and produce very low concentrations of NO or NO2."

The perceptual situation of an astronaut exposed to unusual gravitational-inertial forces has been compared to that found in experiments involving perceptual rearrangement, such as optically induced displacement, curvature, tilt, or right-left reversal.  In both instances, the observer is confronted with a variety of inter- and intra-sensory conflicts that initially disrupt perception and behavior and may cause nausea.  However, people are able to adapt to these imposed conflicts, as manifested in a reduction or elimination of the initial disruptive responses.  Overcoming motion sickness and regaining normal perception may involve many of the same processes as adaptation to perceptual rearrangement in general.  Our Phase I research demonstrated that adaptation training is beneficial as it reduces dizziness and motion sickness symptoms experienced in both VR and OKN environments.  In Phase II research, we propose to run studies to test further the effects of adaptation training on sickness by inducing motion sickness in a VR device with an added ?reafference? component.  Phase II research will also involve refining and replicating Phase I findings, broadening the aftereffect conditions to which adaptation applies (sickness, posture, eye hand coordination, changes)",,"In recent years the possibility that space motion sickness might interfere with performance has been a major concern.  As the word ""interfere"" suggests, the concern has been that space motion sickness might interrupt ongoing activities, e.g. as frank emesis does.  An additional concern is that nausea as a negative reinforcer might lead to responses that could, in principle, be performed long after motion sickness proper had subsided.  The responses most likely to be affected are head and eye movements. It is possible that these learned nausea-avoidance responses continue to affect an astronaut?s performance adversely although he or she may have no direct awareness of their presence. Based on recent studies with visual reality (VR) devices conducted in our laboratory through software changes we are able to rapidly reconfigure VR hardware and thereby produce systematic and replicable changes in the incidence and severity of motion sickness symptomatology among participants.

Triton addresses this challenge by developing new polymer nanocomposite-based materials solutions for food packaging.  Nanocomposite materials, based in high-barrier resins, such as PET, EVOH, and polyethylene, can outperform unfilled materials in ways crucial to the needs of NASA and the extended-flight missions.  Triton Nanocomposites increase the barrier capabilities of such materials by over 2-3 times.  Nanocomposites remain lightweight, flexible, moldable and fully recyclable. With such dramatic increases in barrier properties, nanocomposites can allow the necessary weight and volume of food packaging to be reduced by at least half with decreased packaging wall-thickness.  These unique advantages result from the nano-dispersion of very high aspect ratio (>100:1), organically-modified layered alumino-silicates (ORMLASTM).  The successful nanocomposite contains well-dispersed and highly orientated nano-platelets, which form an inorganic barrier to diffusing species.  This remarkable nano-structure also increases strength and tensile modulus without loss of flexibility and the low-loading levels (2-8%) do not result in any weight-increase or loss of processibility.  Reduced resistance to heat and moisture makes these materials fully retortable as well as microwaveable and compatible for use with convection ovens, or hot-water-injection.",,"Triton has successfully produced large-scale food packaging tray prototypes incorporating our high barrier nanocomposite resins through commercial food packaging partners.   This accomplishment has also attracted commercial attention from major food and beverage packagers in the US and abroad.  The nanocomposite materials remain as flexible, recyclable, and versatile as the unfilled resin counterparts while providing enhanced oxygen barrier for extended shelf life.  Since these effects are achieved at very low loading levels of the nanoscopic fillers, the approach is highly cost-effective.  The nanocomposite structure enables unparalleled reductions in wall-thickness for bottles, retort pouches and thermoformed trays resulting in lower shipping, processing, and materials costs"

The ability to easily access, move and transform data is critical for IAI in that large enterprise organizations have numerous disparate sources of information that they need to integrate.  Similarly, intelligence organizations that we have been working with (e.g., US SOCOM) are very interested in improving their technology for gathering and integrating geospatial and intelligence data.

The 500 gram, 1 Watt, instrument will be able to determine spacecraft floating potential to within 0.1 volt for each second in flight. The SCM's performance represents an order of magnitude improvement over what is available now. In Phase II we will advance the SCM from laboratory prototype to flight prototype. We will develop flight electronics, a flight sensor head, calibrate the instrument, put it through a series of tests for flight worthiness, and deliver the fully tested flight instrument and documentation to NASA. The Phase II work will produce an SCM for flight tests, and will prepare us for the Phase III production of instruments.",,"There are three markets in aerospace for use of the SCM: 1) scientific use in low earth orbit, 2) use for the detection of hazardous charge, and, 3) use for the detection of charge in the solar wind. We have already made a significant advance into the first market. The SCM has been included in one of two proposals now pending for the NPOESS satellite system. If funded, $3-5 million would be available for the production of the Goembel Instruments SCM starting as early as late 2002. We expect continued success in marketing the instrument to both the private sector and the Government (for all three uses given above). For instance, the SCM would excel at monitoring the floating potential of the International Space Station, which charges to dangerously high levels. The SCM could be used on its own to warn of high levels of charge or it could be used in conjunction with a discharge device to reduce charge. The relatively modest expenditure by NASA in Phase II would do a great deal to advance the state of the art in spacecraft charge sensing and make an inexpensive, compact, reliable spacecraft charge monitor available to all."

The key technological advantage offered by the sensors developed under this program is their ability to be highly multiplexed, allowing the placement of literally thousands of sensors along a single optical fiber.  There are three strategic objectives for the Phase II: 1) Fully validate the DGDS technology for space reactor applications, 2) Expand the application base for DGDS sensor technology, and 3) Develop strategy for commercial development.  The primary objective is to finalize sensor designs using specifications obtained from NASA and industry partners so that prototypes can be constructed.  Resolving high temperature operation is a major portion of this objective.  The application base will be expanded by designing sensors that can measure temperature, strain, pressure, and flow.

Manual surveys are intrusive to space craft activities and crews.  An automated process of leak detection and location is needed.  IVC proposes to do this with  (a) existing space qualified hardware, (b) an addition of wideband ultrasonic transducers, and (c) new ""smart"" software algorithms that process emitted leak energy in a manner that results in detection and location of the leak.  The uniqueness of the proposed approach is the use of large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, ""stick on"" ultrasonic sensory nodes that are all synchronized within a radio frequency network and are self calibrating.  The network provides the data paths and synchronization. Ultrasonic transducers can act as transmitters as well as receivers. Thus the sensor network calibrates itself thus increasing detection and location accuracy.

Operating machines, whether for transportation, manufacturing, or maintenance give off residual wide band energy.  Flaws in the machine will produce uncharacteristic spectral patterns of energy that can also be first recognized as anomalous and later evaluated to determine the nature and severity of the malfunction.  Application of this NASA technology to complex machines would establish an automated process for machine inspection routines currently provided by expensive and error prone manual methods.  Automotive, submarine, aircraft, and ship structures display a characteristic sonic and ultrasonic vibration pattern when excited.   These patterns are functions of the structure type, weight, and bulk modulus of the materials.  Accurate detection and mapping of these patterns and their dynamic characteristics are critical to noise suppression design.  This technology would allow miniature wireless sensor units to be place quickly and easily on the surfaces to be tested so as to not damp the signals producing the noise."

The first is for the probes themselves.

Like silkworms, this vehicle could spool out an optical fiber, delivering a communication lifeline to survivors trapped in collapsed structures. Military applications include mine countermeasures and stealth operations, for example, deployed from a submarine, transiting through open water, moving inland via rivers or sewer pipes, onto shore and then overland, even climbing stairs or other structures. Sensors or ordinance packages could be stealthily deployed en route. The vehicle could swim to a predetermined site, bury itself, and remain on station for extended periods collecting data or awaiting further instructions.

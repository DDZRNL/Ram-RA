The smart nanostructured modifiers represent a significant discovery as the adhesion strength of our novel and commercial-off-the-shelf aerospace adhesives was increased by > 40% with inclusion of such systems upon aging in 100% relative humidity (RH), ten days, 140F.  Of significant importance to manufacturability and dual-use commercialization, the novel modifying agents are inert, inorganic-organic, halogenated hybrid copolymers, and hence can be used with virtually any adhesive, paint or environmental aerospace materials systems.  The inorganic poly(octahedral silsesquioxane) (POSS), fluorination and copolymer molecular weight can be synthetically engineered to complement any paste of film adhesive.  The TRL of the novel adhesive system would be increased from 6-8 during Phase II.","NASA applications for the ultra-hydrophobic, nanostructured, modifiers and high performance, halogenated, POSS-copolymers include moisture/corrosion mitigating structural aerospace adhesives, anti-ice conformal coatings and gamma radiation resistant composites.  At the systems level, the moisture resistant, environmentally tunable adhesive systems would prevent the spontaneous bond dissociation associated with water wicking at the metal-epoxy interface of bonded joints.  In humid environments, diffusion through the bulk epoxy adhesive on composite-composite bonded joints would be mitigated via a reduction in the free volume of the water permeable epoxy.  The universal, inert nanostructured modifiers could therefore support composite or metal aircraft substructures.  For dual-use NASA applications, NanoSonic's spray ESA process is an economically feasible option for manufacturing multilayer nanostructured stacks and environmental coatings for large area aircraft and space structures.  NanoSonic's hydrophobic, yet polar, hybrid adhesives and coupling agents offer excellent adhesion, moisture and corrosion resistance over a wide service temperature range of -90oC to > 450oC.","NanoSonic's high performance polar, yet hydrophobic adhesives would result in advanced aerospace adhesives and surface treatments with increased durability to minimize subsonic aircraft aging and durability related hazards with a TRL of 6 upon completion of the Phase I program.  NanoSonic's polar resins are synthetically engineered to offer stronger adhesion over commercial aircraft adhesives, and the hydrophobic backbone allows for superior moisture resistance and corrosion mitigation.  The down-selected polymers would also serve as adhesives or sealants with solvent resistant against jet fuel, sea water and harsh aircraft solvents.  The adhesives offered will be delivered in volumes up to 55 gallon drums and are roll-to-roll compatible for repair appliqué.  TRL 9 would be reached via successful flight testing and platform integration of the adhesives onto commercial subsonic, supersonic and near-space aircraft such as 787 Dreamliner, V-22, AH-1, UH-60 F/A-18, JSF, HAA and ISIS.",Airframe; Airlocks/Environmental Interfaces; Airport Infrastructure and Safety; Ceramics; Composites; Cooling; Erectable; General Public Outreach; Inflatable; K-12 Outreach; Kinematic-Deployable; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Modular Interconnects; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Organics/Bio-Materials; Production; Radiation Shielding Materials; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety; Tankage; Testing Requirements and Architectures; Thermal Insulating Materials

However, life management for composites is in its infancy compared to life management for metal structures.  Limitations in the ability of standard nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods to observe manufacturing quality and in-service damage evolution of composite structures may prevent designers from realizing their full potential.  Current NDE practices are incapable of overcoming these limitations.  Thus, a new framework and methodology is needed for high resolution imaging and tracking of manufacturing quality and damage evolution.The goal of this program is to enable assessment of the matrix, fiber, and bonding conditions for composites using a combination of detailed physics-based models, high resolution imaging, and controlled loading sources to isolate the composite characteristic of interest.  Micromechanical models allow quantitative determination of composite constituent properties.  This program focuses on magnetic field sensing (i.e., eddy-current) methods that can be combined with structural analysis to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of these NDE methods.  JENTEK and MR&D are well-positioned to deliver this methodology in the form of commercial software and NDE equipment.  We will also work with a major aircraft OEM to maintain our focus on practical solutions to high priority needs.","If the program is successful, it will provide NASA with a framework in which a variety of NDE methods can deliver enhanced performance for manufacturing quality assessment and life management of composite components and bonded structures.  This will be enabled by improving the understanding of the interactions between the incident energy associated with particular NDE methods and the composite constituents. This program will also deliver a new capability for inspection of stresses within the composite and at buried interfaces.  This will be valuable for both aircraft structures and spacecraft components such as composite overwrap pressure vessels.","Civilian aircraft designers will experience the same benefits in terms of being able to more fully utilize the capability of composite aircraft components to provide weight reductions, payload improvements and fuel efficiency.

The individualized OFS assessment model is trained and individualized using different sources of training input (physiological signals, system dynamics measurements, etc.) and training output derived from the dynamic cognitive workload reference analysis.

Loss of control incidents can be attributed to variety of factors including environmental (icing, clear air turbulence, wakes, etc.), failure of aircraft components (stuck control surfaces, failure of hydraulic systems, broken cables, etc.), human factors (pilot error, insufficient training, crew distraction, etc.) or a combination of any of them. Usually the final catastrophic event is linked to nonlinear phenomenon (like stall) and there is a small time window of opportunity for the pilot (or the flight computer) to recover but the action they take are critical to any such recovery. In Phase I, we have demonstrated how nonlinear equilibrium analysis can be brought to bear upon this problem to understand the dynamic behavior of the aircraft outside of the nominal operating regime. We have also shown using NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) how such tools may be used to dynamically estimate the operational envelope of the aircraft. In Phase II, we will extend the methodology to design an on-board envelope protection system and study upset recovery schemes. The analytical tools will be supported by the development of commercial grade software for on-board envelope estimation and upset recovery for unimpaired and impaired aircraft.

To this end, Aurora proposes the innovation of applying a suitable version of these algorithms to the design of a flare maneuver guidance and planning logic.

For engine manufacturers, especially manufacturers of diesel engines, the improved performance of the aerodynamic lens combined with the capability to directly obtain size resolved soot measurements is critical to guide efforts to design end-of-pipe exhaust treatments.  In the biomedical field, aerosol drug delivery is an important therapy for a growing number of treatments, including insulin.  Moreover, the potential human health impacts of nanotechnology and nanotechnology enhanced consumer products is becoming an area of increasing concern.  In the chemical industry, nanoparticles have become an important part of many commercial products and chemical processes.  On-line characterization of functional nanoparticles is therefore an important application of the new technologies.  For energy applications, PM emissions of clean coal power plants are to come under tighter regulation and an instrument that can monitor and characterize the PM emissions will improve efforts to reduce power plant emissions.",Aircraft Engines; Particle and Fields

This capability is very important due to the extreme scramjet operational environment, which makes cut-and-try development approaches impractical. With UCDS, it will be possible to accurately predict the scramjet pressure oscillation amplitudes, along with critical parameters, including the unsteady wall heat flux.The UCDS tools were recently applied to the Ares I thrust oscillation issue in support of NASA's Thrust Oscillation Focus Team (TOFT). After validating the UCDS capabilities by analyzing the RSRM, GTL applied the tool to identify a relatively minor motor modification that should eliminate the organized motor oscillations.Building upon this validation, GTL took the first step towards extending UCDS to scramjets in the Phase I effort.  While a variety of issues and challenges were uncovered during the effort, the effort confirmed that the UCDS framework is fully applicable to scramjets.  However, the effort also revealed that the DCR scramjet is far more complicated and difficult to analyze than a typical rockets.   In the Phase II effort, GTL proposes to address the key issues that were identified during the Phase I effort.","Since the UCDS models are built from a general formulation, they can be used to analyze practically any combustion device, including rockets (liquid, solid, hybrid), turbojets (combustors, augmentors), ramjets, scramjets, combined cycle engines and so on. As such, UCDS can be used by NASA in the development of practically any propulsive device. Specific near term NASA applications for UCDS include: - Continued effort to mitigate the Ares I thrust oscillation effort - Working with the Ares V team to avoid potential thrust oscillation issues - Supporting the Constellation Program by identifying and avoiding potential stability issues that will arise when engines and motors are scaling up to meet performance requirements - Supporting the development of new propulsion devices, such as scramjets","With its broad capabilities, UCDS can be used by any combustion device developer, including the Air Force, Navy, Army, MDA, DARPA, DOE, and commercial propulsion developers, such as ATK, Aerojet, Pratt & Whitney and others. One specific non-NASA applications for UCDS is the Air Force/Aerojet Hydrocarbon Boost Engine development program.",Aircraft Engines; Chemical; Fundamental Propulsion Physics; Monopropellants; Simulation Modeling Environment

Such expectations are amplified in the VIP market where people are used in the acoustic and vibration levels of civil and executive jets.  One of the most critical excitations for interior noise in helicopters is the one from the gearbox.   Thus, the structure-borne noise path (i.e. excitation propagating from mounting locations through the fuselage structure to the panels of the cabin and to the interior) must be captured in rotorcraft interior noise computations.

The development of algorithms that leverage and recognize the interactions and interdependencies between DAC and TFM is the key innovation of this effort. Some examples of expected operational improvements include 1) reduction in congestion and delays when sector capacities (Monitoring Alert Parameter or Dynamic Density) are violated, 2) reduction in controller workload and improved safety, 3) ability to accommodate user preferred routes and weather uncertainty and 4) achieve a balance between airborne delay and grounding holding delay. The SBIR Phase-I effort demonstrated how a combined DAC-TFM algorithm determines an optimal airspace configuration different from a DAC-only algorithm and could result in minimization of peak count and dwell time variance. The effort also included the design and preliminary implementation of a TFM model that uses ARTCC sector configuration to determine the delays that is generated, absorbed and propagated. The Phase II effort includes development of DAC-TFM framework as an enhancement to NASA's ACES- DADS (Dynamic Airspace Design Service) work and interaction of NASA's airspace partitioning DAC algorithms such as MxDAC, DAU slicing and Sector Combination algorithms with the TFM models using the same framework.","We anticipate the post applications for this technology to be initially tied very closely to NASA's Airspace DAC research efforts.

Advancements in aircraft capabilities via new technologies can enable aircraft to operate more efficiently in the NAS and to operate safely in areas previously restricted.  AeroTech proposes to enhance the assessment of Performance Based Operations (PBO) by implementing the Autonomous Weather Hazard Avoidance Model (AWHAM) into ATM simulations providing autonomous guidance for aircraft thru hazardous weather regions.  PBO and traffic flow schemes can be assessed for any scenario by varying the detection capabilities of simulation aircraft, regulations, and/or policies, and examining deviation decisions, flight paths, safety impacts, and NAS throughput.  Phase II will involve implementing the hazard avoidance model into an operational simulation and performing a proof of concept study that will establish and quantify the benefits of aircraft equipped with particular hazard detection capabilities from the perspective of an aircraft operator.  AeroTech also proposes to develop the structure and architecture for integrating the AWHAM with the Autonomous Operations Planner, which provides pilots assistance in determining flight paths that comply with safety constraints and reduce operational costs.","When the goals of the Phase II research and development are met, the Autonomous Weather Hazard Avoidance Model will be supportive of NASA's NextGen-Airspace program's goal to develop methodologies and techniques to minimize or solve the demand/capacity imbalance problem in the NextGen future.  The proposed Model will support level 1 and 2 research areas in Traffic Flow Management (TFM), Separation Assurance, and System-Level Design Analysis & Simulation Tools by improving the autonomous decision making capabilities of simulation aircraft, enabling the exploration of Performance Based Operations (PBO) based on aircraft weather detection capabilities, enabling the assessment of 4-D weather cube information for PBO, and enabling the development and testing of new TFM techniques that maximize airspace usage through PBO.

Along with the ability to generate new systems and technologies comes the need to rigorously evaluate, and eventually validate, the effectiveness of these concepts. However, it is often challenging to translate simulation data into useful, integrated, and contextually-based assessments. Many critical findings are not identified for this reason, which could otherwise guide researchers toward advancements with NextGen technologies. Aptima proposes to develop the Use-driven Testbed for Evaluating Systems and Technologies (U-TEST), a flexible toolset that helps NextGen researchers to efficiently extract findings on pilot performance in simulated flight environments. Three primary components are: (1) context-capturing software will guide researchers to key events and allow important contextual information to be gathered for analysis; (2) a data integration platform that will automate organization of data sources into a format conducive to analysis; and (3) context-based analysis software that will enable deep, focused analysis by combining a quick-look function, an algorithm for focusing analysis, and context-based playback of key events and trials. U-TEST will be an extensible toolset that can help NextGen researchers improve the amount and quality of findings across a range of studies.","U-TEST will be designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will therefore offer utility to a range of aviation research groups within NASA. In particular, U-TEST will help researchers meet multiple milestones within NASA's Airspace Project, Airportal Project, and Aviation Safety Program. In the NextGen ATM-Airspace Project, U-TEST will provide the capability to rapidly assess the impact of emerging NextGen technologies on pilot performance to inform redesign. This will include providing feedback on NASA's Cockpit Situation Display to guide future modification efforts. In the NextGen ATM-Airportal Project, U-TEST will assist with the collection, integration, and analysis of human performance data within the airportal environment, including gates, taxiways, runways, and approach airspace. In the Aviation Safety Program, U-TEST can support evaluations of pilot performance with novel human-machine integration designs and operations.","The flexibility and extensibility of U-TEST will also offer utility to many groups external to NASA that conduct flight simulations. First, avionics developers (e.g., Boeing, Honeywell, Garmin, Avidyne) can use U-TEST to collect evaluation data throughout the technology development lifecycle, thus reducing certification time. Second, many human factors researchers (e.g., FAA, MITRE, ARINC, universities) perform similar research and development tasks as NASA, and would benefit from the collection, integration, and analysis capabilities provided by U-TEST. Third, training directors must understand the effects of flight deck technologies to develop the training curriculum that prepares pilots for NextGen.

With this concept applied to surface operations at major airports, NASA's NextGen-Airportal Project is exploring the use of surface 4-dimensional (4D) trajectories, which use required times of arrival (RTAs) at selected locations along the route. Observing these RTAs as constraints along the taxi route, the flight still has many degrees of freedom in adjusting its state profiles (i.e.,  position, velocity, etc. as functions of time) to achieve the timing constraints. This research will investigate whether and how these degrees of freedom in trajectory control may be used to achieve desirable behaviors for the taxi operations. Previous research has applied the trajectory control freedom to assure passenger comfort by keeping the accelerations and decelerations within pre-specified limits, and yet there is still untapped flexibility in designing the trajectories. The proposed research will explore this trajectory design problem to achieve additional desirable behaviors, beginning with the consideration of fuel burn, emissions, and noise. A flight-deck automation experimental prototype will provide the platform for simulating the designs, augmented by models developed to evaluate environmental benefits. The findings will benefit future designs of flight-deck automation systems, as well as tower automation systems which rely on accurate understanding of the flight deck's operational behaviors to plan efficient and safe operations for the entire surface traffic.","The proposed research contributes directly to trajectory-based surface operations (TBSO), which constitute an important area of research being pursued by the NextGen-Airportal Project under NASA's Airspace Systems Program. The research will produce realistic and favorable surface 4D trajectory designs to enable TBSO. Sharing these design models with the control tower will allow its automation system to plan safe and efficient operations, and enhance separation assurance by using the models to infer intent when monitoring the traffic movements.","Whereas NASA's NextGen-Airportal Project investigates innovative new technologies, approaches, and procedures to enable capacity enhancements within the airport and terminal domains to meet the JPDO NextGen capacity goals, products from the proposed research will contribute to this cause. The research findings will strengthen the understanding of flight-deck automation potentials for trajectory-based surface operations (TBSO) to help avionics companies design and develop flight control systems that enable such operations.

Improvements to current methods of spacing aircraft could significantly increase airportal capacity, but there is currently limited awareness of wake encounters and information with which to assess spacing in real-time or to design new spacing schemes. AeroTech proposes to improve situational awareness of wake vortices and enhance the prediction of wake vortex transport and decay by continuing development of the In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS). The VEDARS will quantitatively detect wake encounters from flight data; downlink encounter reports in real-time to enhance ATC awareness and enable assessment of spacing schemes; and collect and report meteorological parameters from aircraft for use in wake transport and decay predictions. AeroTech is also proposing to improve the accuracy and reliability of reported wind speed and direction (and hence crosswind estimation) by improving and validating an estimator for sideslip angle. A reliable and accurate crosswind estimate is a key component in predicting the transport of wakes. By the end of Phase II, the operational feasibility concept for the VEDARS will have been established.","The In Situ Wake Vortex Encounter Detection and Reporting System (VEDARS) will directly support NASA's NextGen-Airportal project goal to realize an airportal environment that will achieve the highest possible throughput and operational efficiency, while balancing safety and environmental requirements. VEDARS will support the Safe and Efficient Surface Operations and Coordinated Arrival and Departure Operations Management (CADOM) focus areas by enhancing researchers' awareness of wake encounters; supporting the assessment and optimization of merging and spacing schemes; providing data that assists in the characterization and prediction of wake transport and decay; and providing a capability for simulations that can be used to assess airportal operations and procedures within various weather conditions and airfield layouts.

NASA currently maintains an inventory of balances that were designed for previous model designs and operating ranges that may not be as relevant to current test conditions. Project resources do not always allow a balance to be designed for specific testing applications due to the associated costs and schedule. Luna Innovations is proposing to develop new and innovative force balance technology that will reduce the cost of facility instrumentation and allow for reduced design and instrumentation time, while providing more accurate and reliable results when compared to current balances. This development utilizes proven fiber optic sensor technology that integrates active thermal compensation with a highly accurate, multi-channel sensing network. The versatile operating range of this technology with respect to temperatures and loading conditions, combined with a high channel count data processing system designed by Luna, will provide advanced measurement capabilities for NASA facilities and enable accurate testing of emerging propulsion and transport technologies.","The implementation of fiber optic technology into a 6-component force balance will enable improved accuracy in aerodynamic measurements made across NASA facilities under a variety of test conditions at a reduced cost when compared to traditional, electrically instrumented balances. Operating at a reduced cost will allow more extensive testing of design features and system level designs in support of the next generation CEV, Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), and advanced propulsion systems. The reduced machining and instrumentation cost of the balances themselves will also enable individual designs to be completed for specific models at a scale that was previously not feasible due to project resource limitations. The versatile operating ranges of this technology will also reduce the design time as the limits of aerodynamic testing are extended. This technology will demonstrate itself as being vital to increasing the future design and testing capabilities of NASA.","While NASA is the leader in fundamental research for advancing aerospace technology within the United States, commercial entities are also working to advance the state-of-the-art in high and low-speed propulsion, flight vehicles, and fundamental aerospace sciences. Key to verification of computer simulations is the ability to cost effectively obtain data under ground based simulated flight conditions. The technology developed during this project will enable commercial air and spacecraft developers to obtain vital data which will improve vehicle design, safety, and efficiency.   In addition, the strain gauges and system developed during this program will also be applicable across industry to all harsh-environment applications in which electrical gauges cannot survive. Fiber optic gauges provide a miniature, non-intrusive method of accurately measuring strain and temperature while, as opposed to electrical gauges, are EMI-resistant.

New technologies and test procedures are therefore needed to maximize the investments and reduce some of the related costs associated with flight test. To address this need, Systems Technology, Inc. is developing a Fused Reality (FR) Flight system that allows a virtual environment to be integrated with the test aircraft so that tasks such as aerial refueling, formation flying, or approach and landing can be accomplished without additional aircraft or risk of operating in close proximity to the ground or other aircraft. Furthermore, for the first time, the dynamic motions of the simulated objects can be directly correlated with the responses of the test aircraft. The FR Flight system will allow real-time observation of and manual interaction with the cockpit environment that serves as a frame for the virtual out-the-window scene.","Following the successful completion of a Phase 2 in-flight evaluation program, a prototype FR-based flight test system will be ready to transition into a commercially viable product. The FR system will have potential applications for NASA, other government agencies, and commercial aviation. For NASA this product will directly address the stated need for highly innovative and more efficient flight test techniques. FR will reduce the need for specific aircraft that are costly and often difficult to schedule. Critical flight test evaluation tasks involving other aircraft and related dynamic elements can still be conducted in a safe and repeatable manner.","For other government agencies, specifically the DoD, a FR-based flight test system will find new uses in addition to those identified for NASA.

For commercial aviation, a FR-based flight test system can be used for up-and-away collision avoidance training, poor visibility approach and landings, runway incursions, etc. Finally, a powerful FR application is in-flight synthetic vision for actual operations during impoverished or uncertain visual environments. Here, the entire cockpit window area can be a virtual HUD where symbology/objects are superimposed on or replace the actual out-of-the-window scene.

As data rates dramatically increase due to new sensor technologies and the desire to pack even more sensors on spacecraft, it is imperative that new solutions be compact in size, light in weight, be high speed, and highly power efficient. NASA has recognized optical links offer potential improvements in power and in size due to a substantially narrower beam and smaller components. An ideal technology for such links is a laser transmitter master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) using pulse position modulation techniques.  In Phase I, a design was developed for a laser transmitter MOPA with a wall-plug efficiency of up to 23% operating at 1560nm. Operating at longer wavelength offers a number of advantages including the use of numerous off-the-shelf components. This Phase II proposal will demonstrate a working prototype of the design at a Technology Readiness Level 4 by the end of the program.","High power fiber master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) transmitters provide the basis of high speed deep space communications links using pulse position modulation. NASA has planned for such devices to be used in future spacecraft. Previous work has demonstrated laser transmitter MOPAs up to 100 MHz with wall plug efficiencies up to 18% and operating at 1064nm which requires bulky optical components. The techniques developed in this proposal will provide improvements in efficiency, data rate, size, and weight compared to designs already investigated by NASA.","Fast rise time MOPA structures for optical communications can serve as ideal input sources for eye safe pulsed fiber laser based sources for material processing and other scientific applications.  The flexible beam path and distributed thermal dissipation make fiber lasers ideal  for many applications, especially CW ones, and for this reason fiber lasers have made significant inroads into many CW based laser markets such as material processing and long pulse laser marking.  Pulsed fiber lasers have not been successful in penetrating laser markets due the adverse effects of fiber non-linearities on pulse width, and non-linear optical generation efficiency.  At peak powers in the 100's of kW, nonlinear optical effects play a destructive role in widening pulses and lowering peak powers.  A well designed MOPA structure can alleviate many of these problems. The narrow pulse width and fast rise times of the MOPA system create opportunities for temporal pulse shaping and multi-pulse operation.  These techniques have already proven themselves successful in semiconductor memory repair and high speed resistor trimming.

Replacement of the waveguide components by micromachined parts that provide significant size, weight, and cost reduction without substantially affecting the electrical performance, can lead to a breakthrough in wireless communications.  During the Phase I program, Nuvotronics utilized its proprietary PolyStrataTM metal micromachining process to create X and Ka band filters with state-of-the-art performance.  During Phase II, tunable filters will be fabricated using the PolyStrata process and tuned using reliable and low actuation voltage MEMS devices.  The filters will be designed and tested for space operation and have immediate applications in the Deep Space Network communications system.  The PolyStrata process is capable of producing high Q, low weight and therefore compact filters.  The PolyStrata process is a new multi-layer technology that creates high quality air loaded copper microdevices.  High quality cavity resonator filters can be fabricated using this high precision micro-fabrication process, enabling very high Q filters while being compact, surface mountable and compatible with the integration of active chips.","Our primary goal is to provide NASA with robust space-capable technology that is lower cost, lower weight, and has improved performance over current technology.  The initial application is within deep space probes that communicate with the Deep Space Network system in the X and Ka bands.  Future missions require higher bandwidth capability, and as channels in the X band become crowded, NASA requires components at higher bandwidth in the Ka band with reduced size, weight, and power consumption.  Nuvotronics will be capable of offering products to NASA and its subcontractors at the end of the Phase II to satisfy this requirement.  The results of this Phase II will potentially support future on-board satellite communication requirements for NASA and millimeter wave sensing applications for landing and collision avoidance in radars on NASA platforms.  Future missions supported include Juno - a solar powered spacecraft set to launch in 2011 and orbit Jupiter, Constellation -   manned missions to Low Earth Orbit, the moon and ultimately Mars, and future spacecraft and rovers supporting the Mars Exploration Program.","Potential applications for devices enabled by the Polystrata components exist in both DOD and Commercial Markets.  Advanced DOD communication systems under development such as the WIN-T tactical network require advanced microwave components in order to meet the demanding applications of satellite communications while on-the-move.  In addition to communications, devices developed on this program applied to higher frequency operation have applications in DOD radar systems for short range all-weather radars and automotive collision avoidance radar.  Non-defense communications applications exist in higher frequency communications systems (60 GHz, E, Q, and/or W bands) for high speed datacommunications servicing backhaul, wireless enterprise bridge, wireless fiber lateral emulation, government and public safety networks, WirelessHD, and WiMax markets.",Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Highly-Reconfigurable; Microwave/Submillimeter; RF

The new MAC protocol includes a novel mechanism of TDMA overlaying CSMA/CA and ensures scalable throughput and QoS performance in the hierarchical multihop wireless mesh networks proposed for lunar surface networks. The new MAC protocol will be implemented on top of a reconfigurable 802.11 radio and is compatible to legacy 802.11 networks. It also includes advanced features like efficiency power management, adaptive channel width for improving receiver sensitivity and communication range, and error control for eliminate errors due to radiation and radio burst. The hybrid routing protocol combines the advantages of ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing and disruption/delay tolerant network (DTN) routing. Its performance is significantly better than AODV or DTN, and is particularly effective to wireless networks with intermittent links, as in lunar surface networks and orbit access. In this proposal a detailed prototyping plan to implement the developed protocols is also presented. By the end of Phase II, a prototype system will be available for demonstrating the delivered technical objectives proposed in this proposal.","The proposed technologies can support lunar exploration and will be used to provide scalable lunar surface networking and orbit access. Similar application scenario can be found even in Earth environment, where the surface network will be on the Earth surface and the orbit access will be from Earth to its satellite. The same technologies can be applied to the explorations of other stars like Mars and also to any deep-space communication networks. They will become critical building blocks of Inter-Planetary Internet.","The same technologies can be adapted to DoD applications. For example, a communication network formed by both planes and ground battling units is similar to the integrated system of lunar surface networks and orbit access. The developed technologies can be applied other military networks such as batterfield networks and airborne networks. On the non-government market, the most promising application areas will be IEEE 802.11 mesh networks, IEEE 802.16 mesh networks, and their integrated systems. The technologies will draw tremendous attentions from service providers, chipset companies, and networking software companies.

In a new concept, the communications architecture will evolve from the present centralized system to one where user/missions will be given direct control of communication schedules, allowing them to directly change requests, while working with other user/missions to solve scheduling conflicts in a collegial environment.  A radically new user interface paradigm will be needed to support this new approach. It is our contention that such an interface is best designed using intelligent agent technologies, resulting in an intelligent space communications scheduling agent for each user/mission.  In Phase 1 we demonstrated the feasibility of using the Distributed, Collaboration and Interaction (DCI) intelligent agent software to support key activities of user schedule representatives of the Deep Space Network (DSN). These agents used models of mission preferences for preparing requests and posting notifications, and took actions on the part of the user to resolve schedule conflicts and take advantage of unexpected asset availability.  In Phase 2 we will extend our prototype agents to support the full range of user scheduling activities, to add capabilities to support multi-user conflict management and to design them to integrate with DSN Service Scheduling Software as it evolves to support user/missions. We will also investigate the potential of using software agents to support the space and ground networks.","Scheduling is a primary enterprise at NASA and the new exploration initiative will only increase the need for efficient interactive scheduling. Besides space communications, we also see potential applications to assist geographically distributed users to schedule time on NASA's orbital and ground based telescopes. Mission planning is at the core of all space missions due to the high cost of space assets such as astronauts, equipment and communication links. Our new agent services, connected with planning engines, will have applications across many NASA programs, from Mission Control to on-board NASA vehicles and outposts, especially for EVA planning. With the new exploration initiative, EVA mission planning and scheduling will increase dramatically from an EVA every few months to one or two a day, and that will increase the need to integrate science and exploration training tasks into a coherent EVA plan/schedule. We also expect applications of our technology to immediately impact NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP), in particular, the Automation for Operations (A4O) managed at NASA ARC, which is investigating automated planning and scheduling to enhance spacecraft operations.","he military has a number of arenas wherein tasks are requested of limited availability assets. Examples are the Air Force Satellite Control Network (FSCN) and the defense intelligence use of high altitude aircraft and special operations surveillance assets. The needs of the user/missions of these assets are similar and would benefit from the application of our enhanced DCI technology. The military is also currently a large customer for unmanned vehicle operations. Unmanned vehicles, both air and ground, are becoming more and more common in battlefield situations. As these unmanned vehicles are increasingly deployed in tandem with dismounted forces, coordinating software will be necessary to ensure successful operations. In particular, unmanned surveillance vehicles, are becoming more and more common in battlefield situations as evidenced in Iraq and Afghanistan. As these unmanned vehicles are increasingly deployed, scheduling their use by an increasing number of users will require the kind of distributed agent systems described in this proposal. Mission planning will also play a large role in integrated manned and unmanned operations. Distributed planning and control systems will serve to better merge competing user needs to accomplish military missions. Finally, non-military applications include distributed scheduling of aircraft in municipal airports, trains and other transportation systems, as well as factory production lines.",Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Database Development and Interfacing; Human-Computer Interfaces

These are extremely unique and expensive assets, and their successful deployment, operation, and recovery are essential to our nation's scientific discovery, economic prosperity, and national security.  Surveillance and weather monitoring are significant factors in enabling safe, secure, reliable, and cost effective operations.  Ranges encompass large marine regions that are expensive to monitor and not under the exclusive control of the spaceport.  Marine regions include backwater areas (lagoon, river, and estuary) near the launch site, as well as the coastal and open-ocean regions extending hundreds of miles downrange.  The most hazardous regions must be cleared and maintained clear in preparation for launch and reentry operations to ensure public safety as well as the safety and security of the vehicle itself. To support such operations, Emergent Space Technologies, Inc. (Emergent) proposes to develop the marine autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) range surveillance (MARS) system. MARS is an integrated solution that includes vehicle, payload and ground segments and will support automated collection and transfer of launch range surveillance and weather data. MARS provides enhanced situational awareness to range operators responsible for ensuring public safety, range availability, and mission success.","The MARS system is being developed to support NASA range surveillance and weather monitoring activities for spacecraft launch and recovery operations.  MARS augments existing surveillance operations in the range's expansive marine corridor, which is expensive to monitor, and prone to incursion by commercial and recreational boats.  Once developed, the system can support Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) and sounding rocket launches at the GSFC Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and Constellation program launches at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  The MARS payload technology can be deployed to other marine platforms including buoys, barges, and ships. When deployed to land-based towers, the technology can be used to monitor launch, processing, and recovery facilities.  When paired with appropriate sensors, the MARS system will support autonomous in-situ oceanographic and atmospheric data collection and transmission for NASA Earth science applications including satellite calibration and validation, physical oceanography, algal bloom monitoring, and hurricane research.","A wide array of non-NASA government and commercial autonomous marine surveillance and in-situ data collection applications can be supported by the MARS system.  Application domains include disaster response, energy, environmental, homeland security, law enforcement, defense, public health and safety, transportation, and weather forecasting.  The MARS system offers the potential to decrease operational costs, decrease human workloads, reduce human exposure to hazardous environments, increase situational awareness, enable extended duration observations, and customize temporal and spatial surveillance and monitoring scales across domains.  State and local governments tasked with conducting increased surveillance and environmental monitoring activities on increasingly limited budgets are expected to benefit from the MARS system which will ultimately enable more effective use of employees and resources.",Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Computer System Architectures; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety

Difficulty in verifying a cleared range causes significant launch delay that may significantly affect the operation safety, cost and schedule. With the increase of workload on existing and/or newly-built spaceports, challenges in launch range clearance and surveillance call for new breakthrough in technologies to better serve for NASA's missions. We propose this SBIR to develop a novel ""Smart Pan/Tilt/Zoom Visible/IR Sensor"" platform, dubbed Smart PTZ(TM), especially suited for detection, tracking, recognition, and identification of persons and objects that have intruded areas of the range that must be cleared in order to conduct safe launch operations. Conventional optical sensors have limited field of views (FOV). They observe objects through a small solid angle. Simultaneous acquisition of target in panoramic view is not possible. Although optical amplification may provide detailed target image, detecting and tracking target(s) in a large area is difficult, resulting in lengthy search time, costly UAV maneuvers, low efficiency in verifying range clearance, even missing intruder due to limited FOV.  Increasing FOV, however, is a double-edged sword that leads to a decreased spatial resolution, causing difficulties in target recognition and classification. To resolve the simultaneous yet contradicting requirements on the FOV and image resolution for range surveillance applications, we propose a novel Smart PTZ sensor concept that meets both needs with unprecedented performance.  By integrating both wide FOV sensor and agile PTZ sensor within a compact package, together with a set of intelligent video analysis algorithms, the Smart PTZ sensor  would enable high performance target detection, tracking, recognition and classification, within a very large FOV (up to 360-degree) for NASA launch range clearance and surveillance.","The unique advantages of the proposed Smart PTZ Sensors include:(1) Novel optical design of wide FOV optics (up to 360-degree) for imaging sensor, no blind spot, no image distortion; (2) Simultaneous acquisition of both wide field of view and zoomed high resolution images;(3) Smart PTZ target tracking capability;(4) Intelligent video processing algorithms for automatic target detection and tracking;(5) Embedded on-board DSP processing module;(6) Novel optical design of 360-degree imaging applies to both visible and infrared sensors;(7) Flexible mounting options: on-board UAV, ground mobile vehicle mounted, and ground fixed camera installations.(8) Tremendous commercialization potential   The Smart PTZ sensor designs allow for flexible mounting configurations and application scenarios.  The compact light weight and low-power visible/infrared sensor package is ideally suited for mounting on UAVs and ground mobile vehicles for launch range surveillance.  The Smart PTZ sensors  can also be installed at fixed ground locations with critical importance for constant 7/24 real-time video surveillance with intelligent target detection capabilities.  The proposed Smart PTZ visible/Infrared sensor technology offers an efficient, flexible, low-cost, and high performance solution to NASA launch range surveillance applications.","Beyond NASA's launch range clearance, the proposed Smart PTZ sensor technology has immediate commercial applications in homeland security, video monitoring, and IP based remote video surveillance.  According to Frost & Sullivan, the global video surveillance industry is about $7 billion, which is expected to grow to $13 billion within five years, with 44% growth market on the verge of technological breakthrough. The video surveillance market is considered as a limitless growth market. ""Cameras Everywhere"" continues to be the best description of the trend in the video surveillance market.

In this way, the Phase II effort culminates in a product that is able to adapt to unknown operating conditions and learn new failures in an unsupervised way. Additionally, a major effort consists of providing a novel, robust, and embedded software toolset for sensor Failure Detection and Identification (FDI): Sensor Data Validation and Self-Healing Scheme (SDV-SHS). To increase the commercialization potential and market values of the NASA and non-NASA applications, the Phase II project adapts DiRETHMS to the market requirements.

Active tags use batteries to power their communication circuitry, sensors, and microcontroller. Active tags benefit from relatively long wireless range and can achieve high data and sensor activity rates. However, the batteries required by active tags are disadvantageous for device cost, lifetime, weight, and volume. In contrast, passive sensor tags receive all of their operating power from external RF transmitting sources and are not limited by battery life. One attractive feature of passive sensor tags is the prospect of permanently embedding them in objects for structural monitoring. Another is their suitability for applications in which neither batteries nor wired connections are feasible, for weight, volume, cost, or other reasons. A limitation of purely passive sensor tags is the requirement of proximity to a RF transmitter. Since lower power consumption is one major trend in RF circuit design, a self-powered system by means of energy harvesting becomes very attractive. It can serve as the enabling technology for novel applications such as ambient intelligence. Using a power harvesting technique for wireless rechargeable battery smart sensor and enhanced RFID are the key elements for successfully distributing sensors across sensor networks.","Ground testing of propulsion systems is a critical requirement to enable NASA's New Vision for space exploration. The proposed power harvesting technology for sensor and RFID applications will enable a cost effective remote testing and health monitoring through shared sensor networks.

Maintenance of the ground facilities is a difficult and ongoing task since the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is located in one of the most aggressive corrosion environments in the U.S.  The effects of the corrosive environment at the KSC are compounded by the exhaust of the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters which produce an estimated 17 tons of hydrochloric acid with each launch.  The Phase II project will continue the development of the models began in Phase I for classification of corrosion inhibitors for structural steel.  We will produce even more robust models for selecting synergistic corrosion inhibitor compositions through a sequential program of algorithm development and high throughput electrochemical screening.  We will then demonstrate the efficacy of the new compositions in protective coatings by electrochemical impedance studies, cyclic corrosion tests and outdoor exposures. In addition we will also develop toxicity classification tools for organic corrosion inhibitors. We will also scale up production of the corrosion inhibitor additive packages for evaluation by coating manufacturers.","The proposed technology will have primary application to the ground support equipment and facilities at KSC, but the proposed technology could be used at any location where NASA maintains either equipment or facilities exposed to corrosive environments.  The compositions of TDA's corrosion inhibitors and the nanostructured carriers arising from the Phase II efforts can be used as a low-toxicity, high performance corrosion inhibiting additive for protective coatings on the structural steel that makes up most of the ground facilities at KSC.  Furthermore the methodology can be used to identify corrosion inhibiting packages for other metals and alloys that NASA needs to protect from the environment.","The direct losses to the U.S. economy attributed to corrosion each year exceed $300 billion.  The methodologies and materials arising out of the Phase II effort can be applied to protect not only steel, but aluminum and magnesium.  For, example, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force and commercial airlines need low-toxicity, high-performance corrosion inhibiting additives for corrodible aerospace aluminum alloys.  New and effective corrosion inhibitors could replace the toxic chromates that are still being used in aerospace applications. Protective coatings employing our corrosion inhibitors could be used for low-toxicity corrosion protection for metals employed in a wide range of applications, including, automotive, aerospace, bridges and buildings.  Additionally, the corrosion inhibitors could be used in related products such as adhesives and sealants where low toxicity corrosion protection is desired.",Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Spaceport Infrastructure and Safety

The new technology, demonstrated via software simulation, is compatible with existing launch-capable GPS antennas and receiver hardware, and requires the addition of cabling and a common processor (and can accommodate channel mismatch in the receivers or added hardware).  The processing load for jammer suppression is small, less than that for GPS signal tracking. The Phase I program employed signal simulation at the intermediate frequency (IF) of the receivers, after digitization.  During Phase II, we propose to develop a demonstration unit consisting of launch-compatible antenna and receiver hardware plus processing software; and to measure its performance using a high-fidelity RF simulation.","The principal NASA application of the proposed technology is making GPS metric tracking for the Constellation Program's Ares launch vehicles robust to interference with and jamming of the GPS signals.  Effective GPS metric tracking is a crucial component in the success of NASA's autonomous flight safety system and its space-based range demonstration and certification project.  Besides the Ares launch vehicles, the same range safety technology applies directly to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles, and to the SpaceX Falcon 1 launch vehicle.  Through the use of position measurements at multiple locations on the launch vehicle, the technology also applies to antenna pointing and attitude determination.","The technology applies directly to range safety in DoD's Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS).  It is also particularly well suited to body worn units and platforms that are small or unusually shaped.  These include Small Diameter Bomb and its variants; A-160 Humming Bird helicopter, High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft; and Scan Eagle UAV.  The proposed technology would be particularly useful for mini-UAVs planned for urban deployment, for which there is a large homeland security market.  Many nonmilitary missions could be enabled by a UAV that could safely fly autonomously in civilian airspace.  Effective guidance depends on the availability of GPS signals.  Cost and weight considerations preclude use of a CRPA.  Hence, without the proposed approach, the UAV would be extremely vulnerable to being blinded by an inexpensive jammer or by inadvertent interference.","Attitude Determination and Control; Telemetry, Tracking and Control"

The innovation is the establishment of a fault tolerant, field scalable, high precision navigation system that can and support the size, weight, and power (SWaP) goals by integrating mature technologies to provide an navigation capability while naturally supporting data and voice communications on the same network.  Perhaps most importantly, this system is bidirectional such that position information is provided to both the base and the mobile units.

We expect NASA to use this technology for initial development of a lunar base and to support exploration and mining activities on the moon.  Later the same technology may be used to perform these functions with only minor modifications during future planetary exploration.","The proposed approach will have other military and commercial applications in the terrestrial environment.  Modernization of the aging international LORAN infrastructure with a lower power more accurate digital solution stands out as a key cross-promotion for this system.  There is strong domestic and international support for retaining and modernizing the LORAN infrastructure as a backup to GPS.

KaSPAR is a modular system with multiple temporal and cross-track baselines to fully characterize the scattering and statistics expected from SWOT, provide data for developing classification algorithms, and understanding instrument performance and limitations over the vast variety of scenes that SWOT will encounter (ie sea-ice, vegetation covered water, frozen/partially frozen rivers etc).  Furthermore a wide-swath (>5km) high-accuracy elevation mapping capability provides the necessary framework to translate traditional point or profile calibration/validation measurements to the spatial framework that SWOT will measure. Beyond SWOT, KaSPAR's unique 4D imaging capability (2D intensity, elevation and velocity mapping) can be uniquely applied to topography applications, local water resource management and monitoring, weather reconnaissance (e.g. floods & storm surge), electronic vision applications and much more.The Phase II activities will build out a complete multichannel radar system to realize the potential of KaSPAR.  Key developments include the highly phase-stable high-bandwidth receivers, low-sidelobe antennas and integration with a high power (40W) solid-state power amplifier.  The modular, compact design will be compatible between platforms and is directly compatible without modification with two NASA King Air aircraft. Long-term KaSPAR is designed to support unpressurized high altitude operations.","In contrast with previous implementations at lower frequencies (L-, C- and X-band), millimeter-wave interferometry (Ka-band for KaSPAR) enables improved accuracy with a constrained antenna and baseline size.  These advantages make the KaSPAR development applicable to potential solution for interplanetary ice mapping missions (e.g. Europa) and planetary topography mapping missions.  KaSPAR componentry, integrated subsystems and techniques including the phase-stable receivers and calibration methodologies could readily be integrated, or adapted for specific system requirements.  A key element of KaSPAR is that it will utilize a solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) (rather than a tube amplifier).  The 40W state-of-the-art SSPA KaSPAR will use would enable an operational airborne ice-surface topography mapper that would not only improve performance over that previously achieved, but also be capable of operating on long-range UAV's to enable ice surface topography mapping of remote, yet critical regions of Antarctica.  This is highly relevant to NASA's ongoing IceBridge activities.","The KaSPAR and its technology also fill technology gaps that exist in several other commercial and governmental applications. US Coast Guard and US Geological Survey have expressed interest in using KaSPAR to build such a data base for high use (recreational and navigation) rivers. This would improve the performance of models used to predict discharge rate and flow patterns of rivers that use stage level data from in situ river gauges, and in the future, from SWOT elevation.  In turn, this would aid navigation and would provide critical information to search and rescue operations.   KaSPAR could also be deployed rapidly during time-critical events such as flooding, or to provide storm surge spatial measurements prior to land-fall.   Ka-band interferometry has the potential to provide 3D mapping of scenes during limited low visibility conditions (i.e. fog, drizzle, etc). The technology developed for KaSPAR may be used to realize Ka-band radar interferometer electronic vision systems that would complement existing infrared systems. The aircraft industry has expressed significant interest in this area. Although designed for mapping rivers and oceans, a KaSPAR system could be used to provide 3D terrestrial imaging.  However, it is significant that the high-bandwidth phase-stable multichannel architecture and processing techniques are applicable and transferable to other geometries (for example off-nadir viewing for dedicated terrain mapping).","Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Microwave/Submillimeter; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Pilot Support Systems; RF; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors"

The PolyStrata fabrication technology, being developed at Nuvotronics, LCC, Blacksburg, VA., is capable of meeting or exceeding all of the requirements outlined to be a solution for these frequencies. Air-filled copper rectangular coaxial transmission lines are fabricated using a photolithographically defined layer-by-layer process. The resulting transmission lines are extremely broadband, low-dispersion, high-isolation, and low loss compared to other forms of planar transmission lines. These lines are smaller than rectangular waveguides because the transverse cross-sections of the lines are not resonant. Phase II of this work will include the design, fabrication  and characterization of prototypes that will enable PolyStrata-based frequency-scanned antenna-array operating from 140-160GHz with +/-16 degree beam steering, a beamwidth of 0.5 degrees and 400MHz per beam bandwidth. An antenna array with this performance would require roughly 24cm by 24cm.  This is possible using 4 sub-arrays that each are fabricated on a single wafer and then tied together to achieve the overall system performance. We will develop and deliver prototypes that will be smaller versions of this, but demonstrate all the necessary aspects of the system including the feed network, the antennas, the tiling of subarrays and the connection to the outside world.  The approach will offer a high-yield, cost effective product that will meet the NASA needs.","Primary applications for the frequency scanned antenna array are to provide significant improvements over existing Ka-band radar used for planetary landing missions. Ka-band radar sensors are planned for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission scheduled for 2009/2010, but future missions are anticipated to employ radar at frequencies centered above 90GHz, such as G-band (Pollard et al., 2005). Antennas operating in this frequency range will reduce landing radar size and weight substantially while maintaining or improving the system performance for topographic and velocity data acquisition by providing greater resolution. Pollard and Sadowy (JPL under NASA contract), have outlined in detail their requirements for the G-band radar system needed for future MSL missions, including antenna specifications and phase shifting capabilities. We believe that missions after the MSL will be our first targeted application for the Nuvotronics G-band antenna solutions. Future NASA missions, especially those involving autonomous landing in rough terrain, would be the next target applications for the proposed antenna innovations.  In addition, antenna arrays and feed networks operating at these frequencies would have applications in space-based radiometers such as those aboard the NASA AQUA earth-observing satellite.","Other agencies (Air Force, Navy) could use the advantages of a PolyStrata-based millimeter-wave array in low-weight, high performance applications for autonomous landing and harbor guidance. The FSA would provide a substantially smaller payload for aircraft and heightened resolution in topography and velocity measurements. The millimeter-wave landing radar realized by the batch-level PolyStrata process can reduce costthereby making the autonomous landing radar a viable solution on many aircraft increasing long-term safety of craft and personnel. Harbor guidance for ships deals with the same weather and atmospheric-related issues. Additional applications include weather warnings and atmospheric research, especially where radar is mounted on aircraft or other vehicles to conduct surveys. The cost advantages would aid in the proliferation of radar at these frequencies. Since many of the current generation radars used for weather warning systems and meteorological forecasts are being updated with newer technologies (Heinselman, 2008), these microfabricated antenna array solutions could offer cost and size advantages.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Microwave/Submillimeter; RF"

Target gases include CH4, CO, CO2, N¬2O and other species critical to climate science, environmental monitoring and commercial pollution compliance efforts. The DAGR approach builds on traditional gas-filter correlation radiometry (GFCR), a well-known and proven technology for trace gas sensing.  The effectiveness of GFCR, however, has historically been limited in downlooking applications primarily because variations in surface albedo degrade its performance.  In our Phase I effort, we investigated and demonstrated the ability of the DAGR design to overcome these limitations.  With the successful completion of these feasibility studies, the technology has been increased to TRL-3.In the Phase II effort, we will construct and test a prototype DAGR sensor for CH4 detection and monitoring, advancing the technology to TRL-5.  CH4 was chosen as our target gas to meet the pressing commercial need for an improved natural gas leak detection system.  For NASA, the DAGR prototype will significantly advance the technology needed for future missions such as ASCENDS, GEOCAPE, and GACM.  DAGR represents a major advance in using backscattered light for detecting concentrations of key molecular species.","The DAGR technology proposed here will directly demonstrate high sensitivity remote sensing of CH¬4 in the boundary layer.  With minor adaptations, DAGR could provide simultaneous measurements of additional trace gases such as CO, N2O and SO2.  These capabilities are of direct relevance to three NASA Decadal Survey missions: ASCENDS, GEOCAPE and GACM.In order to separate physiological carbon fluxes from biomass burning and fossil fuel use, ASCENDS must simultaneously measure boundary layer CO2 and additional tracers, ideally CO and CH4. Observations of CO at 4.7 μm are primarily sensitive to the mid-troposphere, but observations at 2.3 μm are needed to extend sensitivity to the surface.  A DAGR instrument can provide high precision measurements of both CH4 and CO at 2.3 μm.  GEOCAPE and GACM will focus on the carbon cycle, regional air quality, and long-range transport of pollution.  Measurements from a DAGR sensor are directly relevant to these goals.  Mr. Gordley has been consulting with NASA investigators on the GEOCAPE mission to help advance the technology needed for this mission.  Developing a DAGR prototype would be an important step in this direction.","The primary commercial application targeted by this proposal is natural gas pipeline monitoring.  The landscape of Federal regulations in this area is rapidly changing, and the energy industry is highly motivated to move quickly and efficiently towards compliance.  Demand for surveillance systems outstrips the services currently available.  Based on results from Phase I, the DAGR sensor is superior to state-of-the-art remote detection systems now in operation, and will help meet this demand. A second commercial application for DAGR is ground-based monitoring of CO2 in sequestration fields. Using current technology, CO2 can be stored in depleted oil and natural gas fields, saline reservoirs and basalt formations.  Geologic storage of CO2 can account for over half of the emission reduction needed to achieve atmospheric stabilization.  With only minor modifications, the DAGR design could be adapted to sense boundary layer CO2 using backscattered sunlight.  Tower-based DAGR sensors would be used for monitoring the ambient level of CO2 at and around the sequestration site during preparation, injection, decommissioning, and finally for long-term monitoring.",Optical

The objective of the proposed project is to use single-layer metamaterial metal/dielectric composites to develop multiwavelength polarimetric focal plane arrays (FPAs) that far exceed performance requirements for ACE and CLARREO, while reducing costs through component integration. Phoebus's metamaterial films are an enabling technology and can be used to develop high spectral resolution, low-crosstalk components for other NASA missions, such as GEO-CAPE, as well as transparent metal contacts for high-efficiency sensors and solar cells. Phoebus's metamaterial films can eliminate several problems with current polarimetric detectors, such as diffraction, light scattering, moving parts, and the need to dice/bond components. This project will use recent discoveries in metamaterials research that allow for polarimetric control of the flow and focusing/superbeaming of light, concepts that have been analytically and experimentally verified during Phase I. Phoebus's Phase I results confirmed that its structures will allow for 2500x improvement in polarization extinction ratios - the key performance metric for polarimetric detectors  compared with currently available polarimetric detectors. Phase I results also confirmed that the relevant structures can be fabricated using routine materials and fabrication techniques in widespread use throughout the semiconductor device industry.

Through knowledge gained about theoretical modeling and fabrication methodologies, the project may also lead to other photonic devices of use to NASA. For example, the light-concentrating abilities of Phoebus's recently designed metamaterial Fresnel zone plates are well-suited to creation of pixel-sized microlenses, to be fabricated atop IR focal plane arrays. Such devices improve sensitivity of space-based imaging and remote sensing systems by enabling smaller, lower-noise detector elements without loss of light-gathering power while simultaneously reducing system mass. Fabry-Perot interferometers are currently used as narrowband wavelength filters for select remote sensing and astronomy applications. By tapping into very narrow bandwidth light-circulating modes, Phoebus's could also improve on current devices by providing even narrower bandwidths with a simpler, lighter and lower-cost device.","Phoebus's metamaterial films are an enabling technology with a variety of potential applications spanning multiple device types and industries.

The LFMG prototype will have a dynamic range of 25,000 nT to 75,000 nT, and achieves an accuracy and stability necessary to perform common mode noise rejection between two LFMG instruments. This advance in the state of the art represents an increase in sensitivity of more than an order of magnitude, and will permit new high performance gradiometer measurements for use in innovative exploratory research into the effects producing temporal variations in the magnetic field over the Earthfs surface.","The accurate measurement of the magnetic field components and their orientation in space is recognized as a basic requirement for space research. The LFMG will be used to observe magnetic fields at the Earthfs surface with extremely high resolution.

Hawkeye is the culmination of two decades of innovative instrument development at SPEC. The new probe will measure the size distribution of cloud and precipitation particles, provide high-resolution (2.3 micron pixel) images of cloud particles and remove artifacts from ice particle shattering.  This will be accomplished by eclectic combination of technology developed in three existing SPEC optical cloud particle probes:  1) A fast FSSP, that measures size distributions from 1 to 50 microns and records individual particle statistics and remove shattered particles using inter-arrival times, 2) a cloud particle imager (CPI) with upgraded imagery capable of recording up to 500 frames per second, and 3) a 2D-S (Stereo) probe that is configured with one channel to provide full-view images of particles from 10 microns to 1.28 mm, and a second channel configured to provide full-view images of particles from 50 microns to 6.4 mm.  Thus, using particle dimensions along the direction of flight will produce particle size distributions from 1 micron to several cm. Hawkeye will be designed for installation and autonomous (unattended) operation on NASA research aircraft, including the Global Hawk unmanned aerial system (UAS), and DC-8, WB-57F and ER-2 piloted research aircraft.  Hawkeye will provide vastly improved measurements of particle and precipitation size distributions, particle shape, extinction coefficient, effective particle radius, ice water content and equivalent radar reflectivity.  Hawkeye will be ready for installation on NASA aircraft for the upcoming ACE and GPM decadal missions, which are aimed at measurements of the effects of aerosols, clouds and precipitation on global climate change.","Based on this historical record and increasing interest in global climate change, we anticipate that the Hawkeye, a new advanced-technology standard for cloud particle probes, will be requested for all future NASA and other-agency climate research programs.  In particular, ACE and GPM decadal missions will benefit considerably from Hawkeye measurements.  Participation in these missions generates direct commercial benefit and also exposure for additional commercial sales.",There is a growing international market in weather modification research and operational cloud seeding programs.  Research/cloud seeding programs are now taking place on five continents.  These programs are using aging technology to investigate clouds for weather modification applications and will benefit from a compact probe that will reliably measure changes in cloud particle distributions due to the effects of cloud seeding.  Certification of new aircraft for flight in known icing conditions is another commercial application for the Hawkeye.

This fast-response atmospheric turbulence probe (FRAT probe) will be able to sample ambient air, and measure CO2 and other gases.  Phase I work demonstrated that with a proper design of the probe nose, ingestion holes for gas sampling do not interfere with port pressure measurements. Variations of this probe will be able to operate in harsh atmospheric environments. High-frequency response and resistance to water spray were accommodated by mounting the pressure sensors in small chambers very close to the probe nose surface. To return the absolute instantaneous velocity of air and calculate atmospheric turbulence, the motion of the probe and the aircraft will be measured. To this end, the components of an Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS), namely accelerometers, magnetometers, GPS and other electronic equipment have been assembled, and tested.  These components will be packaged into a stand-alone probe system that will include an A/D board converter and a microcomputer. Software for post-processing of data will be developed. This probe system will be tested on CO2 towers and mounted on an aircraft to measure gas contents, humidity, and other atmospheric thermodynamic quantities.","The attractive features of this product are that it will include all components in a tightly packaged probe body half the size of a base ball bat, making it a stand alone, off-the-shelf item, at an affordable price, in the range of $6,000 to 20,000. This product will be readily available for mounting on micrometeorological towers or on any flying platform to measure atmospheric turbulence and gas contents as part of environmental research. Such measurements can improve our understanding of the high-wind boundary layer and the exchange of heat, moisture and momentum across the oceanic or terrestrial surface. This equipment may prove valuable in disclosing the fluxes of man-made or natural species like CO2, which are key elements of micro-meteorology. A variation of this probe could be flown into developing tropical storms or hurricanes, to measure wind turbulence, the size and number density of droplets, and the fluxes of momentum, humidity and other thermodynamic quantities.","This instrument may appear useful in commercial micro-meteorological applications that require the measurement of sensible heat, water vapor and trace gas fluxes, as they relate to air quality.

We propose a new approach where low cost, extensive measurement campaigns can be made using standard meteorological balloons.In this SBIR program, Southwest Sciences is developing a lightweight, inexpensive greenhouse gas sensor suitable for balloon sonde measurements, Using a novel measurement technique, this sensor will provide dry air mixing ratios of CO2 without the need for concurrent measurements of temperature, pressure or moisture.

Multi-finger robot sample grasping devices are controlled to securely pick up samples.  Equations have been developed to provide optimal grasps for perfectly modeled objects, but grasping unmodeled objects like a random sample on planetary surfaces is an open research problem. Approaches to grasping unmodeled objects use various sensors, such as cameras, distributed pressure sensors, and strain gages, to characterize the object and the quality of a grasp. That information is then used to initiate or improve the grasp. A major source of difficulty in robotic grasping, therefore, is the sensing of object parameters and grasp quality. Humans combine the high information content of vision, several types of haptic/tactile sensors in the fingers (300 sensors per square centimeter), and a sophisticated learning process to grasp unknown objects. In comparison, current robotic graspers rely on a much more limited set of sensors, particularly for measuring tactile properties.

It also has the potential for greater accuracy in force measurement and control in a different regime than current sensor (strain gauge) technologies and can be a new tool in the machine designer's toolkit.This technology will provide NASA with advanced, robust grasping solutions for unstructured environments. This will include both the computer vision algorithms that extract grasp quality metrics from an optotactile fingerpad, as well as the grasp algorithms that take advantage of that information.

In situ geochronology was specified as ""overarching"" priority in the recent NRC survey. It will provide a rich field of LAOCIS applications. Because this technology combines physical principles of laser induced breakdown plasma and tunable laser absorption, the future integrated instrument will measure elemental composition (~30 elements simultaneously) and key isotopic abundances in condensed samples. This proposal is particularly focused on Mars but highly relevant to applications on the Moon, other planets, their moons (e.g., Titan, Europa, Io, etc.) and comets. In addition, the measurement system can be utilized for rapid, mobile isotopic measurements on Earth to study biogeochemistry, element cycle studies, human health and ecosystems. The most probable application is the analysis of bulk light element isotope systems, which are relatively abundant allowing minor isotopes to be seen with high signal/noise ratios.","Potential commercial applications for the LAOCIS will be varied throughout forensic and homeland security applications; government nuclear maintenance and non-proliferation activities; hydrological, petrochemical and geological exploration and relevant field applications; measurement of isotopic tracers/markers for medical practice and drinking water control, and in academic institutions (particularly environmental, medical, nutrient and biogeochemical research).

The New Frontiers has placed a South pole-Aitken Basin sample return as a future mission scenario. The enhanced detection capabilities of DUV-RF can be used to provide an understanding of organics and water distribution in the lunar regolith.","This technology is useful for a broad range of in situ measurements for: space science and terrestrial geochemical, geophysical and geobiological studies; planetary protection applications such as measuring/characterizing organic or biogenic contamination on outbound and inbound spacecraft; and for general application to high quality non-invasive, non-destructive measurement of trace levels of contamination on surfaces, in liquids and in the air, such as aboard the International Space Station.  The proposed instrument will provide the ability to measure trace levels of organic material at working distances up to 1 meter or more.  For space science applications, this would enable a Rover-body mounted instrument that could interrogate the vicinity of the Rover.  For terrestrial applications the stand-off measurements could be made in full sun-light conditions at least for Raman and potentially for the deep UV native fluorescence emissions.  For planetary protection applications it would enable direct measurement of bioloads on spacecraft surfaces without the need for sample collection using traditional methods.","The technology being addressed by this proposal is immediately useful for Department of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (HS) applications as well as non-government commercial and industrial applications.  DOD and HS applications include in situ biological and chemical warfare sensors to detect trace levels of biological, nerve, and blister agents as well as low-volatility toxic industrial chemicals (TICs).  The ability of the sensor to measure hazardous materials at meters of working distance vastly improves their use by first responders.",Biochemical; Biomolecular Sensors; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors

LUNA is based from the concept of CheMin, the XRD/XRF instrument of MSL, but is redesigned to provide a more compact unit at much reduced costs. Many details of LUNA derive from the designs of a small portable XRD/XRF instruments developed and marketed by inXitu. Bringing LUNA to TRL 6-7 is possible within the scope of this Phase II because key components have been or are being developed.  Phase 2 addresses the missing critical subsystems: a low-cost flight-qualifiable X-ray CCD, and flight-qualifiable electronics to drive the detector and control the instrument.   LUNA is not frozen in a particular geometry or mechanical implementation, it is meant to be flexible to answer the specific needs of any lunar mission.  Transmission or reflection geometries are possible as demonstrated by inXitu's commercial instruments.  Phase 2 will demonstrate a reflection version of LUNA operating under vacuum.  This work leverages on the extensive experience of the PI and the company with XRD-XRF instrumentation in terrestrial and planetary applications.","Primary application is fitting a LUNA instrument to a landed platform, rover or lander, to perform mineralogical analyses of the regolith, rocks, ices, and dust at the lunar surface. The LUNA concept opens XRD/XRF capabilities to small missions with limited payload.  The project is structured to enable quick development at low cost once selected for flight.  Although this development is focused on lunar applications, it would fit other planetary missions requiring a mineralogy instrument.  Secondary applications are analysis of sample return in planetary sample curation box, and analysis on manned orbital or lunar stations for science and resource utilization.","This development will enable next generation portable field XRD/XRF instruments for geological analysis in the field, mining, oil, forensic, art, and also dedicated applications such as in-vacuum process monitoring tools for thin film deposition, robotic systems for quality control, or low cost benchtop instruments for routine analysis in the laboratory or for education.

These formations dictate the capability for precise alignment, synchronized maneuvers and reconfigurations. In order to accomplish the stated tasks, precise and low-noise micro-thrusters are needed.Busek Co. Inc. is proposing to continue the development of a micro RF ion engine propulsion system. Propulsion system is emphasized here because we believe we have all the building blocks needed to complete the system. The RF ion engine will operate in a dual thrust mode or low thrust, nominally 5-30 microNewtons (micro-N) for very precise, long duration missions and have the option to operate at high thrust, nominally 100 micro-N, for short applications such as spacecraft tip-off. This combination of thrust ranges from the same thruster is a unique and mission enabling technology. Busek has a flight qualified carbon nanotube field emission (CNTFE) cathode that is a near perfect fit for neutralizing the ion beam. The CNTFE is propellant-less and very low power, order of 1 Watt. Busek proposes to utilize a slightly modified microvalve for precise microflows. DC and RF electronics and control complete the system.","Applications of micro RF ion engines include many currently planned and future NASA missions that require precisely controlled and highly throttle-able thrust for formation flights. These missions include Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Space Interferometer Mission (SIM), Submillimeter Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure (SPECS), Space Astronomy Far Infrared Telescope (SAFIR), Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and Stellar Imager. Furthermore, micro RF ion engines can serve as tip-off control for formation flying satellites.Not only applicable to formation flight applications, micro RF ion engines are also the prime candidate for missions calling for zero drag.  Zero drag can be achieved by varying thrust to counter the drag force measured from minute deceleration of the spacecraft.  The thrust must be rapidly responsive and precise, which are the special features of RF ion engines.","Potential commercial applications include any micro and nano-satellite missions that would require precision thrust, drag-free flight or incondensable propellant. Terrestrial applications for the micro RF ion thruster include a micro machining and semiconductor fabrication by nano focused ion beams. The microvalve has many applications where precise control of micro flows is required. The miniaturized valve has potential in many ion engines including small Hall effect thrusters as well as gridded ion thrusters, miniature chemical thrusters typical of ACS or mini spacecraft propulsion. The CNTFE cathode has already shown applications in the colloid propulsion system Busek delivered to JPL in 2008.

Prior to encapsulation plating round or other cross section tubes are inserted thru holes in the plastic foam so that they are incorporated into the electroformed mirror structure when the master is encapsulated with more NiP. The tubes which connect the front and back surfaces of the mirror are made by electroforming with the same NiP alloy.

The urgent need for low-stress Ir coating technology is driven by the current limitations on telescope angular resolution resulting from substrate distortions caused by conventional reflective Ir coatings that typically have very high stress.  In particular, we have measured film stresses in excess of 4 GPa in the case of Ir films deposited by conventional magnetron sputtering.  It is thought that the distortions in the thin glass mirror shells (such as those proposed for the IXO FMA) resulting from such extremely large coating stresses presently make the largest contribution to the telescope imaging error budget, of order 10 arcsec or more.  Consequently, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the imaging requirements of IXO, or other high-resolution X-ray missions in the future that use thin-shell mirror technology, unless high-quality Ir coatings having significantly lower stresses can be developed.  The development of such coatings is precisely the aim of our proposal.  Specifically, building on our successful Phase I effort, we propose to complete the development of low-stress Ir/Cr bilayers, and also investigate the use of Ir/Ti bilayers. We also propose to investigate the properties single-layer Ir films, as well as Ir/Cr and Ir/Ti bilayers, prepared by reactive sputtering with nitrogen.  Finally, we plan to transfer the low-stress Ir coating technology to our large, production-class sputtering system so that we can coat GSFC-supplied thin-shell mirror substrates and conclusively demonstrate reduced stress-driven substrate distortions.","The low-stress Ir coatings we propose to develop will be suitable for use in the IXO FMA telescope, as well as other future NASA X-ray telescopes comprising thin shell mirror elements.","Low-stress Ir X-ray coatings may also find application in non-NASA applications, such as diagnostic medical and homeland security (i.e., baggage and cargo screening) X-ray imaging.",Optical & Photonic Materials

To accommodate this in a grazing incidence design, extremely thin mirrors are formed in concentric shell configurations. A slumping technique has been demonstrated with such thin, lightweight shells. However, the optical surface is found to contain a significant amount of mid-spatial frequency errors. Reactive Atom Plasma (RAP) is a figuring technique that does not impart mid-spatial frequencies to the optical substrate geometries and can additionally remove specific spectra from the figure error. RAP is a sub-aperture, atmospheric pressure, non-contact figuring technology that relies on a deterministic gas-phase etching of the optical surface with high material removal rates. Further, RAP has the ability to modulate tool footprint on the fly, allowing the removal of specific spatial frequencies from the error spectrum. RAP has already been demonstrated as a very credible approach for fabricating the lightweight wedges required for the assembly of such mirrors and  is especially suitable for figuring extremely lightweight mirrors given the non-contact operation. In phase 1, we demonstrated the ability of the RAP process to impart minimal mid-spatial errors into the optical surface. A fully automated figuring platform with adjustable footprints is to be developed for phase 2.","Key NASA applications that could immediately use the technology are those involving high energy X-ray telescopes such as NuSTAR and IXO. The technology developed is also applicable to other NASA programs that seek to minimize payload without sacrificing sensor performance. Besides attenuating mid-spatials on such lightweight mirror segments, wedges can be etched on the back surface for assembly. The process can also be eventually used to direct-write gratings for local phase control on aspheric surfaces.","Making precision surfaces with a high aspect ratio is a common problem across optics, semiconductors, compound semiconductors, photo-voltaics etc. The high aspect ratio results from a need to reduce mass (as in the case of lightweight mirrors), improve device performance/packaging (as in semiconductors), decrease costs (as in photo-voltaics). The methods developed in Phase 1 can be applied to the rapid manufacturing of such surfaces in these other areas.

A mix microsats and P-PODs on a single ESPA is also feasible, all with an option to go to widely disparate destinations.  NASA Ames estimates there is an estimated 13,500 kilograms of excess lift capacity for ESPA payloads available between now and 2013.","There are at least 3 upcoming Air Force ESPA class S/C (15 secondary payload rideshare opportunities) currently scheduled.  For the military, this capability will produce launch opportunities and missions of interest to customers such as MDA, DoD, and NRO.  For commercial users, a successful demonstration will greatly increase the utility of ESPA-derived launch opportunities and will increase demand for ProPACS within the commercial industry.

For nanosats, the critical design challenge is achieving autonomous control of the EclipseVEDsTM for spacecraft thermal self regulation without the need for human intervention. To achieve this goal, Eclipse employed EclipseVEDTM technology and demonstrated the capacity to have automated control thermal systems capable of in-flight thermal regulation of a cubesat or other small satellite. In Phase II, Eclipse will build a complete multi-panel cubesat and work with NASA to lab test a completely functional prototype and review the capacity to utilize the ECDs concurrently with photovoltaics.","The electrochromic technology and its control systems suggested in the present proposal possess a wide range of applications relative to the needs of the Agency in satellite, spacecraft and component thermal control, space communications, chemical and biological monitoring of environmental control and life support systems, and in optical processing of information. The EclipseVEDTM developed by Eclipse Energy Systems, Inc. works as a voltage-controlled variable emissivity device to modify the thermal budget of satellites, spacecraft and space-based systems such as antenna networks, inflatable reflectors and habitable structures. The use of the technology with photovoltaics can also lead to longer missions, lower cost and more external area of the nano-sats used for other mission critical purposes.","Beyond the use as nanosat systems and the immense market for small space platforms for experiments in the commercial market, the EclipseVEDTM will be sold as an alternative to thermal control louvers prevalent in mid-size to large satellite systems comprising a $15M to $20M market. Typical louver systems add considerable mass to satellites (4kg/m2) in comparison to that associated with an IR ECD (15g/ m2). The use of EclipseVEDTM's to reduce thermal distortion in space-based antenna networks, reflectors, high altitude airships and habitable structures will reach a market estimated at $60M per annum. The EclipseVEDTM will find application in infrared beam steering for space-based communications, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers and infrared spatial light modulators for image processing.

The use of an Internet-based protocol, especially TCP/IP, can provide seamless network command and control continuity between terrestrial and space-based platforms and environments, as well as between distributed ground and space stations. However, long propagation and/or large transmission errors can significantly degrade current TCP/IP performance. In addition, current TCP is too complex to fit in a small footprint, which is required in microsats and nanosats. To address this NASA/ARC need for wireless networking technologies for small launch vehicles, Broadata Communications, Inc. proposes to develop a Small Space Platform Internet Protocol Stack with Space-Enhanced TCP technology (or SSP IP & TCP in short) to dramatically increase TCP/IP performance (20 times improvements over standard TCP/IP was demonstrated in Phase I) and enable the use of TCP/IP for processor-footprint constrained spacecraft in NASA missions. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to further develop the SSP IP & TCP technology, and to produce a full-scale, highly-optimized, IP embeddable SSP IP & TCP prototype system for placement in NASA networks with micro- or nano-satellite platforms.  Our Phase II work plan is designed to complete SSP IP & TCP development and to produce: (a) a miniature, nanosat integrateable, standalone embedded network system module that provides all SSP IP & TCP functionalities and can directly meet NASA needs and resource-constraint integration requirements, and (b) a full-scale SSP IP &TCP software package that supports multiple network communication interfaces and provides automated installation for Linux or Windows operation systems.","In addition to the NASA's direct application for the Space Networks, the SSP TCP technology can also be applied in many NASA, government, and military programs related to the Space Station, the Moon and Mars Initiative, C4I and tactical networking, and small, possibly secret devices where wireless links may be employed, especially in cases where thin platforms are employed in IP communications including but not limited to sensor networks, SATCOM, Gigabit SATCOM, JTRS DCRM or surrogate architectures, software radios, Link-16, and Link-11. In addition, the SSP TCP can be a space enabler for many sensors, devices, and components, which can gain communication effectiveness and efficiency due to the SSP TCP's features.","The SSP IP & TCP is also directly applicable to commercial network applications that can benefit from wireless enhanced TCP performance, especially in devices that are resource constrained. Major markets are cell phones and wireless packet networks for public IP access. Potential applications include, but are not limited to, wireless Internet access networks (especially for satellite, mobile/wireless Internet Service Providers), performance management of wireless technology, and commercial sensor applications.The SSP IP & TCP can pervade cellular or wireless networks with long propagation, military embedded devices IP devices in ad hoc networking environments, and sensor networks with limited footprint modules, saving these private enterprises money and increasing their efficiency for consumers.

Design_Net will continue, via this SBIR Phase 2, to develop the selected adapter to a structurally tested engineering model.  This adapter can accommodate everything from 6u and 12u carriers to full up ""ORS class"" (800lb) small satellites and is applicable to Minotaur IV, Falcon 9 and Taurus 2.",Different NASA centers have different uses for Small Satellite Rideshare.  KSC is interested in flying P-POD class missions for education and technology; Ames desires to fly 6u and 12u form factors for biological purposes and is interested in potential Lunar missions; JPL has a number of technologies waiting for a ride. Adapters which enable NASA to make better use of its Launch Vehicle inventory and efficient use of lift mass will move some of the technology experiments from TRL 5 to TRL 8 and greatly assist the agency in buying down risk on its larger missions as well as flying the small ones for a predictable price.

By addressing the security, scalability and virtualization challenges that have heretofore prevented service-centric M&S from being practical, this first-of-its-kind Modeling and Simulation as a Service (M&SaaS) platform will allow M&S users and developers alike to avoid many of the obstacles that currently confound the delivery, accessibility and usability of traditional, non-service-oriented M&S software.Building upon its commercial Grid Software as a Service (GSaaS) platform, Parabon convincingly demonstrated M&SaaS feasibility in Phase 1, as well as its ability to deliver the M&SaaS solution, completing in Phase 1 a Phase 2 solicitation goal of executing a NASA climate model across a computational grid and displaying the results, all from a browser.  By the completion of Phase 2, M&SaaS will support, at TRL 6-7, browser-based source code editing, management of distributed repositories, research collaboration via forums and wikis, and virtualized build and runtime environments, all from within richly featured and access-controlled web accounts.  M&SaaS has the potential to revolutionize how M&S is practiced across many industries  including defense, finance and pharmaceuticals  however, its benefit to NASA could be remarkable.  Because the NASA mission often involves science that does not readily admit to direct experimentation, M&S is often the only means by which to answer significant scientific and engineering questions.  The productivity improvements and cost reductions enabled via this new service paradigm will help NASA and other organizations generate discoveries more readily and realize significantly higher return on M&S investments.","Use of M&S at NASA is pervasive and the commercialization applications for M&SaaS are numerous.  For example, Earth climatologists at NASA rely heavily on climate models to assess the potentially far-reaching consequences of greenhouse gas emissions; NASA space mission programs use simulation extensively to orchestrate mission plans, engineer flight systems and conduct contingency planning exercises; and NASA space science programs model cosmological phenomena to answer some of humankind's deepest questions.  None of these types of investigations are possible without extensive use of M&S.  Nearly every M&S application at NASA that is built around the traditional software delivery paradigm (release, install, patch and upgrade) is a candidate for migration to a service-centric delivery model under M&SaaS.The M&SaaS solution applies equally well to many domains that do not strictly employ M&S.  For example, modern scientific instruments, ranging from satellite imaging systems to particle accelerators to radio telescopes, can generate data at extraordinary rates and corresponding declines in data storage costs have invited researchers to generate tera- and now petabyte scale datasets. The researchers that work on such datasets share many characteristics in common with the M&S practitioners and the proposed M&SaaS solution will enable them to collaborate more effectively and perform computational analyses on their data with greater ease.","M&S practitioners outside of NASA comprise a large and attractive market.  Many large government contractors serving NASA perform M&S work for NASA and other federal agencies.  Several of these contractors and Department of Defense representatives have already expressed procurement interest in the proposed M&SaaS solution.  Additionally, the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) is a collaborative effort between multiple federal organizations to provide information and models relating to space science research. Member organizations in this partnership  which includes, among others, the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR)   comprise an excellent collection of agencies that could benefit from M&SaaS.  M&S activities span other lucrative commercial industries such as pharmaceuticals and finance, to list a few, and Parabon has existing customers in these sectors that will benefit from M&SaaS. The higher productivity, improved ease-of-use and reduced costs afforded by the proposed solution will be attractive to M&S practitioners in these and other industries where M&S is used. Moreover, the solution is generally applicable to domains not directly involved in M&S, for example, bioinformatics, photo-realistic rendering and intelligence data processing.",Computer System Architectures; Software Development Environments; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

Unfortunately, operating procedures are often written indifferent languages. For example, Orion will use automatic procedures writtenin SCL, the Spacecraft Command Language, while backup manual procedures may bedeveloped in PRL, the Procedure Representation Language.  However, proceduresdeveloped in different languages may diverge, so that the backup PRL proceduresdo not operate in the same way as the SCL procedures.  This could lead tounintended effects that may range from simply unexpected to inefficient or evencatastrophic. We propose to develop the SAFE-P tool, which will use formal model-checkingmethods to prove that PRL and SCL procedures have the same underlying executionsemantics.  Our Phase 1 effort validated the effectiveness of our approach;Phase 2 will completely automate the model checking process and integrate withthe Procedure Integrated Development Environment (PRIDE).  SAFE-P will thusallow procedure authors to easily compare procedures as they are beingdeveloped.  When differences are found by SAFE-P, they will be highlightedimmediately in the PRIDE interface, allowing the operators to either fixproblems or annotate the respective procedures to explain the differences.Using SAFE-P, NASA personnel will rapidly and confidently verify that if anautomatic SCL program cannot be executed, a backup manual procedure in PRL willbe equivalent and safe.  Furthermore, as automatic translators are developed totransform procedures in one language into another NASA-relevant language (e.g.,Tietronix's current effort to translate PRL into SCL), the SAFE-P tool willprovide a critical validation mechanism to double-check the correctness of thetranslation and highlight areas where the translator makes mistakes (ordeliberate approximations that yield different behavior).","The proposed SAFE-P tool will be applicable to a wide variety of NASAmissions including ISS, Shuttle, and Constellation operations.  Formanned and unmanned spacecraft operations, SAFE-P will bridge acritical gap in NASA's safety procedures, preventing the possibilityof inadvertent commands that do not conform to standard operatingprocedures and that could lead to dangerous or even catastrophicconsequences.SAFE-P fits directly within NASA's Automation for Operations (A4O)system concept, helping support significant reductions in operationscosts and increases in operational efficiency while maintaining orimproving system safety.

Proceduresencode the operational knowledge of a system as derived from systemexperts, testing, training and experience.  In current Space Shuttle and ISS operations procedures are displayed using applications separate from the applications used to display commands and telemetry.  This means that procedures cannot interact with commands and telemetry to help an operator's situation awareness.  This leads to slower procedure performance and greater opportunity for errors.  TRACLabs is building on existing NASA Constellation program technology to combine procedures, commanding and telemetry into a single, consistent framework in which to operate space vehicles.   Instead of viewing procedures in static displays, flight controllers will have interactive, reconfigurable procedure displays and assistants that can be tailored for specific situations.  The displays will have different views tailored to specific operations, including browsing, assigning, editing, executing and monitoring procedures.  A procedure executive automates some procedure execution and provides procedure assistance.  Automation is always under the control of the flight controller via level of automation feature.  Each step or instruction of a procedure can be labeled as manual, automated or consent. This will increase the efficiency of procedure performance and reduce procedure errors.","We have identified four NASA programs that can immediately use the results of this project to enhance their current and future capabilities.  These programs are:* Constellation Procedure Application Software Suite (CxPASS):  This program is chartered with providing software support and requirements for both on-board and ground procedure viewing and execution for all Constellation vehicles including Orion.  Phase I discussions with CxPASS personnel have identified key areas of mutual interest including procedure viewing, procedure editing and situation awareness. * Mission Controls Technology (MCT): This program is producing the next generation command and telemetry software application for the Mission Control Center (MCC). This project is intended to provide procedure capability to MCT.   * Automation for Operations (A4O).  This research program is producing prototype software systems to demonstrate advanced automation capabilities to Constellation.  We expect that the software produced in this project will be used by A4O as their procedure display environment for forthcoming demonstrations.  * Lunar Surface Systems (LSS).  This program is developing concepts for Lunar habitation and robotics infrastructure.  Procedures will be a core part of operating Lunar surface assets.  This project can provide procedure assistance software to LSS for testing of their operations.","All complex systems use procedures as the core of their operations.  Industries such as refineries, petrochemical plants, power plants (both nuclear and conventional), pharmaceutical plants and ethanol plants currently use manual procedures represented in PDF, similar to the current NASA state-of-practice.  The benefit that NASA will receive from moving to electronic, automated procedures can be duplicated in many of these industries.  Plants that already have some level of automation such that telemetry and commanding is available electronically are the most likely to adopt this technology.  Just as at NASA, safety, workflow and cost concerns must be addressed before this technology will be adopted.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Human-Computer Interfaces; Software Development Environments

In the last 6 years, GPUs had an increasing performance advantage of an order of magnitude relative to x86 CPUs. Furthermore, this performance advantage will continue to increase in the next 20 years because of the scalability of the chip manufacturing processes. The goal of this project is to efficiently exploit the GPU parallelism in order to accelerate the execution of a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver. SAT has a wide range of applications, including formal verification and testing of software and hardware, scheduling and planning, cryptanalysis, and detection of security vulnerabilities and malicious intent in software. We bring a tremendous expertise in SAT solving, formal verification, and solving of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) by efficient translation to SAT. In our previous work (done on the expenses of our company) we achieved 2 orders of magnitude speedup in solving Boolean formulas from formal verification of complex pipelined microprocessors, 4 orders of magnitude speedup in SAT-based solving of CSPs, and 8 orders of magnitude speedup in SAT-based routing of optical networks. During Phase 1 we implemented a prototype of a parallel GPU-based SAT solver that is 1  2 orders of magnitude faster than the best sequential SAT solvers. In Phase 2, we will continue to exploit the GPU parallelism to accelerate SAT solving, and expect to achieve speedup of 3  4 orders of magnitude.","Efficiently solving of challenging Boolean formulas is critical to NASA, as this will increase both the speed and scalability of the following applications:  1) formal verification and testing methods for complex mission software and hardware, including those of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), the next generations of Mars Rovers, and other spacecraft;  2) formal methods to check the robustness of radiation-hardened circuits;  3) SAT-based methods for scheduling, planning, and solving of other Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs);  4) formal methods for network coding that will increase both the bandwidth and reliability of space communications by using the existing communications equipment that is already deployed in space after updating the firmware;  5) SAT methods for reliability-based optimization of hardware, software, and mechanical systems;  6) power consumption analysis for circuits;  7) design of experiments;  8) design of error-correction codes; and  9) FPGA technology mapping and routing.","The potential non-NASA commercial applications include:  1) Formal verification and testing of software and hardware, where the potential customers will be all major semiconductor and software companies.  2) Scheduling, planning, and solving of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), where the potential customers will be all companies that use scheduling and planning tools.  3) Electronic Design Automation (EDA) problems, such as FPGA technology mapping and routing, power consumption analysis for circuits, and formal methods to check the robustness of radiation-hardened circuits, where the potential customers will be all EDA and semiconductor companies.  4) Formal methods for cryptanalysis, where the potential customers will be the Department of Defense, the NSA, and all companies that use cryptanalysis.  5) Formal methods for cyber security, such as for detection of security vulnerabilities and malicious intent in software, where the potential customers will be all companies that develop robust virus scanners based on formal methods, and companies that develop formal methods for detecting security vulnerabilities in software. Because of the potential for a very wide range of software obfuscations that can be used to hide malicious intent, future virus scanners will have to employ efficient formal methods to detect malware, and thus the importance of speed and scalability that will be possible with an efficient SAT solver.","Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Expert Systems; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Highly-Reconfigurable; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Intelligence; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Development Environments; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures"

Such capabilities will significantly improve reliability, performance and lifetime of electronics that are used for space missions. This will be achieved through the development of novel compact and distributed device modeling capabilities for radiation-hard and extreme temperature instrument design, as well as techniques for circuit design that help to predict the vulnerability of circuits to degradation and upset from radiation. Research and development is indicating that standard bulk silicon CMOS and SOI processes operate well under these extreme conditions so that there is little need for NASA to commit to large expenditures for exotic materials. Models and CAD tools are relatively inexpensive as compared to fabrication costs; thus the results of this project should provide a very large return on investment.","The work proposed in this program will help NASA develop electronics for space missions where ambient temperatures are in the cryogenic region. We plan to provide Verilog-A models for compact SPICE-type simulators for electronics design in radiation rich environments at cryogenic temperatures. This will help allow NASA to design and operate low temperature, radiation hard, ruggedized electronics for future space applications. The design tools will help to allow NASA to develop a unique capability in cryogenic and radiation hard instrument design. The tools will also provide a competitive advantage to develop specific radiation-hard and cryogenic operating circuits that NASA requires for their EJSM and related missions, including analog to digital converters and charge amplifiers.

Furthermore, any application where the input signal is extremely weak, and a very large signal to noise ratio is required, may be enhanced by cryogenic operation. The developing field of quantum computing is also in need of circuits operated at cryogenic temperatures as input and readout subsystems.

The Constellation Program is one of NASA's new space programs which entail both manned and unmanned spaceflights beyond Earth.  In support of the program spacecraft electronics will need to be radiation hardened against a TID effects and provide SEL immunity.Another potential Flagship program is the Europa Jupiter System Mission where the goal of the program is the general exploration of the Jupiter System, as well as, additional focus on Europa and Ganymede.

The International Space Station and future exploration vehicles require a light weight, compact, portable oxygen concentrator technology (OCT) that can provide medical grade oxygen from the ambient cabin air.  Current OCTs are heavy, bulky, have a narrow operating temperature range (ambient to 40 degree Celsius), and require 15 to 30 minutes start-up time to reach their full operating capacity.  Lynntech's proposed electrochemical OCT solves these issues by operating the OCT with a cathode-air vapor feed, unlike conventional electrochemical OCTs which require a liquid water feed.  This is possible due to the use of in-house developed proprietary nanocomposite proton exchange membrane and catalyst technologies.  Cathode-air vapor feed operation eliminates the need for a bulky on-board water supply, significantly reduces the complexity of the balance-of-plant, and greatly increases the system efficiency. OCT will be a quarter the size and weight of conventional OCTs, be capable of instant start-up, and have a wide operating temperature range.

Therefore we expect this same technology to transfer to military applications.  A variety of commercial activities also have similar characteristics to NASA missions.  As mentioned, air traffic controllers work in high-stress environment where small mistakes can be costly.  Likewise, teams of operators control nuclear power plants, petrochemical plants, oil refineries, etc.  They often perform standard operating procedures and need to be monitored closely for degraded performance.  Even in situations in which lives or property are not at risk, monitoring and detecting problems with individual and team performance is useful for managers interested in achieving peak performance. Further possibilities include competitive sports teams, particularly professional sports teams with their highly paid teams, where team cohesiveness and particularly team performance are significant concerns.",Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Expert Systems; Human-Computer Interfaces

Building upon the alpha version of the software developed as a part of the Phase I SBIR, the proposed software will allow crewmembers and/or personnel watching video footage to periodically document salient crewmember behaviors which will then be used to identify behavioral patterns. When a behavioral pattern is identified and deemed important to investigate, users would be able to review all collected data. Furthermore, this software includes an integrated feedback module that offers automated reports based on identified behavioral patterns. Flight surgeons can create a knowledge base of feedback based on specific attributes or behavioral patterns, and the software will then generate automated feedback reports based upon identified attributes or behavioral patterns. Flight surgeons will be able to: 1) generate a variety of reports that describe crew member behavioral patterns; 2) use the behavioral timestamps to view incidents of behaviors on video footage; 3) compare behaviors with other data (e.g., performance reports); and, 4) generate feedback reports.","The Behavior Tracking Software System is designed to monitor flight crew behavior and behavioral patterns for the purpose of identifying potential interpersonal and psychosocial issues (e.g., team cohesion) and automatically generating appropriate feedback. In addition to the needs of the Human Research Program ISS Medical Operations Constellation Program (Lander and Lunar Habitat Projects), the Behavior Tracking Software System has several potential NASA applications in the Exploration Systems Directorate, Space Operations Directorate, and NASA Agency Training and Development Office. These applications include personnel selection, personnel training, tracking employee and team performance, team selection, assessment centers, human behavior research, and leadership development.","Several organizations have expressed interest in the ability to record occurrences of behavior, identify behavioral patterns, easily view video of when behaviors occurred, and generate automated feedback based on the occurrences of behaviors. The Behavior Tracking Software System could be used by the U.S. military and law enforcement groups for monitoring human performance for personnel selection and training, as well as assisting with the identification and treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Horizon Performance currently is under contract with U.S. Army Special Forces to assist with the monitoring of student performance during training. Horizon Performance recognizes the increased demand for tools that can help trainers monitor and evaluate performance in austere environments. Other industries plagued by monitoring people working in austere environments, such as mines, could also use this software. For health care, doctors could monitor outpatient recovery by allowing patients and their caretakers to assess a patient during recovery or after an intervention. In athletics, coaches and trainers could use this software to monitor an athlete's performance by connecting behavioral assessments to video footage. Coaches could generate performance reports that show behavioral patterns which would guide coaches and trainers to specific points during a performance. They could then review video footage at these points and use them to further enhance an athlete's performance.",Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Data Input/Output Devices; Database Development and Interfacing; Mission Training; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools; Software Development Environments; Training Concepts and Architectures

Detecting, reporting, and correlating related incidents are key to preventing future incidents.  NASA has made significant progress in standardizing the reporting of space incidents by developing electronic data entry and storage of information. While such information technology improves report consistency, incident data are not represented in a way that enables advanced computer-based reasoning about incidents.  TRACLabs proposes to develop a human factors incident-reporting tool for authoring and utilizing human factors incident data. This project is innovative in combining semantic web technologies with automated assistive technologies to aid users in finding relationships among incidents. The semantic indexing provided by the use of incident reporting language permits more sophisticated search of archives.  During Phase I we defined a semantic language for incident reporting in XML and designed a technology approach for authoring and utilizing incident reports represented in this language. In Phase II we will implement this software and evaluate its effectiveness for the space human factors community at JSC.  At the end of Phase II, software for reporting space human factors incidents will be delivered to NASA.","Incident reporting is an important part of handling issues that arise during space operations.  NASA missions currently report flight incidents using approaches such as the Problem Reporting and Corrective Action (PRACA) process for Shuttle and Station, Shuttle In-Flight Anomaly (IFA) reports, and Station Items for Investigation (IFI).  The semantic language and tools for incident reporting TRACLabs is developing are complementary but not duplicative with these approaches.  They are intended to support user groups that have information needs not well addressed by programmatic incident reporting systems.  For example, the space human factors organization needs to track incidents related to human factors and habitability issues not captured in current incident archives. We use semantic web technologies to embed domain semantics in incident data and utilize these semantics to improve database search and reporting.  The software is customized by defining new domain semantics or adding XML tags for special domain needs.","Commercial tools for incident reporting are available in a diverse range of domains from crime incidents to corporate security incidents to customer complaints.  Like the proposed software, most of these products support electronic submission and reporting of incident data, and archival of incident reports. The proposed approach differs from these commercial tools in providing a semantic basis for customization and improved search, and in representing incidents in an XML-based language.  Such capabilities permit applying much of the incident reporting software developed for NASA in non-NASA applications.  Promising applications include reporting incidents arising in chemical and nuclear plants, such as incidents arising from human error during plant operations, and reporting medical incidents, such as incidents that arise when monitoring the aged or impaired in performing the activities of daily living.",Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Database Development and Interfacing; Human-Computer Interfaces

The laminate is a multilayer structure comprising polymer and inorganic dielectrics that will provide near-hermetic encapsulation of food items for the duration of these missions. In Phase I, flexible polymer barriers with an oxygen transport rate of <0.005 cc/m2-day and water transport rate of <0.005 g/m2-day were developed. The barriers contain no metal foils, have a areal density of <34 g/m2 for a 40 micron thick film, and tolerate high temperature sterilization treatments. The polymer laminates are mechanically robust exhibiting a 165MPa yield strength, 200MPa tensile strength, 550MPa tensile modulus, and 3% elongation to yield. In Phase II, we propose to optimize barrier properties to reduce weight, minimize ash on incineration, develop heat-sealing methods, and expand the testing to include heat sealed enclosures. The Phase II effort also includes a collaboration with a potential high-volume manufacturer of the barrier films for aerospace applications.","The specific NASA applications for the proposed barrier polymers are the following:· food packaging for long-duration space missions;· packaging for medicines on long-duration space missions;· packaging of air and moisture sensitive chemicals used in scienceexploration on long-duration missions;· packaging of astronaut  physiological samples;· packaging of extraterrestrial materials for return to earth.All these applications will benefit from the availability of a lightweight, high-strength flexible packaging material. Besides having exceptional barrier properties, the proposed barrier polymers have several other features that are important to these NASA applications including: 1) transparency to allow inspection and identification of package contents; 2) an internal surface to which biocompatible and non-thrombogenic coatings can be added; and 3) a low temperature heat sealing capability that allows astronauts in space to create sealed packages that exclude water and oxygen and also prevent bacteriological and viral contamination.","Non-Nasa commercial applications in both the private and Government sectors have been identified.

Transmissible chromosome aberrations (translocations and inversions) have profound genetic effects, such as disrupting regulatory sequences that control gene expression, or creating genetic chimeras.  These chromosome aberrations play a causative role in cancer, and ionizing radiation is one of the most efficient agents known to induce them.  As such, chromosome aberrations are relevant to three NASA needs, biodosimetry, analysis of astronaut lymphocytes for cumulative radiation damage, and space radiation risk modeling.  Of all structural chromosomal anomalies, inversions  a reversal of orientation of material within a chromosome  are the most difficult to detect.  This is especially true of small inversions, most of which are invisible to all current cytogenetic techniques.  Yet small inversions are likely the most transmissible (nonlethal) form of chromosomal damage, so they persist for long periods.  This is a useful feature for retrospective biodosimetry, and may also prove to be useful as an indicator of radiation quality..  In Phase 1 we demonstrated the use of a human chromosome 3, partial chromatid paint to detect a known inversion. During Phase 2, we will continue to improve the efficiency of the technology, an essential goal for commercialization (Phase 3) ultimately creating an improved and complete chromatid paint for chromosome 3.  Finally, we will test the chromosome 3 'chromatid paint's' ability to detect radiation-induced inversions, and establish their frequency.  The technology readiness level at the end of the Phase 2 contract is expected to be 5, i.e. validated in laboratory and relevant environments.","Three applications of interest to NASA are: 1) Retrospective biodosimetry, the estimation of radiation dose based on observed biological damage at a time point considerably after the exposure; 2) Ongoing chromosomal analysis of astronaut lymphocytes provides a measure of accumulated genetic damage caused by space radiation exposure.  Chromatid paints will increase sensitivity of this analysis by adding a new class of observable aberrations; and 3) Biology-based space radiation risk analysis efforts.  Chromosome aberrations play a causative role in carcinogenesis, as does gene copy number imbalance and cytogenetically invisible point mutations.  One way to bring knowledge of cancer genetics into risk analysis is to estimate dose- and LET-dependent probabilities for specific cancer-related genetic alterations. Although some large inversions that can be detected are known to be associated with certain cancers, adequate investigation of cancer-specific chromosomal inversions is currently not possible, and therefore many such inversions, especially small ones, undoubtedly remain undiscovered.  This shortcoming is pertinent with regard to charged particle exposures in that small inversions are likely to be among the most common and most stable chromosome aberration created.  Chromatid paints have the potential to contribute to biology-based risk analysis through their ability to reveal these previously cryptic, currently predicted small cancer-related inversions for the first time.","We expect that chromatid paints will fulfill multiple needs in several fields related to human health.  A major market for inversion detection is the screening of cancer cells for previously undetected inversions that are causal.  New cancer specific inversions may lead to diagnostic and prognostic tests and may even lead to eventual drug targeting.  Other markets include, but are not limited to: clinical cytogenetics (cancer diagnosis and prognosis, detection and diagnosis of certain neurological disorders associated with inverted copy number variants, infertility diagnosis and genetic counseling); biomedical research (mechanistic studies of cancer induction, radiation effects, and chemical toxicology); and governmental agencies (retrospective biodosimetry-evaluation of radiation exposure as might occur accidentally or from a terrorist attack).  Ultimately, multi-color chromatid paints will provide genome-wide translocation identification, just as mFISH and SKY currently do, and in addition will allow simultaneous and sensitive detection of inversions, making it possible, even probable, that chromatid paints may eventually capture much of the market currently held by chromosome paints.",Biomedical and Life Support; Biomolecular Sensors

Three sequential objectives will be completed: (1) Subsystems consisting of a disposable microfluidics chip with multiple channels, fluorescence and light-scatter optics for cell detection, cell labeling protocols and reagents, electronics for controls and data processing and digital analysis and display hardware and software will be constructed and tested on the basis of Phase I research results.  (2) Subsystems will be integrated into a benchtop flow cytometer for counting red and white blood cells and three subsets of white blood cells.  (3) A compact hand-held cytometer device will be delivered to the sponsor.

The immune system of crew members, compromised by weeks of low gravity, renders them more susceptible to acute radiation effects of a solar proton storm.  Post-irradiation blood cell counts of irradiated humans has always been vital to their appropriate medical care.  Thus a (very compact) blood cytometer will also be critical to future deep space exploration missions.  Therefore, infusion into NASA mission needs and projects constitutes providing this technology for (1) cell and immunology research aboard the ISS and ISS National Lab, (2) medical monitoring of ISS crew members via the Human Research Program (HRP), and (3) medical monitoring of deep-space exploration crews, especially following a solar proton storm.","With its low cost and potential for automated manufacturing the proposed Microfluidic Multichannel Flow Cytometer, in specialized versions can be used for the monitoring of CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in AIDS patient care in underserved populations, blood cell counting in neonates using a drop of heel-prick blood (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development), in-field blood tests of military personnel, and of research and testing laboratories that cannot afford, or do not have access to, a cytometry facility. A major advantage is that it processes a single drop of whole blood automatically inside the chip allowing it to be used in low-resource settings. The potential market for such a device is large.

The proposed detection technology leverages changes in optical transmission through a surface due to molecular binding (e.g., antibody-antigen binding).  Antibodies specific to the white blood cell surface protein markers (antigens) are pre-coated on the sensor surface to recognize specific white blood cell types with inherently high specificity and sensitivity.  In Phase I we developed surface chemistry and demonstrated surface chemistry sensitivity and specificity for total white blood cells and two lymphocyte subtypes (B-cells, CD4+ T-cells).  During phase II we will develop a functional prototype of the OILWBCS-MEMS device to demonstrate that end-to-end operations from sample-in to signal-out produces clinically relevant results.  The OILWBCS-MEMS design will include single-use replaceable cartridges for fluid loop and sensor components.","The proposed OILWBCS-MEMS white blood cell counting system could provide on orbit white blood cell counting capability, currently not available on orbit, for experimental support and monitoring astronaut health and performing biomedical research on International Space Station (ISS), Crew Exploration Vehicles (CEV), and etc. White blood cell counts are extremely important as a diagnostic tool.  With its high specificity/sensitivity, compact size, multiplexed counting capability, and automated operation, the proposed system can also provide a powerful cell counting capability for NASA's ground based biomedical research and development Physiological testing and experimentation will be supported through the use of a white blood cell counting system.  White blood cell counts, however, are also extremely important as a diagnostic tool.","Besides NASA's on orbit application, the proposed white blood cell counting system could be used to perform immuno-based cell counting for ground applications, similar to that done by flow cytometers. In general, any existing immuno-based cell counting performed for research and development, could potentially be accomplished with our proposed approach. The benefits of our proposed nanohole array cell counting system include high specificity and sensitivity for simultaneous counting of multiple cell types, compact size, low power consumption, and full automation.  The OILWBCS-MEMS will be particularly suited as a tool for remote applications for example in battlefield medical facilities or in other mobile medical centers, such as ambulances, triage centers, disaster response and for use in third-world medical facilities.

The development of efficient odor removal systems for use inside lunar architectures is one of NASA's critical needs (2008 SBIR Topic X2.03). Because of the limited space and resources in both exploration vehicles and non-moving habitats, a treatment system must be compact, lightweight, and robust, and have low energy and material input requirements, with focus on reducing equivalent system mass (ESM). We have developed a novel, robust, and highly effective Silica-Titania Composite (STC) technology capable of adsorbing and oxidizing VOCs to harmless byproducts when irradiated with UV light. The effectiveness of the technology for removal of ethanol from air when irradiated continuously with UV was proven under Phase I. This Phase II proposal will focus on the design, fabrication, and evaluation of a prototype employing the STC technology with UV LEDs as the light source, challenged with several VOCs simultaneously. The prototype will be designed based on the requirements of the Lunar Habitat in NASA's Lunar Outpost mission. Revised ESM calculations will be completed after system optimization, and a final prototype will be delivered to NASA for future testing.","The proposed system is equally well suited for use in space exploration vehicles, as well as permanent space habitats. The STC technology has numerous applications in air and water purification, most of which fit into the specific needs of NASA's Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) systems. This includes not only gas-phase odor removal related to VOCs, but also pathogen inactivation in both gases and liquids, removal of organic compounds from gray water, and removal from a number of inorganic compounds from air. Although VOC-related gas-phase odor removal is the primary application for which the system will be tailored, further development of the treatment system may make it suitable for other NASA applications. Some specific missions of interest within the Constellation Program include the Altair Lunar Lander, Lunar Outpost, Small Pressurized Rover, Payload, Mars Transit Vehicle, Mars Lander, Mars Outpost, Mars Rover, and ground support applications.","The STC technology is applicable to several non-NASA applications. For example, the technology can be used to remove VOCs from indoor air in commercial buildings, homes, hospitals, and schools. It may also be used by the military for air purification in submarines and aircraft. The technology is currently being developed for use in commercial aircraft cabin air purification. Significant work has been done in the development of the technology for methanol removal from gaseous exhaust at pulp and paper mills. Furthermore, the STC technology has been commercialized for mercury removal from caustic exhaust at a chlor-alkali facility, and a pilot-scale study is under way for mercury removal from coal-fired power plant flue gas.",Testing Requirements and Architectures

The regeneration process, which requires minimal material and energy consumption, can be completely automated and the filtration performance can be restored within a very short period of time.  The overall system filtration efficiency is targeted towards the HEPA standards, where the HEPA filters cannot be regenerated effectively.","Dust pollution is one of the major issues that threaten the health of the astronauts and system reliability for Moon and Mars exploration.  NASA has a clear need to remove particulate matter suspended in habitat air.  The filtration system needs to be highly efficient, durable, reliable, and simple to maintain.Preferably, the system would be capable of in situ regeneration that would be required infrequently. The proposed filtration system, capable of being regenerated in place by utilizing changes in the atmospheric humidity, is very promising.  It would not require intense reverse air pulses to renew the filtration surface as conventional filters do.  Elimination of the pulse cleaning allows the filtered particulate to be collected in aggregate form, thereby simplifying mission atmospheric control.","While the novel filtration media contemplated in this proposal is directed toward NASA missions, substantial additional opportunities also exist, both within the Department of Defense and in civilian markets.Within land forces there are numerous vehicles and stationary installations that require atmospheric control to afford protection from biological and particulate (radiological) threats.  Filtration is an integral part of that protection.  However in remote and hostile environments, the efforts required to maintain the filtration equipment can be problematic.  Thus an efficiently regenerative microfilter would be advantageous.  Uses for such a device range from personnel carriers, battle tanks, remote command centers, and field hospitals.  We estimate that there may be 50,000 such vehicles/installations in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps that could utilize this technology.Other applications include biological filtration, protein purification, and precision filtration for the milk and beverage industry that requires good anti-fouling, and regeneration properties.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning; Composites

Resupply of water is prohibitively costly for such extended missions.  Water reclamation processes typically recover 90-95% of the water present in wastewater formed by combining urine, hygiene water, and humidity condensate with the remaining concentrated in brine.  This concentrated brine contains a significant amount of water, potentially a very valuable resource.  The proposed prototype development will recover virtually all of the remaining water using an ultrasonic brine dewatering system (UBDS).  In the UBDS process, extremely small nebulized droplets of the brine are created ultrasonically at the brineair interface.  Small droplets enable quicker drying due to their high relative surface area. This is particularly important when drying brines that contain thermally labile materials, which require relatively low temperature drying.  The UBDS prototype has no nozzles to become plugged, requires little power, is simple and small, requires minimal astronaut attention and is compatible with continuous, closed cycle operation that can be made gravity independent.  The innovative Phase 2 prototype will fulfill the unmet need to significantly improve water loop closure during extended manned missions.  The Phase 2 project will provide an automated UBDS prototype that will be delivered to NASA for further testing.","The NASA application of this innovative technology will be as Hardware for Lunar Base and other Early Planetary Bases.  The partial gravity at these locations will permit nebulization without the use of a wick.  Gravity based water accumulation at the bottom of the condenser will be accomplished without the assistance of an air/water separator.  This technology will enable efficient water recovery from brines resulting in a major mass closure for water usage on Lunar Base.  Use as Flight Hardware for Transit Missions is also anticipated.  With this application, a wick will be used to hold the brine at the desired location during nebulization.  An air/water separator will be included to facilitate separation without the assistance of gravity.","For the private sector, a major application is improved drying processes for pharmaceuticals.   Many biologically active compounds are thermally labile and would benefit from the use of this technology for preparation of inhalants.  In addition, the ultra-small size of the resulting particles is desirable for inhalation because they are more easily suspended in air and because solvation and uptake through the alveoli in the lungs is more efficient for small particles.  For example, NaCl particles are widely used in dry powder inhalers for bronchial provocation tests to identify people with active asthma or exercise-induced asthma.  Such powders are currently made using laborious processes to control particle sizes and distributions. The technology developed during this SBIR project will allow continuous formation of small, dried NaCl crystallites, in a process more amenable for large-scale production.",Waste Processing and Reclamation

The objective of the Phase I SBIR program was to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating pyrolysis, tar cracking, and oxidation steps into a compact, efficient, system for processing spacecraft solid wastes. This integration, which was based on a microwave pyrolysis/cracking/oxidation unit, has resulted in a significant reduction in energy consumption per gram (~70% when compared to a conventional unit), and an overall reduction in system complexity.

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable, compact, flight-qualifiable, microgravity-compatible, TOC analyzer (TOCA) for online, real-time water monitoring with an operational lifetime of 5 years with no need to resupply chemicals or water. Key components include an electrochemical unit that eliminates the need to resupply or store chemicals, an effective oxidation processor for TOC conversion to carbon dioxide, a compact, stable inorganic carbon sensing unit, and mesofluidic design for reduced ESM. During Phase I, Lynntech successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by designing, fabricating, and testing both the critical components and an integrated breadboard TOCA. During Phase II, an optimized, reliable, compact, flight-qualifiable, microgravity-compatible TOCA prototype will be designed, fabricated, tested, and delivered to NASA.","Successful development of a compact online total organic carbon analyzer (TOCA) will lead to quality monitoring of the reclaimed and stored water supplies on-orbit and their suitability for crew consumption by indicating the potential presence of hazardous chemicals. Improved monitors are desired for the ISS and are essential for crew safety on the planned long-duration missions to the moon and Mars. The proposed technology will provide reliable, real-time monitoring of water quality by indicating the level of organic contaminants in the recycled water. It will solve key issues for manned space missions: there is no need to supply chemicals or water; chemical storage and handling as well as sample pre-dilution are eliminated; minimal crew maintenance time is required; the unit has a low equivalent system mass; and testing water volumes used are minimal.","Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis is a well-defined and commonly used analytical tool. Many water utilities monitor TOC to determine raw water quality or to evaluate the effectiveness of processes designed to remove organic carbons. Successful development of a compact online total organic carbon analyzer (TOCA) will have a high commercial applicability to a wide range of industries where water quality assurance and control is important, such as the semiconductor or pharmaceutical industries.",Biomedical and Life Support; Waste Processing and Reclamation

It offers advantages in performance, ease of cleanup, compatibility with on-board environmental systems, and ability to recharge during a mission. ADA Technologies has designed and built a prototype hand-held extinguisher that successfully extinguished test fires in an atmosphere of 34% oxygen and 8 psia total pressure, representing manned spacecraft environments.In this Phase II SBIR project ADA proposes to advance this FWM prototype toward production status by incorporating design improvements compatible with space-based operation and validating the new configuration in fire tests in the spacecraft environment chamber (34% O2 & 8 psia) operated by team member Colorado School of Mines. We will also plan for microgravity (aircraft) testing and prepare a Flight Qualification Test Plan to be used to estimate costs for flight qualification of the hardware. Finally, the production prototype will be tested against UL standard 711 class 2B and 5B flammable liquid fires. A comprehensive specification and drawing package will be prepared. All Phase II project activities will be directed toward advancing the TRL of the technology to Level 8. In Phase II we have added a partner experienced in the production and qualification of flight test fixtures and experiments. ADA has also initiated discussions with a NASA contractor for spacecraft as well as with a commercial supplier of fire protection equipment to take this technology into the broader commercial marketplace, targeting aerospace and flammable fuels storage as early market segments.","Fine Water Mist (FWM) is a versatile fire suppression technology ideal for application in manned spacecraft and planetary habitats. It is effective and efficient, with a small mass and volume impact. NASA recently identified FWM as a leading candidate technology for fire protection on the Altair lunar lander. The ADA prototype design can be operated in any gravity environment, including microgravity, and with the gravity vector in any orientation with respect to the extinguisher. The ADA FWM extinguisher is rechargeable on-station, a key feature for extended lunar and planetary missions. In addition, FWM is fully compatible with spacecraft systems, using only water and nitrogen as agents which offer no adverse impact to human health. ADA has identified two candidate partners to advance our technology through flight qualification to supply hardware for Constellation family of manned spacecraft. Fine Water Mist Fire Suppression is also useful and effective in a range of applications in NASA facilities and Ground Support Equipment. ADA has designed, built, and tested specialized FWM systems for use in hazardous environments on board US Air Force aircraft, and has worked on conceptual designs for such applications as flammable liquid storage and ground protection of aircraft. We believe that Fine Water Mist would prove ideal for many NASA fire protection situations. ADA plans to partner with a commercial supplier of fire suppression equipment to bring this technology to market.","Significant market opportunities exist outside the base applications within NASA.  ADA will leverage these to create a commercial opportunity for our FWM technology that is of significant potential impact to the company while satisfying the NASA need/requirement.  Aerospace applications (airlines) constitute one major opportunity.  Airplanes are currently equipped with halon extinguishers  both automatic and handheld.  However, halon is no longer in production and the European Union is mandating its replacement even prior to the depletion of Halon stockpiles.  FWM is an excellent candidate for this application as it is very effective, safe for human exposure, and environmentally friendly.  ADA's fine water mist system is also a great fit for fire protection in vehicle and enclosed space applications. Military vehicles, subway trains, museums, passenger and merchant ships, hotels, data centers, flammable fuel storage locations are among promising markets. Overall, this is a several hundred million dollar market opportunity, and FWM will have a positive impact on safety, human health, and the environment. ADA has begun discussions with companies that have existing fire protection products and market share to update their product lines and increase market opportunities.

A low-pressure drop separation unit is needed to remove these sulfur compounds from regolith process streams that is compact and lightweight. To this end, Reactive Innovations, LLC proposes a Phase II SBIR program to continue the development of an electrochemical reactive-separation unit to selectively bind and remove the sulfur compounds into a separated stream of sulfur-based compounds. During the Phase I program, we developed and successfully demonstrated an electrochemical reactive-separation platform that binds sulfur compounds via a charge transfer process to a redox carrier that is subsequently transported across a membrane separator releasing the sulfur components. The Phase II program will continue to develop the membrane electrode assemble to improve the separation process as well as transition this technology to RIL's advanced reactor platform for more extensive testing. The Phase I effort has brought this lunar regolith reactive-separator unit to a Technology Readiness Level of 3.

(MEI) and the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) propose to develop and demonstrate a microchannel methanation reactor based on nanofabricated catalysts.  Our innovative approach of combining microchannel reactor technology with nanofabricated catalysts provides the synergy between these two emerging technologies with the potential to enhance reaction efficiency by orders of magnitude.  This improvement in efficiency leads to more compact and lower mass reactor systems.  Thermal and mass diffusion distances in microchannel reactors range from tens to hundreds of microns versus tens to hundreds of millimeters in conventional reactors.  Slow heat and mass transfer dominate the operation of conventional reactor designs, thus limiting reaction kinetics.  As is well known, catalytic efficiency increases with decreasing catalyst particle size (reflecting higher surface area per unit mass) and chemical reactivity frequently is enhanced at the nanoscale.  By virtue of their nanoscale dimensions, nanotubes and nanorods geometrically restrict the catalyst particle size that can be supported upon the tube walls.  By confining catalyst particles to sizes smaller than the CNT diameter, a more uniform catalyst particle size distribution may be maintained.  The high dispersion provided by the vast surface area of the nanoscale material serves to retain the integrity of the catalyst by reducing sintering or coalescence.  To maximize catalyst exposure, our design includes hierarchical support structures, consisting of a 3-d network of open pores within the microreactor structure, and finally the nanofabricated support.  Additional advantages of the hierarchical catalyst support structure include minimal pressure drop (while providing superior catalyst contact) without the need to resort to fluidized bed configurations.","The primary target application of this technology is the inclusion of our prototype methanation reactor in the demonstration of an integrated carbothermal reduction system for the production of oxygen from lunar regolith.  The development of highly efficient microchannel reactors will be applicable to multiple ISRU programs.  As this technology can be applied to a wide range of processes, the applications are numerous.  NASA is currently pursuing technologies to convert plastics and other crew solid waste to carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and/or water (per NASA SBIR 2009 Phase I solicitation).  Our proposed microreactor could be used to subsequently convert these carbon oxides to methane as a fuel.  Propellants can be produced from carbon dioxide (Mars atmosphere).  Methane reformation can be used to produce hydrogen onboard fuel cell power rovers, enabling many mobility concepts.  Ethylene can be produced from methane.  Ethylene is a feedstock for production of polyethylene and ethanol. Methane reformation can produce hydrogen on board rovers to feed fuel cell power systems.  Polyethylene can be used in the construction of habitats, tools, and replacement parts.  Ethanol can be used as a nutrient for Astrobiology experiments, as well as a precursor for the production of nutrients (e.g. sugars) for human crew.","Makel Engineering has strong interest in the development and utilization of renewable fuels.  Makel Engineering has ongoing research and field test demonstration activities in the utilization of biogas (e.g., dairy, landfill) for stationary power generation, and is currently partnering with the California Energy Commission and a major California utility (Sacramento Municipal Utility District  SMUD).  In most cases, clean up of the biogas stream is required.  To date, the commercially available method is the use of a sorbent, like activated carbon filters, which eventually saturate and need to be disposed.  If microreactor-based systems are successfully developed, catalytic clean-up will become cost-effective, and would eliminate the need to dispose of saturated filters.  Processes of interest include desulfurization, removal of siloxane, etc.  There is also growing interest in the production of biofuels from a variety of sources.  Commercially, biodiesel is produced utilizing homogeneous catalysts.  However, there is growing interest and research in the utilization of heterogeneous catalysts to simplify the production process and enable distributed production as smaller scales.  Our proposed hierarchical support design is well suited for liquid biofuel production, as it provides excellent catalyst exposure, and precludes the need of separation of the catalyst from the product stream.",In-situ Resource Utilization

In Phase 1 experimentation, scaleable iridium and iridium-alloy anodes demonstrated a capability for generating more than 1 L of oxygen from a silicate melt.  The use of external heaters in the lab-scale cell imposed severe limitations on its performance, which constrained the duration and the rate of oxygen production in these experiments.Based on the successful Phase 1 results and the demonstrated need for a robust, long-duration, larger-scale electrolysis cell, ERC proposes a plan for the design, construction and demonstration of a reactor capable of producing oxygen at a rate of 1 kg/day or more.  A self-heating cell is critical for resolving reactor containment issues, and a critical innovation will allow this to be realized at much smaller scales than those previously required with other electrolytic processes.  Successful demonstration will greatly enhance the technology readiness level of molten oxide electrolysis for oxygen generation by means of in-situ resource utilization.","NASA has identified In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) as a key paradigm behind the establishment of a permanent lunar base. An important resource is oxygen, and Molten Oxide Electrolysis has been identified as a potential technology for extracting this resource in-situ.While MOE has produced oxygen on a laboratory scale, critical systems must be developed to meet the goals of producing in excess of 1 metric ton of oxygen per year in the lunar environment. The proposed work, Advanced Self-Heated Cell Reactor using Large-Scale Inert Anode for MOE, significantly advances the technology readiness level of the MOE process for ISRU oxygen generation.The proposed self-heated cell reactor using larger scale anodes would resolve two major challenges in scaling operations, and provide a platform for studying the MOE process in much greater depth and for longer periods than ever before.","In addition to producing oxygen for lunar exploration, inert-anode MOE has the potential to make an even greater impact on the global metals industry. Capable of reducing metals from their oxide states, the process is under development as a lower-energy, environmentally-sustainable method for producing titanium. Currently, research is conducted with carbon anodes, which are consumed to produce CO2.  The introduction of inert anodes would make the process CO2-free.  While the rewards of commercialization are high, electrolytic metal process development has traditionally been risky because of the size-scales necessary to reach a self-heated reactor.  Thus, development of a lab-scale, self-heated reactor using large inert anodes would revolutionize the commercialization of MOE processes.  An advanced, inert-anode reactor would increase experimental throughput and process development in the multi-billion dollar global titanium industry.Such a reactor would also allow the process to be adapted for the production of other metals such as iron, chromium, and nickel.  In the future, we envision MOE with inert anodes as a method for the green, electrochemical extraction of steel, the world's most-used structural material. The development of the advanced self-heated reactor with a scaled-up inert anode for use in molten oxides is a pivotal enabling technology for these revolutionary goals.",Ceramics; In-situ Resource Utilization; Metallics

During this effort, an innovative composite thrust chamber is being developed that will incorporate advanced ceramic oxide and iridium liner techniques as well as replacing the expensive, high density rhenium with a low mass carbon-carbon composite.  The Phase I results have demonstrated the potential of combining innovative fabrication techniques to produce an advanced ceramic-Ir lined C-C thrust chamber. Hot gas testing has shown the ability of the ceramic oxide coating to reduce the exterior temperature of the C-C jacket, which will enable the use of higher temperature propellants for improved performance.  No damage was observed in the ceramic-Ir liner as a result of hot gas testing.  During Phase II, the techniques will be optimized to allow fabrication of a 3000 lbf chamber that will be delivered to NASA-MSFC for hot-fire testing.","PPI's targeted NASA application is for the Altair Ascent Module main engine.

(Touchstone) has developed a novel and innovative Out-of-Autoclave (OOA) composites manufacturing process with an electrically heated carbon foam tooling system. Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) utilizes a coal-based carbon foam (CFOAMREG) core that serves as both the tool substrate and the heating source for a composite part being cured. The tool heating is a result of flowing current through the carbon foam, which results in heating.  This approach to self-heated tooling is a potentially enabling technology for manufacturing large composite structures by eliminating the need for autoclaves and large curing ovens, as well as by reducing costs, weight, and improving composite part quality.The overall objective of the NASA Phase 2 program will be to optimize critical factors for thermal uniformity in a CFOAM Electrically Heated Tool (EHT) and to validate the electrically heated cure process with current state-of-the-art OOA materials.  The data generated will be used to produce a Scaled Composite Shroud (SCS) cylindrical mandrel EHT that will be designed, fabricated, tested, and used to cure a large composite part without an autoclave or oven.  The SCS demonstration tool will be up to an 8' diameter and 12' length mandrel, which will be approximately one-forth of the scale as a tool necessary for an ARES V composite structure.","Carbon Foam Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) has direct application for NASA programs that involve manufacturing large composite structures in an out-of-autoclave (OOA) process.  Programs such as the ARES V Heavy Launch Vehicle as well as the ARES I Crew Launch Vehicle are utilizing composite materials in order to maintain weight efficiency.  Manufacturing composites OOA with a CFOAM EHT will maintain process cost efficiency while keeping weights low.  The EHT technology application is not limited to large structures, however, and does have utility for any NASA component made from composite materials. Specifically, on ARES V, the Composite Payload Shroud, the Composite Interstage, and the Composite Structures of both the Core Stage and the Earth Departure Stage are all targeted applications for CFOAM EHT technology.   On ARES I, the Composite Frustrum of the First Stage, the Composite Interstage structures, and others are also applications for CFOAM EHT technology.   Composite components of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle are another application of EHT cure process.","Carbon Foam Electrically Heated Tooling (EHT) also has several commercial applications in the commercial and defense industry, which also share NASA's issue of manufacturing composite structures in an out-of-autoclave environment. These industries also rely heavily on composite material to maintain low-weight and high-strength designs.  Touchstone is actively working with prime contractors and DoD agencies such as the Air Force and Missile Defense Agency to utilize CFOAM tooling technology. Programs that can potentially benefit from CFOAM EHT development are the SM3, THAAD, and KEI missile systems along with other commercial aerospace programs.  Aerospace applications that will benefit from OOA EHT technology development include helicopter blade spars, missile fairings, airplane fuselage sections, and numerous others.",Composites; Launch and Flight Vehicle; Multifunctional/Smart Materials

Significant development is called for in the area of devices and structures that tolerate or mitigate the presence of lunar dust. Honeybee Robotics seeks to develop a scalable dust-tolerant, autonomous utility connector for lunar surface system applications with a focus on small pressurized rover recharge. Honeybee has heritage in developing mechanisms for extreme, dusty environments. There are many near-term applications of such a connector including: the utility and electrical connections that will be used on the next-generation lunar EVA suit, cryogenic utility connections that will be used to pass liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen during in-situ resource utilization activities, and high-power electrical connectors capable of thousands of cycles for the Lunar Electric Rover (LER) battery recharge and data transfer functions. The Phase I program has resulted in (1) environmental testing of breadboard lunar dust-tolerant alignment features for autonomous utility connections capable of accommodating ±20˚ angular and ±1.5cm lateral approach misalignment; and (2) a conceptual design that integrates the dust-tolerant alignment features with our dust-tolerant electrical connector and mechanical connection mechanisms based on lessons learned during environmental testing of the alignment feature breadboard. In Phase II, Honeybee will develop a prototype autonomous utility connector that integrates the alignment features, mechanical connection mechanism and electrical connection mechanism; testing the prototype in our lunar Dusty environment Simulation Test chamber that is capable of closely reproducing the conditions of the lunar surface.  This effort will lead to the development of an autonomous dust-tolerant utility connector to TRL 6 with a focused application to the battery recharge connector for the LER being developed for the Constellation program.","The dust-tolerant autonomous connection mechanisms to be developed through this project will be an enabling technology for extended lunar operations in that they will allow several cycles of utility connection and disconnection for EVA and surface operations.  Future mission scenarios involving erectable structures, diverse EVA-compliant tools, Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)-to-rover or EMU-to-robot interfaces, and other in-situ assembly or interconnection activities will all call for dust-tolerant reusable connectors. In particular, the Constellation Lunar Electric Rover utility recharge connectors will require dust-tolerant technology.  Discussions have already begun to this effect with engineers from NASA, Oceaneering, and Ball Aerospace.","Military and homeland security operations are often conducted in uncontrolled environments. An increasing use of high-technology tools provides for improved performance, but also introduces new risks. The incorporation of dust-tolerant autonomous connection mechanisms in military couplings will allow greater reliability and flexibility for modular electronics in operational scenarios, especially in dusty, dirty, sandy environments. Incorporation of dust-tolerant connectors would also reduce maintenance, repair, and overhaul costs by reducing select component failures due to degradation by dust and sand. Current connectors meet stringent mil-spec environmental requirements when connected, but the connection itself must be made under clean conditions. We expect that adding a tolerance to making and breaking connections under off-nominal conditions will result in an increased service life for modular electronics for use in military and homeland security applications. There is also broad commercial potential for dust-tolerant autonomous connectors in several commercial applications requiring the reliable performance of modular electronics in uncontrolled environments, including oil and gas exploration, first responders and emergency services, heavy and highway construction, and mining. By employing dust-tolerant connectors, rather than attempting to seal dust intolerant connectors against the environment, the connectors used in these applications may be truly ruggedized.",Airlocks/Environmental Interfaces; Fluid Storage and Handling; In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Manipulation; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Modular Interconnects; Portable Life Support; Suits; Testing Facilities; Tools

By using NGS survey markers, with centimeter-leve position accuracy, as test sites, we expect to create a truth model for both absolute and relative position measurements that is essentially error free (relative to the LNS accuracy), thus allowing very accurate characterization of both random and systematic errors for both absolute and relative position measurements.  This unambiguous characterization of the total error will allow validation (or correction) of the navigation error models and assessment of system performance with a high level of confidence.  Additionally, the LNS prototype hardware is sufficiently small (roughly shoebox size with a laptop PC for data collection) and easy to set up (put on a tripod over the NGS marker), that it can easily be taken to multiple test locations.  Finally, a detailed technology roadmap will be created showing how the TRL 6 LNS can be raised to TRL 9, ready for flight.","This lunar navigator technology is applicable for navigation of landers, rovers, balloons, or airplanes on or above the surface of any planets, asteroids, or moons for which stars can be seen from the surface. The navigator device is potentially low cost, light weight, and exceptionally robust in that it does not depend on any external resources for navigation.

Known as lunar regolith, it has been produced by meteorite impacts since the formation of a solid lunar surface billions of years ago.  The regolith, while promising as a future building material for lunar installations, also poses a hazard in the form of dust clouds being generated by all forms of gas expansions in the high vacuum environment of the lunar surface.  This is especially pronounced during spacecraft operations; a single lunar landing and take-off emits the same amount of gas as the whole lunar atmosphere contains.  Instruments placed on the moon by the Apollo mission showed marked degradation due to damage from dust released during the lander's takeoff.  Since there is no air movement to remove the dust after it is deposited, it is essential that dust is not displaced during everyday operations of a permanent lunar installation.Adherent Technologies, Inc. (ATI) has over the last decade developed a number of specialty UV-curing resins for NASA applications in space.  In the Phase I program, ATI developed a resin and dispenser system to coat large areas of lunar surface around landing pads and atmosphere locks with a thin, dust-stabilizing coating.  The coating is UV stable and elastic enough to weather the temperature extremes of a lunar day and night cycle.  Special emphasis was given to a low outgassing, solvent-free system that does not contaminate the lunar atmosphere.In the Phase II program, ATI will optimize the resin formulations from the Phase I for thin film coatings.  By comparing those to two-part resin systems, a balance between required properties and needed launch weight can be struck for different mission profiles.  The engineering development will concentrate on a lightweight, reliable spray system to be added onto existing NASA moon vehicles.","The primary application for the new coating is dust mitigation for future lunar missions, especially near the landing pad for a permanent installation.  It can be combined with ATI's penetrating two-part formulations for roads and landing pads in a single applicator, potentially as an add-on to the planned lunar earth mover.The resin development also supports application of UV-cure resins in Rigidization on CommandTM systems for inflatable structures like shelters and antennas as well as structural repair tapes.","Initial commercialization of the dust mitigation resin system will center on terrestrial dust mitigation and leaching prevention for industrial waste sites like mine tailings.

Maintaining water in the vapor phase greatly reduces membrane swelling which should increase durability.  Finally, by keeping water in the vapor phase the MEA is not exposed to ion and other contaminants that are carried by a liquid water stream, further increasing durability and simplifying the system by reducing the need for ultra-pure water.  The primary goal of this Phase I program is to demonstrate a high-pressure (1000 psi) static vapor feed electrolyzer and demonstrate that the system can operate without purge of the water feed stream for up to 100 hours.","Lunar and space stations, satellites, high altitude aircraft.Terrestrial water electrolyzers typically utilize an abundance of recirculated water to the electrolyzer, usually on the anode (oxygen) side, where it serves reactant, coolant, and as the ""carrier"" phase wherein the product oxygen is carried from the anode by the pumped water.  Subsequent to leaving the electrolyzer the phases are separated by gravity in a receiving tank.  In near-zero or low-gravity environments, this separation is difficult to achieve.  Doing so results in additional system complexity and compromised process efficiency.  As part of a regenerative fuel cell system, NASA has a need for highly-efficiency, but robust technologies capable of storing energy in the form of stored hydrogen and oxygen.

Thus the static vapor feed technology may be useful in alcohol-air batteries such as those used for portable power.  In all these applications, the management of the gases and liquids involved generates significant complexity that inevitably increases the cost and reduces reliability of such devices.  As such, they will all benefit from static water vapor feed technologies.  Those benefits actually create the market for this technology.",Energy Storage; Renewable Energy

The nanocomposite design provides a synergistic improvement in reversible capacity and electrochemical cycling as a result of the unique silicon architecture and structural reinforcement provided by the nanofibers.  In the Phase II program, PSI will increase cell size to 2.5 mAh and optimize cell design to further improve cycle life.  PSI will deliver to NASA 2.5 Ah lithium ion cells with an energy density greater than 220 Wh/kg that is required by NASA's future robotic and human exploration missions.  In collaboration with a battery manufacturer, PSI will also demonstrate that this anode technology is scaleable to reach industrial production level.","Energy storage with improved weight and volume performance are required for various NASA applications which are both orbital and planetary surface.  Flight elements of the Exploration Vision initially include the Orion and ARES crew and launch vehicles, respectively. For lunar capability, additional elements include the Lunar Lander or Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM), robotic missions, and surface systems. Surface systems include human habitats, Extravehicular Activities (EVA), science measurements, and the utilization of in situ resources. This lithium-ion battery system has the capability to provide an energy density of greater than 220 Wh/kg with a 1-year calendar year service life.  The battery system contains no toxic materials and lends itself to being human rated for Exploration missions.  These mission applications include portable power for landers, rovers, and astronaut equipment; storage systems for crew exploration vehicles and spacecraft; and stationary energy storage applications such as base power or peaking power applications.",Rechargeable lithium ion batteries have rapidly become the primary choice to power the next generation hybrid electric vehicles.  These battery packs require large volumes of low cost anode materials that provide higher charge and rate capability than graphite anodes.  This proposal will utilize carbon nanofiber stabilized silicon whisker as active materials that will provide unmatchable capacity and rate capability.  Success in the proposed Phase II research will result in a novel silicon whisker composite anode that can be readily incorporated in lithium ion batteries. The scalable synthesis process would allow the anode to be produced at a sufficiently low cost to allow incorporation in the targeted electric vehicle and bulk energy storage markets.,Energy Storage

Zero or low cryogenic propellant boiloff is required during extended missions and lengthy on-orbit times. Heat flow through multilayer insulation is usually the largest heat leak in cryogenic systems, so improvements are desirable. Load Responsive Multi-Layer Insulation (LRMLI) is an innovative new technology using micro-molded polymer dynamic spacers that provide high performance insulation both in-atmosphere and on-orbit.  LRMLI under atmospheric pressure compresses dynamic spacers to support an integrated, thin vacuum shell for high performance in-atmosphere operation, and disconnects the spacers during on-orbit/lunar surface operation to reduce heat leak and provide ultra-high performance thermal insulation.LRMLI was successfully proven feasible in Phase I work, reaching TRL4. A LRMLI prototype was built and tested and a 3-layer, 0.25"" thick blanket demonstrated 7.1 W/m2 (0.19 mW/m-K) heat leak for on-orbit and 14.3 W/m2 (0.34 mW/m-K) for in-atmosphere operation. Equal heat leak on-orbit of a 0.25"" LRMLI blanket (2.1 kg/m2) would require 16"" of SOFI (15 kg/m2), with LRMLI having a 64X advantage in thickness and a 7X advantage in mass.LRMLI insulation can provide superior cryogen insulation during ground hold, launch and on-orbit/vacuum conditions without need for purge. Total heat gain into cryogenic systems could be substantially reduced. Terrestrial non-NASA applications include LH2 powered aircraft and cars in development.This proposal is to further develop LRMLI toward commercialization. Tasks proposed include a study of both NASA& non-NASA applications to select two for further optimization, next generation design of dynamic spacers and modular vacuum shells, and building and testing prototypes in realistic environments such as a 3' diameter cryotank similar to a selected use like NASA Altair or Boeing HALE tanks.","Lightweight, high performance thermal insulation is critical to NASA's next generation spacecraft. Zero or low cryogenic propellant boiloff is required during extended missions. Load Responsive Multi-Layer Insulation (LRMLI) could provide high performance cryopropellant thermal insulation both in-atmosphere (pre-launch and ascent) and on-orbit for NASA Exploration EDS and Altair vehicles. Current insulation uses MLI, or SOFI/MLI, with purge systems.  LRMLI could reduce thickness, mass and purge needs, provide lower heat leak than SOFI or purged conventional MLI systems, and is a more robust insulation system.LRMLI has a unique ability to provide high performance thermal performance during ground hold, launch and on-orbit operation. It can provide substantially lower total mission heat gain, helping enable longer LEO and lunar surface missions.  LRMLI could provide insulation for cryogenic systems on space instruments, satellites, spacecraft cabins, lunar surface habitats and LH2 powered aircraft. LRMLI might provide micrometeorite protection. LRMLI could provide high performance insulation with adjustable thickness, mass and thermal conductance to fit mission requirements, with inherent control of layer dimension and spacing, more predictable performance, and a robust structure.","Terrestrial non-NASA applications of LRMLI are numerous since LRMLI operates efficiently in-atmosphere. LH2 powered aircraft are in design, with a critical aspect LH2 storage. A trade study found LRMLI the best choice with lower mass and heat leak than SOFI or MLI with heavy vacuum shell. LH2 powered cars are in development and would also benefit from LRMLI.Extremely efficient thermal insulation has use in a broad range of non-aerospace markets, including commercial applications such as cryogenic vessels & pipes in scientific and industrial applications. A major use is insulating cryogen dewars used in research, medical (personal LOX tanks) and industry, and insulating superconducting devices for MRI and high energy physics.Other potential applications include large commercial tanks, industrial boilers and hot and cold process equipment, refrigerated trucks/trailers, insulated tank, container and rail cars, liquid hydrogen fuel cells, appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, hot water heaters, mobile containers to keep foods hot or cold, marine refrigeration, potentially even thin insulation panels for buildings. Refrigerator/freezers and water heater appliances, alone, are a large market that could benefit from superior insulation with improved energy efficiency.  We have had discussions with dewar, refrigerator/freezer, vacuum insulated pipe and building insulation panel manufacturers, who have shown interest in this insulation technology.",Fluid Storage and Handling; Propellant Storage; Thermal Insulating Materials

The Altair (Lunar Lander) ascent stage requires LO2 and LCH4 storage durations of up to 14 days in LEO and up to an additional 210 days on the lunar surface.  Long term storage (224 days) of LO2 cryogenic propellant on the lunar surface is required to support space power systems, spaceports, spacesuits, lunar habitation systems, robotics, and in situ propellant systems.  Long term storage of LO2/ LH2/ LCH4 cryogenic propellants on the surface of the Earth with minimal propellant loss is required to support launch site ground operations.  This SBIR Phase II proposal focuses on improving the strength of aerogels which are the best cryogenic insulation materials known and proposes to develop non-compacting aerogel insulation that could be used to insulate cryotanks on launch vehicles and Earth, and in-space cryogenic fuel storage tanks.  During the Phase II effort, we will optimize and scale-up preparation of the crosslinked hybrid aerogels developed during the Phase I effort.  The best aerogels will be thoroughly characterized and tested in a relevant environment to attain a TRL of 5.","The material developed in the Phase II effort could have a variety of applications in the aerospace industry and within NASA.  Aerogels are the most efficient thermal insulation known, and NASA has several applications that would benefit from the low density and thermal conductivity of aerogels.  Aerogels could also be applied to NASA spacesuit applications, and insulation for cryogenic fuel tanks and cryogenic fuel transfer lines, and internal insulation applications on re-usable launch vehicles.  The insulating structural aerogels could be used to build insulated habitats on the Moon or Mars.","The resulting insulation system from this program will also have far reaching effects in both military and commercial applications.  The potential exists for insulating weapons, fuel tanks, electronics, and landing gear bays of military aircraft.  The products will have a commercial impact in areas such as: appliance insulation, airliner fuselages, LNG fuel storage tanks and transfer lines.

These include increased efficiency, reduced vibration and reductions in overall system mass and power consumption. For the small coolers required, pulse tube and Stirling coolers offer the best opportunities. At present, the efficiency of these coolers is limited by the effectiveness of low-temperature-stage regenerators. Below about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators. One is that the heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thereby, severely limiting the number of useful materials to a few in common use. A second factor is that these commonly used materials are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues. In this effort, we will address both factors. We will use newly developed materials with high heat capacities at temperatures below 80 K, higher than that of commonly used materials. Further, we will develop novel low-temperature regenerator matrix configurations that will address both the aspect of high-efficiency and regenerator durability. Both the void fracton and the ratio of surface area to solid fracton of the regenerator matrix will be varied to achieve high efficiency.","NASA is considering missions to the outer planets carrying significant amounts of propellant. Cryogenicly stored propellants offer the highest specific impulse of any chemical system. Zero boil-off (ZBO) propellant storage can directly impact these long-term exploration missions. It minimizes the launch mass such missions require. For ZBO missions high efficiency cryocoolers capable of providing cooling at 20 K are required. Other coolers being developed by NASA for use in astrophysics studies and radio-astronomy, will also greatly benefit from the londurable high efficiency low-temperature regenerators.",There are a number of commercial applications which require cryocoolers that will benefit from high efficiency low-temperature regenerators.

The oxygen and hydrogen will be produced by electrolysis of water from In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) reactors.  The electrolysis products will be warm high-pressure gases, requiring significant cryocooler power to achieve the desired storage conditions.  This power can be reduced by expanding the gases adiabatically from the electrolysis pressure to storage pressure.  We propose to develop innovative turboalternators to maximize this effect and convert the extracted fluid power into useful electric power.  Small flow rates and high fluid densities require turbine rotors that are extremely small and operate at high speeds.  Cryogenic gas bearings and miniature rotor fabrication techniques are key features that create high efficiency in our approach.  The gas bearings also enable reliable, long-life, maintenance-free operation.  The proposed development will leverage decades of Creare experience with cryogenic gas-bearing turbomachines.  In Phase I, we developed optimized turboalternator designs by conducting trade studies, specifying design details, analyzing performance, and demonstrating bearing operation with two-phase rotor flow.  During Phase II, we will create a complete set of fabrication drawings, develop critical fabrication processes, fabricate a prototype turboalternator, and measure its performance at representative operating conditions.","The primary NASA application for this technology is cryogenic fluid production to support extraterrestrial exploration and science.  Initial designs will focus on oxygen and hydrogen production for regenerative fuel cells on the lunar surface.  Future applications include liquid methane production, and alternative locations include other moons and planets in our solar system.  Such systems could also be used for in-situ reactant production and storage aboard space stations and transportation spacecraft.  Another potential application is to re-liquefy cryogens that boil off during in-space refueling of orbiting spacecraft.  Broader uses include improved efficiency for turbo-Brayton cryocoolers and power generators.

Structural integrity and high insulation behavior have been demonstrated when used in combination with a non-ablating, coated carbon/carbon or ceramic matrix composite outer shell. In Phase I, Ultramet demonstrated the initial feasibility of a foam-reinforced hybrid ablator/aerogel insulator thermal protection system (TPS) in which a portion of the thickness (front face) of a low thermal conductivity structural foam was infiltrated with an ablative material and the remainder of the thickness (back face) was filled with the high temperature aerogel insulator.

The three-dimensionally interconnected foam reinforcement is anticipated to provide increased char retention relative to alternative fiber and honeycomb reinforcements. The vehicle interface temperature will be controlled by the highly insulating aerogel-filled portion of the foam structure. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Materials Research & Design (MR&D) for continued thermomechanical design optimization, and ARA Ablatives Laboratory for ablator infiltration of Ultramet structural foam. Performance will be evaluated through high heat flux ablation testing and a demonstration of scaleup potential up to 18"" diameter.","The proposed foam-reinforced hybrid ablator-insulator may meet NASA requirements for increased TPS heat flux capability and reduced mass.

However, the complexity and size of the data acquired through flight data logging represent a challenge to the most complex tools to date. The effort proposed herein sets forth a multi-phase approach for the efficient application of existing data processing, visualization and analysis techniques for the identification and characterization of safety-relevant flight conditions, and for the identification of their precursors. The approach starts by reducing the voluminous flight data into a feature-based encoding, where features used for each flight parameter type are selected to match its specific variation. The second processing phase allows domain experts to efficiently inspect the flight data starting from detected exceedances, and to formulate constraint-based hypotheses regarding co-occurring events, and possible precursors. The third phase uses the hypotheses developed during the second phase to apply constraint-based data mining techniques for the identification of patterns associated with exceedances, and to identify the precursor sets for safety-relevant flight conditions. The description of the proposed effort also includes preliminary implementation results for selected prototype components, and establishes the feasibility of the investigated approach.","We expect the full-scope environment for Constraint-based Analysis of Aircraft Operations to have immediate and tangible benefit for the Aviation Performance Measurement System. The proposed capability provides an approach to analyzing the vast amount of data collected during routine flights, to detect and characterize behaviors that are transient, and may potentially remain undetected, and to identify their precursors. The proposed approach will offer domain experts immediate access to the important flight data analysis capabilities, and will be applicable to a variety of safety analysis problems and aircraft types. The proposed effort has also integration potential with components of the Aviation Safety Program at NASA?s Langley Research Center, and has application potential to the analysis of engine condition data for the Space Shuttle Main Engines.","The non-NASA commercial applications of the technology for Constraint-based Analysis of Aircraft Operations will pursue the licensing of our constraint-based behavior verification technology to system integrators in the intelligent agent industry, and the application of the proposed approach to maintenance operations conducted by major airlines. Recent commercial scale experiments have demonstrated that the identification and recognition of safety-relevant flight and engine conditions can help airlines significantly optimize their maintenance schedule. The proposed approach would represent a new step in that direction, by helping maintenance personnel to accurately define the context in which certain engine conditions occur, and to take appropriate measures."

In the Phase I effort, a novel spectroscopic technique was shown to be an effective method for measuring oxygen concentration in harsh environments with sufficient accuracy for use in an OBIGGS system. This system utilizes rapidly scanned Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Diode Lasers (VCSELs) to measure oxygen concentration by molecular absorption. This system can measure 1000 ppm to 100% oxygen in ambient temperatures from -60 to 150 F utilizing as the wavelength agile spectral-harmonic (WASH) technique. The wavelength agile aspect of the laser source/detection technique allows for temperature insensitive measurements of oxygen concentration over a wide range of pressures (0.3 atm to 2 atm) with high accuracy as well as with auto-calibration capabilities. The Phase II effort is focused on packaging this sensor technology in a form that is able to be inserted into an operational aircraft fuel tank and conform to a set of environmental and operational requirements as defined by both the OBIGGS needs as well as the fuel tank environment. Furthermore, achievement of the Phase II goal requires the miniaturization of the laser driver, data collection, and data processing functions into flight-scale electronic hardware.","There are many commercial and military applications for an accurate and rugged fuel tank oxygen concentration sensor. The fuel tank oxygen sensor could be used in both new and retrofit commercial aircraft as a control sensor for fuel tank protection systems. The reliable and precise instrument can be used to control onboard inert gas generation systems (OBIGGS) for cargo compartment fire suppression, fuel tank inerting, and emergency breathing oxygen systems (OBOGS) for passengers and crew. The key to the commercial viability of this product is the accuracy of the sensor, its ability to handle harsh environments including highly variable temperatures and pressures, and its reliability and lifetime, which we have engineered into the system. The long operating lifetime and stability of this measurement system in challenging operating environments are superior to existing oxygen measurement strategies.",This type of sensor can also be used to monitor the air/fuel ratio in terrestrial gas turbine and high pressure combustion systems where a rugged sensor with long operating life characteristics is needed. Also possible using this sensor is a real-time measurement of oxygen tension in respiratory gases and respiration monitoring. The absorption based technique has no biofouling effects and is nearly independent of scattering environments such as heavy droplet sprays or moisture making the sensor useful in biological measurements.

They are innovations that can provide tremendous opportunities for weight and cost reduction in future aerospace and non-aerospace systems.  To date, lattice block structures have been successfully fabricated for a number of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, but not extremely difficult to cast reactive metals such as titanium-based alloys.  As titanium is one of the most important metallic materials in existence today, with growing importance in aerospace systems due to its superior strength-to-density, high temperature strength, and corrosion resistance, titanium alloy lattice block structures offer significant benefits to NASA and the industry if they can be successfully produced.  Consequently, the purpose of this SBIR Phase II effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of casting full scale lattice block structures from titanium alloys using a proprietary investment casting process.  A successful Phase II project paves the way to manufacturing actual lattice block structural components in Phase III and beyond, providing the necessary foundation for a more widespread acceptance of this unique technology in the industry.","Titanium-based alloys, including gamma titanium aluminides, are high temperature materials that can meet the ever-increasing demands for more robust, higher temperature-tolerant, and lighter weight hypersonic vehicle airframe components for commercial and military systems.  Titanium and gamma lattice block materials can be used as low weight structures within these applications.  For example, gamma lattice block structures could be considered for sandwich structures for thermal protection system for the reusable launch vehicle.  Other potential NASA commercial applications include aircraft engine components such as fan blade and compressor casings, nozzle flaps, and engine tiles for next generation aircraft gas turbines.","Essentially, any application and/or industry that need superior strength-to-density within relative affordability while retaining the physical properties of titanium and gamma alloys could use lattice block structures.  Furthermore, those that require potential replacements for Ni-based superalloys at lower temperatures and for titanium alloys at higher temperatures could consider gamma alloys.  Potential commercial applications include aero engine components, automotive engine components, and aircraft and spacecraft structural applications.  Other possible uses of lattice block materials include components for furniture, shipboard structures, building structures, automotive vehicle frames, and a potentially limitless number of other possibilities."

Equally important, the Equivalent Source Reduction (ESR) experiments completed show a dramatic simplification of the problem of acoustically modeling surfaces, with little to no perceivable difference in the auralization.While AuSIM3D? real-time binaural rendering capacity has grown from a few point sound sources four years ago to a few dozen point sources presently, largely due to gains in commodity processor speed, the performance improvement capacity shown by SVD and the simplification of the acoustic surface modeling problem demonstrated possible with ESR has been much more dramatic.  Our results show hundreds of point sources can now be realistically rendered in real-time, and that these sources can represent a relatively large surface with negligible loss of accuracy.  When these techniques are integrated in the AuSIM3D client and server applications as proposed in Phase II, it will be possible for the first time to binaurally render the sound of an acoustic disturbance applied to a surface model of considerable area. AuSIM is also eager to optimize the ESR and SVD implementations into commercial-quality software applications to create the next generation of AuSIM3D technology.  With the newly added horsepower, AuSIM3D applications will be soon able to render directly the acoustic data generated by industry standard Finite Element Analysis (FEA) acoustics vendors such as MSC/Nastran, COMET Acoustics, and ABAQUS.  These firms have already signed Letters of Intent to provide whatever technical support, collaboration, and marketing resources we need to become fully interoperable with their systems.  Soon designers will be able to regularly hear the acoustic performance of the surfaces they've designed while the models are still on the electronic drawing board.","AuSIM's end product will import acoustic data from major commercial FEA packages, allowing NASA to use computer models of aerospace surfaces for airplanes, rotorcraft, and space vehicles.  NASA applications that have a need to perceive the acoustic characteristics of aerospace surfaces range from assisting the design phase and the design promotion phase to, in the worst-case-scenario, assisting in the accident analysis phase.In the design and redesign of new and existing aerospace vehicles, it will be very useful to hear the effect of airflow on external surfaces.  Although noise levels alone can be quantified fairly well with existing technology, the spectral coloration that gives each sound its distinct characteristics can also determine how pleasant or unpleasant the sound will be to listeners.  The acoustic comfort level of the crew and passengers inside the craft is an important design factor, as it will affect the flight crew's level of fatigue, which will affect their ability to operate the craft safely.Another factor of concern to NASA engineers is the sound generated by an aircraft or spacecraft that reaches the ears of people on the ground.  Our end product will enable a design to be simulated under a range of normal operating conditions, and enable the completion of a perceptual study that will help determine which designs will have the minimum negative psychological impact on passengers, ground crew, and the general public.","The largest commercial applications of the technology would be in the aircraft and automobile industries, where millions of dollars are spent yearly to get new vehicles to operate with a more comfortable noise level. The real-time acoustic data rendering capabilities that would be enabled with the development of the SVD/ESR-enhanced 3D audio binaural simulation software could be applied widely throughout the automobile design world by licensing it to be integrated with existing and broadly used industrial acoustics analysis packages. Such a combined package would offer significantly more display versatility to engineers designing to optimize acoustic performance than any other package available today.  Existing FEA packages with acoustics analysis modules do well at quantifying the noise levels and spectral characteristics of vehicle surfaces in the presence of an acoustic disturbance, but determining which frequency distributions plotted on a view graph will produce a negative visceral human response, versus which ones will sound pleasant or unobtrusive, is still an inexact science at best.  Therefore, vehicle designers are required to produce multiple prototypes and test them acoustically before bringing a product to market.  Our Phase II product will give these designers, and even their decision-making managers, the ability to hear prototypes in service before they ever leave the electronic drawing board, saving significant costs in the product prototype mockup stage."

A runway incursion alerting system is currently not available to any class of aircraft.  It is envisaged that the PathProx alerting algorithms would be a supplement to several other technologies that are currently under development.  These other technologies are GPS, ADS-B, and CDTI.

As there are no analytical tools or experimental facilities in the world today that can quantify a cavitating inducer?s dynamic transfer function, developing this capability is crucial for the safety, reliability and competitiveness of the American Space Industry.  An innovative experimental technique that uses mappings of inlet and exit flow and pressure fluctuations to quantify a cavitating inducer?s dynamic transfer function is proposed.  A cavitating inducer can be a source of instability in a rocket vehicle.  Due to cavitation dynamics, inlet flow perturbations maybe amplified by the inducer resulting in very large flow and pressure fluctuations in the fuel system.The resulting dynamic couplings can lead to vehicle instability (POGO) as well as generate intense dynamic loadings on the turbopump.  The feasibility of implementing the proposed measurement technique on an upgraded Concepts NREC water flow test loop was demonstrated in the Phase I effort.  Implementation of the test loop upgrades and demonstration of the transfer function measurement technique on a scaled inducer with a historical pedigree will occur in the proposed Phase II effort.","As mission requirements lead to higher power density turbopumps with lower specific weights and higher suction specific speed requirements the potential for flow-induced dynamic instabilities, both at the turbopump level and at the system level, increase.  Rocket vehicle dynamic models require an accurate dynamic characterization for the inducer.   The proposed experimentally measured dynamic transfer functions will provide accurate and reliable pump dynamic attributes which are necessary to assess the probability of destructive flow instabilities, such as cavitation surge and rotating cavitation, and their effect on engine component reliability and life expectancy and integrated vehicle system instability.","High energy density turbomachines such as gas re-injection pumps and compressors and high-energy density industrial pumps are a source of instability.  Accurate dynamic characterizations of these machines are required to ensure safe and reliable operation of the systems into which they are installed.  In addition to understanding the dynamic attributes of  these machines under cavitation or stalled conditions, the dynamic transfer function under normal operating conditions is also required.  The methodology proposed to measure the dynamic transfer function of a cavitating inducer is transferable.

Tungsten is being used for its high melting temperature (6170?F) and chemical stability. However, conventional tungsten materials have to be forged to get adequate properties. Forging tungsten into complex shapes is difficult and has limited its application. Small additions of rhenium improve the ductility of tungsten without significantly decreasing the melting point.

In previous work, Ultramet developed an ultraviolet-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (UVCVD) process that allows deposition of dense, strain-tolerant ceramics at room temperature, thus avoiding heat-induced material degradation and providing excellent material performance, including enhanced oxidation protection. Although these coatings have improved performance, identifying a single phase that best performs the two key functions of the interface coating, oxidation protection and interface slip, has proven elusive.

One multilayer system was employed in the fabrication of a carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) CMC that demonstrated the highest mechanical strength yet achieved for C/SiC using Ultramet's melt infiltration densification process, verifying the beneficial effect of the multilayer system via a 33% strength increase. The Phase II project will build on this encouraging preliminary room temperature data via further optimization of multilayer interface deposition at Ultramet and extensive evaluation of both coated tows and CMCs utilizing the coatings at the elevated temperatures expected in actual use.","Ceramic matrix composite materials are projected to significantly increase safety and reduce costs simultaneously, while decreasing weight for space transportation propulsion.

Currently-available TPS coatings are not adequate and do not have the durability required for use with RLVs.

Accordingly, the first focus of the proposed Phase II effort will be on the generalization of the approach to account for changes in all aspects of the 2 or 3-dimensional panel geometry and on the various material properties involved (Young?s modulus, ply angles and thickness, ...).  Panels are not independent structures but are part of more complex systems, e.g. panel + support + TPS, and an accurate estimate of the response/life of the panels must include the interaction with these other components.  Accordingly, the predictive and sensitivity capabilities of ELSTEP/FAT must be extended and validated for such integrated systems.  Computational aspects will also be re-visited to maintain the efficiency of ELSTEP/FAT.","The proposed design-oriented software (ELSTEP/FAT) will become the only available tool for the prediction of the response, fatigue life, and their design sensitivities of panels subjected to thermo-acoustic loads.  Additionally, it will include the capability to model the integrated panel system (panel + support thermal protection system) and thus will help in the transition from component design to system design.  With its strong focus on fatigue, ELSTEP/FAT will cover two separate markets (panels and fatigue) thereby increasing its distribution potential.

It will play an important role in the design of many flight vehicles including supersonic transports, reusable launch vehicles, RLV/TAV and other projects of NASA?s space initiative that experience severe thermal, acoustic, or both types of excitations.  The inclusion of the TPS modeling and of its interaction with the panel will provide a common platform for the development of these components and will help to transition from component design to system design.

Dynamic drag is minimized by using a grid construction.  This Grid-Sphere can provide electrodynamic tethers with the ability to passively collect arbitrarily large currents at the positive pole?requiring only low bias voltages.  This makes current collection independent of tether length and eliminates hazardous high-voltage operations.  The Phase-1 results include the development of grid-film materials with the required characteristics and the derivation of a linearized model of the current collection process?and clearly show the Grid-Sphere to be feasible and to collect current with virtually the same efficiency as a solid-surface spherical electrode of the same radius.,"The Grid-Sphere electrode will be an attractive addition to space tether technology because it will allow the collection of arbitrarily large currents with arbitrarily short tether systems while maintaining very low dynamic drag.  These characteristics will be enabling to applications such as the Tether Reboost System that has been proposed as a alternative means of reboosting and maintaining the orbit of the International Space Station?where the micro-gravity environment must be maintained, thereby prohibiting long tethers.  It will also be a valuable asset for the MXER Tether Launch System concept being proposed as a low-cost alternative to second-stage boosters for missions requiring launch into deep space.  In this case, high-power electrodynamic reboost of the MXER system will be essential to achieve efficiencies competitive with alternative launch technologies.","The Grid-Sphere Electrode relies on deploying a very large-scale spherical body of 10 to 20 meters or more in radius.  Dynamic drag is minimizing by using a grid construction so that orbital lifetime may be very long?even in LEO.  The Grid-Sphere can, therefore, be used as a very large RF antenna that could remain in LEO for long periods of time.  Grids can be upwards of 90-percent transparent, in order to minimize drag, and still allow grid spacings ranging from sub-millimeter to several centimeters to be used.  Grid spacing can, therefore, be selected to match the frequency range of the RF band used.  Placing such an antenna in LEO would minimize the distance to mobile ground-based transmitters, thereby reducing transmitter power requirements and improving receiver sensitivity."

Rather than using traditional approaches based on failure events in static engineering designs, we will treat a system as a dynamic process that is continually adapting to achieve its ends and to react to changes in itself and its environment.  The original design must not only enforce appropriate constraints on behavior to ensure safe operation, but the system must continue to operate safely as changes occur.  The process leading up to an accident (loss event) can be described in terms of an adaptive feedback function that fails to maintain safety as performance changes over time to meet a complex set of goals and values.  Using this definition of risk management, we will extend our commercial system engineering tool set to include model-based simulation and analysis of risk throughout the system life cycle, including complex human decision-making, software errors, system accidents (versus component failure accidents), and organizational risk factors.",The results of this SBIR research will be potentially applicable to every NASA project where significant losses can result from the operation or lack of operation of the system.  It should be particularly important in systems with significant software and human automation interaction components and in large projects where management decisions about risk are critical and need to be supported.,"The results of this SBIR project will be applicable to risk management in any safety-critical system.

The core of our approach is a computational organizational model of the network of interrelationships among people, knowledge, tasks, technology, organizational goals, system failures, and the surrounding environment. In Phase I we defined a simulation and optimization model of organizational safety and illustrated the use of NORM as applied to Team X, a concurrent engineering design team specializing in unmanned space missions. In Phase II we will develop the NORM modeling software, develop a customized Team X application, and perform a comparative analysis of Team X using NORM and several additional computational modeling tools.","Formal modeling of organizational risk management is critical to a variety of NASA applications, including launch operations, the Mission to Mars, and the International Space Station (ISS). Failures such as the Challenger launch and the Mars rover illustrate the need for tools to design organizations that minimize rather than induce errors, and to identify latent errors introduced during design and construction before they manifest themselves as operational failures providing little opportunity for recovery. The challenges of constructing, maintaining, and continually expanding the ISS demand cost-effective methods for predicting the impact of new technologies on system safety prior to installation.","The capabilities of NORM are most likely to appeal to customers who have the need to analyze and improve organizational safety or design organizations for safe operations. Examples of potential applications include air traffic control, supervisory control systems, command and control systems, ground and maritime transportation, hospital administration, construction, and manufacturing. In addition, management consulting firms provide a potential market for software licensing and consulting services. Business analysts that advise corporate management on safety issues require a deep understanding of the risks present in the organization, but are typically unacquainted with scientific methods for rigorously modeling and analyzing organizational risks."

Making the BLISS method useful in industrial practice requires software that creates an environment where engineers and managers can freely interact and optimize performance and cost. Phoenix proposes innovative software to bring BLISS to industry by using Web-based integration of users in a Multidisciplinary environment combined with the automation of computer assets. The automation will provide seamless parallel computing in a distributed manner prescribed by the BLISS methodology.  In the Phase I research we defined the key system requirements, performed a design optimization test case to confirm these requirements, and completed a preliminary design for the Phase II system development.  Phase II development will include eight technical tasks covering a twenty-one month time frame. The program has been structured so that the development efforts will result in a working system after the first year with the balance of required features being incorporated during the remaining nine months","The proposed software will help NASA streamline program management by combining collaborative project tools with system design and analysis. Phoenix software will help integrate program management with engineering to give a total picture for optimizing the mix of performance against cost and risk. NASA will realize a significant reduction in workflow problems due to non-concurrent data and information that is not synchronized with program schedules and goals. Furthermore, the proposed innovation will allow NASA program managers to view complex system interactions. For NASA it will enhance the Advanced Engineering Environment (AEE) and find immediate application on current projects such as Next Generation Launch Technology, Orbital Space Plane, Engineering for Complex Systems, and Aeronautics.","The software can be applied to a wide spectrum of defense, electronic, and automotive industries.

To develop design tools, accurate measurement of void fraction is critical to (1) identify the flow regimes, and (2) quantify the liquid holdup. Opaque reactor beds and conductive working liquids render various traditional void fraction measurements impractical. Advantages of impedance-based measurements include:  excellent sensitivity to void fraction, non-intrusive installation, and high rates of data sampling. In Phase I we demonstrated that our approach can meet the need with a prototypical packed-bed geometry and a conductive liquid. Our results prove a sensor configuration, demonstrate a signal-conditioning approach, and show that electrical impedance measurements in a packed-bed configuration can be correlated readily to void fraction for both steady-state and transient two-phase flows.  During Phase II we will develop purpose-built electronics, adapt the sensor mechanical design to the configuration of packed-bed facilities, and demonstrate a prototype with packed-bed facilities like those used in NASA research projects.","Long-duration, crewed space activities depend upon the development of packed-bed reactors for regenerative life support systems for extraction, absorption, humidification, leaching, etc. Development of design tools for microgravity packed-bed reactors depends upon knowledge of the void fraction. No simple, non-intrusive, fast-response instrument exists to measure void fraction in packed-beds. We can deliver an instrument to measure temporal and spatial variations of void fraction applicable to NASA research, including current microgravity aircraft and planned International Space Station experiments.

While the problem of solid waste resource recovery has been studied for many years, there is currently no satisfactory waste disposal/recycling technology. The simple catalytic incinerator in the current study can be replaced with a solid oxide fuel cell for power generation. The char produced in the first stage can be stored as a future source of carbon dioxide or converted to activated carbon which has multiple uses on board a spacecraft (flue gas clean-up, air revitalization, water purification, methane activation, hydrogen storage, radiation protection, medicinal purposes). This system will be useful to NASA in at least three respects: 1) it can be used as the primary solid waste disposal unit; 2) it can be used as a net generator of electrical power; 3) it can be used to produce activated carbon from solid waste.","The primary purpose of this effort will be to develop a piece of hardware for NASA which can become an important component of a Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS). However, there are also important potential benefits to society in terms of significantly increasing the capabilities for distributed power production from biomass and other solid waste. This will contribute to improved energy security, environmental quality and balance of payments. In the near term, the technology will have commercial applications to solid waste resource recovery problems in remote areas such as underdeveloped countries, arctic regions, oil production platforms, cruise ships, rural areas, farms, etc. In the long term, the technology can be integrated with fuel cells and have widespread business or residential use for solid waste removal and combined heat and power generation."

During the Phase I program, Luna developed a novel affinity microcantilever-based biosensor that was capable of directly monitoring water supplies for bacterial contamination during space flights. The biosensor is based upon the principle that as organisms bind to an affinity coated microcantilever beam, the chemomechanical forces induce a deflection in proportion to concentration of bound target.  Using gold-based coupling methods, anti-E coli antibodies were attached to the microcantilever beams and tested with varying concentrations of E. coli. Luna?s patented EFPI technology was then used to monitor the cantilever deflection with subnanometer sensitivity.  Binding of E. coli was successfully demonstrated at concentrations of 105 CFU/ml which induced significant signal responses.  During the Phase II, sensitivity will be increased using the new USB FiberPro II system and through optimization of affinity coatings and signal enhancement reagents.  The affinity microcantilever will be adapted for multiplexing using micromachined arrays and integrated with microfluidics for stable reagent handling.  The affinity microcantilevers will not only be useful for space-based applications, but will be adaptable for use in water quality and environmental monitoring, food safety, process monitoring, and medical diagnostics.","The proposed Phase II work will result in the development of a novel, compact, low-power rapid biosensor platform with which microbial contamination of stored water supplies may be monitored on the Space Station and during prolonged space flights. The sensor suite also will be able to screen for surface contamination and monitor water recycling efficiencies.  Through support electronics and spectral sharing, Luna will exploit the fiber optic sensors to provide a sensor suite capable of measuring a broad range of biochemical and physical parameters.","The key advantages of the affinity microcantilever sensor include; i) field-use operation with no critical alignment issues, ii) cost-effective multiplexing techniques already developed for communications applications, iii) real-time, absolute, spectrally encoded information that, unlike fluorescent systems is not affected by non-specific background interference and detection without labeling.   Consequently, the affinity microcantilever sensor platform also will allow Luna to produce a wide range of products with immediate near-term and long-term market impact for applications in, i) water quality and environ-mental monitoring, ii) food safety, iii) process monitoring, and iv) medical diagnostics."

The system will recover water initially contained within wastes and stabilize the residue with respect to microbial growth. Dry waste may then be safely stored or passed to the next waste treatment process. Using microwave power, water present in the solid waste is selectively and rapidly heated. Liquid phase water flashes to steam and superheats. Hot water and steam formed in the interior of waste particles create an environment that is lethal to bacteria, yeasts, molds, and viruses.  Superheated steam contacts all exposed surfaces and provides an effective thermal kill of microbes, in a manner similar to that of an autoclave.  Both water and heat are recovered in a condensing heat exchanger, with further water reclaimed from saturated air by adsorption, using microwave regenerable sorbents. Benefits of microwave power include rapid heat-up and cool-down, and selective heating of water by the direct absorption of electromagnetic radiation, thus minimizing conductive and convective losses. This translates directly into reduced size and power requirements, and lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM).","The primary governmental application for the proposed innovation will be as Flight Hardware purchased by NASA, or by an aerospace contracting firm on behalf of NASA, to provide solid waste stabilization and resource recovery, thereby minimizing resupply requirements for future advanced life support (ALS) systems needed for long duration manned missions in space, such as a Lunar base, or a manned mission to Mars.","Within the private sector, the primary commercialization opportunities are in the areas of biohazard containment and elimination. The proposed technology offers many attractive features which can be utilized for the safe mass reduction and stabilization by disinfection and dehydration of solid hazardous wastes, particularly infectious wastes or wastes containing genetically engineered microorganisms. Two private sector opportunities are immediately apparent: [1] hardware for the stabilization and disinfection of medical wastes generated in physicians offices, clinical laboratories, hospitals, etc., and [2] hardware for the destruction of biohazardous materials generated during biological, pharmaceutical, and biomedical research."

Mesoporous materials consist of highly ordered three-dimensional structures with precisely controlled pore size distributions, relatively high surface areas, and surface affinities which promote the adsorption of aqueous organic contaminants. When used as a catalyst support, these features offer an effective means to overcome the primary factors which limit the performance of conventional catalysts.  These innovative catalysts will facilitate the development of more effective methods for the destruction of organic contaminants in wastewaters generated aboard spacecraft, Lunar and planetary habitations. When fully developed, ambient temperature catalysts can be employed in the volatile removal assembly (VRA) or other similar aqueous phase catalytic oxidation reactors to both increase the degree of mineralization of organic contaminants and to drastically reduce the required operating temperature and pressure.  These improved performance characteristics directly translate into reduced size, weight, and power consumption, and therefore will result in substantially lower Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for catalytic reactors which employ these innovative highly active ambient temperature catalysts. Feasibility of the proposed innovation was conclusively demonstrated during the Phase I project in which ambient temperature reaction rates were improved by a factor of 50 times.","The advanced low temperature oxidation catalyst has the potential for immediate use by NASA aboard the International Space Station soon after completion of the Phase II effort.  The proposed technology offers the following advantages: 1) ambient temperature (or low temperature) operation will provide savings in energy, simplification in design, and improved safety, 2) lower pressure operation reduces material requirements and enhances safety, 3) higher catalytic activity offers more complete oxidation, thereby increasing reactor efficiency, reducing expendables and extending the useful lifetime of post- treatment IX beds.All of these advantages translate into cost savings.","Private sector applications for the advanced low temperature oxidation catalyst have been identified as: 1) industrial & municipal pollution control and environmental remediation, and 2) ultrapure water production for the manufacture of integrated circuits and pharmaceuticals.  The primary competitors to the innovative technology are alternative methods for the removal of organic contaminants from aqueous and gas phase process streams.  These include sorption using media such as activated carbon and oxidative techniques such as photocatalytic oxidation, ozonation, Fenton?s type peroxidation, and combinations of ozonation and peroxidation.  The low temperature aqueous phase catalytic oxidation process offers improved efficiency, safety and reduced cost over these competing alternatives.  The oxidation process has also proven capable of producing a virtually sterile effluent."

Long duration spaceflight requires a near real-time of monitoring bone loss during flight to alert astronauts to the potentially debilitating problems and direct the use of countermeasures.  Present technology requires post-flight measurement of urinary calcium on stored urine samples.  The Creare Urine Analysis System (UAS) provides a unique solution to this problem by enabling spectrophotometry (a proven technique in clinical chemistry) to provide real time measurements of urinary calcium loss to serve as a marker of bone loss and risk of kidney stone formation. The Creare UAS can be fully integrated into the International Space Station Urine Monitoring System to provide astronauts with running totals of total urinary calcium loss during the past day, week, and entire mission.  The real-time nature of the system will provide a non-invasive biosensor capable of early detection of excessive calcium loss, identification of crew members with elevated risk for kidney stone formation, and effective application of in-flight countermeasures.","The Urine Analysis System will permit, for the first time, real-time monitoring of urinary calcium during spaceflight. The data provided by our system will allow astronauts to evaluate the extent of their bone loss during extended periods in microgravity, determine when more aggressive countermeasures are needed to prevent or limit bone loss, monitor the effectiveness of bone loss countermeasures, and assess risk of renal stone formation.  Data collected by the system will provide a valuable database for guiding continued research in bone loss prevention.","The technology developed under this program has direct application to clinical monitoring of the ten million Americans suffering from osteoporosis each year.  Present clinical monitoring techniques must be performed in the physician?s office or require expensive test kits.  The technology being developed under this program has the potential to permit cost-effective, continual home monitoring.  Low-cost, unobtrusive home monitoring of calcium loss could be extremely beneficial for many patients including those at greatest risk for rapid disease progression and those just starting therapy.

On long-term space missions, on board the International Space Station, or on future lunar or planetary facilities, a biodegradable food packaging plastic could be disposed of in hydroponic environments that support agricultural production.  Several biodegradable polymers are commercially available, but they lack the barrier properties needed for food preservation.  TDA proposes to improve the barrier properties of biodegradable plastics by forming a multi-layered laminate film containing biodegradable polymers modified with our proprietary nanocomposites.  Much of TDA?s nanocomposite research has focused on the careful design of surface treatments to produce nanocomposites compatible with and dispersible in targeted host polymers.  In Phase I, we demonstrated that we could improve the barrier properties of several individual films of biodegradable polymers.  In Phase II we will meet high barrier packaging requirements by combining layers of biodegradable nanocomposites to achieve protection against both oxygen and water vapor permeation.  We have shown that we can form well-dispersed nanocomposites with several biodegradable plastics and, in one example, have demonstrated improved barrier properties without a loss in biodegradation rates.","The high barrier multi-layer laminate films developed in this project could be used in extended duration space missions that would require a significant amount of packaged, shelf-stable food.  A high barrier packaging material that was biodegradable would be a critical part of the Advanced Life Support system and would decrease the amount of food package waste that would be stored on board until re-entry or incineration is possible.  Biodegradable food packaging materials could be recycled in-flight in hydroponic baths as a supplement for crops grown inside the spacecraft.","As a bio-based polymer, PLA can be produced domestically at low cost, eliminating dependence on foreign petroleum supplies with their corresponding demand and price fluctuations.  PLA is also biodegradable - an additional important feature that realistically addresses the problems of plastic waste generation. Successful development of high barrier PLA would find application in a variety of areas including consumer packaging applications, packaging for food and food service applications, and medical packaging.   PLA nanocomposites also have the potential to replace several commodity thermoplastics like polyolefins and PVC in certain applications."

It represents decades of development and is the standard tool for experimental particle physics simulations.  In another SBIR Phase I project AES had already established its level of suitability for the simulation of space radiation shielding to protect astronauts. Geant4, however, represents geometry in its own format which is not immediately compatible with standard CAD programs which generally lack critical information for radiation simulation such as composition of materials.

This could prove invaluable in attempts to better understand equipment and mission failures, optimize maintenance and repair schedules, and generally improve reliability.","For NASA the primary interest is in the augmentation of CAD (STEP) format data with information which allows radiation effects simulations with Geant4 to be carried out. That said, the results of our Phase I research have made it clear that the needed flexibility and extendability is also ideally suited to allow arbitrary augmentations of CAD data.  Recent events  have underlined to us, the potential value of a fully extensible data description. For example, in the case of failure (either catastrophic, or simple wear and tear leading to replacements) there would be clear value in having the geometrical description of the constructed object contain information on the components which might not seem of immediate interest to a physicist or engineer.","Within the particular scope of making it easier to handle radiation simulations, we expect to find major applications in fields in which shielding and dosimetry are important such as commercial space applications, reactor design, medical radiology, etc. The general ability to augment CAD-produced data, and in fact the general proposed XML framework for a fully extensible format is potentially applicable to any CAD user, as well as to anyone wanting to manage almost any conceivable process or engineered device."

This program develops a fully integrated, digital camera chip, which is an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that counts individual optical photons using avalanche photodiodes operated above breakdown, in Geiger mode.  This all-digital, CMOS imaging technology fulfills the demanding requirements for providing high-resolution images at ~GHz speeds characteristic of CMOS devices.  In Phase I, we successfully completed all the Phase I goals by designing, fabricating, and characterizing the Geiger APD pixel elements of the APS camera ASIC. In Phase II, we will design, fabricate and characterize prototypes of the complete APS camera ASIC.","The advantages of this technology applies to many imaging applications, including the following (NASA missions):  Airborne, spaceborne or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms for imaging and measuring climate, meteorological parameters, aerosols, clouds, water vapor and other chemical atmospheric constituents, vegetation index, biological productivity, chlorophyll fluorescence, 2D and 3D surface terrain mapping, and ocean color.  Our detector provides tracking and collision avoidance capabilities for rovers and other robotic exploration vehicles, in addition to providing ranging capabilities using LADAR and LIDAR.  In spectroscopy applications, such as LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy), and satellite communications, the proposed technology represents an ideal detector technology.","Non-NASA applications include low-light-level imaging, photography, diffuse optical tomography, nuclear imaging, x-ray imaging, (nuclear medicine).  The proposed ASIC camera would find widespread use in instrumentation where compact, high-speed, hi-resolution imaging detectors are used.  High-performance imaging detectors currently have a large commercial market, and as such, the proposed development holds a very high potential for commercialization."

We then assembled and tested a PCI breadboard and demonstrated its tunability over a 1 nm spectral range with a bandpass close to 0.02 nm and an acceptance angle close to 1o. The acquired data demonstrated conclusively that an approach based on the PCI concept provides an optimal solution for designing and constructing an ultra-narrow tunable optical bandpass filter.

With the addition of a fiber amplifier this laser would eventually be capable of generating pulses on the order of tens of milli-joules, an amount suitable for space-based lidar systems. The laser output could be doubled into the near-IR range, tripled into the visible range, and quadrupled into the UV range of 382 to 394 nm. We propose to combine the dual wavelength fiber laser developed by Jin U. Kang of Johns Hopkins University and fiber amplifier techniques developed at Sigma. These lasers would provide a breakthrough for ground based, airborne and space based lidars due to their combination of eye safe wavelengths, high power, tunability, and capability for dual wavelength operation. Their inherent solid state structure and lack of external components make them ideal for space applications.","A high repetition rate, tunable, dual wavelength, high power fiber laser operating at eye safe wavelengths would be a breakthrough source for wind, water vapor, aerosol lidar, and altimetry systems. There is great need for lidar measurements of wind profiles as well as atmospheric constituents which this laser would enable, the last one particularly through its dual wavelength capability. Furthermore, a large fraction of the visible and soft UV spectral region could be covered by conversion, producing a tool for laboratory and field research not currently available. Its all fiber construction makes it a rugged compact, alignment insensitive system, ideally suited for space applications. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate power scalability to obtain the per-pulse energies necessary for space based systems. If successful, this technology would provide a good alternative to Nd:YAG lasers for similar missions to GLAS, MLA and VCL in the future, and become a true enabler for missions with more stringent requirements.","A high repetition rate, tunable, high power fiber laser would mean a break through in commercial laser technology.

In the scientific lidar sector, this laser could be implemented in various types of lidar/altimeter systems used in global studies and weather modeling. In R&D labs in academia or industry this laser would be an excellent source at wavelengths where other sources are cumbersome (OPOs), and would offer greater flexibility. In the commercial sector this laser can be implemented in airport-based instruments (i.e. ceilometers, windshear detection) and urban pollution monitoring systems where reliability, ease of maintenance and eye-safety are paramount.

The proposed DIAL transmitter would enable high-resolution, high-accuracy remote sensing of atmospheric molecular species of interest to NASA including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide as well as many others. The proposed project would yield a deliverable laboratory-level system comprised of a diode-laser-pumped, Q-switched, 2-micron laser, which pumps a middle-wave-infrared (MWIR) optical parametric oscillator (OPO), that is injection-seeded with a quantum cascade laser (QCL) to provide a narrow linewidth. The primary innovation is the use of recently developed distributed feedback (DFB) QCLs to injection-seed a MWIR OPO for the purpose of obtaining narrow linewidth, high-pulse-energy operation in a compact, simple configuration. A secondary innovation is the specific selection of other critical system components that make the overall system suitable for airborne and space-based instrumentation. These include the all-solid-state 2-micron pump laser and the MWIR OPO, which can be constructed with either zinc germanium phosphide (ZGP) or cadmium selenide (CdSe) depending on the wavelength coverage desired.","NASA applications of the technology are related to the Earth Science Enterprise, specifically for aircraft- or space-based measurements of the profile of atmospheric gases that will allow better understanding of global climate changes and the human impact on the atmosphere. The species include common greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as a wide variety of gases that play a role in atmospheric chemistry. Of these gases, the majority exhibit infrared absorption connected with the vibration-rotation features of the gas molecule, and this can be sensed using DIAL techniques. The narrow-linewidth, seeded OPO design proposed here can produce wavelengths in the two atmospheric windows (3-5 and 8-12 ?Ym) available for sensing, and thus can be used in a number of NASA remote-sensing systems operating from both aircraft and space-based platforms. Since the OPO technology is driven by a 2-?Ym Ho:YLF laser, it leverages the high-energy laser technology developed at NASA Langley for wind-sensing into a wide range of species-sensing applications.  An additional application of the technology would be in coherent wind-sensing systems based on Ho:YLF lasers, also part of the Earth Science Enterprise. The proposed work will advance the technology of high-energy, resonantly pumped Ho:YLF lasers, and data developed in the effort will be of significance to the existing NASA Langley-centered program in that area.","A commercial product applications include: 1. Fence-line monitors at industrial sites, needed to meet Clean Air Act requirements. Problems have been encountered with FTIR systems now used such as lack of sensitivity to meet regulations for many gases and interference from water vapor, which is difficult to correct due to the limited resolution of the FTIR. A broadly tunable, narrow-linewidth IR source based on an OPO /multi-QCL combination could be an alternative to the FTIR system, and solve the operational difficulties now encountered.  2. Systems for determination of air pollution in urban and industrial areas from automobiles and industrial processes, including both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases. 3. Systems for homeland security, such as continuous monitoring of urban air or entry points for the presence of chemical agents and explosive devices. 4. Systems for military applications, including long-range detection of chemical agents. Another example is chemical detection systems flown on UAVs. These systems would have strategic application in determining whether a country is developing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. Tactical applications include monitoring of battlefield conditions and wide-area monitoring of fixed assets such as military bases against chemical-warfare attacks. 5.

The resultant reduction in the number of diodes and the size of the beam-handling optics leads to a lower-cost, lighter weight system, advantages for both the satellite- and aircraft-based systems. Our approach will enable a new generation of lower-risk, lower-cost science missions, requiring lower power and weight resources. This technology will lead to high performance DIAL systems deployable on small aircraft, UAVs and satellites. This flexibility in choice of platform will greatly enhance the capability of NASA to achieve the science goals of ESE.","The work proposed here has direct application to the development of aircraft and satellite-based ozone DIAL systems, as described in detail earlier in this proposal. The pump source would drive a nonlinear conversion system to generate UV wavelengths suited for ozone sensing from different platforms. Other NASA applications for the pump source would be in precision altimetry for earth and other planetary investigations. The source, combined with other nonlinear optics, could also serve as the DIAL transmitter for probing of other species than ozone. In particular, combined with optical parametric oscillators, the source we develop could provide broadly tunable infrared for sensing of a wide variety of molecular species.","The proposed high-energy MPS technology would be an extension of our existing diode-pumped product line and would offer a step-up in power and energy from our existing products, into the 100-W range now served by more conventional lamp-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. A MPS Nd:YLF laser with 100 mJ/pulse fundamental energy, 1-kHz rate and high beam quality, with the addition of harmonic generation for some systems, could provide a relatively low-cost solution for precision machining applications such as marking, cutting, welding and drilling, of interest to the electronics, automotive and medical-device industry.

The proposed multi-laser Off-Axis ICOS instrument will measure all three of these species simultaneously while on board a NASA aircraft. In Phase I, we have demonstrated feasibility by building a laboratory prototype Off-Axis ICOS instrument and measuring CH4 in the near-infrared and CO in the mid-infrared. In Phase II, LGR will perform a series of scientific studies to characterize the selected absorption features, engineer a flight-ready, multiple-species analyzer, and test the analyzer aboard an aircraft before delivering the final system to NASA.","CH4, CO, and N2O are critical atmospheric species that have been implicated in the greenhouse effect, stratospheric ozone depletion, and pollution transport.  Due to the importance of these species, NASA has developed a wide array of instruments to measure these gases including ALIAS, ARGUS, ATLAS and DACOM.  These instruments have provided precise concentration measurements but have been limited in their utility by their sensitivity to alignment and lack of robustness.In this SBIR effort, we propose to circumvent these limitations by combining our novel Off-Axis ICOS technique with continuous-wave quantum cascade (QC) and DFB diode lasers.  Off-Axis ICOS surpasses the traditional multi-pass methods currently employed by NASA because it provides a longer sample pathlength and is far less sensitive to alignment.  Moreover, QC lasers are poised to replace Pb-salt lasers in many future applications due to the imminent possibility of room-temperature operation.","Beyond NASA, the proposed multiplexed, ultrasensitive gas analyzer has several commercial applications.  These applications include industrial process control, emissions monitoring, and the scientific instrumentation market.  During the Phase I research effort considerable progress has been made in developing an industrial process control monitor in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company.

For Phase II, MicroET is teaming with the University of Washington and Technology Assessment and Transfer (TA&T) to develop and demonstrate a breadboard prototype during the first year followed by a brassboard prototype made of a ceramic monolith structure during year 2 of the project.   Our team brings to the table expertise in system engineering and development, fluid dynamics and heat transfer, and ceramic microfabrication.  As described in the commercialization section of this proposal we have developed necessary partnerships and intellectual property to successfully manufacture and commercialize our electronics cooling products during phase III.","MicroET?s mission is to develop an autonomous, highly efficient, hermetically sealed cooling module.  Our longer term goal is the development of thermally-actuated autonomous cooling modules that eliminate the use of external power to drive the liquid in the loop.  As part of this mission, we are being funded from various sources to develop various components of our technology.  However, our product during the NASA SBIR Phase II project will be two different prototypes targeted to meet specific needs within NASA.  We expect that our product will have its highest impact in the following NASA programs: FPGA chip, micro/nano spacecraft, high density avionics, expandable and planar lidar/radar arrays, and miniature fuel cells.","The proliferation of consumer microelectronics and the relentless progression of Moore?s Law offer numerous market opportunities for advanced thermal management systems. The waste heat fluxes from consumer-grade microprocessors are approaching 100 W/cm^2 and this trend shows no sign of slowing down. A mass-produced version of the MicroET cooling module could be cost-competitive with today?s most advanced cooling solutions, but would exhibit significantly better performance than the current state-of-the-art. There are extensive application opportunities in personal computers, network servers, supercomputers, embedded computing devices, and a wide range of telecommunications equipment. Wide band gap semiconductors have been the subject of a great deal of research and development work in recent years. The Department of Defense has a number of ongoing programs to use these semiconductors in phase array radar and similar high-energy applications. While wide band gap materials have some distinct advantage, they also generate large quantities of waste heat, with fluxes approaching 1000 W/cm^2. A high-performance distributed cooling system is imperative for the operation of such systems.  High power lasers are in use in numerous military, scientific, and industrial applications ? some with extremely large waste heat fluxes (1000 W/cm^2 and greater). As with wide band gap semiconductors, a high-performance thermal management system is absolutely necessary."

It should be understood, however, that these objectives are not automatically met. The operational costs of monitoring and commanding a large fleet of close-orbiting satellites is likely to be unreasonable unless the onboard software is sufficiently autonomous, robust, and reconfigurable. A decentralized, agent-based guidance and control system has been designed in Phase I to help meet these challenging software requirements.  The proposed concept is a decentralized guidance and control system, organized in a multiple-team framework, and implemented within the Princeton Satellite Systems? (PSS) ObjectAgent? architecture. In the ObjectAgent architecture, Agents may be remotely added, removed or replaced post-launch to increase mission flexibility and robustness. This level of reconfigurability exceeds the state-of-the-art in traditional flight software.

The purpose of SIRA is to obtain high-resolution measurements of transient phenomena in the solar corona. The proposed mission involves 16 close-orbiting spacecraft, placed either in an Earth-centered DRO or at a libration point. The formation control objective is to provide sustained formations in which the cluster fills the u-v plane perpendicular to the sun-line. Because this mission involves a large number of spacecraft, it seems an ideal candidate for the Decentralized Formation Flying system.","Any mission involving formation flying of cooperative spacecraft is a potential application for this product. While most of the planned formation flying missions known to the public today are research related, the Department of Defense has shown a continued effort to advance formation flying technologies.

Education ? Commercial data vendors ? Application Services (Precision Ag, facility management, forestry)   Commercial data vendors will be able to provide per kilometer sales with no minimum order using automated sub-setting and customized data delivery systems. Custom derivative products will be created and delivered in real time with little or no additional overhead cost to the vendor.   This system will enable profitable application services to fully mature, Precision Ag in particular stands to advance substantially, where the time between data acquisition and delivery of custom derivative products is reduced or eliminated entirely. Forestry is another market where real-time availability of processed or value added imagery is of great importance. The need for producers to maintain additional high-tech staff to interpret or process data is reduced or eliminated entirely. No need to store large data files, or maintain on-site geo-spatial information. No need to wait 24 hours for data to post. Value added data can be processed inline and can be available immediately after the data are downloaded. High resolution aerial or satellite data vendors will be able to produce regional data sets and market to large groups rather than to large commercial farms alone. In addition to the commercial farms, Precision Ag will become viable for moderate sized farms as well."

The spaceport of the future may resemble, from an operational perspective, our current airports and seaports of today and will need to resolve many similar issues to these transportation hubs. These issues include (1) safe and secure spaceport operations, (2) efficient movement of machinery and people through the spaceport, and (3) cost-efficient, affordable, and timely spaceport operations.  Discrete event simulation has been used to assess detailed processes at modern day seaports. Like seaports, spaceport operations are labor intensive and require extensive use of personnel and machinery. The ability to conduct seaport operations efficiently has been improved significantly through proper utilization of seaport assets. This foundation provides a solid footing from which research for efficient spaceport operations can be based. An object-oriented discrete event simulation system is proposed that will address spaceport operations in the context of aerospace safety, mobility, and efficiency. The simulation system will be built upon the Java programming language to provide for maximum portability and will utilize XML for standards-based data interchange. Development of the simulation model will provide the underlying basis for follow-on activities such as 2D and 3D animation and visualization capabilities. Technology transfer of lessons learned in the development of seaport simulation models will be utilized. The overall goal of the spaceport simulation model is to maximize throughput, operational safety, and resource utilization and minimize overall cost of operations.","The results of the Phase I and Phase II research activities will be a powerful, flexible, object-oriented discrete event simulation system for spaceport operations.

As the spaceport industry is commercialized and our society accepts space transportation as a common mode of transportation, SPACESIM will be able to be used at spaceports worldwide to ensure that operations are conducted in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, the SPACESIM model has potential integration possibilities with other transportation simulations to provide macro level ?end-to-end? simulations of an entire transportation grid including all modes of transportation.

The closed-cycle cooling alternatives currently available for such applications are not well suited to their requirements. In many cases reliability is low and vibration high. In other cases coolers are too massive and inefficient. This proposal describes a two-stage pulse tube cooler (PTC) that combines a bootstrap staging configuration with an innovative second-stage regenerator design and a unique load-interface. The proposed cooler contains three innovative concepts that together will overcome the limitations of current cryocooler technologies: (1) the matrix for the second stage regenerator will be made from a newly-patented material having a heat capacity in excess of all other known materials, including lead (Pb), over a wide range of low temperatures (85K down to 15K), (2) the material for the second-stage regenerator will be formed into a novel matrix geometry, and (3) a unique load-interface will be an integral part of the cooler giving it the capability to cool distributed loads efficiently. The proposed pulse tube will be lightweight, efficient, reliable, vibration free, and easy to integrate into cryogenic dewars.","Missions to Mars that involve the in-situ manufacture of propellant which will require the capability to store seed hydrogen for long periods of time. To accomplish this, a small lightweight cryocooler mounted on the storage vessel that is capable of sub-cooling the liquid, intercepting parasitic heat leaks, and re-liquefying hydrogen vapor will be required. The proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is ideally suited to such applications. For missions that will involve transportation or in-situ liquefaction of liquid cryogens such as hydrogen, neon, and oxygen, the proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is again ideally suited. The presence of two stages allows cooling at two temperatures. The proposed cooler is easily modified to liquefy both hydrogen and neon at the low temperaturestage, and oxygen, for example, at the higher temperature stage. To improve the ultimate signal to noise ratio obtainable from cryogenic IR focal plane arrays (FPA), it is desirable to have on-focal plane, high-resolution, analog-to-digital (A/D) data converters. Such A/D converters, based on the Josephson effect, together with supporting technology, are currently in various stages of development. The proposed two-stage pulse-tube cooler is ideally suited to these applications as well.","There are a number of commercial applications. A partial list includes: ?Superconducting electronics ?Superconducting magnets for MRI systems ?Superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage ?SQUID magnetometers for heart and brain studies ?HTS filters for the communication industry ?Liquefaction of industrial gases ?Cryopumps for semiconductor manufacturing ?Radio astronomy As an example, a market of about $100 million/year currently exists for G-M cooler-based cryopumps for sputtering systems used in the semiconductor industry. Sputtering systems normally have several cryopumps per unit with each cryopump costing $20-25,000. The more reliable PTC package will cost about the same as current G-M units and will be less expensive to maintain due to the lack of oil and rubbing surfaces."

The proposed pump system would mitigate NASA's concerns on reliability in this critical application by virtue of the seal arrangement tested in Phase 1 and the design of each pump to be able to meet the current fill rates in the event of one unit's failure. Phase I focussed on the reliability issues surrounding the primary sealing arrangement in the LOX pumps and demonstrated the feasibility of a non-contacting combination of a dynamic seal and a purged labyrinth seal set as a highly reliable sealing solution for the primary seal for Liquid Oxygen (LOX) transfer pumps. Additionally, Phase I efforts produced a unique concept for a new LOX pumping system for vehicle loading operations. In the proposed system, two pumps would work in parallel to provide an increase in LOX transfer rate of 50%. The scope of work in Phase 2 will include the design and manufacture of this complete pump system composed of 2 pumps, pump performance testing on water, and cryogenic testing at KSC's ATDC facility.","The proposed pumping system (incorporating the new seal arrangement) can be immediately applied to retrofit the existing Shuttle LOX loading pumps at KSC. The system was designed to have minimal impact to existing mechanical, piping, and electrical infrastructres used for vehicle loading. Furthermore, there are a great number of LOX transfer pumps currently employed at Stennis Space Center which could be replaced by this more reliable pump. With some modifications, the pump concept could also be used by NASA for the transfer of Liquid Hydrogen or other propellants.","The technology developed in the Phase 2 effort can be applied to any low viscosity, hazardous fluid pumping application. Potential markets include chemical and petrochemical industry where nearly all pumped fluids meet these criteria. Another large market for this pump technology would be in LNG for transfer and ship offloading. By not being submersible, a large pump would be more efficient and cost less for installation and maintenance. This large pump would offer an attractive alternative to submersible pumps and would be cost-competitive in this growing market. A smaller market which perhaps should be counted in long-term plans is that of commercial space vehicles. As more private firms achieve greater success, this pump could be marketed for the support and launch facilities of private space industry."

As a result of these operations, helium contaminated with hydrogen, nitrogen, and small amounts of air is vented to the atmosphere where it is not recoverable in a practical or economic manner.  The system proposed will recover helium and could be designed to also recover hydrogen from these waste gas streams and purify it to a level where it can be recycled for usage.  Cryogenic processes as well as other gas separation techniques will be incorporated into a complete integrated system to accomplish this gas recovery.  The Phase II system will be a practical system for helium recovery in both commercial and NASA related programs where helium is routinely used and vented in significant quantities.  The Phase II unit could be made to handle the full scale helium separation for recovery for some specific helium use applications at NASA/KSC.","Since almost all of NASA's launch and other propellant related test operations use helium and hydrogen, this system would be capable of recovering these valuable gases to the point that they could be separated and recycled for the next operation.  Since some propellant densification operations will exhaust waste streams comprised of helium and hydrogen, this gas separation system would be a major economic benefit in these operations.  The use of this gas recovery system operating in conjunction with the NASA's gas usage operations could result in substantial cost savings that is realized over a relatively short period of time.",Companies that develop and test hydrogen fueled rocket engines at large testing complexes have large quantities of cryogenic storage and other volumes that require helium as a purge gas or pressurizing gas for the high pressure liquid hydrogen propellant supply vessels.  The helium gas used in these applications becomes mixed with hydrogen and possibly other gases and is typically expelled as waste gas to atmosphere after use.  The proposed system would be capable of separating the helium or hydrogen from waste gas streams instead of venting these two gases to atmosphere.  Substantial cost saving could be realized by recycling these expensive gases in the test facility instead of buying additional helium.

The new technology, which employs a lightweight microsphere-based insulating medium, provides for robust, low-maintenance storage and distribution systems. Well suited for the on/off operation that is typical for space launch operations, microsphere insulation minimizes losses in stored propellants at spaceports and for commercial liquefied gases. Microsphere insulation?s inherent properties of high crush strength and ability to flow combine to form a tough, resilient insulation system that withstands exposure to harsh launch/landing environments and ambient /vacuum pressure cycles. Based on extensive thermal testing, including recent measurements made at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory, microspheres perform 1.5 to 3.3 times better than perlite and limit heat leak to less than most insulation materials, particularly multilayer insulation (MLI), in a soft or lost vacuum condition. At 10-1 torr vacuum, microspheres outperform MLI by a factor of two. This means significantly reduced lifecycle costs from maintenance, lost cryogen, and reinsulation. Microsphere-insulated transfer line and storage tank prototypes will be extensively tested to optimize performance, address microsphere handling and containment methods, and validate long-term performance benefits.","NASA/KSC needs new insulation technology for future spaceports that require thermally efficient energy-integrated launch pads. Low-cost, durable, high-efficiency transfer lines will be needed for long-distance cryogen transport. Improvements are needed for existing LC-39 cryogenic loading systems. NASA/SSC is the lead center for rocket propulsion. Many NASA/SSC storage vessels are plagued by perlite compaction problems or poor vacuum retention from adsorbed moisture. Vacuum-jacketing does not exist on many transfer and vent lines, which present safety hazards, including formation of enriched oxygen, and substantial economic losses from steady-state heat loads and cool-down losses.","Primary commercial applications include transfer lines and storage vessels for the medical, liquefied natural gas, industrial gas air separation, superconductor, semi-conductor, food-freezing, and aircraft industries. Industrial cryogenic tank fabricators have expressed strong interest in microspheres as a higher performance substitute for perlite insulation that precludes the inevitable compaction problems and also recognize potential for microsphere-insulated vacuum-jacketed transfer lines. The domestic industrial cryogenic storage and transfer line markets are over $100M per year, with the global market about three times greater.

An advanced radiator must provide high thermal performance with minimum mass while satisfying launch and deployment considerations. Traditional metal based radiators and single phase pumped heat transport loops are inadequate for the emerging demands; metal based high temperature radiators usually are over 8 ~ 10kg/m2.  C-C composite materials are ideal candidates to solve this challenge because of their series of advantages, such as very low density, high thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties, high flexibility and variability in thermal and structural properties by tailoring their composite constituents.  In combination with heat pipes, two-phase Capillary Pumped Loops (CPL) and Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) or other two-phase heat transport loops, overall thermal performance and reliability of the space radiators can be significantly improved and realized by reducing radiator mass, which is a big portion of overall spacecraft mass.","Power systems currently under development for deep space exploration are a prime example of an application that would benefit significantly by this research and development.

Liquid monopropellants are often used in propulsion systems where simplicity of design, restartable/control on demand, and repeatability is desired.  Unfortunately, many monopropellants are toxic and dangerous, ruling them out for EMU thruster application. Thus, EMU thrusters have relied upon cold gaseous nitrogen, which offers very low specific impulse and propellant mass fraction. A NOPS, however, uses nitrous oxide, a readily available safe and storable propellant which is not toxic, has performance comparable to hydrazine, and does not decompose spontaneously like hydrogen peroxide.  Furthermore, Pioneer Astronautics has demonstrated a system that decomposes N2O into a breathable mix of oxygen and nitrogen.  Thus, for example, an EMU propelled by a NOPS system would provide an astronaut with a large emergency backup supply of oxygen.  Such a dual use system could also have great utility as the propulsion system for manned spacecraft, such as the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle, where safety is paramount and breathing gas reserves are desired.  Replacing current liquid monopropellant thrusters with NOPS units would greatly reduce ground processing time and costs, while providing comparable performance.","The NOPS propulsion system concept, due to its inherent safety, is an attractive propulsion system for a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) or SAFER system, as the N2O monopropellant greatly out performs cold N2 thrusters used on current MMUs in both specific impulse and propellant storability, because its 5 times as dense at ? the pressure as compressed N2. In addition, Pioneer Astronautics has also demonstrated that N2O can be decomposed into a breathable mixture of N2 and O2, offering the potential for a combined spacesuit breathing/MMU propulsion system, with greatly increased endurance and mobility compared to current systems. If manned spacecraft were to use a NOPS it would allow the propellant aboard the Space Station or interplanetary spacecraft to be used as a backup to the life support system. Transporting air reserves to the Space Station as N2O would significantly reduce logistics costs by drastically cutting transport tankage mass.","The Nitrous Oxide Propulsion System has the potential of promoting use of liquid monopropellant rockets. Currently, the difficulty and cost in safely handling and storing conventional liquid monopropellants has hindered their use. The NOPS would not have these limitations. Hydrazine is commonly used as a monopropellant in attitude control thrusters in spacecraft. Unfortunately, hydrazine is extremely toxic. NOPSs, however, use a benign monopropellant, and so much less care and expense is necessary. NOPSs would be much more profitable and attractive to use than current common monopropellant rockets systems, and should be able to dominate the market for liquid monopropellant propulsion systems, such as are used in attitude control of spacecraft. Currently, some 1000 satellites are planned for launch in the next 10 years, and all will need attitude control systems. These satellites and their necessary replacements thus guarantee the NOPS a large and highly lucrative commercial market. NOPS is also promising for upper stage tank settling during long LEO-GEO coast, as it eliminates hydrazine handling from launch operations."

To enable missions that are envisioned for the future, advances in the human/robotic interface are required. This proposal provides a new telepresence interface, based on an ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) HMD. This fully immersive HMD has a FOV which nearly matches the unobstructed human visual field, and maintains high resolution throughout. By combining this immersive display with a custom camera system and appropriate software, a telepresence system capable of high-fidelity depth perception, FOV and resolution is possible. This tool would be a significant benefit to human operators of robotic systems. In Phase 1 we designed a tiled, wide FOV camera array and appropriate 3D software to interface between this array and the HMD. The product of Phase 2 will be a complete working telepresence system with custom camera array and HMD. This system will be integrated into the NASA telerobotic system called Robonaut.  There are strong commercialization opportunities in the engineering services industry and various government agencies, as they are known users of telepresence systems for remote operation of robots and vehicles.","The proposed ultra-wide FOV telepresence system will enable a new level of operator control over robotic systems for payload manipulation, docking and similar tasks. The enhanced FOV and depth perception will also allow operators of exploration vehicles greater understanding of the remote terrain---leading to more efficient exploration and faster, safer navigation for the remote vehicle. Finally, playing back the immersive visual experience recorded on a distant planet for non-NASA personnel may provide a dramatic marketing tool for the agency.","The ultra-wide field of view of the proposed system will allow users a much greater sense of immersion in the displayed enviroment--be it virtual or remote. The new level of telepresence immersion will enable much more practical police, rescue and hazmat applications to emerge. It is also well known that the US military is increasing its reliance on remotely piloted vehicles and this system would work equally well in the battlefield environment. Entertainment applications will also emerge: for example, allowing individuals to ""step on the field"" during a professional sporting event via telepresence."

A second potential NASA application is in the monitoring and control of planetary exploration vehicles and associated research equipment. Finally, the sensors have application in the use in robotic manipulators aboard platforms placed in earth orbit. An example is use for control of mobile servicing systems such as employed on the international space station. Each of these applications is direct and can be implemented on existing or planned NASA programs.","Because of the ubiquitous application of robotic technology in industry, the products to be developed during this Phase II effort are expected to have a significant market. For example, the commercial manufacturing (e.g. automotive industry) makes extensive use of robotics in the production process. Both the direct force load cell and the torque sensor are anticipated to have significant market potential for measurement and control of robots used in the manufacturing process. Robotics also is anticipated to provide an increasing role in the processing of hazardous wastes. Use of robotics can safely permit collection and analysis of potentially hazardous materials.

Compared with conventional optical fiber based sensor systems, our technology offers substantially higher sensitivity.  We achieve this by combining the mature Bragg grating technology with the inherently high sensitivity of polymer waveguides to stress waves.  Using a hybrid silica/polymer Bragg grating multiplexing scheme, the sensor system is capable of simultaneously measuring temperature and strain/stress.  By integrating optical waveguide filters and couplers with the Bragg grating array sensor, the sensor system offers increased dynamic range for simultaneous detection of both the high and low energy AE signals arisen during impact or crack formation.  The Phase I research has demonstrated the feasibility of the integrated polymer waveguide and Bragg grating fabrication technology and the use of Bragg gratings for static and dynamic stress sensing.  In the Phase II research effort, the polymer waveguide and Bragg grating designs will be further optimized.  Hybrid polymer/silica Bragg grating array and an on-chip wavelength filter demodulation prototype system will be developed for temperature, stress/strain, and AE detection and location measurements.","In typical aerospace environments, both weak and strong AE signals are present. Crack formation and low-energy impact such as bird strike and tool-drop during maintenance typically generate weak AE signals.  High energy impact such as on-orbit collisions with micrometeoroids, ice, and space debris, often result in very large AE signals.  Both of these AE sources can lead to serious structural damages of aerospace structures.  Therefore, detecting and locating both high and low energy AE signal sources is essential for aerospace applications. The on-chip Bragg grating array sensor device LGR has demonstrated and proposed to further develop for Phase II will greatly enhance NASA efforts to develop state-of-the-art, compact, waveform-based, quantitative AE sensing technology for crack monitoring and impact detection facilitated by measuring and locating both high and low energy stress waves, from DC to MHz frequency range.","Advances in high-resolution, high sensitivity, and large dynamic range AE sensing technology has immediate applications in civil engineering for monitoring weak AE signals in steel and concrete structures such as bridges, freeways, and buildings.  High frequency ultrasonic signal detection  method development can be utilized in ultrasonic testing, medical ultrasonic imaging, and other non-destructive testing (NDT) technology.

FIR filters, for example, can be implemented much more efficiently in hardware.  This makes the RTP a perfect solution to the common problem of needing general purpose processing in conjunction with hardware-based algorithmic data flow.  This new approach is referred to as ?heterogeneous computing?.  Here, the most efficient tool for the job is used ... general purpose processing for control tasks, and reconfigurable hardware for high-data-rate algorithmic tasks.  The RTP will enable single-chip heterogeneous computing."

A MEMS Earth horizon sensor, when compared with current state-of-the-art Earth horizon sensors provides for three orders-of-magnitude reductions in size, reduced power consumption, lower cost, and increased functionality and flexibility.  In the Phase I program, the feasibility of key components of the proposed Earth horizon sensor, namely, the MEMS scanner and the beam focusing element were demonstrated separately.  In Phase II, SiWave has teamed up with a major satellite manufacturer to take the necessary steps to further develop, conduct ground evaluation, flight qualification and for possible space flight of the MEMS horizon sensor.","NASA applications include navigation for next generation nano/micro-spacecraft, Earth orbiting spacecraft, and planetary missions to Mars and other solar system planets. The reduction in size and mass will reduce the cost of the spacecraft as well as the launch costs.","The proposed device has commercial applications in telecommunications, broadcasting, surveillance, Earth science satellites, and high altitude aircraft and balloons.

Space Micro has developed innovations for mitigating SEU/SEFI, enabling the use of high-speed microprocessors (>1,500 MIPS) with improved SEU tolerances (>1E-5 errors/day).  Time-Triple Modular Redundancy (TTMR) applies traditional triple modular redundancy on a single microprocessor.  TTMR improves SEU rates substantially.  SEFI is solved through the use of a SEFI ?Hardened Core? circuit, external to the microprocessor, along with SEFI recovery software embedded into application code.  It monitors the ?health? of the processor, and if SEFI occurs, forces the processor to return through a series of escalating events (interrupts, reset).  Space Micro successfully demonstrated monitoring and recovery of Pentiums from SEFI, 100% of the time, using a prototype of the H-Core in a proton environment. This is significant in being the industry?s first (only) demonstrated solution for SEFI in microprocessors.In Phase II, the H-Core will be advanced into a radiation hardened IC that operates with any advanced microprocessor, allowing automatic return to operational status after a SEFI event.  Additionally, software recovery algorithms will allow applications to recover part or all of their lost data.","This SBIR provides enabling technology for several key NASA developmental areas:  ? -Intelligent Distributed Spacecraft ? -Ultra-High Data Rate Communications ? -High Performance Spectrometry ? -Autonomous Reconfiguration ? -Complex Multi-node Heterogeneous Networks ? -Network Scalability for Incremental Network Growth   As high lighted in the Earth Science Enterprise Technology Workshop, drastically enhanced on-board processing is needed for data compression, event recognition and response, and hyperspectral and radar data processing  With more computing power in space, we can also develop more efficient onboard real-time multisensor\multisource\multiresolution algorithms to perform target recognition, image deblurring, noise filtering, motion compensation, guidance and navigation, surveillance and reconnaissance, data compression and transmission for more effective earth resource monitoring as well as law enforcement and homeland security.

As evidenced by the Air Force letter in the proposal, the Air Force is funding a low power space computer program to reach the same goals as desired by NASA and commercial satellite manufacturers (high speed, low power and radiation hard/tolerant).  Vastly increased performance over traditional radiation hardened processors enables lower cost systems, plus enabling new capabilities.

Second, a thin CVD SiC sputter deposition process applied to the mirror facesheet.  This enables a low-scatter surface as well as high reflectance in the EUV band.  Third, the application of Tinsley?s computer controlled optical surfacing (CCOS) grinding and polishing makes it possible to generate aspheres with extremely accurate surfaces.

The demonstration focus is 20cm ? 25cm deformable (secondary or tertiary) mirrors where the ultracompact adaptive optic is achieved by a combination of the ultralightweight advanced pixelized device control system (developed and demonstrated by QorTek during Phase I) and the super-thin, super-smooth composite mirror technology (developed by Composite Mirror Applications, Inc).  The conclusion of Phase II will be a product consisting of a 20cm diameter circular adaptive mirror.  The mirror will incorporate a circular matrix array of 488 active (induced strain) elements.

Capability is needed to support science mission data retrieval at higher rates than heretofore possible with RF systems where the optical system must have very high surface accuracy.  By increasing the aperture of the transmitting telescope, the receiver aperture can be reduced to a more manageable size.  The SPACE COMMUNICATIONS impact of the technology is providing low cost high-density array of actuators solution for which there currently exists no competition.  Future SPACE OPTICS will be required to be lightweight, have supersmooth surfaces, and super accurate figures as to function in deep space for long periods of time.  Low-cost high-density actuator deformable mirrors provide the best means for maintaining high performance. Missions that can potentially integrate the new technology include Solar High Angular Resolution Photometric Imager, Stellar Imager Space Interferometry, and TPF.","At present, there are absolutely no such products available to the non-NASA telescope user community to correct for mirror defects in mid-range astronomy optics.  The cost of adaptive optic systems currently available is prohibitive to such use.  The present technology offers promise as a low cost, completely integrated solution to aberration correction for both the NASA and the non-NASA astronomy and astrophysics community.   By teaming with CMA, the QorTek/CMA team is in a position to, almost overnight, go into production of limited quantities of such self-contained atmospheric aberration correction systems.  The commercial advantages in combining the inexpensive Thin Film or Circuit Board Matrix Architecture with the Composite Mirror production technology that CMA brings is that we estimate that a limited production of the fully integrated system with support software and installer support could be made available at a range of prices very attractive to the user community."

The LGC produces balloon lift gas by catalytic reforming of methanol to generate hydrogen plus some carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide.   Pioneer Astronautics prototyped and characterized an LGC system during Phase I. The LGC was demonstrated as a portable lift gas generator for launching meteorological and scientific balloons from remote locations where high-pressure helium is not available.   Based on favorable mission analyses conducted during Phase I, the LGC as a method for extending the duration of high-altitude scientific balloon flights will be developed under Phase II. The LGC would operate with an auxiliary buoyancy-control balloon. The LGC produces lift gas by catalytic reforming of methanol at night. During the day, some of the lift gas (predominantly hydrogen) is burned with atmospheric air to produce water. The water ballast can be dropped or can be recycled to the LGC for steam reforming to generate lift gas the following night. These techniques can triple the duration of high-altitude flights compared to conventional methods of dropping ballast at night and venting gas during the day.","The Lift Gas Cracker can be used to provide lift gas for stratospheric balloon flights for Earth observation, atmospheric research, and high-altitude telescopes.  Lift gas generated on board at night from liquid methanol can be used to maintain altitude as an alternative to dropping ballast. The lift gas, which is predominantly hydrogen, can then be catalytically burned with air during the day to effectively reduce the lift gas volume while generating water ballast. The water ballast can be dropped or can be recycled to the Lift Gas Cracker for steam reforming of methanol the following night, greatly extending the time aloft.  The LGC could also be used for extended duration balloon flights on Venus or Mars.","The LGC is well-suited for the production of lift gas in remote areas, such as the Arctic, Antarctic, and underdeveloped regions where conventional gas cylinders are difficult to obtain. Such gas is needed in large quantities to support meteorological campaigns and flight service stations, which provide winds aloft data to pilots. In addition, winds aloft information is needed by artillery units, which fire projectiles through high altitudes. In remote areas, the provision of helium bottles to field units is difficult, and the LGC offers logistic advantages. The low cost of lift gas compared to helium could provide an attractive alternative for systems such as tethered balloons since the gas leakage experienced over time by such systems can be considerable. With the addition of a gas separation membrane, the LGC could be used to supply cheap, easily generated hydrogen for fuel cell applications, including automobiles and power supply stations."

Two-phase capillary pumped heat transport technology including Capillary Pumped Loops (CPLs) and Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) offers many operational advantages over mechanically pumped counterparts.

For example, with Nitrogen as the working fluid, the loop can provide 77K cooling for a large structure that contains high-temperature superconductor (HTS) electronics.  Another potential application of the proposed concept (with water as the working fluid) is to provide cooling for consumer electronics cabinets (e.g. high-power servers).

The improved wear (relative to commercial diamond tools) is achieved by orienting diamond crystals on the tips of specially designed cutter inserts, so as to exploit the anisotropy in diamond hardness. The reduction in tip wear enhances the precision of machining in uninterrupted cuts. The advantage is most clearly seen when hard ceramics, such as SiC, are machined, but the new cutter technology also provides benefits in machining certain metallic systems.

Optics of 10-m class and beyond must be active to maintain sufficient optical figure.  However, traditional deformable mirrors are too massive and complex to launch into orbit.  Electron beam actuation solves this problem by replacing the myriad of wires of current high spatial frequency deformable optics with an electron source.  Pointing the electron beam anywhere on the mirror surface provides unparalleled flexibility and unlimited spatial frequency.  Phase I results proved the ability to provide high authority, stable and repeatable actuation on an electron beam actuated optic.  Flood loading induced 9-waves of power in a 1-in optic.  Focusing and pointing the electron beam achieved localized deformations.  A scalable design is introduced to allow for a 25-40 cm diameter, less than 5-kg/m2 optic actuated by electron beam control to be delivered on Phase II.  The multi-parametric nature of electron beam actuation will be harnessed by developing novel control algorithms. The proposed project will allow for a lower mass, reduced complexity design capable of shape fitting not possible with any current deformable mirror technology, due to the flexibility of electron beam control.","In addition to the benefits of hexagonal modules for Gossamer optic system wavefront correction, a segmented deformable mirror would have applications in high energy laser beam cleanup and propagation. The hexagonal array spacing also offers several advantages in conventional adaptive optics applications. The hexagonal packing provides a higher actuator density in a given aperture size and access to influence functions that are not possible with square arrays. Other applications would be in the ophthalmic area. High density mirror arrays could be installed on Fundus cameras to aid ophthalmologists in diagnosing retinal disease and other problems which can be diagnosed through the study of the capillary structure in the eye. There would be applications in laser eye surgery by improving the beam quality of lasers used as scalpels.","The Adaptive Tertiary mirror would allow the correction of wavefront errors in Gossamer optics, which are critical to the development of 100 meter and larger diameter telescopes in space. The adaptive tertiary potentially alleviates some of the tight manufacturing, assembly, and deployment tolerances that are anticipated in working with ultralightweight optics, reducing the complexity of the system and therefore the risk and cost. The adaptive tertiary concept can be applied whether the primary mirror is segmented, as in the case with NGST, or the more typical vision of a continuous gossamer membrane. Each segment of the adaptive tertiary, with independent tip-tilt functionality, can correct both the large errors anticipated during deployment, or the higher spatial frequency errors compensated in a conventional deformable mirror."

More generally the process improvements proposed here will benefit CCOS processing of any hard, brittle material.  This expands the benefits of the proposed work to apply to silicon optics, hard window materials like sapphire, germanium optics, and silicon carbide optics.  In these material areas there are a number of NASA commercial applications where the time/cost benefit created with the technology development proposed here can create a real technology advantage.","Beryllium optics are typically used in space-based and air-based optical systems which are of interest to NASA and the DoD for astronomical observing and remote sensing of the earth.  Historically, beryllium optics have been used for NASA?s Space Infared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), the DoD?s Earthwatch system, and NOAA?s GOES weather satellite.  Improvements to Be mirror processing obtained in this SBIR effort will benefit the development of future space-based optical telescopes systems that are considering a Be based design."

The concept for EXIST relies on an X-ray telescope imaging the entire sky each 95 min orbit. The core of the X-ray imaging telescope comprises approximately 8 square meters of pixilated Cd-Zn-Te (CZT) detectors, a technical feat never before attempted. This enormous array requires development of a new packaging technology for CZT detector arrays, one that allows detectors to be abutted together into large arrays of CZT tiles, with minimal dead space in between detectors. Also required is a technology that can produce these detectors with a high interconnection yield, not currently achieved with indium bump technologies. We propose an innovative technique to assemble CZT X-ray sensors avoiding conventional direct indium bump hybridization used today. The novel scheme incorporates commercial off-the-shelf flip-chip and multichip module technologies, combined with new flip-chip bonding materials and proprietary processes developed at Aguila under previous NASA sponsorship. This will result in novel detector modules containing fully-integrated readout electronics that can be implemented into a large-array motherboard.","Lack of access to good packaging technology is hindering NASA's ability to develop large area CZT focal plane detectors for hard x-ray missions on balloons and in space such as InFOCuS, Constellation-X, EXIST and HSI. The ideas presented here may also be solutions to the array hybridization challenges for cryogenic arrays with calorimeters and bolometers which have been proposed for Constellation-X and various sub-mm and IR instruments.","The commercial market for CZT pixel detectors is in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, anti-terrorism and industrial processing. Once the CZT material technology improves to where large area arrays are readily producible, the market for using this technology will offer many opportunities. Furthermore, there is a great need for high interconnect densities in flip chip electronic assemblies with many applications in automotive products and wireless communications."

This thruster is itself a variant on the Vacuum Arc Thruster that has been demonstrated via a recently concluded Phase I SBIR contracts from NASA. The VAT was verified to be a throttleable low mass (ca. 150g) high efficiency (ca. 10% measured), high Isp (1000-3000s) electric propulsion device that can be remotely adjusted to deliver individual impulse bits from 0.25?Ns to 50?Ns with repetition rates varying from 1?1000 Hz while all the time providing an Isp of >1000s. The MVAT approach has shown to improve thruster performance and control contamination while keeping the system mass low (<300g). AASC proposes to team with Aerojet to further develop and low level qualify the MVAT to TRL 5.","The primary application of the specific electric propulsion thruster to be developed in the proposed work will be for optical interferometry mission. However, beyond this immediate application, the thruster could find use for larger or smaller spacecraft used in precision pointing and attitude control. The MVAT will become the enabling technology to use micro-, and nano-spacecraft for more challenging but cost-effective missions.","Commercial applications might be found in communcation satellites. GEO-satellite location and bandwidth allocations are limited.  Bandwidth on these satellites is currently limited and expensive.  Future projections indicate that as more third-world countries enter the information-age, prices will increase with demand.  A solution seems to be to find or create new and innovative ways of providing bandwidth for example the use of constellations of small satellites. These satellites will require precise, low mass propulsion systems like the MVAT."

This type of optical filter consists of a three-dimensional, periodic structure in monocrystalline silicon. Due to the nature of light transmission through such a layer, omnidirectionality of the transmission was demonstrated. Due the construction consisting mostly of a single environmentally stable material, porous silicon filters do not suffer from thermal, mechanical, and environmental instabilities. In Phase II, Lake Shore will optimize the manufacturing process and will evaluate some design changes that should provide viable prototypes for testing by NASA. In particular, different silicon anodization setups will be used to provide uniform silicon anodization across up to 150mm wafers, different pore geometries will be used to maximize the transmittance, CVD pore wall coating will be developed to extend the application range of such filters beyond the transparency window of silicon, antireflection coating of the filter surfaces will be developed to suppress reflection losses and packaging will be developed in order to adapt these filters for different applications.  Such filters are expected to impact commercial, military and scientific community in many filter applications.","Mid-infrared imaging is a powerful technique to study the center of our galaxy and beyond. However, this wavelength range is difficult to work in. At these wavelengths, room temperature objects emit strongly. The strong Earth background causes weak signal-to-noise ratios. Mid IR filters are needed to separate extraterrestrial signals from this background to build a meaningful picture. Currently used filters suffer from problems stemming from the lack of materials that are transparent, stable and compatible with each other at these wavelengths. The proposed new type of filters can solve these problems. Specific applications of proposed filters include the infrared imaging of planets; studying atmospheric methane (to determine methane output from ocean life), and IR spectroscopic sensing of planetary gases, for example, water vapor on Mars.","Narrow band pass, band pass and band blocking IR filters are used in optical communications, environmental monitoring, chemical and biological analysis, imaging and other areas. Customers include manufacturers of production equipment, as well as manufacturers and users of ?consumer? optical components and equipment. All uses suffer from the angular dependence of the transmission spectra that is a characteristic of interference filters. Many of these users solve the angular dependence problem by adding additional complexity, weight and price to their products, sometimes degrading the performance as well. Lake Shore proposes a new design for optical filters that has the potential to be a disruptive technology. Hence, all these applications may be considered as potential markets for MPSi filters. As a specific example, automation in the manufacture of fiber optic communications equipment has been delayed in part by tight alignment requirements, a problem that can be overcome with this technology."

The design will also minimize the channel-to-channel DC variation which improves the bias uniformity across all pixels of the array. 2- Capable of operation at cryogenic temperatures down to 1.5K.  Advanced monolithic cryo-CMOS technology will guarantee deep cryogenic operation with minimal impact on noise performance. 3- Offers the potential of being directly hybridized to IR detector arrays using indium-bump technology.

The analyzer design is based on an electric dispersion and an immersion front-end optic.  The improved performance allows a low mass, low power requirement, chemical analysis tool suitable for planetary missions. This tool is suitable for understanding the chemistry of geophysical materials and can detect signs of life or pre-biotic processes.  The ability to determine chemical state in addition to elemental composition of materials with no a priori knowledge of the materials provides a robust experimental capability for extracting information in situations where the environment is not totally known. A second innovation involves using a new sample access technology that eliminates valves or pumping from the Mars atmosphere. The XPS tool input only needs to be placed 1 mm from the sample area of interest. This greatly simplifies ease of use, makes sample introduction simple and improves reliability.  With, or without, the new sample system, the goal of the program will be a prototype XPS with a mass less than 10 kg that consumes less than 10 watts.","The effect of the oxidants is a major question in the search for biosignatures on Mars and in special Earth locations. On Earth a small portable, field useable XPS system will provide in situ information and avoid the ever-present contamination effects that are a part of laboratory experiments.  Keeping samples in situ avoids the changing water levels and travel related contamination.For Mars applications a mission compatible XPS will provide clear elemental and chemical state information with no a priori knowledge of the sample, which insures important knowledge is gained with XPS measurements. This tool will be suitable for understanding the chemistry of geophysical materials and provide an ability to detect signs of life or pre-biotic processes.   Measurements at Mars atmosphere conditions with the new sample system on earth will allow detail studies of the kinetics on Mars model materials,",The small size and mass of the proposed XPS system and its potential low cost lends itself to applications as a dedicated tool in production environments.  Large markets for such products exist in the semiconductor industry for monitoring film production for gate oxides and Cu migration barriers. Similar markets also exist in the polymer industry for film surface preparation steps that lead to further processing and in the data storage media industry for media and head lubrication and corrosion protection films.  The Mars Atmospheric Pressure Environment (MAPE) sample handling system being prepared can be reformatted to allow measurements at pressures up to 10 torr using conventional XPS systems.

The helium-based Ion Mobility Spectrometer previously developed for NASA by the key personnel making this proposal provides the universal response and ppb sensitivity required. However, the minimal resources available onboard for missions to planets and small bodies such as comets, asteroids, and moons, mandate that the instruments provide maximum analytical capabilities with minimal requirements of volume, weight, and consumables. Therefore, further miniaturization and development of the IMS is required. For Phase II it is proposed that a miniaturized IMS prototype be designed, built, and evaluated as the platform for a space-capable instrument. This instrument will incorporate a number of novel features that advance the current technology. The modifications and improvements to the former design will provide the required analytical and space-flight capabilities to serve as the basis for a miniature space-capable instrument. Phase II will also entail the evaluation of the Mini-Cell IMS in conjunction with MEMS GC and the  further miniaturization and production engineering of delivered instrumentation. Potential commercial applications are for the manufacture of hand-held detectors for explosives or illegal narcotics.","NASA applications are as described in this proposal for a chemical detector which, when mated to a miniature GC, can provide the detection and confirmation of identity of chemicals eluting from the GC. The low weight and consumables usage of the Mini-Cell IMS make the use of this instrument practicable for the contemplated future missions to explore the atmospheres and gaseous contents of moons, comets, and planets including the proposed balloon rover missions. Another potential NASA application is for an IMS to replace the IMS currently used to monitor the crew environment on the space shuttle. The current system is bulky, and the replacement of it with something smaller sized is being investigated. The americium source could also be an advantage here because the device could be advertised as no more hazardous than a common commercial smoke detector.","The greatest potential commercial application for the Mini-Cell IMS is for the manufacture of hand-held detectors for explosives or illegal narcotics. The Mini-Cell design concept should be scalable to mass production techniques which will drastically lower the cost of production versus the standard IMS while still providing the high sensitivity required for the demanding explosives or drugs detection applications, Using a non-regulated ionization source, such as the Am-241, makes the Mini-Cell IMS much more widely available. Other commercial applications would be in the detection of trace chemicals in the semiconductor industry. Here there also exists a need for sophisticated instrumentation with very low, and always becoming lower, detection limits for a variety of chemicals deleterious for the production environment. Having a non-regulated source would also be very well received in this application."

The proposed approach is consistent with the planetary protection requirements and can be used to extract intact and tailings samples for biological and geological research on Mars.  While the proposed drill is optimized for Mars environment, it can be used on other celestial bodies. The main advantage of the autonomous core drill and the emphasis of the proposed research are mass saving due to the bracing, deployment, and retrieval systems that are lighter, less complex, and have smaller launch envelope than currently proposed drive stem drills powered from the surface. The latter approach is limited to depths around 10 m since its efficiency drops precipitously with depth. The proposed system should fit the envelope of 40 kg and 200-300 watt-hrs per meter advance in medium hardness rock formations.","Dry drilling is a niche technology on Earth but is a major requirement for NASA applications. Delivery of deep subsurface samples from all celestial bodies in the solar system has been identified as a requirement by most roadmap studies. Mass saving advantages of an autonomous drill is most suited for these environments. The autonomous drill offers ability to drill through a wider variety of rock formations; it permits easier hazard avoidance; and it can reach larger depths than currently proposed approaches.  The system developed under this Phase II SBIR may be used by NASA as a test bed to compare performance of drilling/coring systems based on different drilling bits. The developed autonomous corer minus its drilling bit will provide propulsion, reaction forces, dry bailing, and power delivery for other drilling bit subsystems that need to be tested.","Autonomy and bracing technologies developed under this Phase II SBIR will find wide applications in the microtunneling field on Earth. The latter is rapidly becoming the technology of choice for deployment of new infrastructure lines in urban environment.  Current techniques use either horizontal directional drilling or jacked production pipe driven drilling head assemblies (DHA) to excavate these tunnels. The existing technologies reached their limits and further improvements may require autonomous DHA?s.  UTD has a long history of development and commercialization of novel technologies.

The innovation proposed here would adapt and extend the SPHERES system for a follow-on mission to ISS to serve as a testbed for MSR autonomous terminal-phase rendezvous and capture technologies ? including guidance algorithms, rendezvous and capture techniques, and capture mechanisms ? as would be involved in the retrieval of a sample lofted into Mars orbit.  The autonomous retrieval of the orbiting sample is one of the most technically complex and risky aspects of the MSR mission.  The SPHERES MOSR testbed would streamline OS retrieval algorithm and hardware development, and significantly reduce the risk of this critical MSR mission operation.  This Phase II effort would result in a flight hardware system implementation ready to enter the Shuttle/ISS payload integration process.","The primary NASA commercial application for the SPHERES MOSR testbed is in support of the NASA Mars Sample Return mission development.  We believe that the testbed will play a unique role in simulating contact dynamics between the target and chaser.  An unanticipated result obtained during Phase I was that the testbed could serve a critical role in evaluating capture mechanism designs.  We also feel that the testbed will be useful for rapid prototyping of MSR rendezvous/capture algorithms, taking advantage of the unique iterative capability of the SPHERES system during operation on ISS.  The testbed would have immediate relevance to other NASA missions requiring autonomous on-orbit rendezvous/docking, including sample return missions from other planetary bodies and construction/servicing of large, distributed space optical systems.  While these other missions are still in the initial planning phases, the testbed could be highly useful in support of advanced technology development and mission architecture studies.","We anticipate applications in the military and commercial sectors.  The DoD is seriously investigating autonomous rendezvous and docking for the purpose of resupply, maintenance, and upgrading of valuable orbital assets.  DARPA?s Orbital Express program is leading this investigation.  If the Orbital Express program yields a positive result, we anticipate that several DoD organizations will develop autonomous rendezvous and docking technologies.  We would position the SPHERES MOSR testbed in a similar role as for the NASA missions ? as a low-cost, uniquely-capable system for rapid, iterative evaluation of algorithms and hardware for the last-few-meters problem.  Also, because it is extraordinarily inexpensive relative to other spaceflight and associated ground research systems, we believe that there are multiple commercial sales opportunities for the testbed in academic and government research programs.  We would expect that these applications would be for complete systems ? perhaps more oriented toward ground application ? than the mission-oriented options discussed above."

Currently, there are no automated techniques for sampling spacecraft surfaces for microorganisms and providing real-time analysis for contamination, despite the desperate need for such a device.  To overcome obstacles associated with conventional sampling and time-consuming detection methods, Lynntech has developed a unique vacuum surface sampling device which can be used in conjunction with a state of the art electrochemical based gene expression micro-detection unit.  In the Phase I research, Lynntech successfully designed and fabricated the sampling unit, demonstrating its sampling capability on several surfaces.  In addition, the microbiological electronic detection unit, including a cell lysing system and miniature thermal cycler, were successfully designed, built, and tested as individual benchtop components.

The sampling device may be used alone or in conjunction with a novel microbial detector, providing NASA with the convenience and flexibility to perform a variety of different analysis techniques on the same sample.  Providing NASA personnel with a non-labor intensive method for this type of microbial sampling and detection could save many man hours of labor.  Potentially many more harmful microbiological contaminants could be detected and subsequently eliminated by using these types of devices, which streamline the sampling and detection process.  The devices are not only more user friendly than conventional techniques, but can also produce results much faster.","The microbiological autosampling device and the detector unit would both find use in many military and civilian applications.  Biological warfare agents pose a significant threat to both US military forces and civilian populations worldwide.  Convenient sampling methods are desperately needed that can efficiently sample surfaces such as carpet, ceiling tile, furniture, and drapes.  The proposed sampling device would overcome many of the technical hurdles faced when sampling these surfaces.  In addition, when paired with the detection unit, both units could provide near real-time analysis and detection of biological warfare agents, potentially saving many lives.  Other uses include sampling of harmful pathogens in the food production and processing industries, point-of-care medical facilities, medical and dental offices, and manufacturing facilities that require strict adherence to microbial contamination standards, such as those found in the pharmaceutical industry.

Further uses to NASA include position sensitive detection for vehicle docking, navigation, and guidance.  Sensitive 3-D imaging can be realized using these detector in LADAR applications, including the geographical mapping of terrestrial or extra-terrestrial features.","The primary application of this work is the further development of a detector for tracking satellites or other sources used in long-haul free-space optical communication systems.

Cryogenic power electronics can provide important benefits both for space and commercial applications: higher efficiency, reduced size, weight and complexity, and improved system reliability. Of primary importance to spacecraft is reduction or elimination of thermal control and its attendant power usage, weight, size and added electronics. We propose using the silicon-germanium (SiGe) materials system because of its powerful design flexibility, compatibility with silicon processing, and ability to combine desirable features of both silicon and germanium. Conventional Si-based electronics has not proved adequate for deep-cryogenic temperature (down to 30 K) power applications, whereas SiGe operates well down to these cryogenic temperatures. In Phase I we successfully fabricated metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures and heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT), which are essential elements of advanced power devices to be developed in Phase II. The proposed SiGe cryogenic power devices are an innovation because there are presently no power semiconductor devices based on SiGe and designed for cryogenic applications.","Upcoming NASA missions to the outer planets and satellites, asteroids, and other sites will encounter extremely cold environments, down to the deep cryogenic range (as low as 40 K). Cryogenic electronics can eliminate or reduce the need for thermal control and thus reduce spacecraft size, weight, power usage and the associated electronics. Also, it will enable greater mobility and lifetime for surface exploration craft, as well as reducing their thermal impact on the environment. Cryogenic electronics is also needed for space-based observatories that depend on cryogenics, such as the Next-Generation Space Telescope. Actuators for the deformable optical systems will operate at deep cryogenic temperatures, and the drive electronics should operate in the same cryogenic environment.","Potential application areas in the industrial, commercial and defense sectors include magnetic resonance imaging, energy storage (inductive or capacitive), cryogenic or superconducting power transmission and distribution, cryogenic or superconducting motors and generators, magnetic confinement, particle accelerators, aerospace vehicles, and radio-frequency power amplifiers. These applications can benefit from improved efficiency of cryogenic power electronics and reduced size and weight. Many of these are natural application areas because they already incorporate a cryogenic environment. Also, cryogenic temperatures around 30 K have received additional emphasis by the recent discovery of superconductivity in MgB2, which promises to be a practical material for both electronic and large-scale applications."

Box 978, Manvel , TX   77578 - 3819",(281 ) 489  - 4889,,,,,,,"Phase I demonstrated a new lithium ion anode material based on nanotechnology that exploits the high rate capability and excellent cycle life of a carbon fiber material and the high volumetric and gravimetric capacity of tin-based systems to yield a high capacity material. Phase II objective will be to further optimize the modified carbon fiber anode to a level where a practical gravimetric capacity of 500-700 mAh/g can be delivered.  The combination of this anode with the mixed oxide cathode material in a lithium-ion battery packaged in a soft-pack aluminum laminate material should exhibit energy density ranging from190-230 Wh/Kg. The carbon fiber will act not only as an electronic conductor but also as a cushion that will accommodate the volume changes during lithium intercalation and deintercalation.  In addition, because of the metallic character of the modified composite anode, the overall cell impedance is expected to decrease.  Such a decrease in cells impedance should give rise to much improved rate performance and excellent cyclability than existing commercial cells. This proposed lithium-ion technology promises to revolutionize the world of space batteries in terms of cost/performance factor.","The lithium-ion batteries using our novel LPT's anode technology can be exploited for broad range of NASA applications, from planetary orbiters and landers to reusable launch vehicles and small aircraft. This battery technology can also be incorporated in unmanned Aerial Vehicles that require capacities up to 200 A-hr.  They can be used for missions to outer planets Jupiter, Pluto (e.g. Europa Orbiter and Pluto Fly-by) Planetary orbiters and the earth satellites (e.g GEO and LEO). The scale-up of these batteries should meet or exceed the battery requirements for space applications where cycle life of more than 30000 cycles for low earth orbit (LEO), high rate applications (> 4 kW/kg) and rapid charge/discharging (ten of seconds) and calendar life of more than 10 years for geosynchronous orbits (GEO) are needed.","Widespread use of a variety of portable consumer electronics such as portable computers, cellular telephones, camcorders and handheld power tools, as well as continued demand from other future potential applications such as electric bicycles, scooters and cars have resulted in large markets where our new lithium ion battery technology could be used. The commercial viability of electric vehicles is still primarily limited by battery technology. The successful development of novel lithium-ion batteries should meet and exceed the performances of commercial lithium-ion batteries and should be able to capture new markets such as the high rate applications (e.g. power tools, underwater vehicles, high-tech gadgets, PDA).  They could be also be used in wearable batteries for the military and load-leveling applications. These new and conventional applications are placing growing demands on existing battery technologies to deliver increasing amount of electricity through smaller and lighter batteries."

NASA will benefit from availability of these systems in its push towards expanding mankind?s understanding and place in space.  One technology having the most potential for serving NASA objectives is thin-film photovoltaics.  Great advances have been made over the past 20 years in photovoltaic technology, and thin-film devices are no exception.  However, these advances have not led to the realization of the combination of high efficiency and high power density required for future NASA applications.  One shortcoming has been the substrate material.  In this Phase II program, Foster-Miller proposes the continued development of a substrate that will enable the realization of NASA?s long-term goals.  Among commercially available polymeric materials, PBO is the only material exhibiting the high temperature stability and high mechanical strength necessary to achieve the high efficiency and high power density required for these missions to come to fruition. This Phase II effort will address the space-stability problem - common among polymeric substrates - for PBO by identifying and optimizing coatings to impart a space-hardened nature.  Devices will be fabricated and an array will be supplied to NASA. (P-030625)","A mature space-hardened CIGS-on-PBO PV system will find application in many current and future thrusts at NASA.  The provision of low density power generation systems such as CIGS-on-PBO PV?s will present a means of increasing mission payload or decreasing mission budgets.  This will have specific implication in Space Science Missions such as a Mars Outpost SEP Tug where increased payloads are desirable.  Assessment of the effects of combining PV?s with electronic propulsion systems for solar system missions such as Jupiter and Venus orbiters has indicated significant potential for launch cost savings and increases in mass margins.  Additional NASA applications include: large size satellites, microsats, deep space solar electric propulsion arrays, planetary surface power generation, and deep space outpost power generation.","Space-hardened CIGS-on-PBO technology could be readily transferred to several commercial and government applications outside of NASA.  Commercial applications include the remote terrestrial power generation (i.e., roofing shingles), battery trickle charger, and cell phone chargers.  Government applications include military personnel power supply, structurally-integrated power for deployable tents and shelters, and drones."

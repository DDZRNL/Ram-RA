The focus will be to quantify, model and validate residual stress and cold work evolution at stress concentration features during simulated service in aerospace gas turbine engine disk materials. This will be accomplished by first utilizing existing NASA Test data. If the existing test data are insufficient, a minimum number of specimens will be tested if the resources permit. These specimens will have varied surface finish conditions to be determined in consultation with NASA personnel and will be tested using a thermal mechanical load history that will simulate the operating conditions of new generation of gas turbine engines and include the effect of superimposed dwell cycles. The deliverables will include effects of service history on residual stress and cold work depth profile evolutions within notches, and analytical modeling descriptions of the evolution of these parameters as a function of simulated service history. Also included will be models and algorithms extrapolating the predicted residual stresses and cold work to service conditions outside of those tested during the program.","The long-term goal of this research effort is to improve the life and durability of turbomachinery disk components made from advanced powder metal alloys.  These improvements are critical to the success NASA programs such as Environmentally Responsible Aircraft (ERA) program.  This program has the goal demonstrating technologies that can reduce aircraft emissions and fuel consumption. This requires that components operate at increased temperatures and/or with reduced cooling air.  Advanced metal alloy and composite materials can operate under these conditions, but durability and life must be assured. One of ERAs approaches to accomplishing these goals is to focus on ""advanced multi-discipline based concepts and technologies,"" which is exactly the approach of this proposal. Structural, thermal, materials, reliability and systems engineering expertise must be brought together to achieve the objectives in Phase I","The results of this proposal and potential products will be of interest to the commercial gas turbine industry in general.  This includes large aircraft engine companies such as General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.  This is especially true for smaller companies in the private sector that cannot afford a research effort of this magnitude. Honeywell has expressed specific interest in this work and has provided a letter to this effect, which is provided with this proposal.  The methodologies (and supporting analysis/design tools) as well as improved PM disk designs are both considered products of this effort. The primary market for the compressor and turbine disk designs includes gas turbine engines for use in military and civilian aircraft applications.  Gas turbine engines are also used for ground power applications. These projects identify advanced materials as key technologies for future power generation systems based on gas turbine engines.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Generation; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Processing Methods; Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures; X-rays/Gamma Rays"

Residual stress and cold work will have a dramatic impact on the fatigue performance. Shot peening is widely used on PM disks to provide a fatigue benefit however, the relaxation due to thermal and mechanical loads can reduce or even eliminate the compressive residual stresses and increase the risk of a catastrophic disk failure. Up to now the evolution of the residual stress and cold work under typical operating conditions in PM disk superalloys is not well understood.In Phase I proprietary x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques will be used to simultaneously measure the change in residual stress and cold work for fatigue specimens tested in a manner to approximate in-service conditions. XRD residual stress and cold work results will be used to establish the feasibility of applying analytical or empirically based modeling techniques to predict the residual stress and cold work evolution. The modeling technique will first be demonstrated on fatigue samples and further developed and proven on actual disk hardware in Phase II. The anticipated beginning and ending technology readiness levels (TRLs) for Phase I are 2 and 5, respectively.",The proposed development program will provide the following for NASA applications:· A multi-functional modeling tool to be used in NASA's Aviation Safety Program to provide longer lasting and safer compressor and turbine disk operation.· A means of measuring residual stress and cold work depth distributions simultaneously in critical high stress regions of disks. · A software tool that will allow for accurate assessment of the change in residual stress and cold working of disks providing a predictive capability of determining the remaining life of a part. · A means of developing surface enhancement processes that can produce the optimal compressive residual stress and cold working for maximum residual stress stability through the life of the part. · The model will allow for NASA engineers to understand the full stress state of the disk (applied + residual) as a function of life for a much more accurate interpretation of fatigue life. · This development will ultimately assist NASA in achieving their goal of safer and more reliable operation of legacy and new production aircraft.,"Applications for quantification and modeling of the residual stress and cold work outside of NASA are significant. Non-NASA applications are much the same as those listed above. Engine OEM's and their suppliers can use the predictive tools developed in this program to thoroughly understand how residual stresses and cold work change during the life cycle disks. Furthermore, the OEMs can use the measurement and modeling tools to develop more robust surface enhancement processes that remain stable at high temperatures and stresses, producing higher fatigue strengths, and safer longer lasting performance.","Air Transportation & Safety; Destructive Testing; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

The increasing demands on NDE to address inspection reliability in the area of health monitoring and remaining life assessment demand that quantitative engineering tools be available so that cost effect engineering analysis on inspectibility limits and optimal inspection protocols be done.  Most NDE techniques, as they move to a more digital format, generate terabytes of data for a single scan.  X-ray methods generally have high computational needs.  Until recently extracting information from massive data sets was impossible due to limited computation capabilities.  By applying the emerging massively parallel graphic processing cards (GPU) to a CT simulation, SimCT, we have a means to address the quantitative modeling in an important NDE method needed to characterize materials in support of health monitoring activities.  The computational techniques using GPU platforms and the data analysis methods developed in the x-ray area apply to any NDE method.  This R&D effort will develop a GPU implementation of the key subroutine in SimCT and demonstrate the capability to handle NDE simulation needs using complex geometry in near real time.","Developing NDE quantitative protocols, as demands on performance of materials increases, becomes increasingly critical and difficult.  Quantitative simulation tools capable of assessing the impact of the multitude of inspection parameters provide a cost effective means to determine adequate procedures in safety critical inspections.  Developing simulation tools addressing realistic complexity seen in new materials and real field inspections requires an ability to adequately model complex samples; which in turn requires the utilization of the latest computation platforms, namely GPU's.  The massively parallel GPU platforms enable the solution a new class of computational problem at one tenth the cost of traditional parallel approaches.  The computational methods involved in modeling complex geometry from a Cad format also apply to other NDE methods modeling.  Finally developing more robust and polished interface for these engineering tools gives better productivity and access to more people with reduced training needs.","There are currently no competing CT simulation products to SimCT in the market place.  The extensions and modifications added to the software under this Project will increase the speed of operation by about 100 times.  This allows for new categories of problems to be addressed and investigated in reasonable times or at greater levels of detail.  Besides NASA applications, there are analogous uses for SimCT in both DoD and commercial aging aircraft problems.  Additionally there is the potential to enter the multi-million dollar medical market and with Homeland Security CT scaning with a swifter easier to operate program.  Lastly, these improvements will allow bundling SimCT with hardware systems to improve the overall operation of CT systems.

(GEM) along with its team members, Clarkson University and LM Aero, propose to develop a mesh independent probabilistic residual life prediction tool for metallic airframe structures. The deterministic solver of this probabilistic analysis tool will be developed by integrating our cutting edge extended finite element toolkit for Abaqus (XFA) with a novel small time-scale fatigue crack growth model for mesh independent fatigue crack growth prediction of a complex airframe structural component subjected to multiaxial and variable amplitude loading. The fast matching and narrow band technique will be implemented to track a curvilinear 3D crack growth without remeshing. Both the versatility and the high computational efficiency will make the XFA an ideal solution model for the probabilistic life prediction where the initial defect shape and location can be treated as random variables without user intervention. After the integration of XFA with a general purpose probabilistic analysis framework (PFA), the resulting probabilistic version of the XFA (PXFA) will enable the following: 1) fatigue reliability assessment of an aging component; 2) evaluation of design variables to meet a targeted reliability level; and 3) provision of operational decision support using SHM data on repair, maintenance, and life extension options.","The results from this research will have significant benefits to enhance the aviation safety program in NASA. It will result in: 1) a commercially viable, accurate, computationally efficient, and user-friendly probabilistic residual life assessment tool for charactering fatigue crack growth and perform damage analysis with the presence of uncertainties in design and loading parameters; 2) an integrated analysis framework for fatigue damage prognosis and health management of air platform; 3) a virtual testing tool to reduce current certification and qualification costs which are heavily driven by experimental testing under various stress conditions; and 4) innovative probabilistic methods and reliability assessment procedures to facilitate the structural health management.  The developed tool integrates advanced computational mechanics, innovative fatigue damage modeling, and efficient probabilistic methods into a seamless framework for probabilistic crack growth analysis and structural damage prognosis.","Structural aging under fatigue loading is one of the most common failure mechanisms in civilian structures such as buildings, bridges, power lines, pressure vessels, and ship structures. The developed probabilistic fatigue life prediction tool can be used effectively and efficiently to assist a designer and rule-maker to answer the following questions: 1) How tolerant of cracks is the location? 2) How long to repair a crack in service? 3) What is the impact of an operational profile change? 4) How often should inspections be made? and 5) How can SHM input be used best? The tool can be used to assist commercial and military industries to reduce the cost of test-driven design and process iterations with the use of the virtual testing tool. Finally, teaming with LM, a highly visible airplane manufacturer, will considerably shorten our development cycle from producing a prototype research orientated tool to commercially accessible design software.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Fasteners/Decouplers; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures; Verification/Validation Tools"

The innovation is providing a single sensor that has dual-use functionality  air data measurement and kinetic air hazard detection in a package that is easily integrated onto commercial aircraft.  Conventional air data systems provide critical information to the aircraft for safe flight, but there are vulnerabilities, as evidenced by the recent Air France accident.  A more robust air data system for flight controls on aircraft is needed  particularly to measure airspeed in icing and severe weather conditions.  This proposed sensor also measures air hazards which impacts the safety of air traffic and smoothness of ride; decreases fuel consumption and incidence of encounters with turbulent events on aircraft.  The Phase I effort entails the system requirements determination, determination of optimal dual-use sensor, prototype design, range and accuracy expectations for each of the lidar modes, and preliminary design of the Phase II prototype.  This technology is a TRL 2 with the intent of reaching TRL 3 by the end of this program.  Phase II consists of a sensor demonstration in a representative flight environment (TRL 5).","Airspace transformation to NextGen may be significantly safer  by providing additional information for kinetic air hazard detection.  NASA has pioneered many innovations and improvements for wind hazard detection, warning and forecasting. This innovation enables this airspace transformation by providing wind hazard measurement and resulting real-time information for air traffic operations.  This innovation will not only increase in-safety flight, but also may impact the volume of traffic able to traverse the continent due to the provision of resultant weather warnings.  Also, safety of the air traffic system will be improved with the provision of a dually redundant air data system on commercial aircraft.  NASA has shown the utility of lidar wind and air data measurements over the years, however, the systems have been quite cumbersome.  Ophir solves this challenge by providing a redundant air data system and dual-use, kinetic air hazard monitoring system in a small size, weight and power consumption package, as well as at a low cost.","The commercial markets have been reticent to adopt an optical air data sensor due the size, weight and power consumption factors, as well as, the single function nature of the sensor.  But, the ability to condense the sensor and the offer multimode operation enables the market acceptance and ultimate sensor commercialization.  The markets addressed by this multifunction sensor development are the unmanned and manned military and commercial aircraft markets.  The proposed innovation may also be used in the regional jet market for new aircraft flight testing and calibration.

We are currently developing strategies for using such crew state metrics to modulate the level of automation support provided to the flight crew.  Dynamic reallocation of function between crew and automation can reduce the cognitive workload on the crew, enhance their ability to supervise the automation and help them intervene in the event of any failure or operation outside the desired operating conditions.eSky is exploring function reallocation in a collaborative flight control system (HFCS) design pioneered at NASA Langley.  HFCS combines precise flight control automation with rudimentary intelligence that the flight crew can guide using relatively simple mechanisms.  HFCS automation manages short-term control tasks (e.g. path following) while the crew is required to direct every significant trajectory change using flight controls rather than an FMS interface to keep them engaged in conduct of the flight. The automation communicates intentions to the pilot through visual and haptic (tactile) feedback; the crew communicates intentions to the automation through conventional controls.   The HFCS user interface is primarily visual and tactile with limited auditory elements, mainly limited to a few alerts and warnings.  eSky proposes to establish the auditory channel as a key element in providing flight dynamic information and cueing of required crew in puts in addition to envelope protection warnings.  These new interface elements will be integrated into eSky's evolving strategies for functionality reallocation of between automation and crew.","The aim of this project is to develop auditory presentation methodology for flight dynamic information as a supplement to conventional, primarily visual, pilot display systems and provide a higher level of support for complex tasks in high workload situations.

In response to this challenge, Aptima proposes to develop a Trajectory-Based Operations Adaptive Information Display (TBO-AID). TBO-AID will incorporate innovative display techniques that address the (1) unique information needs associated with conducting 4D operations (e.g., crossing a specific navigation fix at a specific time); (2) uncertainty and risk associated with weather and mixed-equipage conditions, key challenges for conducting 4D TBO; (3) potential advantages gained through multimodal information presentation; and (4) need for model-based, situationally aware display adaptation to support information processing and decision making. Anticipated results of commercializing this effort include increasing the safety and efficiency of air traffic and expanding the maximum number of aircraft potentially in flight at a given time.","TBO-AID addresses a relevant, high-priority issue  4D trajectory-based operations (TBO)  that is key to increased capacity and efficiency under NextGen.

Theseaircraft will be more fuel efficient, have longer operating ranges though more flexible aircraft structures.  Thisincreased flexibility will result in structural modes being in thesame frequency range as the rigid body modes.  The traditionalnon-adaptive control design approach to address the aeroservoelastic (ASE)interaction of decoupling the rigid body and structural dynamics will not work. Furthermore, the application of adaptive controlto these flexible aircraft may result inundesired ASE  excitationleading to structural damage or failure.   Hencean integrated flight control system is needed for gust loadalleviation, flutter suppression and rigid body control of theaircraft which works in concert with the adaptive control systemfor improved resilience and safety.MUSYN proposes an integrated approach based on linear, parameter-varying (LPV) control to the design of theflight control, load alleviation and flutter suppression algorithms.The Phase I and Phase II research will focus on applying andextending LPV techniques to model, design, analyze and simulate control algorithms for flexible aircraft.The objective is to combine the integratedLPV flight control system with adaptive control topreserve rigid body performance during upsets while retaining the load alleviation and flutter suppression characteristics of the nominally augmented aircraft. Phase I will develop a prototype LPV framework for modeling, analysis,control and simulation and Phase II will develop a comprehensiveLPV software tool suite.","The immediate NASA application will be the X-53 ActiveAeroelastic Wing (AAW) test bed at NASA Dryden.

(ZONA) proposes an R\&D effort to develop an Experimental Model Based Feedback Control (EMBFC) Framework for the flutter suppression and gust load alleviation (GLA). The resilience of the flight control law in the presence of aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic (AE/ASE) interactions can therefore be increased by the suppression of the aircraft's structural vibrations induced by the flutter mechanism and/or gust perturbation. Currently aircrafts with non-adaptive control laws usually include roll-off or notch filters to avoid AE/ASE interactions. However, if changes in the aircraft configuration are significant, the frequencies of the flexible modes of the aircraft may be shifted and the notch filters could become totally ineffective. With the proposed EMBFC framework, the flexible dynamics can be consistently estimated via system identification algorithms and its undesirable effects is suppressed through a robust feedback control law, while the whole systems stability is being maintained.  The proposed feedback control technique will be demonstrated with SuperSonic SemiSpan Transport S4T wind tunnel model for flutter suppression and gust load alleviation.","EMBFC Framework will assist NASA in its goal to achieve an integrated flight control system resilient to failures, damage, and upset conditions due to unforeseen AE/ASE interactions during the development of the aircraft's original control law.","EMBFC Framework can be firstly used by military and commercial aircraft manufacturers for new aircraft designs, modifications and upgrades.

In this concept, the task of accelerating or decelerating the engine is treated as a path planning exercise.  The control system actively searches for actuator inputs that allow the engine to traverse power settings without entering undesired regions of operation. The search is based on the sequential construction of control actions that satisfy feasibility constraints given the system dynamics. These algorithms have been proven to converge to the optimal solution through repeated iteration. RRTs allow for an efficient search of the solution space, reducing the computational expense of determining the best sequence of inputs with which to control the engine.

Among all the possible electrical system failures, two types of failures are considered the most frequent, and hence most critical: intermittent disconnection in connectors, and capacitance failures.  Despite the extreme care in the design and quality control in manufacturing and installation of these connectors in avionics and military equipment, there are increasing number of problems associated with the physical connectivity that ranges from intermittent discontinuities, sparks, and breakages. As for the capacitors, the power systems in modem aircrafts, specifically the ones with DC power supply configurations, rely very heavily on banks of capacitors that act as filters. These capacitors (especially of electrolytic type) present high failure rates - with no effective solution for online monitoring available. The proposed research will study detecting fault initiation, fault-to-failure progression, and online monitoring of the critical problems of intermittent disconnection, and capacitance aging and ultimate failures in aircraft power systems.

NASA data mining algorithms that are formulated as optimization algorithms can be integrated into the proposed distributed optimization and software framework. In addition to being a platform for deploying algorithms at airlines, the proposed distributed framework can support NASA in building national aviation safety resources. Using the developed technology, the airlines, industry vendors, and government can share the mined global knowledge without actually sharing the distributed local data used in its computation. An additional potential use of the developed distributed data mining technology is for validation of aircraft software after its initial deployment. Validation requires extensive test coverage. Monitoring an aircraft fleet would cover a much broader range of conditions than monitoring any single aircraft in the fleet.","*Airline FOQA.* The proposed demonstration of distributed FOQA data monitoring provides a direct path for transitioning the results of this SBIR projects into military and commercial aircraft fleets. The data-driven modeling would make advanced FOQA monitoring easy to implement. The proposed technology could allow the two airlines to share the data-driven performance models of their aircraft while processing their respective FOQA data privately.  *Propulsion.* The fleet-wide data-driven monitoring technology developed in this SBIR can be applied to jet engine fleets. The technology developed in the proposed SBIR project would provide scalability above and beyond what is available in existing systems.*Smart grid.* This is an area of rapidly increasing and potentially immense societal and business impact. Monitoring of power distribution systems is a major application that is not addressed at present. The proposed distributed data-driven monitoring technology is of interest for this area.*Semiconductor manufacturing.* If undetected in time, a fault in a semiconductor manufacturing process tool could lead to losing hundreds of high-cost wafers passing through the tool.

We will accomplish this by adapting the core technology, multicontinuum theory (MCT), from our existing industry-leading software analysis tool, Helius:MCT, to the problem of impact damage in CMCs. Our approach will involve modeling the composite at three levels: constituent level (fiber, matrix, interphase), mesostructure-level (fiber tow architecture), and macrostructure level (impact test of a multi-ply laminate). The mesostructure and macrostructure will be modeled using an explicit finite element analysis code. The constituent level modeling will be carried out using MCT, which permits constituent stresses and strains to be exactly determined from composite-average strain. The objective of the Phase I effort is to develop the modeling framework and compare predicted results with published experimental results. In-depth study of ceramic physics, development of an experimental validation program, and commercialization of the software would be part of a Phase I effort.","The primary NASA applications are the hypersonic, supersonic, and subsonic fixed wing programs. In the hypersonics program heat resistant structural components are needed, for which CMCs are used. Furthermore, combustor panels used in scramjet or ramjet technologies require robust performance and high temperatures, which CMCs could provide. The tools developed under this SBIR would enable designers of these components to select materials and material structures based on virtual testing rather than expensive experimental tests.The Supersonics and Subsonic Fixed Wing programs have similar needs. Namely, turbine housing and turbine blades must operate at high temperature with the potential for high velocity impact damage from foreign objects. The tools developed under this SBIR are specifically designed to address these issues and would provide rapid assessment of structural performance of CMCs under FOD without resorting to tests.","The initial primary target market for a suite of analysis tools for CMCs is with the U.S. Department of Defense and their Tier 1 OEMs.  Firehole Technologies, with a successful history within the Air Force, is uniquely positioned to apply this SBIR technology in the design and analysis of next-generation warfighting capabilities. Pratt and Whitney-Rocketdyne is a primary candidate for a commercialization partner, as indicated in their letter of support for this proposal. In addition, through past and existing contracts, Firehole has experience utilizing existing methodology for composite structures built by many of the major DoD  prime contractors including: Lockheed Martin, United Launch Alliance, ATK, and Boeing.

The technical objective is to achieve 50-70% weight reduction, super-inductance, extremely high magnetic fields, and potentially operate at high speed driven by AC signals in the tens of KHz frequency range.  Additionally, large size pancake carbon motors could produce extreme torques and withstand the inertia forces of a large diameter rotor. Some of the trade-offs of the carbon motor may be lower efficiency, higher temperature operation or need for additional cooling, and higher initial cost.

Fabrication times and costs are challenging for high acreage applications such as a structural TPS system. This proposed effort offers a new approach in manufacturing of SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composite components cost effectively with short lead time and high flexibility. The composites will be fabricated via a powder metallurgy/sintering approach using an emerging field assisted sintering technology (FAST). The objective is to fabricate and demonstrate making a cost effective CMC composite by FAST. The SiC/SiC produced will be produced from SiC constituents suitable for TPS applications.  Basic mechanical and thermal properties will be measured to assess the promise of the FAST process to rapidly producing a SiC/SiC composite.  A technical assessment of the FAST process to produce a 2700ºF+ SiC/SiC will be made as well.,The development of advanced ceramic composite materials and components with enhanced thermal-structural performance over those currently available could directly support future enabling technologies for hypersonic propulsion and hot structures. Applications for ceramiccomposites in advanced airbreathing combined-cycle propulsion systems and control surfaces for reusable hypervelocity and exo/transatmospheric aerospace vehicles are directly addressed by this technology. These potential applications are critically dependent on the development oflower cost advanced materials capable of high-performance load-bearing operation up to and beyond 1500oC (2700oF). Successful demonstration of the life at temperature of the CMC concept could result in a valuable near term increase in airframe performance and reliability for a variety of hot structures and thermal protection systems critical to both DoD and NASA highspeed aircraft and re-entry vehicles.,"Opportunities for retrofit and new application in turbine engine systems also exist. The potential low cost and high temperature capability could lend itself to these applications for internal hot gas path parts.  Similar requirements for high-temperature materials exist for commercial/industrial applications as well. Although less aggressive than the aerospace/defense and nuclear energy-related initiatives, programs are in place for evaluating reinforced ceramics for land-based turbine components, catathermal combustion devices, heat exchangers and radiant burners, which represent opportunities in energy and pollution abatement technologies that may mature over the next 10 or so years.","Ceramics; Composites; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Passive Systems; Processing Methods"

Ceramic fibers, particularly SiC, must be coated in order to protect the fibers from oxidizing environments, and to allow their use in SiC CMC's. FFF's LCVD techniques can be modified for fast, high purity coating. The Phase I effort includes creating a custom reactor that leverages FFF's existing gas precursor delivery infrastructure, and passing existing monofilament SiC fiber through the reactor to coat with BN in real time. Reversing direction and coating the coated fiber with SiC will be done for dual layer coating. Phase II would scale the process to serially dualcoat a unidirectional moving parallel array of hundreds or thousands of moving fibers. If successful, industry would finally have a reliable in-line approach to fiber coating prior to tow production, because spreading and coating already-sized tows is nearly impossible. Based on prior coating experience and other related proposals, Phase I work would take us from TRL3 to TRL4. Phase II could take us to TRL4 or TRL5, either on a FFF or other commercial fiber production facility.","Over the last quarter century NASA and DoD have demanded high temperature materials capable of operating in oxidizing environments. Government and industry alike have invested large amounts in SiC-based technology for this purpose. Yet, for all that has been invested, fiber purity and protection still remains insufficient to address the needs of 2700 F and above applications. Beyond this temperature, not only are there benefits reaped from higher efficiency engines, but the weight penalty of cooling equipment is lifted. NASA's most immediate benefit from this proposed and other related research relates to advanced propulsion and power generation, for example the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program. In addition, as composites become more ubiquitous in ever more demanding NASA applications such as high performance structures, the demand for coated fibers is likely to increase. A generic, material-agnostic platform for fast fiber coating is of considerable value to future NASA composite development efforts.","In-situ coating of disparate fibers affects a wide variety of composites applications. In the case of SiC fiber with dual Boron Nitride/Silicon Carbide coatings, the most important applications include commercial jet engines and turbo-machinery-based power generation equipment. Both require higher operating temperatures in order to reach ever higher fuel efficiencies, and the consensus is that SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites are the path to that future; the BN/SiC coating system is a highly desired element of this particular CMC. Other non-NASA applications of the proposed generic fiber coating process may well include advanced structural composites, where new high performance fibers are used in next-gen materials systems. The process may also have value in CMC tooling applications, where fracture toughness and wear resistance are achieved through a tungsten carbide composite, for example. The ability to apply fiber coatings during, or just after fiber production, improves the cost/benefit ratio for composites production.",Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Processing Methods

Comparable progress has also been achieved in CFD as an engineering design tool.  Highly accurate hydrocarbon chemistry is now desired for simulating gas turbine combustors and automobile engines to better predict both performance and pollutant emissions.  Newer and more accurate CFD techniques like Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are being used more as computational power increases along with the demand for better flow predictions.  Unfortunately, using large, detailed chemical mechanisms to simulate real turbulent combustion devices is problematic due to the sheer computational burden of the added chemistry.  As a result, chemistry mechanisms employing a large number of chemical species are currently only feasible to run in the simplest of flow geometries, and only the simplest and least accurate chemistry models are currently tractable to run in LES CFD codes.  We propose using a unique neural network approach to create a fast and accurate species source term function that could alleviate both of these problems.","Incorporating fast reacting flow chemistry into LES calculations would represent an enabling technology and would be of great interest to NASA and the rest of the CFD community.  Several groups at NASA would benefit from our project; NASA Glenn Research Center is developing the National Combustion Code (NCC) to aid in the design of rocket and gas turbine aircraft engines, while Wind-US, and VULCAN (developed at NASA-Langley), are two other NASA reacting flow CFD codes that could benefit from this research. The ability to accurately predict performance of hypersonic airbreathing systems burning higher hydrocarbons would be immediately useful.","The US Air Force, GE Aircraft Engines, Aerojet, Pratt & Whitney-Rocketdyne, and Rolls-Royce are all major players in the field of airbreathing and rocket engine design and have expressed a high level of interest in development of high-fidelity engine design tools like reacting flow LES.  Problems with combustion stability, for example, often appear late in an engine development program and can be quite difficult and costly to fix, but could be detected early enough to change inexpensively with high-fidelity computational tools.  Other potential applications of our technology include better rocket plume simulations to more accurately predict radar and infrared signatures and base heating loads, industrial chemical processes, and automobile engine design to help reduce pollutant formation.","Atmospheric Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Characterizing aircraft particle emissions is required to improve aircraft combustor design and aircraft operating practices.  Aircraft particle emissions are a complex mixture of soot and semi-volatile material, primarily inhabiting sizes smaller than 100 nm.  New instruments are required to characterize aircraft particle emissions.  We propose to build a new instrument for sensitive (>200 ng m-3 on a 1 Hz cycle) measurements of particle sulfate.  The key instrument component will be a tunable infrared diode absorption spectrometer (TILDAS).  Compared to existing sulfate measurement instruments, the TILDAS-sulfate instrument will be able to reject NO interferences, a key capability required for aircraft exhaust applications.  Prior to reaching the TILDAS, gas phase SO2 will be removed using an acid gas denuder and particle sulfate will be converted to SO2 in a quartz oven. By running the TILDAS-sulfate in tandem with a commercial differential mobility analyzer, we anticipate obtaining size resolved sulfate mass loadings (10 size bins, from 10 nm to several hundred nm).  Phase I tasks include evaluating acid gas denuder and SO2-to-sulfate technologies, determining the instrument detection limits, demonstrating instrument discrimination against NO and other interferences, and demonstrating the use of the instrument to characterize simulated aircraft exhaust gas.","The primary application of the proposed TILDAS-sulfate instrument will be characterization of aircraft particle emissions.  NASA has sponsored a number of major aircraft particle characterization tests, including the three APEX experiments and the AAFEX experiment.  These measurement activities have contributed to a growing understanding of aircraft exhaust particles.  However, despite substantial effort, many questions remain.  The most important outstanding question is the relative contribution of soot and semi-volatile particles to the overall particle mass emissions loading.  Depending on the engine, fuel, and operating conditions, semi-volatile mass loadings vary from almost zero to more than 100 mg kg-1.  A second outstanding question is the conversion efficiency of SO2 to SO3.  By directly measuring particle bound sulfate  and with limited restrictions on the particle size that can be detected  the TILDAS-sulfate instrument will help answer these two important outstanding questions faced by NASA.","NASA is one of several U.S. stakeholders in the aircraft particle emissions community.  FAA, EPA, SERDP, U.S. Air Force, airport operators, and engine manufacturers all have a stake in understanding aircraft particle emissions  and all of these are potential consumers of the TILDAS-sulfate instrument and its data.  In addition to aircraft exhaust characterization, sulfate aerosol makes an important contribution to global climate forcing.  Moreover, sulfuric acid has been shown to be a key component in atmospheric nucleation events.  Improved instruments are required for rapid, size- and composition resolved measurements of sulfate particles.  Current instruments are inadequate for characterizing particles smaller than 50 nm, suffer severe interferences from other atmospheric gases, lack composition resolution, lack size resolution, or lack the required sensitivity.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)"

In this SBIR project, CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) will team up with Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories (GTL) to develop a hybrid approach by combining CFD capabilities with a systems-level instability modeling approach, the latter based on the Universal Combustion Device Stability (UCDS) process.  These capabilities will be used to quantify the effects of finite-rate chemistry and turbulence-chemistry interactions on combustion instabilities. In Phase I, feasibility of the proposed approach will be demonstrated by combining 2-D Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes and Large Eddy Simulation computations with the UCDS framework. In Phase II, the instability analysis will be enhanced by coupling: (1) 3-D CFD analysis; and (2) Improved UCDS process with more accurate treatment of boundary conditions and the flame.  The proposed approach will enable an accurate combustion instability analysis of rocket motors, gas turbine combustors, and ramjet and scramjet engines.","The model developed in this SBIR project will be extremely useful in identifying the potential sources of combustion instability, and ways to suppress them. The tools developed will allow mitigation of instability problems in the design-phase, eliminating expensive testing needed when combustion instabilities occur in engine testing.  The methods developed under this project will have wide ranging applications at NASA, including design of propulsion devices such as solid rocket motors, liquid rocket engines and gas turbine combustors  important in the design of the Heavy Lift Launch System, In-space propulsion systems, numerous planetary spacecraft missions, etc. The instability analysis methodology developed in this SBIR project can also be applied to high-speed combustion devices such as ramjet and scramjet engines, as the method combines the key advantages of both sufficiently detailed CFD analysis and accurate system-level modeling paradigm. In this respect, the tool will be useful to NASA's Hypersonics Program.","The tool developed will also be useful to a number of industries, including gas turbine manufacturers for civilian energy and aviation applications. The tool will also be useful to the Air Force in the design of propulsion devices such as the engine for the Joint Strike Fighter.

Laser-induced luminescence from the particles will be measured to obtain temperature from its effects on luminescence lifetime. Velocity will be obtained simultaneously from the same particles using conventional particle image velocimetry (PIV). Each of the two diagnostics will employ a separate CCD camera that captures a pair of images separated by a short delay. For the thermometry technique, pixel intensity ratios of the delayed to the undelayed images will be related to temperature via a calibration function. In the PIV technique, particle displacements between the images will be obtained using conventional interrogation window techniques with cross-correlation. The proposed diagnostic is expected to enable spatially and temporally correlated measurements of two key variables in combustion modeling that cannot be obtained in most high temperatures flows using currently available methods.

However, the operational flexibility of these vehicles is limited by the performance of the propulsion system.  In gas turbine systems low temperatures and pressures at the combustor inlet are of concern for combustion stability and efficiency at high altitudes.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to assess the feasibility of developing a high performance airbreathing combustor for hydrogen-fueled very high altitude aircraft by promoting stable combustion using thermally stable catalytic reactor technology.  Our combustor concept baselines the use of strontium-substituted hexaaluminate catalyst supports, which are resilient to temperatures greater than 1500 K.  In Phase I an active catalyst that provides high reactivity with hydrogen at representative conditions will be identified through laboratory testing.  An empirical model of catalyst reactivity will be developed and integrated with a reactor model to produce a conceptual design of a full scale combustor for a defined very high altitude gas turbine system.  The catalytic rector that will be developed through this effort represents a new, enabling technology that will dramatically increase the flexibility of aerospace vehicles.","NASA has shown recent interest in the use of hydrogen fuel as a means of substantially reducing the carbon emissions from commercial aircraft.  A potential problem with a hydrogen-based system is that nitrogen oxides emissions may be difficult to control.  The thermally stable catalytic combustor technology that will be developed through this effort may provide an approach to control the NOx emissions from a hydrogen-based aircraft platform.  In addition, this technology provides a capability to extend the operating range of hydrogen-based gas turbine based propulsion systems to very high altitudes that may enable new aircraft platforms for earth and atmospheric science initiatives at NASA.  Additionally, this catalyst technology could find use in other systems of interest to NASA that operate at high altitudes, such as supersonic/hypersonic vehicles or balloon-based systems, and may require additional thrust, power, or a high heat source.","The proposed thermally stable catalytic combustor technology is a key to providing combustion stability in hydrogen-based gas turbine based propulsion systems operating at very high altitudes.  Such propulsion systems are critical to a multitude of missions employing unmanned aerial vehicles.  These systems are of significant interest to the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  In addition, this technology may have potential to provide emissions reduction in stationary gas turbine systems used for power generation.  This is of interest to the U. S.

Such models are inherently data parallel, and much faster solutions can be obtained using low-cost graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware without loss of accuracy.  This proposal describes development of a user-friendly software toolkit that facilitates implementing detailed or reduced fuel chemistry solvers directly onto GPUs to substantially accelerate CFD simulation runtimes.  The approach is significant because it provides a cost-effective path to substantially reduce the wall-clock times currently bottlenecking high-fidelity combustion simulations.  It accommodates the incorporation of self-contained, real fuel kinetic mechanisms and validated chemistry solvers, written using standard GPU-recognized program language extensions such as CUDA and OpenCL, for use in CFD analyses with minimal end-user code modifications.  Using inputs that are Chemkin-format compatible, the proposed software toolkit will generate portable, GPU-enabled kernels that can be directly compiled into existing CFD codes, such as the National Combustion Code (NCC), to accelerate detailed combustion simulations for improved design support.","This product directly supports NASA's goal of significantly improving air-breathing engine designs to increase combustion efficiency and yield cleaner exhaust emissions. Reaching this goal requires use of CFD-based parametric design studies with validated, extended chemical kinetic mechanisms capable of critically evaluating design concepts affecting ignition sensitivities and combustion stability.  The end-product will provide the necessary automation and acceleration capabilities needed to readily model real fuels such as JP-8 and JP-10 and support design decisions with practical turnaround times.  Our work will directly integrate with ongoing NASA activities improving runtime performance and accuracy of the National Combustion Code.  Additionally, this product is readily extensible for use in hydrocarbon scramjet combustion applications, where modeling of critical kinetic pathways is needed to assess ignition and flameholding sensitivities.","The commercial market for this computational framework is large and encompasses the broad markets of gas turbine combustor and rocket fuel injector designers. Marketing to HCCI/diesel/internal combustion engine manufacturers and other industrial applications, e.g., incinerators and furnaces are also of interest since they depend on efficient and accurate flowfield predictions to evaluate concepts with promise of cleaner emissions and robust combustion dynamics.  Difficulties can arise in both implementing a detailed kinetic model in a standard CFD code and in obtaining a solution involving potentially dozens of species and hundreds of reactions within a reasonable timeframe.  The product of this SBIR effort directly targets this market with provision of user-friendly, GPU-accelerated routines that address this need.

Further, the modeling of composite structures becomes more and more important since many new vehicle designs incorporate increased amount of composite structural components due to weight specific advantages of composites. Thus, we propose to develop techniques that will allow the prediction of noise in the interior of an enclosure such as aircraft due to the transmission of turbulent boundary layer loading in the presence of composite structural components. This innovative Hybrid Element Method (HEM) solution tool for mid-frequency analysis, which utilizes elements of DEA, together with conventional low frequency FEM tools and high frequency EFEM tools, will provide a unified framework that is applicable for the solution of full frequency spectrum vibroacoustic prediction of nonuniform aerospace structures including metallic/composite configurations, accurately and efficiently.","The development of space vehicles and space stations requires the prediction of vibration levels to asses the fatigue life of critical components and noise levels to assess the comfort and functionality levels of crew members. The software product developed as part of the proposed project will enable NASA to effectively evaluate and apply noise and vibration control procedures spanning the entire frequency spectrum. It will also substantially reduce the effort involved in the design of products since the proposed development is based on finite element method that is already used extensively for low frequency noise and vibration analysis. Since low frequency (FEM), mid frequency (HEM) and high frequency (EFEM) analyses can be performed using mostly the same database, the modeling effort associated will be substantially reduced. The software will also enhance NASA's ability to evaluate the acoustic environment and resulting vibration in the payload bay of launch vehicle, diffuse sound field excitation on payloads during rocket launch and ground qualification, and structural integrity of airframe. Manufacturers of aircraft engines and components will also find the software useful for analysis and design.","The proposed development will extend and enhance the computational modeling capabilities in many industries such as automotive, naval, heavy equipment and consumer products.  Customers equate quality of a product with the sound the product makes. As a result of elevated demand for quieter products from customers together with the increased government regulations, manufactures of products with noise problem in all industries are searching for effective ways to make products with improved noise characteristics. For example, in automotive industry, the increased use of multi-media and telemetric devices demands quieter vehicle interiors and the manufactures and suppliers of interior products not only need to consider functionality, but also the noise control capability of the products. Consequently, there is increasing demand for tools based on computer simulation that can be used to guide design at the early design stage. In addition to interior noise prediction and optimization, the software can be adapted to evaluate and improve radiated noise from engines, exhaust, tires, etc. It can be used to evaluate and improve consumer products such as compressors, air conditioners, hairdryers, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines.","Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Composites; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures"

During the conceptual design phase there is no time for developing detailed simulation models and decisions are typically made either by using low fidelity models or existing data and regression models.  However, the decisions made during the conceptual design phase greatly affect the performance of the aircraft and the associated cost, and typically the majority of the cost is locked during very early stages of the design process.  Usually the sound insulation requirements of a passenger cabin are met after the outer mold line of the aircraft and the design of the fuselage structure have been completed and this approach adds weight to the design.  Ideally the structural-acoustic concerns should enter the design cycle early and be considered along with other main design disciplines.  During the early design stages of an aircraft the interior noise performance of different fuselage configurations must be evaluated based on the following information: length, cross sectional stations as a function of longitudinal location, main interior arrangements, spacing and size of stiffeners and stringers, thickness and material properties of insulation blankets, thickness and material properties of the fuselage and of the trim panels, and the type of acoustic treatment placed in the interior.  The acoustic performance expressed in terms of noise reduction comprises the metric for assessing the aircraft performance for interior noise considerations.   The proposed project will develop an easy to use, physics based, computational capability that can provide fast an assessment for the interior noise of either conventional or novel aircraft during the early stages of the design process.  It will also allow engaging information from multi-scale simulations for designing quiet composite materials with increased damping and reduced radiation efficiency characteristics.","Structural-acoustic concerns are present in aircraft structures, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, since they are directly related with occupant comfort and noise induced vibration on payloads and electronic equipment.  In all of these areas decisions made early in the design are critical for the performance and the cost of the system.  Currently, structural-acoustic concerns are typically addressed late in the design cycle when the structural configuration has been finalized.  Bringing structural acoustic simulations early in the design cycle will offer cost and weight savings.  Therefore, the proposed developments will be useful to all NASA groups interested in reducing weight and cost when designing aircraft, launch vehicles, and spacecraft.","Interior noise concerns are present in civil aircraft design since the structural-acoustic performance is directly related with the perceived product quality and the occupant comfort.

In this proposal we will demonstrate how Wavelet Stochastic Estimation (WSE) is the most optimal method for correlating the source region to the sound field when using a microphone array and Particle Image Velocimetry.  WSE first transforms the far-field pressure signal into the wavelet domain which then enables both temporal and frequency information to be correlated with the flow field.  By adding the frequency information to the correlations, it becomes easier to extract the contribution from the large-scale structures and thus relate their dynamics to noise generation. We also demonstrate how WSE can be used with flow structure identification methods, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), to further improve the link between the sound field and the turbulent flow field. The proposed technology supports the Fundamental Aeronautics Program by improving noise prediction and measurement methods.  The technology will be available for both subsonic and supersonic vehicles, with particular emphasis on noise sources generated from shear flows.","The Wavelet Stochastic Estimation method has the ability to support the Fundamental Aeronautics Program by improving noise prediction and measurement methods for subsonic and supersonic vehicles, including jet, and airframe noise sources. We particularly address the need for innovative source identification techniques for engine (e.g., fan, jet, combustor, or turbine noise) and for airframe (e.g., landing gear, high lift systems) noise sources, including turbulence details related to flow-induced noise typical of jets, separated flow regions, vortices, shear layers, etc. The Wavelet Stochastic Estimation method for source identification will be demonstrated in a shear flow surrounding an exhausting subsonic jet.  However, the method is directly applicable to any flow-induced noise since the sources for jets, separated flows, vortices and shear layers can all be measured using PIV and their sound fields can be measured using microphone arrays.  We also believe the development of the current tools could expand into the structures community since the transfer of vibrations would use the same concept as the transfer of sound.","Wavelet Stochastic Estimation is an analytical tool for optimizing the transfer function from one set of data to a second set of data.  For acoustics, the first set of data is often the source field and the second set of data is the sound field.  However, any application looking to understand the transfer of data from one region to another would find application with Stochastic Estimation.  Also, using our advanced technique would add the benefit of including frequency information in this understanding.  Using Stochastic Estimation for relating the turbulent structures in a shear layer to the radiate sound would find non-NASA commercial applications with GE Aviation and GE Global Research, Boeing, Air Force, and NAVY to name a few.  The ability to use this method with both experimental and computational databases further demonstrates the flexibility and feasibility of this product.  Validation of computational databases with experimental databases is often done with time-averaged quantities. The WSE method could be used to compare the large-scale dynamics captured in a computational database to an experimental database.","Aerodynamics; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)"

While the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) market has mature products that solve a large portion of problems faced by practicing engineers, these tools are often inadequate for fast transient, multi-scale numerical problems such as highly resolved turbulence, vortex shedding and combustion instability where rapid, small scale local phenomena can be overwhelmed by numerical dissipation. Many research and commercial solvers perform sufficient spatial resolution, but use insufficient explicit or low order implicit temporal resolution. Higher order explicit temporal schemes are not always feasible when modeling turbulence, can be severely limited by the time step size, and are less efficient than even low-order implicit methods. In the proposed Phase I effort, a previously developed high order implicit time integration formulation, tested up to 11th order accuracy, will be extracted from an existing solver and interfaced with an independent finite-volume solver to prove the feasibility of providing decoupled time integration for existing numerical codes. In Phase II, the time integration formulation will be implemented in a software framework and tested with readily available, popular numerical codes","Many NASA scientists and engineers are involved in the development and use of advanced numerical analysis codes for applications in physics, engineering, biotechnology, etc. This project will develop and deliver a tool for incorporating implicit higher order differencing into these computational codes, allowing high order temporal solutions without developing a new solver.

This shock-induced pressure gradient is a common factor for both flow separation in supersonic inlets and high stagnation pressure losses on transonic wings, factors which are known to reduce performance and efficiency.  These affects can be corrected with appropriate forms of flow control.  Innovative Technology Applications Company (ITAC) and University of Notre Dame (UND) propose the use of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) plasma actuators to control the affects of SWBLIs for two types of problems, one involving boundary layer separation and the other transonic wave drag.  We propose to use plasma actuators near the region of the SWBLI to eliminate or delay the onset of separation in supersonic inlets while using plasma-based shock control methods to reduce the stagnation pressure losses on transonic airfoils.  The advantages of the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) actuators are that they are fully electronic, contain no moving parts, surface mountable, minimally intrusive, can be turned off when not needed, and electrically re-configurable for optimal control in dynamic flow conditions.","Potential NASA applications for the proposed EHD/DBD plasma actuators include lift enhancement and drag reduction on aircraft wings, high angle-of-attack operation using plasma actuators as lifting devices, enhanced performance and efficiency of propulsion (S-ducts, inlets) and aerodynamic (control surfaces) systems at both on- and off-design conditions, and improved cycle efficiency of NASA's air-breathing propulsion systems.","Potential non-NASA applications for the EHD/DBD plasma actuators include design of revolutionary subsonic and hypersonic aerospace vehicles for commercial and military (DoD) purposes, use in turbomachinery systems, noise-control on landing gears of commercial aircraft, design of smart wind turbine rotor blades, drag reduction on ground vehicles, smart helicopter rotor blades, tip-casing clearance flow control for reduced turbine losses, control of flow surge and stall in compressors, and turbulent transition control experiments.",Aerodynamics

In the UGKS  solver, the BGK model of Boltzmann equation is solved directly with finite volume method based on the Discrete Ordinate Method (DOM). In the UGKS computation the convective terms and collision term is computed in one step with a multi-scale scheme without splitting. The UGKS also closely couples the update of macroscopic conservative variables with the update of microscopic gas distribution functions in one step. At the continuum flow regime, the UGKS recovers the Navier-Stokes solutions with much larger time step than regular direct BGK solver where UGKS essentially becomes a shock-capture scheme. In the rarefied flow regime, UGKS recovers the direct BGK method up to the free molecular flow. With the UGKS, the jet-like flow can be simulated with a unique flow solver. Furthermore, a two-species chemical reaction will be incorporated in UGKS. The UGKS will be applied to various test cases whose results will be validated with others' computational results and available experimental data to verify its accuracy and computational efficiency.","The developed Unified GasKinetic (UGKS) solver can be used for hypersonic applications from continuum to rarefied flow regimes for thermochemical nonequilibrium effects up to ionization/plasma flows and including chemical reaction. The UGKS solver can generate accurate aerodynamic forces and heat rates. Typical applications are for launch vehicles in space access, entry command module and ballutes in atmospheric entry; plume flows in chemical engines or rockets.","Potential Non-NASA commercial applications are supported by aerospace and non-aerospace domains and provide industry for rarefied gas flows application with a wide range of Kn number and Mach number. Such examples for defense industry include hypersonic flows around missiles and rocket nozzles.  For civil industry, UGKS applications include aerosol effects on weather prediction, materials processing inside vacuum chamber especially for the semi-conductor industry, air purification with tools made of fine fibers such as masks, and rarefied gas flows associated with MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) such as various gas sensors. ZONA will extend the proposed UGKS and package them into a commercial software.

The technical merit and feasibility of the technology will be demonstrated in Phase I through a series of verification and validation tests that utilize both computational and wind tunnel data in constructing aerodynamic models for the Orion launch abort system (LAS).  Aerodynamic models provide inputs to the guidance, navigation, and control system. The proposed software will enable performance predictions over a wide range of operational conditions through the fusion of data from multiple sources including high-dimensional computational simulations, wind tunnel tests, and flight tests.  The software will also facilitate uncertainty analyses to determine the propagation of variability in inputs into output variability and sensitivity analyses to identify critical design and modeling parameters and operational variables.  Complex systems like the LAS are designed with a mixture of heterogeneous data, and uncertainties in the data can be a critical factor in evaluating designs.  The objective is to develop assimilation methods that reduce the number of expensive wind tunnel tests and CFD simulations required during system design while maintaining and improving the quality of aerodynamic models and systematically assessing uncertainties.","The proposed software is enabling technology for the design of vehicles that fly safely through any atmosphere at any speed, a stated goal of NASA's Aeronautic Research Mission Directorate (ARMD).  The tool fits into ARMD's four-level approach to technology development:  solving aeronautic challenges for a wide range of aerospace vehicles with modeling methods that integrate all phases of the design process:  simulation, ground testing, and flight testing.  The design process for aircraft and launch vehicles involves almost every engineering discipline and relies on a mixture of laboratory testing, computational modeling, and final performance evaluations.  Integrating these types of analysis and testing will draw from the strength and offset the weakness of each.  The software framework will be designed to ultimately interface with models and test data from all of the Fundamental Aeronautics subtopics in the SBIR solicitation, providing the conduit for synergistic development of new and fundamental technologies.","The proposed project will focus on aerodynamic models and launch-abort system design, but the software is applicable in numerous products both inside and outside the aerospace market.  An inclusive framework will be developed to accommodate multiple disciplines in the future including aeroservoelastic, aerothermodynamic, and structural analyses.

Tao Systems and CUBRC propose to develop a wide-bandwidth, thin-film heat transfer sensor system that quantifies the high frequency SWTBLI at duplicated flight conditions. This effort combines Tao Systems' high frequency-response/high-sensitivity electronics and signal processing techniques with the unique expertise of CUBRC in high-speed, high-enthalpy flows to obtain spatiotemporal information for the development of physics-based turbulence models.","In aeronautics, heat flux sensors will help meet measurement challenges in providing validation and verification of CFD codes for heat transfer. Development of reliable turbulence modeling and CFD codes depend on making precise aerothermodynamic measurements of heat flux on various test models. NASA ARMD specifically cites prediction of transition and flow separation as high-priority objectives for the future of aeronautics, and heat transfer measurements is a key tool in providing insight into the dynamics of flow phenomena in SWTBLI regions. Specific applications of interest include SWTBLI at high enthalpies (flap forces and Scramjet), laminar/turbulent transition (crossflow instability), and unsteady separated/reattaching backshell flows on capsules.","Apart from the military hypersonic applications, high-sensitivity, high-bandwidth heat transfer instrumentation would be useful for general spatiotemporally accurate measurement of temperature and heat flux. The electronics could be used  for measurements in turbomachinery (turbine blades) and for pulse detonation engines. One interesting commercial application where high-temperature heat flux measurement would be useful is fuel cell research, in which spatiotemporal heat flux is critical for performance evaluation.

The  goal is to integrate the now proven partially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) method for unsteady flow simulations with the most advanced closure models for compressibility, high-enthalpy (flow - thermodynamics coupling) and  non-equilibrium (flow - chemistry coupling) effects. The PANS model has been established as a reliable model for computing separation in low and high speed regimes in two recently conclude NASA NRA projects -- 1. RANS and PANS modeling of hypersonic turbulent mixing environment;  2. Modeling of strongly separated flows with the PANS bridging method. The current proposal is to incorporate further hypersonic effect closures into PANS. Physics-based closure models for flow-thermochemistry interactions have been under development in Girimaji's group at Texas A&M under AFOSR MURI funding -- Transition and Turbulence modeling in non-thermochemical-equilibrium hypersonic flows. Important closure model building blocks for hypersonic processes are now available from the above fundamental research efforts. The combination of PANS and these advanced high-speed models will lead to a unique capability for computing hypersonic flow separation with ablation, chemistry and compressibility effects. For Phase I, we propose a logical sequence of verification-validation computations to demonstrate the potential of the various individual closures in separated high-speed high-enthalpy flows. While in-house codes are available for the proposed development, we will also consider using any of the NASA codes: USM3D, OVERFLOW, VULCAN or any of the other codes suggested by the grantor. Subsequent work (Phase II) will focus on the assembly of the individual components and development of an unique high-fidelity computational capability for hypersonic vehicle design, testing and development.","The proposed method will lead to a state-of-the-art computational design tool for hypersonic flows with high-enthalpy, ablation and chemistry effects for internal and external flows.

This sensor has applications for measurements in gas-turbine machinery, shock tubes, shock-boundary layer experiments, high-enthalpy hypersonic flows, and in plasma-laden flows such as on reentry vehicles. The output from the sensor is wirelessly transmitted and can be remotely demodulated and converted into the constituent mean and fluctuating components.

The new aero-effected flight control will be achieved using output feedback adaptive control of distributed bleed across aerodynamic surfaces, and is particularly suited for high-altitude long endurance vehicles.  The large-area air bleed is driven by the inherent pressure differences in flight across the pressure and suction wing surface, and is regulated by low-power, surface-integrated louver valves.  Our previous basic research in adaptive control has stressed the ability to model and cancel the effect of uncertainty in output regulation.  We also have developed methods for adaptation in the presence of nonlinear actuation, which includes such effects as actuator saturation.  These tools are currently being employed in the study of active flow control using synthetic jet actuation, and will be adapted to the problems that are unique to improving aeroelastic performance and active damping of airframe-propulsion-structure interactions using distributed bleed.  Phase I will focus on advancing the state of the art in output feedback adaptive control, and demonstration of the capability of aero-bleed to control the dynamic modes of a flexible lifting surface.  These efforts will be integrated in Phase-II by using an adaptive controller to regulate a flexible wing flown in three degrees of freedom in a wind tunnel experiment, using an existing traverse mechanism.  Another option is to use Atair Aerospace's LEAPP vehicle to flight test a highly flexible wing design.  Additional Phase-II and Phase-III transition possibilities include coordinated research efforts with Boeing related to the DARPA Vulture vehicle, and/or with AeroVironment related to the Global Observer vehicle.","The most immediate NASA application would be to Global Observer.  This vehicle recently completed its first test flight that took it to an altitude of 4,000 feet.  Ultimately Global Observer is intended to function as a high altitude long endurance vehicle.  As this program progresses, active aeroelastic and vibration control could easily become an enabling technology.  Adaptive output feedback control design could be added to the existing flight control system as an augmenting element to mitigate the effects of modeling error and possible failures that can occur when undergoing a long endurance flight.  Active bleed control could also be explored for augmenting the existing aero and propulsive means of flight control.  NASA has recently funded a variety of adaptive flight control studies under their Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control effort.  To date, all of the adaptive methods that have been explored under this program assume the availability of full state feedback.  Control of seroservoelastic modes implies that the full state is not available for feedback, and moreover that the full dimension of the plant is unknown.  Advancements in adaptive output feedback design contemplated for this effort would ultimately address issues related to control of unmodeled dynamics as well.  These advancements would also permit application of adaptive control theory to distributed and decentralized control of large and complex flexible space structures.","The most immediate non-NASA application would be to the DARPA Vulture vehicle.  Boeing has recently been awarded a 1-year program for both sub- and full-scale conceptual vehicle design and a system requirements review.  There are other department-of-defense programs that could benefit from this effort such as the Zephyr Joint Capabilities Technology demonstrator.  Atair is also interested in the development of an active means of flow control for applications to their line of guided parafoils.  Guided parafoil control currently makes use of electrically driven left and right servos to pull lines that are attached to strategic points on the canopy.  While effective, this approach to control has a number of drawbacks that limit performance in terms of terminal accuracy.  The most obvious limitation is that it does not provide a direct means of controlling glide slope.  This means that guidance can only be achieved though banked turns since there is no independent means of controlling rate of descent.  The proposed development of distributed bleed control could in concept replace the need for conventional servo actuation with embedded active control devices, and provide an independent means of glide slope control.",Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)

The integration of the SR-CATS instrument with MAC's full air data solution (airspeed, angle of attack and angle of sideslip), a MAC technology already demonstrated in-flight, will be explored. This proposal will focus on combining these capabilities into a practical solution.  MAC's direct-detection UV LIDAR technology uses molecular backscatter and so does not require aerosols, as required by many competing approaches.","SR-CATS will allow NASA aircraft the benefit of having a clear-air turbulence detection system for predictive gust alleviation control and an optical air data system in one package, suitable for general use by NASA aircraft as well as for flight research concerning clear-air turbulence and scientific studies of atmospheric processes.  Ground-based uses include measuring wind speed and direction simultaneously with air temperature and density while also detecting and characterizing shear and turbulence.  Potential uses include wind shear detection for space launches, wake vortices detection and characterization for airports, and climate change studies.","Clear-air turbulence represents a significant safety hazard as well as passenger-comfort issue for the commercial airline industry.  The proposed SR-CATS system has application not only as part of an automatic gust alleviation system, but also as an air data solution that alleviates many problems with current pitot air data.  This capability also makes SR-CATS extremely attractive for military aircraft, including fixed and rotary wing, high altitude and high dynamic, manned and unmanned, and even high-altitude airships.  Information on winds near aircraft, if downlinked and compiled, will also be of significant value to forecasters, especially from aircraft flying over areas (oceans, etc.) where balloon radiosonde releases and other wind measurements are sparse or non-existent.  NOAA and NASA identify the lack of more comprehensive wind-profile data as a major unmet data need for improving the accuracy of weather forecasts.  Inadequate atmospheric data (wind speed, direction, temperature and density) also has a significant negative impact along the entire wind energy value chain, including site assessment, operational farms, turbine control, and grid integration. Turbulence and shear are primary contributing factors to higher than expected turbine maintenance and repair costs.  Finally, military applications for artillery and munitions delivery, precision airdrop, and aircraft take-off/landing on ships can benefit from SR-CATS technology.",Air Transportation & Safety; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)

Efficient, lightweight composite laminate structural design requires highly integrated structural analyses on the laminate and stiffened panel levels, while incorporating manufacturing processes and limitations. Laminate optimization is only one of the many design variables that need to be considered simultaneously in aircraft design. Yet true system level OML surface optimization is an extremely challenging problem that can only be made tractable by reducing the problem into three sequential gates: ply count compatibility, layup sequencing, and ply layout size and shape. The innovative approach proposed solves all three of these seemingly intractable gates and in so doing provides synergistic optimization of ply drops and adds and reduced manufacturing ply processing steps (drawing part numbers) along with laminate sizing to damage tolerance material allowables. To achieve the highest level of design fidelity requires iterative communication with the designer's CAD tool and ply zone mapping tools.

The development of a coupled viscous/inviscid analysis tool for powered-lift airfoils and wings is presented.  In this context, powered-lift airfoils are taken to be airfoils under the influence of a high-energy jet, and include jet-flaps, augmenter-flaps, upper surface blowing, and circulation control airfoils.  This methodology consists of coupling a viscous jet analysis, using a finite-difference approach, with a potential flow panel calculation.  The method uses an iterative procedure to capture the effects of viscous mixing and determine the correct jet shape. The goal in developing 2-D powered-lift predictions is to couple this analysis with a pre-existing modified Weissinger method to accurately predict 3-D wing performance based on sectional data.  In this manner, high-lift wing characteristics can be determined at a fraction of the computational cost of CFD.

No other air vehicle relies on the propulsion system to provide these functions through a transmission system employing a single critical load path without duplication or redundancy.  Thus it is critically important to monitor the drivetrain components in rotorcraft propulsion systems in order to detect the onset of damage or abnormal conditions. We propose to develop an analyzer for rotorcraft health monitoring.  Our proposed device, an oil debris monitor that relies on optical means to monitor the fluid content, will provide a means to monitor the gear and bearing wear that is common in rotating machinery.  This device will be based on fluid analyzers previously developed for industry.  Our sensor will provide a means to detect the onset of failure using optical techniques.  It will be more sensitive than electromagnetic sensors.  In addition it will be able to detect all debris, metallic and non-metallic, including those generated by hybrid ceramic bearings, and will be able to do this even in the presence of air bubbles.  Unlike other optical sensors, our device will be fabricated from a glass monolith and will, by its very nature, stay aligned forever, even when submitted to severe vibrations and shocks.  Within the glass monolith our sensor will integrate the equivalent of two optical instruments, one optimized for large millimeter-size debris and one for smaller micron-size debris.  Algorithms will be developed to merge the data provided by the two optical channels and to present a simple cohesive health assessment.","Studies indicate that failure of the propulsion system is the primary reason for vehicle-factor related accidents. In order to reduce these accidents a number of diagnostic techniques have been developed to detect damage and abnormal conditions of the dynamic mechanical components of rotorcrafts. A majority of this technology focuses on monitoring the gears, bearings and driveshafts of the main transmission system. Oil debris sensors can be used to detect and characterize bearing debris in oil and allow for tracking of bearing health. While commercially available electromagnetic sensors can detect metallic debris, they often cannot detect the non-metallic debris associated with components such as the hybrid ceramic bearings now found in rotorcrafts. Further they have severe limitations as to the size of the debris they can detect. Optical sensors have high sensitivity, and detect non-metallic debris, including ceramic, but they rapidly lose alignment when subjected to shocks and vibrations; they are delicate, require frequent recalibration and are expensive. Our proposed optical oil sensor will be fabricated from a single glass monolith and will never lose its optical alignment. It will have a capability to detect small and large debris, including metallic and non-metallic debris, using an optical sensing modality. Further its will be inexpensive. These claims are based on previous experience developing various fluid sensors, including hydraulic sensors for heavy machinery.","Oil debris sensors are used to detect bearing debris in oil and allow for tracking of bearing health.  These devices allow for maintenance procedures based on condition, a preferable and less expensive approach to the traditional schedule based approach.We are proposing to fabricate and commercialize a small, extremely robust and inexpensive fluid debris optical monitor with both a particle sizing and counting capability.  Our advanced debris monitor will support improved aircraft safety and allow scheduling of oil samples based on indicated need instead of at predetermined time and usage points.  This will not only significantly reduce maintenance burden, but will flag failures as they begin to develop.  This will permit remediation as needed to reduce unexpected and expensive downtime.  There are numerous applications for this type of analyzer in industry and the transportation sector.  These markets are much larger than the rotorcraft market.In order to penetrate these markets the fluid analyzer needs to be reliable, inexpensive, require no periodic calibration, and the data provided should be simple to understand.  Present commercial offerings fail to meet all of these criteria.  Translume analyzers will be inexpensive yet sensitive, and will never require realignment.  This combination of factors is made possible by the development at Translume of novel glass microfabrication processes.  Commercialization will be undertaken with commercial partners.",Diagnostics/Prognostics; Lasers (Machining/Materials Processing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)

In a modern gas turbine engine, these temperatures can exceed the blade and disk material limits by 600 oF or more, necessitating both internal and film cooling schemes in addition to the use of thermal barrier coatings. Internal convective cooling is inadequate in many blade locations, and both internal and film cooling approaches can lead to significant performance penalties in the engine. Micro Cooling Concepts has developed a turbine blade cooling concept that provides enhanced internal impingement cooling effectiveness via the use of micro-structured impingement surfaces. These surfaces significantly increase the cooling capability of the impinging flow, as compared to a conventional untextured surface. This approach can be combined with microchannel cooling and external film cooling to tailor the cooling capability per the external heating profile. The cooling system can then be optimized to minimize impact on engine performance.","The proposed Phase I effort directly supports core NASA research efforts in turbine engine development, as well as the multi-agency Verstaile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) initiative.

As combustion engineers push turbine inlet temperatures to new extremes, cooling designers are faced with increasing heat loads and less available coolant usage. Surface cooling techniques such as film cooling have proven invaluable in this quest.   Films generated by forcing the coolant to bleed through a porous substrate have been shown to perform substantially better than discrete film injection in a thermal sense.  However, the associated aerodynamic penalties limit the application.  On the other hand, discretely injected films have drawbacks as well, including non-uniform coolant profiles significant mixing with the hot working fluid, lowering their effectiveness.  Spectral Energies, LLC and the University of Central Florida propose a novel, low risk approach to surface cooling wherein traditional discrete film holes are embedded within a transpiring porous strip.  The motivation behind this approach is multi-faceted, with the ultimate goal of developing a cooling arrangement which possesses the thermo-mechanical benefits of a transpired film, the aerodynamic benefits of discrete film injection, and mixing characteristics that are some compromise of the two.","NASA is a direct user and developer of turbomachines for various applications, primarily for propulsion.  As improved efficiency and improved durability are the goals of NASA researchers, the successful implementation of this technology will provide a direct method of achieving both.  The proposed innovation will provide increases in efficiency and reductions in fuel burn, through the ability to handle increased working gas temperatures with minimal coolant usage; and durability through the reduction of hot streaks associated with traditional film cooling methods.  Additionally, applications such as the film cooling of rocket nozzles will also benefit from the successful implementation of this technology.","In addition to NASA applications, all users and developers of gas turbines will benefit from the ability to achieve improved heat load handling and durability.  This includes gas turbines for propulsion (the airline and marine industries) as well as for power generation.  The public will then directly benefit through reduced electricity and travel costs.  Additionally, as the private sector is now heavily involved in the development of space technologies, high efficiency and durable hot gas components will be applicable to a large number of up and coming private industries.  ",Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Surface Propulsion

One NASA vision for future transport-sized aircraft includes the blended-wing-body (BWB) platform with embedded, distributed propulsion as a means for increased efficiency and reduced noise. In cruise, embedded propulsion benefits from boundary layer ingestion and wake filling, resulting in high propulsive efficiency. However, several challenges exist, including inlet nozzle design, propulsor design for ingestion of highly non-uniform inflow, and propulsor/airframe support structure optimization. This work proposes a hybrid turboelectric propulsion system incorporating small embedded, distributed cross-flow fans (CFF) for boundary layer control and wake filling, and much larger axial fans for primary thrust. Bringing together the best qualities of both axial and CFF propulsion, a substantial improvement in overall vehicle efficiency is possible. CFD and analytical analyses will be used to investigate the flow field and range of application for such a system. Comparisons will be made with published baseline designs with respect to power requirements, component weights, support structure, and other key parameters.","Upon completion of Phase II, our goal is to have a system capable of inclusion not only within the framework of future BWB transport aircraft, but in others as well. For example, high altitude atmospheric research at altitudes above 80,000 ft would be possible with a cross-flow fan propelled aircraft due to the high lift capability. The large internal volume would provide ample room for sensor packages when compared with standard airplane configurations. With further R&D effort beyond Phase II, this internal cargo volume may be useful for carrying small rocket-based vehicles to 100,000 ft altitude for launch into orbit. A smaller version of this aircraft could potentially be used as a Mars plane, where the primary design criteria are a compact, robust airframe with extremely high lift.","Hand-launchable UAVs represent a key market for the Propulsive Wing, since the high lift and large internal volume of this platform is ideal for carrying sensor packages or munitions for military use. Due to the robust structure and embedded propulsion, the vehicle can also be configured for launch from larger aircraft at cruise altitude and speed. For larger UAVs, high lift and very large internal cargo volume will provide an ideal platform for high latitude and long endurance. Long wingspan versions will be able to fly at altitudes greater than 80,000 feet for a week or more. The substantial cargo volume also offers the possibility of using fuel cell technology. This will provide electric power for distributed CFF or Axial/CFF propulsion, while the embedded propulsion and cold exhaust will help reduce radar cross-section. Another potential application is UAV cargo transport. As an example, a 50 foot wingspan CFF-propelled aircraft with 900 HP of installed power would be capable of flight at 50,000 ft or higher at 250 knots for over 1,000 nm, yet have a takeoff ground roll of 200 feet and be capable of landing in under 100 feet. With the addition of Axial/CFF propulsion, such a vehicle (with appropriately higher power) would be able to travel over twice as fast. Lastly, the platform lends itself to underwater applications, whereby the vehicle produces a downward lift force to counteract buoyancy, and the vectored thrust controls offer a high degree of maneuverability.",Aerodynamics; Atmospheric Propulsion; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)

Phase II research will develop the tools to a level that can be used by NASA researchers in the development of NextGen concepts.","4D trajectories and 4D guidance algorithms have enormous potential to solve several problems in the NAS in an integrated manner resulting in optimal performance. These two can affect improvements in throughput, efficiency and safety. Along, with GPS based navigation and datalink capability, 4D trajectories and 4D guidance systems can define the core of the vastly transformed and improved NextGen air-traffic management system. 4D trajectories and 4D guidance is an inexpensive option to extract the best performance out of the resource constrained NAS in view of projected multi-fold future demand increase. Both these concepts are expected to directly contribute to NASA efforts in designing NextGen concepts both on the ground side and the flight deck side.Trajectory optimization is an area that is of interest to NASA even outside the scope of air traffic management.

The feasibility of implementing one or more optimization algorithms, and potential for further acceleration will be demonstrated on ATM problems of sufficient complexity, which will then form the basis for the Phase II prototype.

Complex, distributed airspace simulations that utilize experimental testbeds (e.g., Multi Aircraft Control System, or MACS) are vital research tools for these projects. However, managing the various complexities and coordination of agent-supported separation assurance can be challenging. This often creates undesired staffing and training requirements, workload, and susceptibility to human error that can disrupt planned scenario events. To address this issue, we propose to develop Artificial Intelligence for Refining Multi-Aircraft Testbed Environments (AIR-MATE). This proposed innovation will provide a MACS-interoperable software module that coordinates the behaviors of human-automation pairs in simulated NextGen airspace. This effort will leverage recent advancements in distributed constraints optimization and adjustable autonomy to analyze airspace simulations in a decentralized, parallel manner and solve problems locally for enhanced efficiency. This technology will reduce the workload and staffing requirements in current NextGen simulations, while ensuring the desired scenario events and separation assurance is properly executed. The results of the AIR-MATE effort will be a more controlled and high-fidelity testbed environment that will aid researchers, increase the quality of NextGen research, and ultimately benefit the development of NextGen concepts.","AIR-MATE will be useful to NASA researchers within the Concepts and Technology Development Project, Systems Analysis Integration and Evaluation Project, and Aviation Safety Program as a software module that will allow them to meet multiple milestones related to the assessment of emerging NextGen concepts.

To address these issues, we propose to develop the UAV-TEST toolset (User-Augmented Visualizations for Targeted Evaluation of Systems and Technologies). UAV-TEST will be a user-centered methodology that helps streamline the research process for UAV-in-NAS research at NASA and enhances the process of generating and connecting new measures, research questions, and visualizations. This concept will be instantiated within a flexible, low-cost toolset that seamlessly integrates with current research tools at NASA.

In Phase II, we will develop a functional prototype that can be used alongside actual NASA studies, particularly within the UAV-in-NAS research areas.","Within the Concepts and Technology Development Project, UAV-TEST will provide the capability to efficiently progress through critical study activities, such as measure authoring, research question development, and configuration of data visualizations. The rapid assessment capability will help meet multiple milestones cited in previous reference materials within the Airspace Systems Program.

Historically, ADS-B has been criticized for its inability to guarantee safe and secure surveillance in all operational conditions.  The technology presented in this proposal provides an integrity check on all ADS-B data that is independent of all primary surveillance modes and is 100% robust to all GPS spoofing attacks.  An important by-product of that integrity check provides us with the further ability to do aircraft-to-aircraft relative positioning that is more accurate and more reliable than any civilian system in existence today.  The ADS-B integrity check and the aircraft-to-aircraft positioning can provide a further basis on which to enhance the safety of the National Airspace System (NAS).","Traffic Flow Management (TFM), Separation Assurance (SA), Super Dense Operations (SDO) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the National Airspace all make heavy use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance  Broadcast (ADS-B).

The potential impact of these capabilities on NASA's NextGen requirements ranges from ADS-B authentication, detection and identification of attacks; to using better relative positions to determine more accurate wind-shear models and enabling precise trajectory modeling during Very Closely Spaced Parallel Approaches (VCSPA).  In short, the GPS Based Location Authentication and Differential Co-Processing could change and accelerate the course of NextGen development.","ADS-B is a public interface, an easy target for attack.  The US Air Force is actively studying how to add security to ADS-B to ensure that attempts to disrupt military missions are identified and counter attacked.

The GPS Location Based Authentication (GBLA) technology presented in this document can solve that concern.  In addition the Differential Co-Processing techniques to calculate relative position between aircraft can act as a backup to the air-to-air radars currently deployed for operations such as formation flying.

The first phase of SEVEN, now called the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP), will be deployed operationally on November 2011.In this project, Mosaic ATM proposes to develop a decision support tool for NAS users that will allow them to automatically generate the optimal route options and their relative costs during CTOP events.  This will allow users to take full advantage of the new capabilities and the opportunities for reducing ground delays and/or fuel burn.  Additionally, this capability will be available for integration into NAS simulation tools such as ACES and FACET, to allow NASA to model high-fidelity, realistic user trajectory preferences generally and in response to CTOP TMIs in particular.  In Phase 3, Mosaic ATM will additionally provide libraries containing the key algorithms for incorporation into existing flight planning systems.","The development of a TOS Generation Tool benefits not just the NAS users, but NASA researchers also.  The underlying route generation and priority algorithm within the TOS Generation Tool can be delivered as a separate code module for integration with NASA simulation environments, FACET and/or ACES.

The addition of a TOS generation algorithm will allow researchers to model the user response to CTOP events, in the context a NAS-wide simulation that could include GDPs and other TMIs.","TOS generation is a key part of a user's participation in CTOP.  While it is possible to use existing tools to generate TOSs, it will be far more cost effective for a user to rely on purpose-built TOS generation tools designed to take into account the users' objectives and constraints.  Mosaic ATM anticipates offering TOS generation products based on the algorithm developed under this SBIR project.Additionally, the results of this SBIR project could form the basis for a new capability either provided by the FAA, through third party flight handling / flight planning providers, or organizations such as AOPA and NBAA to generate TOSs on behalf of users who have not yet developed the capability to generate TOSs themselves.  Such an arrangement would provide the user with a large part of the benefit of CTOP without the need to integrate TOS generation into their internal processes.  Rather, the user would supply a few parameters to the FAA or third party so that they could generate TOSs on behalf of the user.  Such an approach would require the third party or FAA to have aircraft performance models and weather information, but use of such information for flight planning is currently widespread among a vibrant flight planning community, all of which could become users of the CTOP generation algorithm.","Analytical Methods; Computer System Architectures; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Beyond this particular motivation for developing this test facility, evaluation of novel algorithms for trajectory design and innovative communication concepts can be assessed safely and cost-effectively in this environment.The key innovation is the environment in which vehicles and airspace technologies can be assessed. We are not proposing innovation in the technologies themselves. Furthermore, we think that the key elements of the environment are already available, but they have not been assembled into a system that supports airspace simulation. The innovation is primarily system integration, with some customization of the various elements so that interaction between elements is representative of full-scale airspace operations.","A natural commercialization outcome would be to design and install an airspace simulation environment at a NASA center. All of the essential system features can be demonstrated in Phase II in a space about the size of a school gymnasium. Such an environment could then be scaled up for a larger space, to enable simulation of a larger segment of airspace with more vehicles in simultaneous operation. Hangars at Langley or Dryden might be re-purposed for the airspace environment, but Hangar One, at Ames Research Center, would be an ideal venue. It is a very large structure with huge interior volume that is planned for refurbishment but does not have an identified use. It is located at a center that already has responsibility for airspace modeling, so it would readily support cross-pollination between software simulations and subscale flight demonstrations of airspace effectiveness. The environment would be a national resource for developers of new vehicles that must be integrated into airspace, and for researchers pursuing algorithms and protocols for improved airspace effectiveness.","The anticipated commercial market is STEM education, centered on Aerial Robotics camps for high school students.

Each option will contain a list of actions (including TMIs) that, when combined, will address the identified situation.","The Air Traffic Course of Action Planner system developed in Phase 2 can augment NASA's suite of ATM modeling applications. It can be integrated with FACET, allowing task plans, including TMIs suggested by the system, to be played out in simulations in FACET. The system can also aid NASA researchers in understanding the interactions between actions of different ATC facilities, and the interactions between FAA actions and Flight Operator actions.  This capability will allow NASA to remain at the forefront of ATM research and will provide relevant and valuable research results to guide the NextGen evolution.","Some Air Traffic Coordinators in the operational ATC facilities today have information overload from too many tools. On the other hand, some Coordinators (particularly Supervisors) have very few tools at their disposal to support planning and decision-making. There is currently no tool available for FAA traffic managers which allows them to model the affect of a comprehensive combination of TMIs, let alone provide suggestions for the best set of TMIs to fit the anticipated system constraints.

The use of DD as the objective function allows the DAC algorithm to directly address critical aspects of sector design beyond simple balancing of the flight counts. These sector design considerations include the alignment of sector boundaries with flow direction, proximity of conflict points to sector boundaries, and boundary alignment with respect to vertical traffic movement. By using DD as the objective function, we generate a multi-objective optimization approach that considers both efficiency and complex controller workload issues. The SectorFlow DAC algorithm has performed well in NASA's DAC algorithm comparison experiments. However, due to the additional computational complexity caused by the use of DD as the objective function, only limited application of DD as the objective function was conducted. In this proposed SBIR effort, Mosaic ATM will apply a massively parallel computing architecture to the DAC algorithm using DD as an objective function to demonstrate and evaluate both the computational advantages of massively parallel processing, and the benefits of using DD as the objective function in DAC.","The most likely Phase III activities involve further development of the SectorFlow software and algorithms to support NASA's continued aeronautics mission.  The SectorFlow DAC algorithms have been analyzed by NASA in comparison to other DAC concepts, and SectorFlow's performance was found to be high. NASA would benefit from the ability to continue to conduct DAC research using a variety of DAC approaches, including the use of Dynamic Density as an objective function as has been implemented in SectorFlow.The application of massively parallel computing can also be applied by NASA to numerous aeronautics and Air Traffic Management algorithms and analysis efforts. This increase in computational power may allow the necessary increase in modeling samples required to generate robust decision support tool recommendations using a stochastic optimization approach.","The FAA is considering Dynamic Airspace as a potential component of NextGen. However, it is clear that decision support tools will be required to facilitate evaluation of such dynamic airspace designs. As we have found in our DAC research, the required computational performance to algorithmically design and evaluate airspace sectors is significant. The results of this research could be applied by the FAA in a decision support tool for DAC.Modeling and simulation of Air Traffic Management operations is computationally intensive. However, the availability of real-time ATM modeling could be applied to numerous decision-making situations by both the FAA and by Flight Operators. Currently, the level of detailed modeling required to achieve beneficial and useful recommendations from such models in prohibitive. However, the results of this research may provide the necessary computational speed to overcome this obstacle and create the opportunity for commercial real-time ATM modeling and simulation tools.","Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

The MAP value of a sector is typically 5/3 of average sector flight time (or dwell time) measured in minutes, but may be adjusted up or down as necessary to account for other considerations such as sector geometry, traffic mix, and phase of flight. Future operations may utilize complexity as a proxy for workload instead. Our proposed research builds upon existing NASA complexity metrics by analyzing operational data to validate the factors that contribute to complexity in actual operations. We believe we have formulated a novel validation approach to apply to complexity. Our goal is to analyze a large sampling of operational data (substantially larger than could ever be provided by human-in-the-loop simulations) for a wide range of distinct sector types within Center airspace. This large and diverse sampling is anticipated to provide statistical significance to the validation of complexity factors. Most importantly, we believe that demonstrating sound operational validation of complexity is a key step in enabling the transition from aircraft count-based capacity to complexity-based capacity.The first objective is to develop a capability to analyze operational data that can identify sectors whose MAP value deviates from the 5/3 dwell time rule. These sectors will likely exhibit complexity that is higher or lower than the nominal complexity associated with a given MAP value. The next objective is to determine which complexity factors are positively or negatively influencing the sector capacity deviation from the 5/3 dwell time rule from the training set of operational sectors. The final objective is to validate that the complexity factors identified can accurately predict deviations from the 5/3 dwell time rule for the validation set of operational sectors.","The proposed SBIR has two primary focuses. First, we will deliver a complexity analysis tool to NASA so that NASA researchers can conduct their own complexity-related research. For example, NASA researchers can introduce new complexity factors and see if the factors are supported by the operational data. In addition, researchers involved with HITL experiments can leverage this capability to simplify the arduous post-processing of complexity-related data.Second, we will perform specific research studies to complement NASA's internal projects. Studies we perform using the complexity analysis tool will be directly useful to NASA. The study results will guide subsequent NASA research studies. The technical approach may re-used by NASA or may influence the approaches NASA takes on future projects.","The complexity analysis tool will also be very useful in establishing capacities for dynamically-generated sectors for FAA FlexAirspace. In addition, results of research studies that we will publish in reports, conferences, and journals may also help shape the FAA plan for migrating from today's MAP-based capacities to complexity-based capacities.The most likely Phase 3 activities involve further development of the complexity analysis tool and underlying statistical capabilities to support NASA's continued aeronautics mission. The complexity analysis tool could be used within field trials throughout the NAS where the complexity procedures may be refined and actual benefits may be measured. Mosaic ATM has conducted field trials of this type previously with other automation tools and concepts and is well qualified to complete these Phase 3 objectives with minimal risk.",Air Transportation & Safety

This proposal seeks to complement and support this line of research and development through the definition of roles, responsibilities and procedures for coordination and collaboration among these individuals as they adapt airport departure queues at spots and runways to deal with evolving conditions.  It further seeks to design and complete formative evaluations for interface designs that make use of NASA's adaptive planning algorithms.","NASA is developing and testing new operational concepts for airport surface management in order to improve future performance in the NAS.

The most common reason controllers give for why RNAV procedures are not used at their airports is the difficulty handling mixed RNAV and non-RNAV flights.  Our proposed concept directly addresses this complaint, providing a controller decision aid to help controllers merge RNAV and non-RNAV aircraft.  We will also study other applications of the RPI concept, such as planning departure slots into an arrival stream.  The project directly compliments NASA's research and contributes to the NASA Airspace Systems Program's mission.  The results of this project could be applied within NASA's TAPSS project to address mixed RNAV/vectored aircraft environments.  Since RPI technology has been deployed by the FAA for other applications, and the project addresses a current need, the project also endeavors to transfer the resulting technology to the FAA for operational use.","Potential applications for the research results beyond Phase 2 include use by NASA within TAPSS.  This technology would complement NASA's TAPSS by supporting controller acceptance  showing ghost targets will increase the controller's confidence that the TAPSS speed advisories achieve the required merging without vectoring.  In addition, TAPSS assumes all arrivals will be flying RNAV RNP approach procedures, or that controllers can manually handle non-RNAV aircraft using current vectoring techniques.  Controllers at numerous ATC facilities not using RNAV arrival procedures have expressed that the main reason for not using RNAV procedures is the difficulty controllers have merging RNAV and non-RNAV arrivals.  Our concept will help TAPSS accommodate non-RNAV flights and, thereby, support controller acceptance.","Trajectory based operations are a cornerstone of NextGen and RNAV procedures have a proven benefit in the NAS.  However, adoption of RNAV arrival procedures has been slow due to the challenge controllers face merging RNAV and non-RNAV flights.  This project will deliver a controller aide that addresses this issue and could enable broad adoption of RNAV arrival procedures and the accompanying benefits.  We envision technology transfer to the FAA occurring at the end of Phase 2, for implementation within the TRACON automation systems.  A similar concept to address a different issue currently operates at several airports, offering a clear path for implementation of this technology.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

The proposed SA architecture consists of a Network and SA Performance Metric Monitor (PMM), which monitors short-horizon performance metrics of the network and the currently used SA concept. It also consists of an Air-Ground Concept Manager (AGCM), which decides if one or multiple SA concepts are to be applied in a given airspace (i.e., center, flow corridor or transition airspace) based on the observed and estimated network and SA performance metrics.

The proposed system uses commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) components to create a distributed sensor array for the measurement of shear stress in either a flight or ground test environment.  The reusable sensor array requires no external wiring or power source.  The bio-inspired system is based on mimicking the sensitivity and response of a single hair fiber/receptor neuron to sense flow velocity very near a surface.  An array of the hair cell inspired shear sensors are embedded in a flexible, self-adhesive backed sheet of polymide substrate, which also contains a self-contained, battery operated acquisition system.  The self-contained blanket array can be quickly and easily applied to aircraft or vehicle surfaces in question.  No wiring, external power, or control is required.  After testing, the system can be quickly removed and reused.  In addition to measurement of shear stress, the sensor array should be able to determine laminar/turbulent boundary-layer transition locations, laminar/turbulent separation and reattachment lines, and shock locations.  The proposed bio-inspired shear sensor array promises to provide a robust, realizable, accurate, efficient, and cost effective measurement system.","A robust shear stress measurement system for both flight and ground test facilities has significant potential application at several NASA centers, and across a wide range of NASA facilities.  The ability to produce reliable, robust and cost effective shear stress measurements is an important goal for NASA.  By being able to determine boundary-layer transition and separation locations, the proposed system can be used to validate transition prediction and multidisciplinary analysis and optimization tools.  The system could be used in boundary-layer ingestion and optimization efforts.  In a more permanent set-up, the robust measurement system could be used as input for vehicle adaptive control in uncertain environments or adverse conditions, or for closed loop flow control for aircraft, rotorcraft, or high lift technologies.  Accurate, robust, and cost effective shear stress measurement is a necessary and compelling technology.  NASA centers and facilities will be eager to exploit the proposed technology.","Advanced sensing technology in the form of a robust shear stress measurement system for both flight and ground test facilities will provide RHRC with a unique and highly marketable product.  The ability to measure laminar/turbulent transition and both laminar/turbulent separation locations will be of significant importance to both test engineers and researchers.  With the current high costs of both flight and ground testing, coupled with reduced design and test schedules, the proposed technology will be highly desirable in military, government, and civilian testing markets.  The technology developed by RHRC under this program will allow the efficient and cost effective measurement of a fundamental aerodynamic quantity on vehicles across a wide range of applications other than aircraft.  These include automobiles, hydrodynamic, and civil engineering applications.  RHRC will be able to provide complete sensor systems.  The technology can also be easily licensed.","Acoustic/Vibration; Aerodynamics; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Contact/Mechanical; Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

A thin-film, flight-worthy sensor capable of providing spatio-temporally accurate estimation of aerodynamic coefficients enables revolutionary energy-efficient, physics-based, force-feedback flight control of a wide range of vehicles from subsonic to supersonic flows. Recent biophysics research has uncovered sensory techniques to recover information from the noisy environment. Tao Systems proposes to develop a unique sensor that robustly applies these biomimetic sensory techniques to the aerodynamic problem to obtain accurate estimates of aerodynamic coefficients with minimal calibration requirements.","Accurate real-time aerodynamic load/moment sensors will enable a number of revolutionary capabilities across a wide speed range, including, but not limited to: (1) shorter take-off and landing, (2) safe, reliable supersonic operation, and (3) larger passenger and cargo capacity. The primary difficulty in all three revolutionary capabilities is the uncertainty in aerodynamic load \& moments generated by the airstream in design and off-design conditions, e.g., turbulent flows and high angles of attack. Measuring the aerodynamic loads/moments reduces the aerodynamic uncertainty enabling the aircraft to timely, robustly compensate for the adverse flow conditions. Therefore, the proposed innovation could be of significant interest to the aircraft civilian industry.","For national security, the ability to cruise efficiently at a range of altitude, enabled by a substantial increase in cruise lift-to-drag (L/D) ratios over today's high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, is vital, providing sustained presence and long range. Aerodynamic load/moment sensors would enable the efficient, robust active control of adaptive, lightweight wings to optimize lift distribution to maximize L/D.

Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) arrays currently use a single optical source with mechanical steering. An identified goal would be an RF array with true time delay for beam steering and combined in the same physical location with an optical array steered via optical phase shift. ODIS approaches this problem with an optoelectronic circuit that integrates the RF and optical elements within a single chip. The RF at Ka band is generated by an optoelectronic oscillator and converted to RF power in a photodiode at the antenna element. The antenna element is a printed dipole on chip with dimensions of λ/2 (≈4.3mm). The optical source is an array of vertical cavity lasers spaced sufficiently closely to achieve a coherent beam. Optical beam steering is achieved by optical phase shifting of the coherent beam.

By targeting the ADC on a CMOS technology node (90nm, 65nm or 45nm), a complete all digital radio receiver and demodulator can be implemented on the same System on a Chip that performs host interface and higher network level protocols. Using Delta Sigma Modulation at GHz sampling rates eliminates the anti-aliasing filter requirement.  The all digital receiver eliminates I/Q imbalance due to the receiver and DC offset introduced by zero-IF architectures. In order to support multi GHz sampling rates in CMOS, advanced time interleaving, parallel Delta Sigma Modulators and shared integrator architectures are considered. Using Micro-RDC RHBD cells and design experience the digital filtering and decimation of the high frequency bit stream are hardened. The baseband filtering is implemented with temporal latch technology for SEU immunity. In this research various hardening techniques will be used to harden the analog sub-components in the Delta Sigma Modulator including investigating pipelining and parallel processing architectures for filtering and decimation which also address low power requirements.","The GHz sampling rate, high bandwidth, and high resolution radiation hardened Delta Sigma modulation ADC's implemented on a CMOS technology node (90nm, 65nm, or 45nm) paves the way for the elimination of RF analog front end circuits in S-band Microwave digital communication transceivers.

Single photon detection efficiency (PDE) up to 80% has been demonstrated at 1064 nm, as well as maximum count rates in excess of 300 MHz.

In Phase I, a series of single element detectors of varying diameter, as well as small sized arrays, will be fabricated from the new aluminum-free material, and the corresponding decrease in dark count rate will be measured. In Phase II, radiation and lifetime testing will be repeated for the aluminum-free design, and large-area segmented detectors will be coupled to readout integrated circuits and demonstrated.Voxtel anticipates that its technology will enter the program at TRL=4, finish Phase I at TRL=5, and exit the Phase II program at TRL=6.","The proposed low-noise optical receiver technology is applicable to a large number of NASA applications, including lidar atmospheric profiling, laser ranging, ladar navigation and hazard avoidance, and free-space optical communications.","The innovation has numerous dual-use applications in US military, industrial and commercial markets, including 3D modeling and site survey, autonomous navigation, automotive cruise control and obstacle avoidance, and robotics.

Recently, lightweight circular-beam helix TWTAs have been demonstrated with power output in the range of several hundred watts and overall efficiency in the range of 40 to 60 percent. Despite these advances, there is substantial value in further improvement across all of these areas. Beam Power Technology (BPT) proposes a novel elliptic-beam TWTA which is highly efficient (75%) and has 500 W of CW power, reduced weight, lower voltage and an expected 15+ year lifetime. The average power operation is at a back-off of -6 dB from saturation. The linearity is -35 dBc. The Phase I objective is to determine the feasibility of an elliptic-beam helix TWTA which substantially exceeds the performance levels of conventional helix devices. In Phase II, BPT will complete the engineering design and experimental demonstration of a prototype targeting eventual deployment into satellite applications.","The elliptic-beam helix TWTA will provide NASA deep space missions with both increased efficiency and increased power over current state of the art rf transmitters while reducing weight, volume, voltage and complexity. In general, high-efficiency, high-power elliptic-beam TWTAs align with NASA's vision for space exploration by increasing the science data rate-of-return for exploration missions, and by enabling deeper, more sophisticated exploration of the solar system. In particular, high-efficiency, high-power elliptic-beam TWTAs would benefit the R&D programs in the NASA Glenn Research Center's Exploration Systems Division.","Elliptic-beam helix TWTAs have applications in rf amplification requiring high efficiency, high power, broad bandwidth and lower cost.

We propose the development of an innovative software tool that will support mission and scheduling personnel in developing, de-conflicting, optimizing, and maintaining space networks. We have developed an innovative networking and scheduling framework that facilitates the development of more intelligent and optimizing scheduling algorithms with a mixed-initiative architecture. This framework will be augmented to handle the complex and diverse constraints found in the space communications scheduling domain, allowing for accurate modeling. A mixed-initiative conflict resolution assistant will analyze the schedule, and suggest ways in which any conflicts might be resolved. Once a valid schedule has been produced, a multi-objective resource optimizer will refine the schedule to maximize mission satisfaction. Some of this technology has already been applied to the NASA Ground Network (space communications) scheduling and several domains including those involving similarly complex constraints, such as the problem of optimizing ballistic missile engagements, which includes complex line of sight (LOS) and range calculations between satellite-based sensors and three-dimensional ballistic missile trajectories.The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to improve the space networking scheduling and execution capability.  The goals of the Phase I research are to further understand the current and future space networking domain, including user interactions and collaboration, to investigate integration requirements, and to elaborate the heuristics, algorithms and techniques for improved space networking, and analyze them as to their feasibility. Other goals are to define the metrics for space networking performance, further prove the feasibility through prototype development, and develop the Phase II system design.","We are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent planning and scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  The additional capabilities developed for space networking can be synergistically marketed to the same clients. For example, the mixed-initiative conflict resolution manager proposed here would be applicable to many Aurora customers. In addition, we anticipate that this effort will result in additional scheduling algorithms that we will be able to incorporate into our existing scheduling products, thus increasing the benefits they provide as well as their value. There is great potential in this effort because it represents an opportunity to build on our previous scheduling and networking solutions and leverage our and OPNET's customer bases, both of whom can potentially benefit from this effort's enhancements.","The most direct target for the results of this effort is NASA's Space Communications and Navigation Program.

We propose a 6-month Phase I program to 1) demonstrate reliable ignition and operation of our baseline CIC with hydrogen, methane, and propane fuels, 2) demonstrate reliable ignition and operation of our baseline CIC under cold gas inlet conditions, 3) demonstrate extended duration hot fire testing and durability of our CIC design over multiple ignition cycles, and 4) demonstrate rapid pulsed operation necessary for a launch vehicle or space craft thruster application. Under our proposed Phase I effort, we will also conduct a market survey of potential customers and define a flight weight CIC with maximum commercial utility as either an igniter or small thruster.","Our CIC technology will compete effectively with more conventional spark, pyrophoric liquid, and laser ignition systems, because it uses less complex hardware and electronic systems, operates over a broader range of temperature, pressure, and mixture ratios commensurate with deep-throttling engine requirements. In addition, a catalytic igniter system is virtually maintenance-free.  The primary NASA applications for the CIC technology will be ignition systems for future booster or in-space engines and low cost, reliable thrusters on future launch vehicles and spacecraft.","The attributes of the CIC that will make it an attractive alternative to state-of-the-art ignition and thruster systems for NASA commercial applications also apply to non-NASA launch vehicle and satellite providers. Successful completion of Phase II and a potential NASA use of the CIC technology will virtually assure adoption by non-NASA launch and satellite providers on future systems. Near term, we also see a potential market for the CIC as a laboratory scale combustor to support advanced propellant, propulsion, sensor, and health management related technology development.",Launch Engine/Booster; Spacecraft Main Engine

A flexible manufacturing system that can handle the production of such parts in short time periods is desirable. Today's near-net fabrication technologies are extremely limited in design flexibility due to the use of injection molding. Considering the need for design flexibility as well as shorter development cycles, reduced costs, and minimized variance in making one-of-a-kind components, an innovative manufacturing technology will be demonstrated in this work to fabricate geometrically complex superalloy components.","Potential NASA applications include rocket and airbreathing propulsion system components, especially those requiring sophisticated internal passageways.","Potential non-NASA applications include military rocket and airbreathing propulsion system components, industrial gas tubine components, industrial pump and valve components for corrosion resistance, and biomedical implants.",Ablative Propulsion; Atmospheric Propulsion; Ceramics; Composites; Heat Exchange; In Situ Manufacturing; Launch Engine/Booster; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Metallics; Nanomaterials; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Passive Systems; Polymers; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Spacecraft Main Engine; Structures

In order to achieve lower maintenance costs, the turnaround time between mission cycles must be kept to a minimum.  At each cycle, one item on the maintenance checklist to be conducted is rotor torque.In order for a turbopump to be returned to service, among other requirements, it must be clear of all FOD as well as damage to the rotor or bearings.  One maintenance check that is a valid indicator of FOD or rotor and bearing damage is a rotor torque check.  Failure of a turbopump due to rotor or bearing damage may lead to an event categorized as a Criticality 1 (Loss of Life or Vehicle) failure mode.In most modern turbopumps, performing a rotor torque check involves timely and costly maintenance procedures.  In many cases, inlet piping or structural cases must be removed to expose the turbopump rotor.  As each piece of hardware is reinstalled, they routinely must undergo lengthy quality checks to ensure proper assembly and function.FTT proposes development of a means to measure the rotor torque through the use of an electromagnetic drive device.  Similar to a DC electrical motor, the new component would be powered and cause the rotor to rotate.  After recording measurements of the rotor speed and electromagnet input power, the rotor torque could be calculated.  Incorporating a device such as this into a turbopump would reduce time associated with torque measurements from days to seconds.","The anticipated benefits from this technology include reduced maintenance time and increased reliability as fewer turbopump components will be disassembled and handled during maintenance cycles.  This technology is directly applicable to booster engines, in-space engines, and lunar engine NASA applications.","The resulting technology is directly applicable to rotating equipment and turbo machinery in the industrial sectors.  This technology would impact maintenance costs by allowing reduced maintenance time, and fewer components to be handled during maintenance cycles.  Automated rotor torque checks would improve health monitoring capabilities as engine health could be monitored in real time, which could be especially useful for equipment that is located in remote locations.  With the addition of rotor torque data, preventative maintenance and scheduled downtime could be better managed and organized to prevent future outages.",Launch Engine/Booster; Spacecraft Main Engine

The purpose of the IPS is to prevent the fuel (RP-2) and oxidizer (LOX) from mixing by using an inert purge gas; however, a major risk of the IPS is RP-2 wicking into the buffer or LOX cavities, threatening ignition with the LOX.  The proposed sensor will detect the presence of hydrocarbons and signal the health management system to safely shutdown.  It will increase the reliability of the IPS, and decrease turnaround time between missions by eliminating the need for manual inspections for hydrocarbons in the IPS. There are two main technical objectives for Phase I.  First is to research and test various hydrocarbon indicators to determine which materials can detect the presence of hydrocarbons by either changing color or intensity.  The second objective is to research and test various optical viewing devices and data processing devices to determine which mechanism can adequately capture the color or intensity change of the hydrocarbon indicator and signal that the change has occurred.  The sensor will be comprised of the feasible components determined during Phase I, and tested in a rig in Phase II.","The hydrocarbon leak detection sensor is applicable to a RP-2/LOX turbopump.  The sensor would detect if any RP-2 is wicking into the IPS buffer cavity, either during operation or between missions.  This increases the reliability of the IPS, potentially preventing a catastrophic failure.  The benefits of the sensor include providing real-time monitoring of the IPS, and recorded video to be watched as a post-test inspection, which decreases the vehicle turn-around-time by eliminating the need for manual inspections of the IPS prior to every flight.  The sensor could also detect if the RP-2 has wicked between engine firings and signal that cleaning of the IPS is required before the next engine start.  The sensor is at least partially reusable, with the optical viewing device, and may be entirely reusable depending on the type of hydrocarbon indicator material selected as a result of the Phase I testing.","The hydrocarbon leak detection sensor can be used in any application involving hydrocarbons to prevent the risk of ignition due to a leak.  Since RP-2 is a storable propellant and will not evaporate, unlike liquid Hydrogen or liquid Oxygen, the risk of RP-2 wicking is always present.  Specifically, the hydrocarbon leak detection sensor could be used in the Hydrocarbon Boost (HCB) demonstrator engine currently being developed by FTT and Aerojet.  Commercial rocket companies developing LOX/Kerosene engines would also benefit from this technology.  Additionally, applications for this sensor could exist in the oil and gas industries.",Diagnostics/Prognostics; Launch Engine/Booster; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Spacecraft Main Engine

High performance materials, such as low-density ceramics, foams, aerogels, composites, metals, and multi-layer insulations (MLI) will be increasingly used. These materials, however, often have poor mechanical strength and damage-tolerance, and are also difficult to bond to each other, due to the extreme operating temperature and pressure cycles and the mismatch between their thermal (expansion) and mechanical properties. The combination of these drawbacks resulted in the catastrophic detachment of foam insulation from the external tank (ET) in Shuttle Columbia, mission STS-107.There is a need for damage-tolerant, ""forgiving"" and multifunctional adhesive technologies for integrating dissimilar materials (such as cryogenic pressurized vessels to insulations), and ensuring reliable, integrated lightweight system designs. To address this need, Applied Analytic Research Inc. has designed innovative cost-effective Isolating Adhesives that are multifunctional, Bond, isolate and protect dissmilar adherends in the same time.","Since the innovative damage-tolerant isolating adhesive is designed with commercially available building blocks, it will provide a cost-effective and easy-to-apply bonding mechanism between various aerospace structures and materials in space exploration and transportation missions such as orbit transfer vehicles, space power systems, spaceports, spacesuits, lunar habitation systems, etc. A major application is in re-usable launch vehicles (RLV) that have many components with dissimilar mechanical and thermal properties subjected to repeated thermal and mechanical cycles. These components will be difficult to spot-bond via mechanical joints due to interfacial stresses caused by operational cycles. An example is bonding thermal protection system (TPS) and Cryo-insulation materials in integrated insulation designs used for future spacecraft.","As a replacement of mechanical or ordinary adhesive attachment for industrial components exposed to thermal and mechanical stress cycles, such as exhaust systems for hot gases in cars or reactors; or medical, pharmaceutical or laboratory assemblies exposed to periodic cryogenic conditions, such as cryogenic mills or testing equipment","Aerogels; Air Transportation & Safety; Ceramics; Composites; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Fasteners/Decouplers; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics; Passive Systems; Polymers; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

XCOR's composite material is lighter than metal, and unlike graphite/epoxy, nonflammable. The material is immune to microcracking, has a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and is capable of withstanding hundreds of cryogenic temperature cycles. Additionally, it is durable, repairable, and can withstand extreme hot and cold temperatures. The fluoropolymer composite maintains strength and flexibility at extreme temperatures (-260 to plus 280 degrees C/-436 to plus 536 degrees F).Low CTE also allows this composite to be built into a vehicle's primary structure. Used as the internal skin in a sandwich structure (Nonburnite, foam, and carbon/epoxy) the composite skin-foam-skin material provides both thermal insulation and structure. These features, along with the high strength-to-weight ratio, make it an enabling technology for building lighter, highly reusable, and more robust propellant tanks, thus reducing need for maintenance between flights. Further, XCOR believes significant commercialization opportunities exist for the material after its manufacturing processes have matured.","This proposed effort has particular relevance to several key programs at NASA.  First, the Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) provides a foundation of science and technology for many aspects of manned and robotic space travel and payloads ranging from micro satellites to manned systems.  The pursuit of high reliability, safety and affordability is clearly relevant as it applies to NonburniteTM and SOMD's objectives. The use of a human rated (nonflammable) cryogenically capable, reliable, high strength, low weight composite structures could save significant weight throughout the Orion and Heavy Lift Crew Exploration vehicle programs.  The Human Research Program (HRP) seeks to perform advanced high risk technology development in support of human exploration systems.  The fundamental nature of Nonburnite also has particular potential relevance to HRP.  Finally, the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) at Langley Research Center (LaRC) has a mission to look at advanced technology insertion into space vehicle programs.","XCOR believes there are significant commercialization opportunities for the material once manufacturing processes are matured.  NonburniteTM is suitable for lightweight, linerless oxygen-compatible tanks for propulsion, fuel cell, life support, and related infrastructure applications, including aircraft cargo hold structures and containers, high and low temperature environments where flammability is of concern, and large volume commercial or retail applications such as in home oxygen tanks that are lighter weight and easier to maneuver by typically elderly or infirm users.",Characterization; Composites; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Processing Methods; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Space Transportation & Safety; Structures; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)

The brittleness typically associated with a ceramic can be mitigated by forming composites with either carbon or SiC fibers. However, the processes for forming SiC matrix composites limit the size and complexity of the resulting shapes. It is therefore necessary to develop techniques for efficiently joining SiC matrix composite parts. Many such methods have been proposed over the past 25 years, but none is satisfactory, and it remains an active area of research. The joints formed so far either require extremely high temperatures to manufacture or result in unsatisfactory mechanical properties. TDA is herein proposing a route that will result in a pure SiC bond, and will achieve it without requiring any external heat source. As such the joint will be robust, and have the same temperature capabilities and mechanical properties as the matrix. The technology will have met the criteria for exiting technical readiness level (TRL) 3, and some of the criteria for TRL 4, by the end of the Phase I period.","C/SiC and SiC/SiC matrix composites have been proposed for a wide variety of aerospace applications. Its outstanding high temperature materials properties and chemical resistance has lead to its consideration for use in leading edges and other thermal protection systems, combustion chambers and nozzles, nozzle flaps, and afterburner flame holders. Their high dimensional stability across cryogenic, ambient and elevated temperatures has lead to their consideration as mounts for spaceborne optical platforms.","Monolithic SiC parts are widely used in crucibles, furnace linings, and combustors in high temperature chemical processing. SiC/SiC composites have demonstrated long life in industrial gas turbines.

While developers have made some progress addressing this reusability issue, there are also significant reliability issues with the SOA cryotanks due to their inconsistent structural performance.  GTL has identified the root cause of this reliability issue and proposes to confirm this diagnosis.  This will be accomplished by testing two sets of laminate samples; one set fabricated with typical SOA cryotank techniques, and a second set fabricated with intentional laminate flaws.  The results of this testing are expected to show a correlation between the identified flaws and the observed inconsistent performance.  With this confirmation, GTL will examine several techniques that could be used to detect these flaws in production composite tanks.   Additionally, GTL will show how the breakthrough BHLTM cryotank technology inhibits the introduction of these flaws and produced consistently high structural performance.  This effort builds upon earlier research that confirmed the potential of the BHL technology to eliminate the microcracking issue.  With BHL technology, it is possible to build high-performance, reusable and reliable cryotanks. At the conclusion of the Phase I effort, GTL will fabricate a subscale BHL cryotank and deliver it to NASA for independent evaluation.","The high strength to weight of modern composite materials offers the potential for substantial performance gains compared to traditional structural and pressure vessel approaches.  These weight savings will be especially critical to meet the high performance requirements of future NASA exploration systems, including heavy lift launch vehicles, Earth departure stages, lunar or asteroid descent vehicles, and long-term propellant storage in space, on the Moon or on Mars. While the use of composite materials is fairly mature when it comes to non-wetted structures, there have been substantial technical barriers that have slowed the application of this technology to propellant storage.  These barriers are most evident in attempts to apply composite technology in cryotanks for cryogenic propellant storage, which is a critical need for NASA exploration systems.  The BHL technology addresses these issues and offers high-performance, reusability and reliable cryotanks for future NASA missions.","The cryotank technical barriers are essentially the same for NASA and Non-NASA applications.  The proposed BHL cryotank technology directly addresses these issues and will provide the marketplace with access to high-performance, reusability and reliable cryotanks.

The MVF incorporates a generic multi-specimen sample holder which can be accessed on-orbit, allowing data to be obtained in real-time.  Candidate specimens accommodated by the MVF include various cells (e.g. for culturing), aquatics, plants, algae, and invertebrate organisms.  More specifically, the generic multi-specimen container can be utilized as a prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell culture vessel.  It can be used to contain aquatic organisms such as Zebra fish, Medaka, tadpoles, and even developing amphibian eggs.  Seedlings, small adult plants (Arabadopsis), and even fern spores could be located within the specimen container.  Other possibilities include Algae (Chara), fungi (S. cerevisiae), as well as invertebrate organisms such as C. elegans and Drosophila sp. in very large numbers.  MVF's distinct advantage is its capability to provide synchronously controlled 1-G specimens in the same environment as the test specimens.  More importantly, the innovative curved-wall sample holders within the MVF provide a constant gravitational force to the samples at all specimen locations. Since the MVF builds upon existing flight-proven technology, the long scientific hardware development cycle will be significantly reduced, translating into higher scientific throughput of ISS.","Techshot expects to commercialize the MVF by incorporating it into the company's spaceflight service program that it offers to NASA mission programs, as well as for other Government agencies such as investigators funded by the National Institute of Health Biomed-ISS program. The MVF provides a unique opportunity to increase the basic understanding of the effects of spaceflight on biological systems such as cells, plants, algae, and invertebrate organisms.  With the synchronous control, the MVF provides the mechanism to develop critically needed countermeasures to mitigate the negative biological effects of spaceflight on astronauts' health.  NASA can further utilize the MVF to test biological response of the spaceflight environment to help determine the regulation of gene expression in these biological systems.  Most importantly, the MVF is a unique instrument capable of conducting highly-sought-after cell culturing and tissue growth experiments.","Building on its expected success with employing MVF to support NASA mission programs, Techshot expects to soon offer flight experiment services to non-NASA customers, including private sector and university researchers.

The space station itself has a limited lifecycle as well, thus long-term and/or high-risk development programs pose issues for science 'return on investment', if the technology cannot be adequately matured before the station is decommissioned. Thus innovative systems and technologies that minimize impact on limiting resources such as up-mass and down-mass, and can do so in the near- to mid-term, are highly desirable. One such area includes the various rechargeable battery systems on ISS used extensively for cameras, camcorders, laptops, communication systems and other portable science and diagnostic equipment. All new rechargeable batteries intended for use on ISS must undergo an extensive and costly qualification process, to ensure they meet safety criteria for charge, discharge, short-circuit, temperature, containment and other parameters. The associated recharging systems must also undergo rigorous safety analysis before obtaining flight approval. To alleviate this requirement, new battery powered equipment for ISS is often selected based on legacy technology already approved for crewed-space applications, and not on operational need. The use of shared battery resources (battery packs, battery chargers or both), for future ISS payloads could reduce or eliminate the time and cost needed to obtain battery system safety approval, and reduce the burden on valuable up-mass resources.A common (universal) battery charging system for ISS, with the flexibility to accommodate current and future rechargeable battery requirements for payloads and equipment, could reduce the cost use of the ISS by future payload developers. This would not only simplify the safety and integration process for these programs, but also reduce up-mass by making use of existing ISS resources.","The proposed innovation serves to increase the science capability of ISS, by enabling the extended use of SPHERES and other battery-operated facilities.  The establishment of the ISS as a National Laboratory has significantly enhanced the accessibility of its facilities to organizations outside of NASA and the DOD, including other governmental agencies, research institutions and commercial entities.  The universal charger enables use of these facilities beyond the retirement of the shuttle. On the government side, the development of a universal charger forms the basis for space research that is at the core of NASA and the DOD.  The proposed system provides an upgrade to existing ISS facilities to greatly increase the lifetime of onboard assets. The addition of a universal charger to the SPHERES testbed and other facilities allows for increased research capabilities. SPHERES itself has multiple applications: it is a precursor to technology maturation for inspection satellites for ISS and other manned and unmanned NASA vehicles. Its forthcoming visual-based navigation system enables algorithm development in support of new applications such as standoff cameras for unmanned systems, imaging terminal capture for mars sample return missions, and will support a constantly changing workspace during robotic assembly and servicing missions. All of these applications will require additional battery systems and could benefit from the use of a universal charging system for ISS.","DoD applications include the enabled use of ISS research facilities for multiple purposes.  Additionally, opportunities may exist in the commercial, institutional and government sectors to 'sell' test time on SPHERES (and other ISS facilities that have been enabled by this innovation) to organizations for developing and validating vision and assembly capability for future satellite applications. This service could be analogous to the way in which the National Testing Service (NTS) provides facility rental and support for both commercial entities and institutions. Table 1 shows projected return on investment for selling SPHERES test time on ISS. Since SPHERES is the only known long duration, microgravity test facility for the development of satellite maneuvering algorithms, an opportunity exists to extend usage of this testbed to organizations outside of NASA. While the proposed innovation itself is not expected to be commercially profitable as a stand-alone item, it enables future researchers to reduce ISS payload development costs, and reduces up-mass overhead for future launches to ISS, thus creating a significant return on investment.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

Current utilization of biological testing in the ISS is limited by available upmass, downmass, and crew time as well as by the capabilities of the interfaces and hardware already developed.  Our proposed sample preparation module can play a major role in achieving the reality of on-orbit molecular analysis techniques (gene array test, DNA analysis, DNA storage) that would extend and enable additional research and development activities in space, including the ISS.  This will enable near real-time space research studies such as space radiation exposure and enhanced pathogen (bacterial, fungal, viral) virulence in micro-gravity, to be performed without having to store and bring the samples back to earth for complete analysis.","The ability to carry out sample preparation using a small footprint device in a completely enclosed format will allow numerous molecular tests to be carried out in space.  Example applications include microbial detection in advanced life support systems, in-vitro testing for infectious diseases during space flight, gene expression analysis for radiation exposure monitoring/studies, and effect of space flight on microbial gene expression and virulence.  The USPM can be easily coupled with suitable downstream detection modules to expand its capability.","With advances in molecular diagnostics, life science, and forensics, there will be a vast increase in demand for instrumentation that can handle automated sample preparation within a closed format to eliminate cross-contamination.

The recent proliferation of high-definition capture devices and displays (HDTV) provide the general public with first-hand human experiences hundreds miles above sea level in brilliant detail. The recent IMAX film ""Hubble,"" which features one of the final space shuttle missions to repair the orbital telescope, is a prime example. The core of current space-based video capture devices consist of digital imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the harsh conditions of space limit the lifespan of all the imaging sensors, in addition to other electronics. Consequently, NASA is seeking innovative technologies for space-based applications to extend the operational life of these systems to three years or more. In this SBIR project, we propose to investigate robust image reconstruction based on novel signal processing techniques in the vein of compressed sensing (CS) to mitigate pixel damage to the point that is imperceptible by the human eye. Specifically, this proposal is a response to the solicitation for radiation-hardened programmable encoding technology as an identified mid-term NASA solution. CS is a recently introduced novel framework that goes against the traditional data acquisition paradigm. CS demonstrates that a sparse, or compressible, signal can be acquired using a low rate acquisition process that projects the signal onto a small set of vectors incoherent with the sparsity basis. This approach is divided into encoder and decoder stages.  We propose performing the encoding in-line with acquisition using a low-SWaP, radiation-tolerant FPGA. The robust reconstruction will occur back on Earth where high-performance GPU-accelerated workstations can be used.  A benefit of our solution is that it does not require a modification to the original imaging system.","Although the primary application is for space missions involving the acquisition of HD video, NASA will be able to leverage our solution as a technique for mitigating the effects of sensor pixel damage in video imaging for space, air, land or maritime sensors.  The dead-pixel problem is of particular importance for night-vision devices mounted in high vibration/dust environments, like aircraft, road-going vehicles and man-portable equipment. In some of these applications the bandwidth is available to process the raw data away from the sensor, enabling cost reductions.","In order to harness the potential of this technology in the military arena we plan to team with prime contractors, in particular Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors and L-3 communications.  We have worked with these companies in the past, transitioning SBIR technology into military programs of record.  Regardless, the novel algorithms developed in this SBIR can be implemented in alternative low-cost platforms like CPUs and GPUs, enabling the same benefits in post-processing fashion. Once the cost of the technology is low enough, the applications of dead pixel mitigation algorithms are virtually limitless in the commercial imaging arena:  TV broadcasting, medical imaging, digital photography, industrial inspection, robotics, surveillance, etc.",Coding & Compression; Detectors (see also Sensors); Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Perception/Vision; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation)

Furthermore SDVP will improve the motion imaging technology in the space by offering standard compliance flexibility, multimode operation and power management capabilities. As missions evolve, parameters change that can affect the ideal motion imaging configurations. SDVR highly programmable platform will make it easy to upload patches, upgrades, and new applications and improvements, hence providing ""Future-proof"" video processing and over-the-air reconfiguration. SDVP can support other applications in parallel with video processing, reducing SWaP of the greater system.","The adoption of a radiation hardened software defined video processor, SDVP, meets several important needs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by advancing the motion imaging technology in the space environments. One example is the use of HDTV camcorders on the Space Station. The deployment of a high definition television (HDTV) camcorder on the International Space Station is part of a public-private NASA partnership with Dreamtime Holdings Inc., Moffet Field, Calif., to upgrade NASA's equipment to next generation HDTV technology. Another application is the Live HDTV broadcast from Space. On October 2009, NASA transmitted the first live high-definition television (HDTV) broadcast from space (in this case the International Space Station) to earth. Designed to give curious minds a look at life aboard the 220-mile high space station, the broadcast aired on Discovery HD, a NASA partner on the program.","A reprogrammable video processor will provide significant advantages in the commercial market of high quality motion imaging. One prominent sector is the medical equipment market, where high quality and flexibility are both in demand based on the situation and location. A reprogrammable encoder that provides high quality and rate control makes it possible to use the equipment in remote locations, like disaster areas and make shift hospitals, while getting high quality images to specialists and physicians in central locations. Overall it is important to notice that a programmable processor is important for applications that support multiple coding standards, proprietary functions, or future changes to application requirements.

The concept provides a highly simplified and easy to build PMD as an alternative to a total communication device or one incorporating a start basket.  Water bench tests with a very primitive prototype yielded encouraging results, and additional, simple bench-level testing with LN2 was also encouraging.  An opportunity exists to refine the concept, develop a larger, more flight-like apparatus, and test it in a cryogenic tank currently being designed and subsequently intended for use on the Cryogenic Orbital Testbed (CRYOTE) experiment.  Designing a full size flight qualifiable flexible screen PMD under a Phase 1 SBIR effort, followed by hardware fabrication, qualification and flight demonstration on a flight test platform concurrently in development, will allow this concept to be demonstrated for a fraction of the cost that would be required for a dedicated flight of a flexible PMD experiment.  The concept TRL should move from 3 to 5 during Phase 1, and 5 to 7 during Phase 2.","Future space missions to the Moon and Mars are planning to use cryogenic propellants and will require propellant acquisition in low or zero-g environments for many phases of these missions.  Furthermore, maintenance and acquisition of cryogenic propellants while in Earth orbit will likely become more prevalent as space vehicle architecture evolves.  The proposed innovation can potentially simplify and increase the reliability with which these propellant acquisition tasks are achieved.","For commercial space applications (e.g. satellites and commercial launch operations), the proposed innovation may be useful for improved propellant management in the upper stage during coast periods, as well as providing a means of propellant acquisition in the satellites themselves.  Cryogenic propellants are expected to replace toxic storables, and small cryogenic orbital maneuvering, payload delivery, and servicing vehicles are expected to play a greater role in both commercial and military space operations.  The proposed innovation would benefit all of these applications.",Fuels/Propellants

There are numerous new technologies required to achieve needed cryogenic fluid management capabilities allowing future extended spaceflight missions. There are known concerns about the technology readiness of critical cryogenic fluid management (CFM) technologies in micro-gravity. The NASA Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer technology demonstration program is an orbiting laboratory that can investigate CFM technologies in space, and provides an opportunity to advance in-space CFM technologies. The testbed can provide a cost effective means to mature numerous new technologies, flight test and reduce risk for their use in NASA missions.  Integrated MultiLayer Insulation (IMLI) is a new next generation thermal insulation offering higher thermal performance, lower mass and a more robust structure than current MLI. IMLI could use a conformal blanket design with IMLI panels and temperature-matched layer panel seaming.This proposal is for the design, fabrication, testing and evaluation of novel conformal high-performance IMLI thermal insulation blankets for a CRYOTE-like Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer demonstration testbed. A sequence of steps to mature IMLI technology, measure performance in a realistic environment, and plan development of prototypes leading a technology demonstration flight are outlined. Further development of IMLI would aid in the maturing of the passive thermal control aspect of cryogenic fluid management, advancing CFM technologies and reducing risk for future NASA missions and commercial spacecraft, launch vehicles, orbital fuel depots and cryogenic space instruments.","Integrated Multi-Layer Insulation (IMLI) is a next generation MultiLayer Insulation with significant advantages over conventional MLI, and could provide superior thermal insulation for use in NASA spacecraft, launch vehicles, space instruments, space stations, landers and orbiting fuel depots.

Specific objectives of the Phase I effort are to (1) develop a system level model that captures the behaviors of interest and enables design decisions (2) demonstrate sufficient optical performance for high resolution sensing in a prototype scale package and (3) show that this sensing technique improves device stability by enabling a design with a large separation between the sense resonance frequency and drive resonance frequency. This large separation in frequencies results in a device with much greater stability and better performance over temperature enabling the use of this technology in metric tracking hardware and tactical navigation applications. The TRL at the beginning of the contract is between zero and one. At the end of the contract the TRL will be 3.","Commercial application within NASA: The proposed technology will result in a small and low power inertial sensor capable of providing tactical grade performance comparable to a fiber optic gyro.  This technology will benefit metric tracking of launch vehicles in situations where GPS signals are unreliable. Furthermore, the small size of this technology will benefit small space craft in navigation and guidance. For aerospace applications, MEMS scale gyroscopes with performance characteristic similar to that of fiber optic gyros will enable high performance navigation in small unmanned systems.","Successful development of this project lays the foundation for commercial impact in a number of areas. For navigation GPS is commonly used in applications where fiber optic gyroscopes or ring laser gyroscopes are either too large or expensive. In many situations GPS signals are unreliable (such as in areas where they could be jammed or indoors) or they are unavailable such as underground. Petroleum and gas exploration, mining, aerospace systems and consumer electronic devices will benefit from the development of technology. In petroleum and gas exploration, directional drilling and wellbore navigation will benefit from the development of robust and stable MEMS scale gyroscopes capable of operation while drilling. For consumer applications this technology will enable personal navigation in areas where GPS signals are unreliable.","Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

Key goals are:  characterize X-ray sources for navigation purposes; automate pulse shape catalogue tools; automate XNAV/pulsar noise prediction tools; aperiodic source evaluation; photon energy performance enhancement; create integrated catalogs of XNAV guide stars and XNAV-applicable aperiodic sources; identify and document the key periodic X-ray source characteristics impacting the performance of the XNAV instruments and system.  This comprehensive characterization categorizes and provides the necessary parameters regarding these celestial sources that make them beneficial for spacecraft navigation.  Based upon past research work, specific information about each unique X-ray source must be attained in order for the source to yield its optimum capabilities.  We will identify the appropriate parameters for characterizing aperiodic or transient sources for their use in navigation.   Additionally, the existing X-ray source catalogue will be updated and enhanced.  Phase II will focus on implementing these source models in detailed XNAV simulations and potentially creating flight software versions of these models.","XNAV is a game changing technology for NASA, enabling new missions, providing navigation autonomy and redundancy and offering a path to reduce the scheduling demands on DSN, a valuable NASA asset.  There are several promising NASA applications for XNAV where the improvements in navigational accuracy will either enable new missions, or reduce their costs, including missions to the outer planets, and non-planetary missions to deep space.  Missions to Mars and the moon can take advantage of the autonomous navigation capabilities of XNAV, providing redundancy and reducing the need for regular DSN contacts, lessening the burden on this over-taxed system,  The new software tools proposed will support XNAV mission analysis and flight software implementation.  The X-ray source almanac development and maintenance associated with this project would be required to support all of these applications.","The primary non-NASA XNAV applications would be to provide primary or secondary navigation services for DoD missions. For MEO, GEO, HEO, and even cis-lunar missions, where GPS has limited availability, XNAV can provide primary autonomous navigation capability. In addition, XNAV could provide an essential backup navigation capability for missions that normally rely on GPS, but have a need for continuity of operations in the event of loss or denial of GPS. These applications were being actively studied through DARPA's first XNAV program in 2004-06, and key Microcosm team members had strong ties to that program.

Tahoe RF is proposing to build a fully integrated radiation hardened beam steerable GPS receiver front end system that will support NASA's requirements for onboard navigation systems for on-orbit near-earth missions. This frontend system, termed ""BeamDirect"", will not only provide NASA with a software configurable radio receiver for all of the GPS frequency bands, but will also provide ability to do beamforming and beamsteering under software control. Tahoe RF is uniquely positioned to develop this system for NASA for two reasons. First, Tahoe RF has a proven core competency for the design of high performance multiple integrated GPS receivers on a single die. Second, Tahoe RF has recently demonstrated the feasibility of an integrated monolithic beamformer Integrated Circuit (IC) that employs LO phase-shifting techniques through coupled oscillator array. Both of these systems (GPS receiver ICs and beamformers IC) were developed in IBM SiGe process that inherently provides radiation tolerance. Hence by integrating both of these technologies, Tahoe RF can uniquely provide a fully integrated, miniaturized, radiation hardened beam-steerable GPS frontend receiver system.","The BeamDirect GPS system will be designed as custom ASIC chipset to be utilized in the navigation systems of spacecraft. This solution will provide NASA with a compact, low power solution that can be deployed in all spacecrafts including small satellites. The BeamDirect technology is able to provide beamsteering capability to both transmitter and receivers and hence can be integrated into future transceivers to provide a fully integrated communication system.The circuit design, layout and analysis technique will be learnt in this project will facilitate future design of integrated circuits for radiation hardness and extreme-temperature environments. These methodologies and techniques will allow for future design and implementations of fully integrated circuits to help develop low power, high efficiency, compact, radiation-hardened circuits.","Several military applications where this technology can be applied are: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Most of these vehicles are unable to carry any phase array antenna system due to payload constraints. The technology developed under this proposal will achieve the SWaP (Size, Weight & Power) target so as to enable this capability for these vehicles. Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUV) UUV will also similarly benefit from having this capability.

The algorithm will be capable of operating when measurement data is available on an intermittent basis.  An FDI algorithm for faults in the three translational and rotational modes of 4 satellites flying in formation in a highly elliptical orbit will be designed during the Phase 1 effort.  The satellites will carry a limited suite of instruments, just sufficient to determine faults in the three translational and rotational modes and include a GPS receiver.  Communication with a ground station will only be available near perigee.  The measurement data is not stored and transmitted in bursts, so these communication blackouts represent a break in the time history of measurements.  The proposed development will mitigate these breaks so that fault detection and isolation can be performed faster than in a simple, cyclical restart implementation.  Furthermore, their elliptical orbit will carry the satellites beyond the GPS constellation.  The proposed development will account for the loss of GPS coverage as well investigate ways of extending the useful of GPS (when signals are weak) for fault detection and isolation.","This type of system may be implemented on NASA flight test experiments for formations of satellites where resources restrictions limit the implementation of code not associated with flight control and the payload.  Furthermore, this system can be readily applied to existing missions to enhance reliability and safety without having to change the on-board flight software.  For example, the proposed FDI algorithm can be applied directly to the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites to verify thruster and accelerometer performance.  The MMS satellites are resource-limited and cannot communicate with each other.

It will contain an expanded state vector used to estimate non-Gaussian forcing functions perturbing the vehicle's dynamics.  This navigator will integrate the measurements from diverse sensors running at different rates.  And it will demonstrate accurate estimation of uncertain dynamics parameters that are affecting the vehicle's state such as the gravitation field of small bodies.","The navigation system offered will be available as a ""plugin"" for several simulation analysis platforms including GMAT, GIPSY, and GEONS (potentially others), to provide users of these existing NASA tools with its advanced filtering capabilities. By providing this function to designers in an easily integrated package, users can benefit from the expanded capability provided during all phases of vehicle design, analysis, test and flight. This will be particularly useful during the early design stage when major decisions and trades are being made whose impacts are historically difficult to assess. The system can also be utilized during verification and assessment of designs brought forward by commercial providers to reliably ascertain the performance expected from a given hardware configuration and identify areas of weakness early in the design when they are most easily addressed.The product can also be utilized by those currently operating an on-orbit spacecraft or analyzing flight data to expand the capabilities of their navigation system. The proposed filtering package can be used to provide improved estimates of difficult to measure real-time effects like the gravitational potential of a small body or ionospheric error in a GPS measurement. The system can also be used as an inline analysis tool to provide a vehicle's position based on observation data or as a ground-analysis tool to verify the function of onboard algorithms and solutions.","Multiple applications for this type of particle filter software package exist in the broader spaceflight community and outside of the aerospace industry entirely.

The CubeSat platform and the Plug-and-Play concept have prompted the development of attitude determination hardware typical of larger, more sophisticated, three axis stabilized spacecraft, including miniature gyroscopes and star cameras.  The X-ray Star Scanner is a new class of attitude sensor, designed to support precision spin-stabilized CubeSat missions by providing arcminute attitude accuracy in a size compatible with a CubeSat, in fact occupying less than half of a 1U CubeSat module.  The scientific and technological advances necessary to make this instrument possible are in place.  A robust catalog of x-ray guide stars is available through several all-sky surveys performed in x-rays.  Solid state x-ray detectors and their related support electronics have been flown.  The concept of using guide stars to determine the attitude of a spinning vehicle has been demonstrated using flight data.  The XSS fills the need created by the CubeSat and Plug-and-Play platforms for accurate attitude determination on a spin stabilized platform provided in a small package.","The X-ray Star Scanner will provide a precision attitude reference for spin-stabilized spacecraft with a design targeting CubeSat class spacecraft.  However, this attitude sensor will be useful to any spin-stabilize spacecraft requiring arcminute level attitude determination accuracy such that the X-ray Star Scanner will be useful on other small spacecraft platforms being developed at NASA.  This instrument will enable new missions by providing arcminute level point accuracies for spacecraft supporting key NASA missions such as:  Earth mapping and observing missions; solar and astronomical observatories; space weather missions; and planetary, lunar and asteroid mapping and observing missions.  Finally, the instrument developed for the XSS can be used as the basis for the development of an X-ray Navigation (XNAV) instrument.  The XSS will have at least 50 cm2 of collecting area, a collimator and hardware for the collection and time-tagging of photons from the instrument.  While an XNAV instrument will likely require more collecting area, higher precision photon time-tagging and different navigation algorithms, the XSS hardware represents a good starting point for the development of the XNAV instrument.","The X-ray Star Scanner will find users outside of NASA in the smallsat and CubeSat communities in general, but more specifically, with organizations such as the Air Force Robotics Laboratory and the National Reconnaissance Office.  As the CubeSat concept becomes more accepted, the potential uses for, and users of, the XSS will grow.  For example, AFRL has been developing a 6U size ""Cubesat"" that could be used as the basis for a spin-stabilized spacecraft.  There are several obvious DoD applications for precision spin stabilized spacecraft, including electronic intelligence, space weather observations, rapid responsive space communications satellites and earth observing spacecraft in Thompson Spinner configurations, in which the spacecraft spin axis is aligned with the orbit normal.  This allows a simple linear array to be swept over the Earth, imaging a swath of the Earth's surface as the spacecraft orbits.  These spacecraft could produce detailed multispectral images of the Earth's surface on a recurring basis, with image registration on the order of 100 m from an altitude of 400 km, all in a compact CubeSat form factor and capable of quick turn-around and launch on an as-needed basis.",Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring)

The ODYBOLP approach will enable users to analyze space missions using: (a) all possible stable and unstable periodic orbits near LPs of Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon systems, etc.; (b) all possible periodic orbits near asteroids and comets; (c) possible dynamic transitions between different orbits connecting them to each other to organize space for near-zero fuel cost passageways through such orbits. The ODYBOLP software will be integrated into standard NASA software (GMAT, JAT, etc.) for mission analysis and design. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of the ODYBOLP approach. In Phase II, POC will develop a fully functional software system and demonstrate its complete feasibility.","The proposed ODYBOLP will extend NASA leadership in design and analysis of space missions using unstable orbital trajectories in the vicinity of small bodies and libration points. It will improve libration point dynamical system models associated with the multi-body problem and celestial small bodies and provide methods to use these models in space mission analysis and design.

However, the reflection from the Earth's surface can easily mask the cloud signal via the coded waveforms range sidelobe response. The requirement for detecting these clouds from space is severe and significant innovations are required to meet them. The proposed research addresses this requirement and is supported by staff who have significant experience in MMW system development, having built and flown the first airborne cloud radar utilizing FM chirp pulse compression.","The proposed research is a critical component of CloudSat follow-on missions and potential missions to explore methane clouds and precipitation on Titan. In addition the techniques proposed would be of general benefit to the meteorological community in improving sensitivity while maintaining the integrity of cloud boundary location and cloud edge reflectivity measurements, especially in convective systems where large reflectivity gradients exist.","Numerous commercial applications exist for a low range sidelobe MMW radar pulse compression scheme. Currently, low power MMW sensors are used in a number of industrial applications, including 3-D machine vision systems that rely on the radar for target identification and obstacle avoidance. In addition there are new opportunities in developing obstacle avoidance radars for helicopters and unmanned aircraft and vehicles that would directly benefit from the proposed research.","Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Microwave; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport)"

Current 3D tomographic data gathering techniques require multiple flight passes to gather data at different phase centers.  The two technology advancements proposed enabling improvements in the collection of SAR data for ice-sounding and subsurface exploration are compact, multi-band HF/VHF antennas and multi-channel data acquisition systems.  Multi-band antennas enable a single antenna to be used over both spectrums most often used for subsurface exploration; their compact design facilitates the placement of multiple antennas on a single platform to enable data collection at multiple phase centers.  This advancement is complemented by the development of a multi-channel data acquisition system, which enables the simultaneous collection of data at multiple phase centers.  Collecting data simultaneously at multiple phase centers improves data collection by reducing instabilities in measurement locations produced by varying flight paths.  Additionally, cost of collection is reduced due the minimization of flight time needed to collect data.  Phase I will include the development, fabrication and testing of the antenna system (TRL3  TRL6), while forming a concept design for the multi-channel acquisition system (TRL1  TRL2).","Multiple NASA programs will be able to utilize one or all of the 3D tomography technologies developed under this program including work related to MARSIS (or follow-on programs), the SCLP snow radar and the ice sheet depth sounder.  A follow-on program to the MARSIS mission could employ at least two antennas, with a multi-channel radar system facilitating the gathering data for 3D tomography in a reduced number of passes at VHF.  Due to the large wavelengths, multi-pass data collection is likely required in the HF spectrum.  Two programs identified in the decadal survey which could benefit from advances made in this program are the ice sheet depth sounder and the SCLP snow radar.  The snow radar could employ the multi-channel acquisition system to apply tomographic techniques to snow accumulation rates, while the ice sheet depth sounder could use both the antenna and multi-channel receiver for similar purposes.","Beyond application for NASA missions, other commercialization opportunities come from federal and municipal sources.  Spectrums in the HF and VHF are commonly used for foliage penetration and the detection of hidden targets underground.  Federal customers could clearly benefit from the greater application of 3D tomography at these frequency ranges to add another dimension of resolution to their future surveillance platforms.  Municipal organizations may also utilize 3D tomography for the better detection of soil moisture, as well as improvements in estimating snow cover in mountainous areas.  There are many other applications in the areas of academia and industry which could benefit from 3D tomographic imagery.  Some of those include climate research, structure integrity evaluation, subsurface object location for utilities and geophysical feature locating.","3D Imaging; Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Antennas; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Microwave; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Transmitters/Receivers"

Low-power digitization of the resultant wide multi-GHz frequency band (e.g., 2-8 GHz) using a broadband superconductor analog-to-digital converter (ADC) enables high fidelity digital readout with immunity from noise, interference and cross-talk. HYPRES, Inc. has recently demonstrated a series of broadband digital radio receivers, built around a fast superconductor ADC.  This ADC has low noise, low power, high linear dynamic range, and high radiation resistance. HYPRES proposes to design a similar ADC which is optimized for readout of a frequency-multiplexed sensor array such as that in the MicroSpec far-infrared spectrometer now being developed by NASA GSFC for future space missions. The superconductor ADC can be closely integrated and matched with the cryogenic sensors, enabling both reduction in system power and scaling to large imaging arrays.  During Phase I, HYPRES will adapt a phase modulation-demodulation ADC for broadband (8 GHz) input, layout and fabricate an IC combining ADC with digital readout circuitry, and measure ADC performance with RF tones and an RF comb to simulate the frequency-multiplexed output of a sensor array. We will also assess the digital readout system for noise and thermal budget, and design the array interface for Phase II implementation.  During Phase II, HYPRES will work with GSFC to integrate the ADC with a system testbed for the MicroSpec spectrometer and demonstrate its performance.","Future NASA space telescopes for the microwave and far-infrared regimes require large arrays of micro-bolometers and other ultra-sensitive sensors.

In this work, IIIAN proposes using group III-nitride materials, specifically AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures, to fabricate LNAs for microwave radiometers operating from 165 GHz up to 270 GHz.  The group III-nitrides have excellent physical properties for high frequency transistors with the added benefit that the high breakdown voltage of the material renders them less susceptible to failure due to spurious strong signals, eliminating the need for protective circuitry between the antenna and the LNA.Passive microwave radiometers used in the PATH and GACM missions are used to quantify levels of trace species in the atmosphere such as O3, CO, N2O, HNO3, ClO and SO2, and also to estimate water content, both gas phase and as aerosols.  The instruments used for these measurements rely on microwave emission from the relevant species.  Key to such low signal level measurements are front-end LNAs used to amplify the weak microwave emission signal from the antenna prior to the RF detection diode.","In addition to the applications for microwave radiometry discussed in this proposal, nitride LNAs will also find application within NASA for space communications and navigation.  In the 2010 NASA SBIR solicitation, Topic O1.03 calls for ,"" Ka-band RF Devices and Components: Investigate novel RF (especially Ka-band) communications technologies and innovative approaches for high bandwidth, Ka-band devices and components (transceivers, modulators, highly efficient amplifiers, etc.).

The approach of this project is to explore the performance of capacitive MEMS switching technology at low temperatures. MEMS capacitive switches represent an alternative to ohmic contact switches, where the RF impedance of the device is not dependent on metal-metal contacts. These MEMS switches operate with much lower effective series resistance (generally ~ 0.25 ohms) and do not have the issues associated with dry contact switching. This technology also has the advantage of operating very well at millimeter-wave frequencies and higher, where many of the most demanding performance limitations exist. This technology has seen significant investment through DARPA and the DOD, and is directly applicable to high-performance microwave components needed in several of the upcoming NASA missions.","Low-loss, low-power microwave and millimeter-wave switching devices are very important to the development of a variety of NASA sensors and communications systems.  In sensors, this RF MEMS technology will be very useful in radiometer systems.  Using MEMS to switch polarizations in focal plane detectors is one very useful function.  This is especially true for bolometric detectors, where very low loss and low power dissipation devices are required.  The MEMS provide a convenient platform for routing and phase shifting the microwave or millimeter-wave signals being sensed.  Applications include earth-based monitoring for xxx and space-based survey missions, including PATH, SCLLP, GACM, and the Beyond Einstein Inflation Probe for probing the cosmic microwave background emission.","One of the dominant applications of RF MEMS being pursued today is that of tunable or reconfigurable filters in the microwave and millimeter-wave frequency ranges.  High performance waveguide filters are a staple of satellite and earth-based communications systems.  Unfortunately, those high-performance filters are large, heavy, and expensive (each one is hand crafted).  One excellent application of MEMS technology is making those filter tunable, so that a single filter can be reconfigured or adapted to changing requirements and usage.  One excellent application of tunable filters is in cellular base station applications.  Currently, transmitter head at cell phone sites have fixed channel filters which on occasion need to be changed out do to changing requirements in base station coverage or services.  This requires manual replacement of filters, a significant logistics issue for both manpower and inventory to keep the 100,000+ US cell phone sites updated.  A tunable filter would enable remote retuning of filters to save significant expense.  The development of this cryogenic switch technology would be compatible with the superconducting filter technology and offer some very interesting product capabilities for tunable, superconducting filters.","Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Electromagnetic; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Microwave; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Radio; Radiometric; Routers, Switches; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Terahertz (Sub-millimeter)"

The proposed detector arrays will offer near-BLIP sensitivity, with R0A values comparable to HgCdTe detectors, but with superior sensitivity, better uniformity, lower dark current, and much better pixel yield. Typical InGaAs detectors have little response beyond 1650 nm due to the band edge of the InGaAs alloy composition that is lattice-matched to the InP substrate, and the InP substrate blocks short wavelength response below 950 nm in back-illuminated focal plane arrays. The proposed detector will employ low-dislocation-density metamorphic InGaAs to extend long wavelength response to 2.6 um. Chemical/mechanical substrate removal and a surface doping gradient designed to collect photocarriers generated near the light-entry surface of the detector will extend its short-wavelength response. Prototype single-element detectors and segmented arrays will be demonstrated in Phase I. In Phase II, material quality will be refined through additional manufacturing development, and large area arrays will be fabricated.

Two proposed NASA missions will require anticoincidence shielding for x-ray and gamma-ray spectrometers: the High Energy Telescope of the EXIST (Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope) mission, and the Space Science Vision Mission expected to visit Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Shielding improves the performance of x-ray and gamma-ray spectrometers by reducing the effect of charged particle interactions which cannot be distinguished from true x-ray and gamma-ray interactions by the spectrometer. Active shields produce a blanking signal when a charged particle is detected, so that the signal from the spectrometer can be ignored during the spectrometer's charged-particle interaction. While it is well know that this technique produces significant improvement in x-ray and gamma-ray spectrometer performance, the technology to implement it is lacking. The attributes of mercuric iodide make it an excellent candidate for anticoincidence shielding detectors. Because of its detection characteristics, light weight, small size, low cost, robustness, and ease of application to non-planar geometries, this material can replace the costly, heavy, and bulky scintillator/photomultiplier tube (PMT) systems currently in use.","Space-based gamma-ray spectrometers will benefit from the proposed improved polycrystalline mercuric iodide active anticoincidence shield.

This project can partially satisfy the requirement of EUV+FUV (70-200nm) scan range for the JEO and the FUV+MUV (110-330nm) range for the Jupiter-Ganymede-Orbiter (JGO) Since radiation levels in the MRad range are estimated for the EJSM, the Phase II effort of this program on developing rad-hard readout electronics based on the current CoolCAD-NASA program experience with cryogenic and radiation testing of bulk and SOS devices for NASA, can prove to be very valuable.Earth Orbit Mission Applications: Deep UV detectors and associated readout electronics that is designed to be radiation hard and visible and solar blind, can be used extensively for next generation hyperspectral Earth remote sensing experiments.

In the proposed program, back-illuminated, back-thinned SiPMs optimized for UV response and scalable tiling over very large areas will be developed for observation of air showers from ultra-high energy cosmic rays (JEM-EUSO) as well as for visible-wavelength spectrographic and photometric instruments planned for future telescopes (OWL). Short-wavelength light is absorbed near the surface of a silicon detector, and moving the optical entry surface to the back side of the wafer will enhance UV response by ensuring that all photocarriers from UV photons are generated on the correct side of the junction for efficient avalanche multiplication. Placing the optical entry surface on the back of the wafer will also improve optical fill factor because it will no longer be necessary to shine light through the quench resistor network on the front surface of the detector. Lastly, back-thinning the detector wafer will significantly reduce the mass per unit area of the focal plane array.

Blocking filters are essential components in these cryogenic detectors to minimize thermal load while admitting the soft x-rays of interest. Theoretically, an aluminum coating 15-20 nm thick, on each filter in the stack will provide the necessary IR attenuation. In practice, coatings this thin are less optically dense than predicted, and thickness must be nearly doubled to achieve sufficient thermal blocking. This degrades performance. The proposed innovation is to improve the thin aluminum blocking layer to increase its optical density and thermal rejection performance. Preliminary work suggests it is possible to increase the visible and IR light rejection of aluminized polyimide by a factor of 3 or more. In Phase 1, test samples will be made through altered processes.

Particle sensors and electric field sensors can have similar requirements creating a significant need for deployable booms. Currently, these booms are usually custom designed for each spacecraft, resulting in wasted development costs through repetition. The Composite Rolled Magnetometer and Instrument Boom (CROMIB) will be a highly capable, standardized boom for field instruments that can be scaled from 2m long to 12m long. CROMIB is a slit-tube rolled boom that will deploy using strain energy to simplify the storage canister and eliminate the motor and motor electronics. Rolling the boom provides a highly compact stowed volume. Recurring cost will be roughly 1/3 of the cost for custom designing a segmented deployable boom. CROMIB builds upon the composite boom experience gained from rolled solar arrays.","Compact, mass efficient and cost effective composite booms are needed to deploy magnetometers for Earth observation satellites, magnetometers for planetary probes, and electric field sensors. Literally hundreds of magnetometer booms have been designed and flown since the dawn of the space age. Despite the common need for non-metallic booms, a convenient and simple standard deployable boom has not emerged as a competitive solution. In addition, a simple canisterized boom could be used for gravity gradient booms for small spacecraft, and for deploying solar sails. With adaptations for higher torque output, a self-deployed composite boom could also be used to support solar arrays and phased array antennas. Finally, the design could be adapted to deploy a large drag sail to reduce the deorbit time of medium and large satellites in higher LEO orbits at the end of mission life to meet NASA requirements for reduction of orbital debris.","Magnetometers and field sensors also have potential commercial applications. To date, Earth survey using magnetometers for commercial purposes has utilized NASA sensors, however. Commercial dedicated surveys have relied on magnetometers flown on aircraft to study small areas in detail. However, there would be commercial value in higher resolution, more sensitive magnetometry data available on a worldwide basis. This data may be commercially enabled as an additional function of commercial imaging satellites by a low cost magnetometer boom.

The V-400-LF instrument is intended for making high-resolution magnetic field measurements of planets and in interplanetary space on small satellites and spacecraft. The Phase 1 effort includes development of designs for advanced miniaturized components and a conceptual design for a miniaturized V-400-LF instrument in order to establish the feasibility of designing and fabricating a prototype V 400-LF in Phase 2. Laser-pumped helium magnetometers have proven to be world-class instruments for measuring the direction and magnitude of the geomagnetic and planetary fields. The V-400-LF will build on the heritage of the Low-field Vector Helium Magnetometer (LVHM), the Scalar Helium Magnetometer (SHM), and the laser-pumped vector/scalar Self-calibrating Vector Helium Magnetometer (SVHM). The goal of Phase 1 is development of a conceptual design for a miniaturized instrument appropriate for small spacecraft and microsatellites. This miniaturization will be accomplished through the use of advanced miniaturized components and packaging methods for the V-400-LF Sensor and Electronics. The V-400-LF can be used to measure vector components of low magnetic fields, scalar gradients (difference of vector magnitude measurements from two V-400-LF instruments), and gradient tensor elements (difference between vector components using three or more instruments) with very high stability and accuracy. The V-400-LF will have a dynamic range of +/- 1,000 nT, a sensitivity of 10 pT/rtHz at 1 Hz, and a calibrated accuracy of +/- 0.5 nT. The sample rate will be 430 Hz. The TRL is expected to be 4 at the end of the Phase 1 contract.","The V-400-LF is intended for NASA spacecraft and satellites that will measure low magnetic fields in interplanetary space as part of heliophysics investigations or studies of planets and planetoids that do not have a strong magnetic field. With modifications to increase the dynamic range, other opportunities include future microsatellite missions and proposed magnetic surveys in cooperation with NASA, USGS, and NOAA. The vector laser magnetometers are also under consideration for volcanic eruption predictions and geo-potential changes in the Earth's crust associated with earthquakes and subduction zones. The miniaturized V-400-LF will find wide application in future missions focused on the accurate measurement of the magnetic field components and their orientation in low-field regions. Applications of the technology developed in this SBIR project include advanced instruments for airborne, satellite, and surface measurements of magnetic fields on Earth and for other bodies in the Solar System. The V-400-LF instrument, with its high accuracy, stability, and sensitivity along with a compact size, will also be a superior vector magnetometer for reference, calibration, and measurement applications in large magnetic coil facilities or shielded facilities that can reduce the magnitude of the magnetic field for evaluation of spacecraft components.","The V-400-LF technology with higher dynamic range can be used for surface and airborne magnetic prospecting. Polatomic is jointly exploring use of the V-400-LF technology in a tensor gradiometer configuration for mineral and petroleum exploration with Southern Methodist University. In addition, there is a need for improved high-resolution magnetic mapping and magnetic location systems for marine industries. The V-400-LF technology in a tensor gradiometer configuration could provide increased resolution for marine mapping of magnetic buried objects, pipe lines, buried cables and ship wreck search and salvage. The V-400-LF magnetometer and gradiometer can be easily mated to magnetic gradiometer software for such purposes. Furthermore, the V 400-LF technology will have applications in UAVs and UUVs used for sea surveillance for Anti-Submarine Warfare and for over-land surveillance for tanks under trees, tunnels, and underground facilities. Polatomic's vector magnetometers are being considered by the Office of Naval Research for use on a Navy Global Hawk (BAMS) for geomagnetic noise reduction for submarine dipole detection. Polatomic is pursuing opportunities in magnetic detection of tunnels and underground facilities with Argon ST that have applications for border security and monitoring.

The heat rejected can be absorbed by an upper stage cryocooler or rejected to space through a small cryo-radiator.

In addition, the cryocooler technology is extremely reliable and scalable, and produces no perceptible vibration.  The key innovation is a cryogenic compressor which has heritage to the cryogenic circulator developed by Creare and operated on the Hubble Space Telescope for 6.5 years.  On the Phase I project, we will optimize the cryocooler design for a particular mission class and predict the performance of the cryocooler using component-level test data.

This portable instrument will provide rapid (1 Hz), highly accurate (to better than ± 1 ppbv) quantification of NO2 with minimal external calibration or consumables gases.  Moreover, due to the inherent benefits of iCRDS, the analyzer will be selective, robust, and economical.  The resulting instrument will allow researchers in NASA's Earth Science Division to use miniature UAV deployments to complement satellite observations on the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission.  The in-situ data will provide higher spatial resolution and vertical profiling near the highly inhomogeneous NO2 sources, as well as providing correction factors for GEO-CAPE coastal measurements.","The Earth Science Decadal Survey recommends NO2 monitoring as part of a mission dedicated to the measurement of tropospheric trace gases and coastal ocean color.  In response, NASA is developing the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission.  This mission measures both air pollution and ocean color, and targets a variety of species, including NO2.  Many NO2 sources exhibit large spatial inhomogeneity and increased spatial and vertical resolution is required to interpret and verify satellite data.  Likewise, ocean color measurements must be corrected for NO2 concentrations.  In both cases, in-situ, airborne measurements of NO2 are required to complement the GEO-CAPE data.  In the past, NASA has made such in-situ measurements using comprehensive, large-scale, field campaigns on piloted aircraft.  Future campaigns will rely on smaller, manned and unmanned aircraft such as the SIERRA UAV and Aerosonde.  Thus, new instrumentation is required that can autonomously measure NO2 while meeting the size, weight, and power limitations of these smaller aircraft.","Besides its application to NASA, a compact, ultrasensitive NO2 analyzer also has significant commercial applications for environmental compliance monitoring, industrial process control, and scientific instrumentation.  The proposed work is essential in making these instruments more compact, rugged, and cost competitive, and will thus enlarge the potential market size significantly.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)"

One typical flux measurement setup involves placing measurement equipment (sonic anemometers and associated sensors or samplers) on rigid towers (rigidity being required to provide a stable platform for the sonic anemometers).  These towers are relatively immobile, and cannot be readily moved nor installed in remote locations.  This prevents fluxes or vertical profiles of trace species from being measured in many remote areas.   Anasphere will develop a tethersonde system which will allow flux measurements to be made using tethered blimps or kites.  The tethersonde modules will incorporate a three-dimensional sonic anemometer plus motion-correction sensors so that the motion of the tether and module may be removed from the wind measured by the sonic anemometer.  The result will be a highly mobile flux tower.   In Phase I, a proof-of-concept tethersonde module will be built and tested which incorporates a three-dimensional sonic anemometer and motion-correction sensors.  It will be tested in flight.  Phase II work will see the refinement of the modules and sensor algorithms, as well as extensive field tests.","The new tethersonde will facilitate a wide variety of in-situ earth science measurements, particularly those related to science areas within the Atmospheric Composition focus area.  It may be used for the measurement of trace gas fluxes in remote areas.  It may also be used to conduct basic meteorological and turbulence research.  Its inherent mobility, as it will be deployable by tethered blimps and kites, means that it can be taken to remote areas and set up with minimal effort.   The tethersonde system may also be of use to other NASA programs.  For example, it can provide local wind profile measurements in support of various flight operations.",Other government and academic researchers will be able to use the system for the same purposes as were described above for NASA.

During significant solar events, dose rates can exceed safety thresholds. To mitigate the radiation dose rate and total dose hazards, a unique, state-of-the-art system of physics-based models and real-time data characterizing the aviation radiation environment called Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation for Aviation Safety (NAIRAS) is undergoing development. However, validation of the NAIRAS system must occur to provide confidence that accurate nowcasts, and eventually forecasts, can be made for the aviation radiation environment. The Automated Radiation Measurements for Aviation Safety (ARMAS) project will provide that validation in a cost-effective manner. The Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) radiation detector measures the rate and total quantities of absorbed dose and dose equivalent during aircraft flights. These measurements help estimate the biological risk associated with radiation exposure to humans. Up to three flights of TEPC will be flown during the first half of the performance period. The flight regimes are designed to test a range of representative radiation environments. TEPC results will be analyzed in the second half of the performance period and compared with NAIRAS to validate modeled flight profile results.","NASA has a demonstrated interest in quality, cutting-edge research that leads to revolutionary capabilities for the airspace system and the aircraft that fly within it. Aviation safety has been a strong concern for those developing the nation's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), particularly in the area of technologies for improved aviation crew safety. ARMAS, when automated and operational in Phase III will provide data for assimilation into the NAIRAS system and will facilitate a safer and more efficient air transportation system. ARMAS will enable the airline industry, crew, frequent flyers, and FAA to more quickly and accurately mitigate radiation exposure risk due to cosmic rays and solar energetic particle events.","The identified customer of ARMAS is the NAIRAS system. NAIRAS identified customers are the commercial airline industry (airline corporations, aircrew professional associations, and frequent flyer customers), the FAA, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and NOAA/SWPC. Most major U.S. commercial air carriers, along with the airline pilots and flight attendants professional unions, have strongly supported an active, and accurate, radiation exposure risk specification capability. ARMAS in Phase III will provide the accuracy and timeliness of measurements that can be assimilated into advanced physics-based models for global effective dose rate specification and radiation risk mitigation. The ARMAS commercialization strategy will first obtain ambient dose equivalent rates using TEPC and will validate the NAIRAS system results in Phase I. In Phase II we will develop a prototype system to include aircraft measurements retrieved through services (TAMDAR-like) for data assimilation into NAIRAS.

Airborne eddy flux covariance measurements enable regional-scale investigations of carbon sources and sinks as well as measurements in areas where conventional tower flux deployments are infeasible.  These data complement current satellite observations by providing higher horizontal resolution and vertical profiling, enabling better quantification of carbon sources and sinks.

ECqcLTM based portable sensors have also been used to demonstrate the detection of 12CO2 and 13CO2 isotopologues at atmospheric CO2 concentrations.The ECqcLTM-QEPAS technique involves tightly focusing an infrared laser beam between the prongs of a commercial quartz tuning fork (QTF). Absorption of the laser emission by the sample heats up the gas between the prongs of the QTF. The resulting pressure spike is detected as an electrical signal due to a deformation of the prongs that results in a charge separation on electrodes deposited on the QTF prongs. Acoustically a QTF is a quadrupole, which results in excellent environmental noise immunity.By scanning the laser over a wide tuning range, the spectra of multiple atmospheric gas species can be recorded using only a single laser. The QEPAS technique does not require a sample chamber and air volumes as small as 1 mm3 containing atmospheric concentrations of 12CO2, 13CO2, CO, CH4, NO2, H2O2, H2CO, O3, and bromine oxides can be measured with ppb sensitivity.Both QEPAS and ECqcLTM technologies are amenable to miniaturization, monolithic construction, and mass production following a straightforward engineering path using established MEMS technologies. The result would be a small, battery-operated, rugged sensor package that can be mass produced at low cost. The sensor would be insensitive to environmental factors and deployment platform independent. Wireless communication, self-calibration, and remote servicing are inherent components of such a miniaturized monolithic sensor package.","Compact sensors based on ECqcLTM and QEPAS technology for the trace detection of atmospheric gases are of interest to several NASA centers, such as Goddard Space Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and collaborating groups of NCAR and NOAA. CO2, CH4, N2O and O3 are primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, but also in other planetary atmospheres. The proposed sensor technology will not only serve to augment existing non-laser instrumentation, but also to study the feasibility and implementation of new innovative techniques with the precision and accuracy necessary for in-situ measurements and remote sensing of Earth and other planetary atmospheres as indicated in this subtopic, as well as subtopic S1.09:  In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Planetary Science.Another important NASA application is to detect, monitor and quantify the reactive intermediate formaldehyde (H2CO), which is one of the most abundant gas phase carbonyl compounds in the atmosphere and has been of interest to atmospheric scientists for many years. This gas is formed in the atmosphere from the oxidation of most anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons. Formaldehyde is also directly emitted into the atmosphere from biomass burning, incomplete combustion, industrial emissions, and by emissions from vegetation. Typical atmospheric mixing ratios vary from ~1 ppbv to several 10s of ppbv for polluted air over urban regions and air influenced by petrochemical refinery emissions.","Daylight Solutions believes that there are numerous applications for a compact, battery powered, low cost sensor that can detect trace gases (parts-per-billion and below) within a mixture of other gases. Applications exist within the DOD, DHS, first responder, and forensic communities for the detection of harmful/lethal gases, explosives, illicit drugs, and a variety of other agents. The portability and sensitivity of this system, along with the instrument's ability to discriminate between target agents and other atmospheric gases, would greatly reduce the false-positive warnings inherent to most current detection schemes, and could provide an early-warning of target gases before they reach dangerous levels. Such low powered sensors could also be dispersed throughout a wide area to create an autonomous environmental monitoring network to measure green house gases. In medical diagnostics, trace gases present in exhaled human breath can be mapped to specific diseases and used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. The detection of very low concentrations of gases would greatly increase process control and contamination monitoring in industrial applications. The device proposed under this SBIR could also provide a low cost method for individuals to monitor their exposure to hazardous materials where wide area monitoring is not possible.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport)"

The measurements are needed to support ocean color algorithm development, validation, & application to remote sensing measurement for the retrieval of biochemical & optical ocean parameters.

Calibration procedures will be established to assure high data quality.  In Phase-II the prototype instrument will be built and tested at sea & data compared to other SIO instruments.  The proposed system will quantify the underwater downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance through simultaneous measurements at several depths (plus the downwelling irradiance incident upon the sea surface), filling a major gap in technological capabilities for providing accurate light field determinations at the ocean surface from data taken within optically dynamic near-surface ocean layer.  In this layer, the usage of commercial radiometers and common measurement strategies is typically inadequate.

The oceans provide the only means of subsistence for many communities around the world, particularly the expanding coastal populations.  The instrumentation package will be marketed to investigators in the government, academia, and international agencies that are involved in the study of oceans, coastal regions, and littoral regions of the globe. The proposed technology supports present NASA systems such as MODIS, SeaWIFS, MERIS, LandSat7, and future GEO-CAPS, HyspIRI, also various NASA/NOAA programs.  It also expands on capabilities that are provided by the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) ocean color vicarious calibration observatory via on-site and on-demand calibration.","The importance of the oceans and coastal waters to the planet's ecosystem and food resources will require increasing level of global and local monitoring and control of such resources (by governments and international agencies).  The submersible instrumentation package proposed herein has applications in maritime operations, fisheries management, water quality monitoring, littoral and coastal zone management.  With its ability to simultaneously measure the upwelling and downwelling spectral radiative fluxes, this sensor will avoid the inaccuracies with today's single point sensors.  This ability addresses a major gap in today's sensors by providing the data required for improved algorithms to estimate in-water constituents/properties.

This TID performance at cold temperatures is the result of utilizing silicon germanium (SiGe) bipolar technology for the ROIC implementation, and will be the largest SiGe imaging ROIC ever designed and demonstrated. This ROIC will be hybridized with an appropriate selected detector array to produce a FPA of unprecedented TID performance. The TID performance will allow for reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) for lunar and deep space instruments, thus saving fuel for the mission.

The first is an image of a hydrothermal pool at Yellowstone: the kind of place life might begin.  The second is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the Allen Hills 84001 meteorite.  This SEM picture is famous for capturing our imaginations when, in 1996, it was thought to show the first pictures of extraterrestrial life.  Whether these SEM images represent Martian life forms or something else, they stirred intense scientific research and vigorous debate within the astrobiology community, and increased public interest in the search for life on Mars.  When extraterrestrial life is conclusively discovered, it will most likely be shown to the world using an image from an electron microscope.Why have no electron microscopes flown on planetary missions?  Because existing SEM's are too large, heavy and fragile to withstand spaceflight. The key to reducing the size and weight of a SEM lies in eliminating the high-vacuum pumping system. In the SEM, every time a new sample is introduced the system must be re-evacuated.  The entire pumping system must travel with the SEM.  This pumping system is heavy, fragile and consumes a lot of power.  It is because of the pumping system that no portable SEM exists, much less one that could travel to Mars.In this proposal, we will eliminate the need for a high-vacuum system in a SEM.  This is accomplished by developing a new electron source that can operate in relatively poor vacuum conditions.  By eliminating the largest, most complex and heavy part of the SEM, this project will develop a truly portable SEM: the Backpack SEM.","NASA researchers collect samples in remote areas such as Antarctica or Mars.  On nearly every mission, taking pictures is a primary goal.  After optical cameras, SEMs are the most-used scientific imaging tool. NASA researchers use SEMs to image virtually any solid sample they collect. This project will make it possible to bring a SEM to remote field locations where NASA scientists collect data.  As such, every field research team at NASA that uses a laboratory SEM is a potential customer for this technology.  These teams include, but are not limited to, planetary geologists studying Martian dust and Titan's organic ""dunes"", astrobiologists analyzing extremophiles from hydrothermal vents, and paleoclimatologists tracking climate change in pollen and volcanic ash.","The Backpack SEM will be of enormous value to field scientists, engineers and experts who rely on electron microscopes to conduct their studies.  Often, field researchers must ""guess and check"" on which samples to collect.  It may take days or weeks to determine if the samples were chosen correctly.  Even the correct samples can be subject to the vagaries of field research: samples can be damaged, can degrade with time, and they can be lost or mislabeled.  Taking a SEM image of the samples in the field, when changes can be made or mistakes corrected, can save weeks or months of time for a project. Virtually any field researcher who uses a SEM could benefit from having one in the field during sample collection.  This is especially true for researchers who travel to remote locations.  Therefore, the most likely first-adopters of the Backpack SEM are geologists, biologists, earth scientists and archeologists.  Engineers or forensic experts who examine infrastructure (bridges, buildings, etc.) may also want to have a SEM in the field with them during data collection.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support)"

(LGR) and Professor Martin Fejer and his group at Stanford University propose to develop and demonstrate a compact, monolithic, efficient, high-power, narrow-linewidth tunable laser source operating in the 3.2-3.4 um wavelength region. LGR's mid-infrared (mid-IR) light source, based on a fiber-laser pumped monolithic optical parametric oscillator (OPO) developed at Stanford, will assist NASA in completing its trace-gas-detection objectives by supplying NASA with a critical, difficult-to-obtain laser source suitable for continuous-wave (cw) spectroscopy. During Phase I, LGR and Stanford will manufacture a monolithic OPO crystal, using techniques established by Stanford, generating between 1-2 W of single-frequency radiation between 3.2-3.4 um. At the end of Phase I, the OPO system will be used to measure transmission through a 50-cm-long methane cell (manufactured by LGR) at wavelengths corresponding to the C-H stretch vibrational resonance, 3.3 um. Technology readiness level (TRL) 4 will be reached at the completion of Phase I. During Phase II, remote detection of methane will be performed using a methane cell and measuring the backscattered light from the cell as the OPO mid-IR frequency is scanned ~5 GHz. The size of the housing for the monolithic OPO will be designed to reduce the overall size and weight of the mid-IR-laser head. Fiber-coupling for the incoming pump and the outgoing mid-IR radiation will be added to the OPO housing enabling simple fiber delivery. Modeling of the system sensitivity in ppm of methane will be performed for the final remote sensing system for ground-, air-, and space-based operation.","Absorption spectroscopy using a tunable OPO is a simple measurement technique known for its high sensitivity (parts per billion) and potentially superior size, weight, and power consumption (SWAP) compared to competing technologies. Also important are sources for remote measurements of carbon-based trace gases (CH4, CO2, and CO) for total column measurements from aircraft and spacecraft, as well as for profiling measurements from the ground using atmospheric backscatter. These systems need tunable, narrow-linewidth lasers that operate in the 3-4 um wavelength band. LGR's monolithic OPOs can also be used for ground-based applications such as detection of gases emitted from combustion processes including jet engines and chemical-rocket exhaust. A high-power laser system in the 3-4 um wavelength region would complement NASA's robust 1- and 2-um systems developed under the Laser Risk Reduction Program. NASA requires LIDAR instruments for accurate measurements of atmospheric parameters with high spatial resolution from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms with an emphasis placed on compactness, efficiency, reliability, and lifetime. NASA needs advanced components for direct-detection LIDAR instruments on new UAV platforms, ground-based test beds, and eventually in space. For gas measurements using tunable laser spectrometers, available platforms such as aircraft, balloons, surface and entry probes and landed rovers impose severe limitations on instrument SWAP.","The portability and robustness of LGR's high-power (>1 W) monolithic mid-IR light source makes it suitable for many non-NASA commercial applications. It is suitable for sensitive detection of methane and ethane for oil and natural gas exploration missions both in ground- and air-based missions. The eye-safe radiation could be used for detection of gases in exhaled human breath providing advanced detection for certain diseases such as diabetes (acetone), oxidative stress and post-operative organ rejection (ethane), and suspected cancer biomarkers (ethane, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde). There have been several advances in the field of medical imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT) as well as photoacoustic imaging using near-IR radiation. LGR's monolithic OPOs are well suited for biomedical imaging due to the tunability and spectral purity. The application of LGR's eye-safe, fiber-coupled mid-IR light source would be suitable for photoacoustic detection of gases as well as biomedical imaging, photoacoustic ultrasound. The tunability of the monolithic OPOs allows for operation in the well-known water-transparency window between 3-4 um. LGR's monolithic OPOs could be used for laser-based data transmission for air- and space-based applications. The monolithic OPO would be used as the transmitter and receiver unit. Access to additional frequency bands allows for larger transfer rates of information in parallel with current space-based laser communication systems.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Emitters; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Infrared; Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Lasers (Medical Imaging); Lasers (Weapons); Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ranging/Tracking; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Transmitters/Receivers"

The vast majority of these devices have presented challenges to the scientists and design engineers to translate what has previously been the domain of the laboratory, into compact and low powered devices. Of the family of detectors that have been used to meet the challenge, none has greater potential, yet been more difficult to miniaturize into a portable form factor, than the mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometers, unlike some spectrometers such as ion mobility (IMS), require a partial pressure region to scan for a given mass number indicative of the trace species of interest. Probably the most significant hurdle yet to overcome is how one can create a cost effective, small, and low power vacuum system. Over the past 30+ years, no significant advance in vacuum pump concepts save for the turbo-molecular pump has been realized. The proposed concept offers a potential for game-changing new technology that may obviate a turbo pump in many applications while promising to provide significant cost savings with unprecedented reliability and longevity for future space missions.","Spacecraft laboratories, such as on the ISS, could benefit greatly from the success of the proposed technology. Using the vacuum of space for an analytical instrument is highly undesirable due to the safety factor of deliberately creating any leaks on a spacecraft or space station, and the discharge of atmospheric gases could affect the space vessel station keeping or trajectory. As a result, there is a need for a means to create a vacuum for analytical devices such as mass spectrometers used on the ISS, probes for interplanetary missions, and possible future hand-held use by astronauts. The proposed electrospray diffusion pump offers the potential to be applied to all aforementioned applications.","Over the past decade, especially the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there has been an increasing demand for sensitive chemical, biological, and explosive detection devices.

Probably the most significant hurdle yet to overcome is how one can create a cost effective, small, and low power vacuum system to make mass spectrometers portable.

The challenge in the automotive space with vehicles carrying multiple radar system, cameras and LIDAR, is that the there is an immense amount of data that is then processed and fused on-board the vehicle to assist the driver, keeping the car in the lane, avoid collisions, prepare for crash, identify pedestrians, road signs and other important information. There is a huge challenge in verification of active safety algorithms and repeatability of tests. Many expeditions simply can't be done again without huge costs, and even then there is no guarantee that a particular situation occur again. Therefore there is a need for a high-speed, high capacity portable data recorder and means for re-simulation and playback of raw-signal history collected directly in the vehicles.

The main advantages in using these techniques for planetary science is the ability to rapidly collect a wealth of chemical information, by simply directing a laser beam on remote targets of interest. As an important component of the Raman/LIBS instrument, Q Peak proposes to develop, build, and test a miniature Q-switched, solid state laser, producing 1-3 mJ, nanosecond-duration pulses at 526 nm wavelength.  We will produce a preliminarily design for integrating the laser into a robotic arm.

A key challenge is to install thermal sensors to the depths > ~3 m, below the fluctuations of the surface thermal environment, with little thermal disturbance to the regolith. The proposed system is novel in two respects: 1) it utilizes a pneumatic (gas) approach, excavates a hole by lofting the lunar soil out of the hole, and 2) deploys the heat flow probe, which utilizes a coiled up tape with 10 equally spaced RTDs and a cone with thermal needle (for conductivity measurement) to reach >3 meter depth. The system is a game-changer for small lunar landers; it exhibits extremely low mass, volume, and simple deployment. The pneumatic system takes advantage of the Helium gas used for pressurizing lander propellant. In vacuum experiments we found that 1g of gas at 5 psia could loft ~6000g of lunar soil simulant at >10m/s.","The heat flow probe deployment system directly answers the need for the International Lunar Network science requirements. Thus, once developed, the probe can be part of the precursor lunar landers payload. In addition to measuring heat flow on the Moon, the probe can be deployed on the future Discovery- and New Frontier-class robotic missions to the moon, Asteroids, Mars, and other planetary bodies. In addition, the instrument may be used by astronauts on Sortie human lunar missions.","Non-NASA applications include measuring of heat flow in areas on earth, where optimal thermal isolation of heaters/temperature sensors is of paramount importance. These for example include areas with hydrocarbon potential. Exploration companies, such as Shell or Chevron, would in particular be interested in this technology. Since these heat probes are small and can be made relatively cheaply, they can be left in earth forever. Thus, the heat flow data can be accumulated indefinitely. This in particular would be important for tracking global climate change and to understand the nature and causes of climate change. Thus, proposed heat flow deployment method, because of potential cost savings, may allow more heat flow probes being deployed around the earth.

The family of diffractive waveplates wherein this modulation is axially symmetric  vector vortex waveplates (VVWs)  impart a spiral phase modulation at a light beam propagated through the waveplate. As a result, the intensity of radiation is sharply decreased at the axis of the beam by many orders of magnitude, depending on the topological charge and quality of the VVW. Such transparent phase components can be successfully employed in coronagraphy allowing imaging of exoplanets at diffraction angle limit of their separation from the bright host star using small aperture telescopes, and they will allow increasing the imaging capability of large telescopes. To achieve this potential, VVWs shall possess with negligibly small singularity size (~ 2 micrometer) and be spectrally broadband in a large aperture (~ 25 mm).

The project outcomes include innovative advances in component design and fabrication and substantial progress in development of high-resolution deformable mirrors (DM) suitable for space-based operation.Space-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade NASA has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. From this work, NASA has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. Boston Micromachines Corporation has developed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) DMs that represent the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control. The emerging class of high-resolution DMs pioneered by the project team has already been shown to be compact, low-power, precise, and repeatable. This project will develop a system that eliminates the leading cause of single actuator failures in electrostatically-actuated wavefront correctors  snap-through instability and subsequent electrode shorting and/or adhesion. To achieve this we will implement two innovative, complementary modifications to the manufacturing process. We will develop a drive electronics approach that inherently limits actuator electrical current density generated when actuator snap-down occurs, and we will modify the actuator design to mitigate adhesion between contacting surfaces of the actuator flexure and fixed base electrode in the event of snap-down.  Phase II research will combine the actuator design and fabrication processes, and current-limiting drive electronics to produce a MEMS DM with 3072 actuators with enhanced reliability.","Space based astronomical imaging systems are inherently challenged by the need to achieve diffraction-limited performance with relatively lightweight optical components. Given the current constraints on fabrication methods, it is necessary to develop new methods of manufacture to increase reliability and prevent single actuator failures.  These higher-quality deformable mirrors will enable diffraction-limited performance for many space-based optical systems such as space-based observatories, interferometric telescopes and coronagraphic instruments for programs such as EPIC, TPF-C, TPF-I and PECO.  By providing wavefront control and correcting for static and thermally induced aberrations of larger optics in a space-based optical platform, the use of a space-qualified MEMS DM will result in a significant performance improvement.   Producing a more reliable and robust MEMS DM will also have a significant benefit for non-space-based optical instruments.  BMC has had success developing arrays up to 4096 elements for the Gemini Planet Imager and with further research can achieve fewer actuator failures during the manufacturing process and better reliability during use.","A universal benefit to all applications is a reliable MEMS device that can withstand voltage spikes and environmental changes that currently still cause failure in MEMS DMs, which in turn leads to more effective correction capabilities and longer device use in the field.  Also, given the higher yield, manufacturing costs can be reduced.  In addition, the following hold true for each individual application:1) Optical communication:  For long-range secure communication, large amounts of data can be sent over long distances using lasercomm systems.  By creating more reliable deformable mirrors, deformable mirrors can better correct for atmospheric aberrations. 2) Pulse-shaping:  Pulsed lasers are used in a variety of applications from material characterization to laser marking and machining.  By creating arrays with fewer failed actuators, control of the pulsed beams can be enhanced, leading to a more shaped beam.  This will allow scientists to better understand the composition of materials and allow manufacturers to make more precise, complex patterns.3) Biological imaging/ vision science:  For the imaging field, mirrors become almost ineffective if actuator failure occurs due to the smaller required size of the arrays.  Therefore, fewer imaging instruments will need replacement mirrors due to actuator failure.",Adaptive Optics; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Mirrors; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT)

Currently, a large portion of the mirror stroke must be used to flatten the MEMS DMs and in some cases, the DM stroke is not even sufficient to flatten the mirror. In the case of the large-stroke segmented MEMS DMs manufactured by Iris AO, there is sufficient stroke for wavefront correction after flattening. However, the resolution is significantly reduced because the dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converters (DAC) used to operate the DM is spread over multiple microns of stroke rather than the 0.5 µm range required to correct for aberrations in the telescope that feeds the coronagraph.This Phase I SBIR will make substantial improvements in the fabrication process of MEMS segmented DMs that reduce the deleterious residual surface-figure errors. It will do so by systematically addressing the sources of the segment position variations as well as addressing low-spatial frequency chip bow that can result in large peak-to-valley deformations across the DM array. The Iris AO DM architecture will also be modified to enable picometer resolution actuation with ultra-precision drive electronics.","The DM architecture developed here is a perfect match for visible nulling coronagraphs (VNC) that were studied for ATLAST, DAViNCI, and EPIC. In addition to the VNC, Iris AO technology can be a key enabling component in a host of future NASA missions that include Space Astronomy Far Infrared Telescope (SAFIR) Life Finder, and Planet Imager. Other potential programs such as Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) and ultraviolet telescopes will also require adaptive optics. Finally, ground based telescopes, like the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), Keck, and Gemini North & South, require adaptive optics to remove aberrations caused by air turbulence.","In addition to NASA systems, the proposed adaptive-optics technology would find immediate application in several military communications and imaging products.  Air Force and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) both are interested in satellite AO. Systems used in military surveillance such as in the Predator drone and Global Hawk would benefit from the high-resolution, light weight, and low power consumption afforded by Iris AO's MEMS. Military contractors including Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and Boeing have also shown significant interest in using Iris AO technology for long range imaging through turbulent air. The thick mirror segments can be coated with dielectric coatings and are thus useful for laser-guidestar uplink corrections and beam shaping for laser machining. The DMs can also be used to correct horizontal-path aberrations for free-space laser communication links and reconnaissance.

Other approaches, such as multi-color interferometers can provide absolute range measurements.  However, neither technique can measure multiple retroreflectors with a single optical transceiver.  This has led to complex distributed metrology systems, which are limited in usefulness.  Bridger Photonics Inc. proposes to investigate a novel distributed metrology approach that is uniquely enabled by its SLM-Series of actively stabilized swept laser sources.  The technique, termed multi-point trilateration, uses a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) chirped laser radar to determine the range to multiple reflectors that are illuminated simultaneously by three or more large field-of-view transceivers.  Because Bridger's laser radar system can unambiguously determine the range to multiple targets within the field-of-view with high accuracy, trilateration can be utilized to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates for all of the retroreflective targets within the field-of-view.  Bridger provides two critical advantages for the development of this distributed metrology system:  1) The world's highest resolution laser radar system, which is crucial for determining the range to the multiple retroreflectors, and 2) Proprietary processing techniques that enable Cramer-Rao lower bound limited range estimation. Under the proposed work plan, Bridger will provide an optimal design for Transceiver/Retroreflector geometries and model the expected performance, conduct demonstrations validating the system performance and provide a space-qualifiable, compact system design that can be built and delivered to NASA during a Phase II effort should the approach be feasible.","The main target application for NASA is to utilize this multi-point trilateration system to monitor and control the length of critical supporting mechanisms associated with deployable space structures such as extremely large, segmented primary mirrors, trusses and booms for secondary optics and mission scientific instruments.  Such deployable space structures are being considered for deployment such as the Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST).  However, a variety of other space missions could benefit from highly distributed 3D coordinate estimation.  For example, satellite to satellite position monitoring could be performed, or the system could be utilized for tracking positional state vectors for synthetic aperture radar interferometry.  Given a suitable reference satellite, the system could also be utilized to provide accurate reference positions and attitudes for other satellites.  The flexible resolution laser radar system itself also has applications in autonomous navigation and could be utilized to position and fly a variety of sensors, on UAVs, planes or robotic drones in space or to control swarms of satellites.  It could also be utilized during docking maneuvers between manned and unmanned space vehicles and would be especially useful when extremely fine accuracies are required.  3D imagers based upon the same core technology could also aid in imaging of unidentified space debris and examining spacecraft for damage.","Bridger Photonics Inc.'s frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) ladar technology is relatively low cost, can be completely fiber based, and can operate over a broad range of wavelengths.  Therefore it can enable a variety of interesting applications in both Government and commercial sectors including:1) Flexible resolution systems with centimeter to nanometer accuracies for short and medium range chirped laser radar.  Applications include autonomous aircraft and vehicle navigation, and object identification.  The high sensitivity has interested US Navy customers with classified targets.  2) Bridger Photonics is working with the US Navy - NAVAIR to utilize the highly linear frequency sweeps to enable a non-mechanical, moderate range resolution (mm), real-time three-dimensional scanning laser radar system.  This support tool will be utilized as an enhanced navigation aid during helicopter landings during low-visibility such as in brown-outs or in fog.  The system also has the capability to warn pilots of small features such as wires or other fine obstacles. 3) Bridger has experienced extensive commercial interest for industrial metrology and machine vision ranging from the calibration of coordinate measuring machines to the inspection of parts and components for quality control.","3D Imaging; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ranging/Tracking; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

For example, the new material can be used to enable extremely large, mass efficient and high compaction ratio deployable structures that will have a significant impact to DoD missions. With the continuing emphasis on large space apertures for a wide range of information gathering missions, the idea of kilometer scale trusses that package into existing launch vehicles is of increasing importance. Therefore, deployable trusses with high performance metrics greater than current deployable booms need to be developed. The proposed material can be used also to build trusses of trusses that not only package better than previous structures, but also achieve greater stiffness and dimensional stability than current deployable structures.","Analytical Methods; Characterization; Composites; Deployment; Destructive Testing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Lifetime Testing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Polymers; Processing Methods; Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Structures"

This coating is based on recent breakthroughs in self-assembled low index multilayer structures achieved at MIT, combined with Agiltron's mist coating processes. The UV AR coatings consisted of inter-connected oxide nanoparticles in the form of a 3D porous network. We successfully demonstrated this AR coating on a 3"" by 3"" PMMA plate and 1.25"" diameter Fresnel lens with suppressed surface reflection below 1% in the UV range. The coating adhesion also passed standard optical surface cleaning procedures recommended by NASA. In this current SBIR program, Agiltron proposes to scale up the coating process to coat large scale PMMA Fresnel lens surfaces up to 0.25 meters in diameter in Phase I and 1 meter in diameter in Phase II. Agiltron will closely work with NASA to develop the evaluation process for coating uniformity and optical performance.","Nanoporous coating technology is applicable to anti-reflection coatings for the electromagnetic spectrum from UV through near-IR. An immediate need is for coatings on large (2.5 m) PMMA Fresnel lenses intended for the EUSO extreme energy cosmic ray telescope.  Previous coatings have given poor adhesion on PMMA. NASA's contribution to this international mission depends on design of a plastic lens telescope whose antireflection treatments show very high optical efficiency over a wide UV band, large area uniformity, conformal deposition, low film stress, and minimal scattering and absorption.","Nanoporous coatings offer dual functionality of anti-reflection and anti-fogging. Potential military applications include goggles, laser safety eye protective lenses, chemical/ biological face masks, ballistic shields for explosive ordnance disposal personnel, and windows for vehicles. Mist deposition is fundamentally inexpensive and may have commercial applications in the plastic optics industry for eyeglasses and cellphone camera lenses, sport and diving goggles, auto windshields, windows in public transit vehicles, solar panels and green-house enclosures, and architectural products.",Coatings/Surface Treatments; Lenses; Nanomaterials

This proposal will demonstrate prototype manufacturing of a precision mirror in the 0.25 to 0.5 meter class, with a specific scale up roadmap to 1 to 2+ meter class system which can be rated for space flight. Material behavior, processing parameters, optical performance, and mounting techniques will be demonstrated. The potential for scale-up will be addressed from a processing and infrastructure point of view. The Phase 1 deliverable will be a 0.25 meter proof-of-concept mirror. Its optical performance assessment and all data on the processing and properties of its substrate material will be determined. UMS proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of forming a polymer derived 'bulk ceramic' mirror substrate with a 'fully dense' optical surface. This mirror substrate with fully dense surface, will be optically figured, polished and coated with a reflective metal system typically used in a commercial terrestrial telescope.","Earth science requires modest apertures of 2 to 4 meters in size, while deep space observation requires 12 to 30 meter class segmented primary mirrors for UV/optical or infrared wavelengths and 8 to 16 meter class segmented x-ray telescope mirrors which are cost effective. X-ray telescopes require 1 to 2 meter long grazing incidence segments. UV/optical telescopes require 1 to 3 meter class mirrors. IR telescopes require 2 to 3 meter class mirrors with cryo-deformations < 100 nm rms.Affordability or areal cost (cost per square meter of collecting aperture) rather than areal density, is probably the single most important system characteristic of these advanced optical systems. For example, both x-ray and normal incidence space mirrors currently cost $3M to $4M per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 20X to 100X, to less than $100K per square meter.","Mirror technology developed in this project will have many important applications in addition to light weight, low cost, large aperture space born telescopes. Because the mirrors will be constructed from ceramic, they will be thermally stable even at high temperatures, which will make them attractive for high power laser applications. Their low mass may make them attractive for use as solar power collectors (heliostats).To produce a custom, cavity back glass or ceramic mirror is currently cost prohibitive. The mirror technology developed in this proposal is far cheaper than current ceramic technologies, producing components lighter than glass. It also lends itself to mass production which will further reduce cost over custom made mirrors.""According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were at least 500 companies engaged in the manufacturing of optical instruments and lenses in the late 1990s.

The manufacturing process for SCCM integrates Trex's patented CVC SiC process technology with ITT's corrugated mirror design.  The former technology CVC SiC has been shown to yield an excellent, highly mechanically and thermally stable mirror substrate material, while the latter corrugated mirror concept has been utilized to rapidly and inexpensively fabricate glass mirrors.  The SCCM process forms a hollow, closed back corrugated mirror blank by sequentially depositing thin (1-3mm thick) CVC SiC layers onto appropriately designed sacrificial graphite mandrels, which are removed subsequently by burnout in an oxidizing high temperature furnace.  Nominally, the hollow SCCM then consists of mirror facesheet layer, a corrugated interior layer and a backsheet layer, each intimately chemically bonded with each other by the CVC SiC layer-on-layer deposition process.  The result is a monolithic, highly stiff, mechanically and thermally stable mirror substrate suitable for visible, UV, EUV, x-ray and infrared telescopes.  Furthermore, because of the unique fabrication process, minimal after deposition grinding is required, resulting in a cost-effective, rapid deposition process.","Potential NASA applications include UV/optical telescopes such as ATLAST and IR telescopes such as SAFIR/CALISTO, which would benefit from reduced cost of meter-class SiC mirror blanks.  The monolithic SCCM substrate will be polishable to visible/UV quality, with surface figure better than 25nm RMS and surface roughness less than 10 Å RMS.  Furthermore, cryogenic IR missions will benefit from CVC SiC highly uniform and near zero CTE at cryogenic temperatures, which is expected to outperform any composite, two-phase material solution.","Lightweight SCCM substrates would have utility in space and airborne telescopes, especially defense-oriented applications (surveillance, tracking, directed energy, etc.).  Ground based astronomical observatories utilizing a large aperture segmented primary mirror could also employ SCCM.  There may also be utility for the technology in commercial optics for lithography.",Ceramics; Mirrors; Processing Methods

Using hyper-spectral imaging at wavelengths ranging from the UV through NIR, these instruments will record the levels of the earth's temperature rise over the course of a decade.  To make such detailed measurements, polarization effects at various wavelengths due to multiple factors must be eliminated using an optical device known as a ""de-polarizer"".  For the CLARREO de-polarizer, four quartz windows are needed to randomize the polarization state of the observed reflected light spectrum.  Multiple reflections from 4 surfaces produce losses up to 14% of the incident light, a level high enough to produce ""ghost"" effects superimposed on the desired earth images resulting in reduced image contrast and greater measurement error.  An anti-reflection (AR) treatment is needed that can withstand the radiation and temperature effects caused by the mission environment while reducing reflection losses to levels of fractions of one percent.  A new type of AR treatment, being developed for many military and commercial applications, is based on surface relief microstructures fabricated directly in a window, optic, or sensor material.  AR microstructures (ARMs) can suppress internal reflections to levels unattainable by conventional thin-film AR coating technology.  To extend the performance benefits of ARMs to hyper-spectral imaging systems, it is proposed that the fabrication processes developed for fused silica, glass, silicon, and many other optical materials be adapted for use with the quartz and magnesium fluoride depolarizers planned for the ORCA and CLARREO missions.  In addition, an investigation of innovative surface microstructure technology is proposed for the fabrication of a new type of non-scattering, micro-textured depolarizer with inherent AR properties that can be applied to multiple optical elements within a spectrometer system.","The primary near-term NASA missions that can benefit from the new microstructure AR and depolarizer treatments are the hyperspectral imaging instruments of ORCA and CLARREO.  Other NASA missions in operation or being developed include ACCLAIM, a sub-orbital platform employing a hyperspectral imager for cloud and atmospheric aerosol monitoring, GLORY, a total solar irradiance measurement system, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, a dedicated global atmospheric CO2 measurement system, and AQUARIUS, a global sea surface salinity measurement system.  Several mid-term NASA missions that may also experience a direct or indirect benefit from the new microstructure technology include HyspIRI, a hyperspectral instrument for agricultural land surface health monitoring, GEO-CAPE, an atmospheric air quality and ocean health monitoring spectrometer, ASCENDS, a multi-frequency laser system for day and night monitoring of CO2 levels in the atmosphere, and ACE, a backscatter lidar and polarimeter system for aerosol and cloud profiling and open ocean monitoring.","Durable, high performance AR microstructures will replace thin-film AR coatings used in applications ranging from automotive, computer, and portable device displays, to window glass, eyeglasses, sunglasses, camera lenses, optical telecommunication fibers, laser systems, and astronomical instruments.  An important near term commercial application involves the integration of AR microstructures directly into the surfaces of imaging sensors that detect light over a wide color spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet through the far infrared.  AR microstructures are beginning to have a great impact on reducing energy consumption for new solid-state lighting products based on light emitting diode technology, and on energy efficiency where the wide bandwidths and acceptance angles of AR microstructures allow collection and conversion of more photons by conventional solar panels.","Conversion; Detectors (see also Sensors); Display; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Filtering; Infrared; Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Weapons); Lenses; Long; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Nanomaterials; Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Telescope Arrays; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation); Transmitters/Receivers; Ultraviolet; Visible; Waveguides/Optical Fiber (see also Optics)"

To finish optical surface with low cost to an ultra high precision and to reach the capability of generating arbitrary surface shape such as the aspherical surfaces or special patterns, in this proposal, we propose the development of an innovative computer-controlled optical surface finishing system. We suggest using chemical reactive removal as the tool to remove the material on the optical surface, controlled by computer with a deterministic removal algorithm. In phase I, a prototype system with ultra high precision finishing capability, ~ 1/100 lambda (632.8nm) for surface figure and ~1/1000 lambda for RMS will be demonstrated. A 5~10 times improvement in surface roughness is expected over the current technique as the chemical removal is at the atomic or molecular level, rather than by particle bombardment on optical surface. The lower surface roughness will obviously reduce the scattering lose for the short wavelength range. In Phase II, we will extend the work to non-flat surfaces, ie, arbitrary shaped surfaces, and to other glasses and materials of interest to NASA.","The proposed technique will provide ultra high precision and low surface roughness optics fabrication with reasonable cost, and be able to apply it to arbitrary surface shapes.

Specifically those applications that are susceptible to small angle scatter sometimes referred to as flare.  The International X-Ray Observatory (IXO), consisting of 361 grazing incidence nested, azimuthally segmented shell mirrors, is susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors.  These thin (0.4mm) mirrors are produced through a thermal slumping technique where a thin glass substrate replicates the shape of a mandrel (fused quartz or stainless steel).  The current budgeted error for the IXO mandrels is 1.4nm rms over the 2  20mm spatial frequency range.  In addition, exo-planet imaging systems require minimal scattering due to mid-spatial frequency errors on their primary and secondary mirrors.  An example is the specification for the Jovian planet finder optical system was less than 1nm rms in the 4  50cycles/aperture range.","Non-NASA commercial applications include high energy laser systems, EUV optics (lithography), imaging systems and X-ray synchrotrons.  High energy laser applications, such as Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors.  The MSF errors are a source of damaging intensity, specifically in the region of 120ìm  33mm.  In EUV lithography, flare is a significant problem.  Flare as mentioned earlier is directly associated with mid-spatial frequency error.  The mid-spatial frequency errors cause light to scatter into small angles and reduce image contrast.  The specific mid-spatial frequency region of interest to the EUV lithography community is between 1ìm  2mm.

This instrument will be capable of measuring more than three decades of spatial frequency range for determination of rms surface roughness.  It will be insensitive to vibration, being based upon our patented phase-sensor technology, and capable of being mounted on a computer-controlled polishing machine for in-situ measurement of large, aspheric and freeform optics.  Objectives for Phase I are to demonstrate a novel automatic alignment system enabling in-situ extended lateral range surface profiling, demonstrate an extended lateral range concept, and to demonstrate a measurement range of more than three decades in spatial frequency.  Anticipated results of Phase I will be documented laboratory demonstrations of these capabilities.  Our TRL before Phase I is 2-3, after Phase I we anticipate a TRL of 3-4 and after Phase II a TRL of 6.","The proposed on-tool measurement could reduce polishing time and improve surface quality of large and small optics with profiles from flat to aspheric.  Potential NASA applications include all major telescope projects where large precision optics are required such as JDEM, LSST, GMT, TMT and ICEsat.  The sensor can dramatically improve process control for the manufacture of large telescope optics by removing the need for replication and or contact metrology, which can damage surfaces.  It can also improve the manufacture of super-smooth optical surfaces, which are needed to achieve ultra-low scattering in projects such as WFIRST, LIGO, and LISA, by providing rapid, high resolution measurement over a wide spatial frequency range.  This type of measurement can also aid the manufacturing of aspheric and freeform optical components made with computer-controlled machines, in projects such as IXO and other x-ray telescopes.","The proposed extended lateral range profiler can significantly improve the production of large and small optics for many DOD and commercial projects in the same ways it can for NASA projects.  Applications include large optics for telescope mirrors, super-smooth surfaces for x-ray, synchrotron, DUV and EUV optics.   In addition, the proposed profiler has many applications beyond optics production including precision machined surfaces in the medical and automotive industries, and engineered surfaces in the semiconductor, electronics, data storage, MEMS, MOEMS and display industries.",In Situ Manufacturing; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Mirrors; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Process Monitoring & Control

SMD's future direction will be moving from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns), that would require new vantage points, or that would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets.  The demand for larger area coverage, higher resolution and multi-spectral capability in satellite remote sensing applications, and the demand for higher data rates in digital satellite communications networks continue to place ever increasing demands on onboard data handling and processing subsystems - 1 Gbps to 4 Gbps data rates are not uncommon and continually increasing. Further, satellite subsystems must be capable of reliable operation in the space radiation environment and will continue to be constrained by SWAP limitations. Shrinking development budgets and rapid development requirements are driving onboard data handling networks toward more flexible, non-proprietary architectures and interface standardization. Therefore, SPI proposes to develop a 10Gbps per channel optical transceiver and mating, multi-channel reprogrammable network interface card (NIC) that are RAD-tolerant to over 300KRad-Si TID, operate reliably from -25C to 85C.  Further, the NIC will be fully reprogrammable such that it may be reconfigured and utilized as an optical router, switch, or multi-protocol compatible gateway.","The proposed product, in addition to SPI's other harsh environment optical networking products, specifically target onboard data handling needs of NASA, DoD and the Intelligence Community's satellite remote sensing applications.

Modern spacecraft payloads demand high throughput while maintaining extremely high levels of reliability and fault tolerance.  Currently, no standardized protocols presently offer space-level products that provide gigabit-class throughputs.  One-off protocols have many drawbacks including long development times, high potential for error, a lack of existing materials, and do not lend themselves to easy prototyping since COTS products are unavailable.   These chips will retain the power of using the Ethernet standard but will be extended in an innovative way that will allow data rates up to 8 Gbps per port but will still be compatible with ground hardware for development purposes.  Through automated fault monitoring the PHY chip will be automatically detect link failures and the only adverse effect will be a reduction in throughput.","The radiation hardened Ethernet PHY and switch fabric that is developed for this project will be suitable for use within many NASA spacecraft components.  The resulting chips combine many desirable traits including high data rates, high reliability, excellent TID performance, and low power.  Because of this, they will be suitable for use in components that are developed for a range of spacecraft sizes and applications.  Many scientific missions generate large quantities of data that must be stored or processed for later downlinking.  But since no space hardware presently exists using standard protocols with this level of capability missions are forced to resort to custom interfaces.","The radiation hardened Ethernet Ethernet PHY and switch fabric will be applicable not only to NASA spacecraft, but to all spacecraft applications.  Department of Defense and commercial satellites have high data rate needs but demand the utmost in reliability and hardness which this chipset will provide.  Operationally responsive space missions need to maintain a pool of components with standard interfaces to aid in rapid integration.

The first approach is to use a radiation hardened process such as existing Rad-Hard foundries.  These foundries use special processing steps to decrease the total ionizing dose issues, but do not reduce the single event effects.  The second approach is to use a special standard cell library containing hardening techniques that can be built on a standard state-of-the-art commercial foundry.  This cell library must compensate for the unhardened foundry by using special layout techniques to retain the ability to operate through the total ionizing dose experienced in the radiation environments.  These techniques are generally referred to as radiation hardened-by-design layout techniques (RHBD).   For hardening of the circuit architectures against upsets from the single event effects, both the commercial and the Rad-Hard foundries must incorporate some type of mitigation scheme requiring special transistor interconnects or redundant nodes.  This program will fill this void, providing the space community with the ability to easily acquire the RHBD Micro-RDC standard cell libraries for use with commercial ASIC design flows. The library will include a full suite of IO pads designed by Micro-RDC and successfully implemented in test chip designs at 90nm and 65nm.  Finally, a portion of the custom via programmable structured ASIC fabric designed by Micro-RDC and Viasic will be made available to the library users.  This fabric can be embedded into a design which can be modified and reprogrammed by generating just via 3 mask layer, which can lead to a substantial cost savings over a complete new ASIC design. This program will allow Micro-RDC to transform its custom libraries into synthesis libraries, and enable other companies the opportunity to use a proven and fully characterized RHBD ASIC cell library and suite of Mega Cell hard IP for rapidly developing spaceborne systems.","The RHBD library, IP cores and Structured ASIC blocks enables a simplified, fast, reliable and qualifiable method to develop integrated circuits for use in harsh radiation environments.  Through successful completion of this SBIR Phase I and II program system integrators will not be required to re-qualify IC designs for space applications. Our proposed design flow will be radiation hardened to greater than 3Mrad while replicating a commercial design flow. A user of this flow will be able to focus on the component function and speed requirements, as well as other critical performance functionality, without regard to developing radiation hardening methods. The radiation hardness is ensured by using the library, IP cores and Structured ASIC blocks, which have been previously demonstrated through our successful completion of our radiation hard SASIC developed under AFRL. This design flow will be broadly applicable for aerospace system designers offering a low cost short term solution for NASA programs.  An example application for program developed technology of Phase I and Phase II would be the NASA Europa Jupiter System Mission, in which all electronic devices need to have a dose tolerance of 3Mrad (Si) for deep space exploration.","Since IP cores including USB, I2C, and SpaceWire can be used directly in ""Space Plug-and-Play Avionics"" (SPA), the result of this project can also be used by the Air Force to develop SPA devices at a low cost within a short time greatly leveraging program developed technology to other military applications. The RHBD standard cell library licensed by Micro-RDC to commercial and non-commercial customers will enable denser higher speed and lower power solutions than a purely Structured ASIC approach. We will provide IP use licenses to the foundry's and work with the product designers to implement the technology through support contracts if needed. Our ultimate goal would be to create a standard product line of components for partnering with a major product distributor (we have already had preliminary discussions with Areoflex, BAE and Cypress to offer such a line on a non-exclusive basis) to keep costs low.  However, organizations needing specialty parts will find the licensing approach beneficial for low-volume applications which will be met with a simple fee for each silicon run.","Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Ionizing Radiation"

Additionally, once deployed, hardwarechanges are impractical, encouraging a trend towards increasedsoftware programmability. However, topside pressure from applicationadvancements are forcing space-based platforms to improve throughputand latency while reducing power consumption. A popular approach toaddressing the tension between these requirements is the heterogeneousprocessing architecture. By providing multiple hardware tools thatoptimally support a subset of the anticipated workload, aheterogeneous architecture can offer a diverse processing toolset tothe application developer. However, programming these systems isextremely challenging because of variations in toolsets and datasharing interfaces. As a result, data sharing and  dynamic workloadscheduling across heterogeneous architectures is often suboptimal andhindered by poor scalability.

Unfortunately, they are limited in terms of their heat flux capability, approximately 5W/cm2.  Incident heat flux for laser diode applications is on the order of 5-10W/cm2, although this is expected to increase towards 50W/cm2.  This is a severe limitation for axial groove (CCHP) as well as loop heat pipes (LHP).  Standard CCHPs are also not suitable for Lunar and Martian Landers and Rovers, since they can only operate with a very small adverse elevation, on the order of 0.10 inch.  Landers can have tilts of ±20o, while rovers can have tilts of ±45o.  As a result, a wick with a higher heat flux capability and pumping capability is required.  This program will develop heat pipes with both 1) Sintered wicks, and 2) Hybrid grooved and sintered wicks.  Heat pipes with both wick designs will be capable of operating at heat fluxes in the ten's of watts per cm2, and in Lunar or Martian environments at large slopes against gravity.  An all-sintered wick will be used when the entire heat pipe must be able to operate against gravity, while a hybrid wick will be used when the condensers will always be gravity aided on the planetary surface.","Hybrid wick CCHPs for high power electronics on spacecraft, and NASA landers and rovers is the immediate NASA application.  Conventional grooved aluminum/ammonia CCHPs are heat flux limited and are only suitable for operation in space, or when they can be engineered to operate in a gravity aided mode.  The hybrid wicks developed on this program will remove this design constraint, and expand the design space to include higher heat flux operation on future missions.   In addition, some vertical, grooved CCHPs have had startup problems, requiring an electric heater to generate a vapor bubble.  The large number of nucleation sites in the sintered wick will eliminate this problem.Wicks developed on this program will enable the use of 3-D CCHPs for some NASA applications.  Conventional grooved aluminum/ammonia heat pipes can be ground-tested with the evaporator elevated 0.10 inch above the condenser.  This is only possible if the heat pipe is all in a single plane, i.e., a 2-D heat pipe.  In some cases, 3-D CCHPs, with bends in multiple planes, simplify spacecraft thermal design.  However, grooved 3-D pipes cannot be tested on the ground, since there is no way to keep the maximum elevation to 0.10 inch with the bends in multiple planes.   With a hybrid wick, 3-D pipes can be fabricated and ground tested.","The maximum allowable evaporator heat flux in a grooved pipe is relatively low, typically 10-15 W/cm2.  As spacecraft electronics increase in power and packing density, this can present a thermal control problem.  Sintered wicks have much higher evaporator heat flux limits, typically four times higher than grooved wicks.  The main non-NASA application will be for CCHPs that remove waste heat from high power components on commercial spacecraft.",Heat Exchange; Passive Systems

Wewill perform calculations to optimize the material parameters of HgCdTe- and metal-based SL structures to maximize ZT.

For example, thermoelectric devices cool HgCdTe-based infraredimaging cameras such as those on the Hubble Space Telescope. They are employed as refrigerators in various space scienceexperiments. Thermal loop spacecraft temperature control systems employ them as well. The same materials also hold greatpotential in thermionic energy conversion. All these applications will benefit from the improved efficiency of Hg1-xCdxTe- andmetal-based SL thermoelectric coolers, together with the already realized benefits of solid state coolers, namely reliability,ruggedness and low cost.

An innovative space environmental stable TCMS is suggested through research & development work for the multifunctional, low (αS/εT) material systems that can meet these aggressive goals in cost effective, reliable manner. The suggested efforts emphasize developments in two material science areas: the first one considers the development of born nitride nano structure that includes nanotubes and nano mesh (BNNT-BNNMTM) and the second area proposes the synthesis and processing of various homologous compounds of Zinco-Indates that are recently identified as the high conductivity compounds with high refractive index. The material system that integrates these two technologies can allow higher leakage currents that may also help to defend against the natural solar storm events. The suggested TCMS have been derived from the available mathematical models for space craft charging that pay attention to the individual charge dissipation mechanisms and the molecular dynamics of the material systems as well as its thermodynamics. Thus the envisioned derived material systems can provide the needed reliable TCMS in typical space environments in (LEO), (GEO) & beyond. The reliability goal for the multifunctional conductive TCMS is to have a design life of > 10 years in LEO and > 15 years in GEO, and we anticipate the developments to mature by end of phase II ready for the hardware demonstration.","The concepts on the suggested nano-science inspired generic multifunctional high conductivity capable thermal control material system are suitable for the science and o exploration hardware needs and are geared towards delivering the reliable end products.

The transportation authorities are also planning commercial space based radars. These planned candidate optimal fleet operations may require designs that require radiation stability along with the high conductivity for the higher leakage current carrying capability. Currently technology gap exists and no TCMS is available that is space stable and provides flexibility in leakage current. Success of this program spells fulfillment of this gap.

The use of a micron wide gap between the radiation source and the photovoltaic substantially increases the efficiency of the thermophotovoltaic.  This work will be accomplished by combining MicroLink's state-of-the-art InGaAs-based epitaxial lift-off solar cell structure on an InP substrate, and MTPV, LLC's leading-edge, micron-gap thermophotovoltaic device technology.  The relevance of this innovation is that it addresses NASA's ongoing need for high-efficiency, lightweight, compact sources power for space vehicles.  TPV is an attractive and technically feasible candidate for space power supplies, but its relatively poor efficiency performance has meant that it has not seen widespread use in space applications.  However, MTPV technology, by bringing the emitter into the near field of the photovoltaic, couples an order of magnitude more power across the nano-scale vacuum gap than can be absorbed from the far-field spectrum and does so while maintaining the benefits of conventional TPV.  MicroLink's ELO growth technology promises to further increase coupled power relative to the current germanium TPV cells while simultaneously reducing substrate costs.  Thus, MicroLink ELO and MTPV technology can offer both high efficiency and reasonable cost TPV systems for the first time.","The main potential application of MTPV for NASA is as a power sources for space vehicles.  MTPV has advantages for near-Earth missions, particularly in the Van Allen belts.  Our MTPV uses cells based on InGaAs, which is relatively radiation resistant, and is expected to degrade at a lower rate than conventional triple-junction PV cells.  Another advantage of MTPV in Earth orbit missions, where the spacecraft goes into eclipse frequently, is that the use of thermal energy storage in place of batteries may represent an enabling technology.  Another potential application for MTPV is as a replacement for radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) for outer solar system missions.  The current generation of RTGs is heavy and has efficiency of only 6.3%.  Baseline TPV systems offer the potential for efficiency in excess of 15%.","Non-NASA commercial applications for the MTPV technology are huge.  MTPV enables the generation of electricity from waste heat at commercially competitive costs.  Fully 57% of all energy generated in the U.S. is rejected, primarily to waste heat.  Over recent decades, there has been a large effort to find a technology that can recover waste energy in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  A candidate energy recovery technology is thermophotovoltaics.  Conventional thermophotovoltaics is limited by the amount of energy contained in the far-field spectrum of the hot emitter.  MTPV technology promises to overcome this limitation.  By virtue of the nano-scale vacuum gap, MTPV can operate in high temperature environments and do so with high efficiency, at high power density, and with low cost.","Generation; Manufacturing Methods; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Processing Methods; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

Thermoelectric devices offer a simple and reliable means to convert radioisotope thermal energy into useable electrical power.  Previously, thermoelectric devices based on bulk semiconductor materials have been limited by low conversion efficiencies, with Figure of Merit (ZT) values around 1.0 or less.  Increasing ZT above 1.0 has thus far proved difficult, due to the fundamental limitation of identifying semiconductor materials with both a high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity.This SBIR project will develop high efficiency thermoelectric devices based on nanowires.  The use of nanotechnology provides a means to circumvent previous limitations, and achieve combinations of properties not possible with bulk materials.  Phase I will demonstrate technical feasibility by producing high efficiency thermoelectric devices based on nanowires.  In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate prototype high efficiency thermoelectric devices.  Phase II will also develop low cost manufacturing technology for the nanowire based thermoelectric devices, and demonstrate a technology readiness level of TRL 6.","Future NASA missions for deep space and planetary exploration will require radioisotope power conversion systems, for reliable electrical power both near and far from solar radiation sources.  Thermoelectric devices offer a simple and reliable means to convert radioisotope thermal energy into useable electrical power, with no moving parts.  The high efficiency thermoelectric devices proposed in this SBIR effort will increase the amount of available power for NASA mission requirements, and reduce overall size and weight of the power system.","The high efficiency thermoelectric devices developed in the SBIR will also fill many terrestrial needs for renewable energy and energy harvesting.  Presently, about 90% of the world's energy comes from burning fossil fuels.  This chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy in heat engines, operating at about 30% to 40% efficiency.  The result is about 15 terawatts of energy lost as waste heat.  Capturing even a small fraction of this energy with thermoelectric energy harvesting devices would have a huge impact, in terms of dollars saved, reduced consumption of fossil fuels, and reduced emission of greenhouse gases.  In additional to the primary energy savings, waste heat recovery systems reduce the auxiliary cooling required to protect people and sensitive components from the waste heat.","Coatings/Surface Treatments; Conversion; Generation; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Nanomaterials; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

Photovoltaic cell technology is evolving rapidly to the point solar array structural and mechanical systems do not fully optimize system level mass and volume performance potential.  MMA Design LLC (MMA) proposes to develop a compact deployable modular solar array concept with next generation cost and performance improvements.  A solar array is proposed that is mechanically simple while meeting the support requirements of currently available solar cells, as well as future higher performance cells.  The solar array decreases production and system costs through modularity and simplicity, increases the power to stowed volume ratio (W/m3), and increases specific power (W/kg), thus exceeding the performance of the existing state-of-the-art (SOA) systems.MMA proposes to advance the SOA in photovoltaic power systems by developing a Fan Deployed Modular High Watts per Kilogram (FDM-HaWK) advanced solar array consisting of an innovative fan deployed structure.  On-going research at MMA in innovative and manufacturable solar array components, mechanisms and deployable structures makes the proposed solar array feasible and lower risk.  The proposed FDM-HaWK uses many identical modular solar array panels in two-string configurations to reduce cell stringing and laydown costs.  The significance to NASA of our innovative solution is the reduction of solar array costs while producing over 300 watts per kilogram (W/kg) with 32% efficient next generation solar cells in a 5.6 kW solar array wing.  Based on current projections for next generation cell performance by Spectrolab, the proposed system will be capable of producing over 350 W/kg by the year 2017.  From the perspective of packaging efficiency, the FDM-HaWK will produce 51 kW/m3 with existing qualified triple junction cells and 63 kW/m3 by the year 2017.","Potential future NASA applications that can benefit from the proposed development include WFIRST, GOES-R, smallsats, Mars platforms and future science missions comparable to Glory, LRO and Juno. The current state of practice in solar arrays involves a highly customized NRE design and qualification effort for each spacecraft mission that doesn't leverage the significant commonality among applications.  The result is that each solar array is unique, costly, and long lead. This approach is contrary to what is required to support NASA needs: next generation performance, low cost inventory strategies, flexible response to mission needs, and modular architecture that is semi-customizable and compatible across multiple missions.  Investments are required now in the development of next generation solar arrays that are vital to meeting the future needs of NASA, delivering higher performance at lower cost.  Future NASA science missions employing Earth-orbiting observation spacecraft and exploration spacecraft that require high reliability, lower mass and volume, higher mass specific power, and improved efficiency can leverage the next generation performance enhancements of MMA's FDM-HaWK solar array while lowering total system costs.

While the traditional geometry commonly used in a Hall thruster can achieve relatively high Isp operation, they are limited in their ability to achieve much better than 80mN/kW thrust to power.  While values of 90-100 mN/kW have been reported they are achieve at by running the thruster at significantly reduce input power.

Nitrous is the ideal propellant choice for RCS control in satellites due to the fact that it is non-toxic, non-cryogenic, easily storable, self-pressurizing, and cost effective (unlike monopropellant engines that use hydrazine or hydrogen peroxide which are toxic and/or dangerous, increasing ground costs). NOME engines will have all the desirable features of other monopropellant engines (i.e. simplicity of design, restartable/control on demand, and repeatability) NOME engines will also have a comparable ISP to current monopropellant engines (near 190s) but will be made to achieve greater simplicity and lower handling costs than current systems. NOMEs will have over double the Isp of cold gas reaction control systems.","Potential applications for NOME are numerous for NASA. NOME technology would be a novel hardware solution for anywhere an inexpensive, simple, low-thrust rocket engine could be used. Particular areas of interest would be RCS control of satellites, and main propulsion for micro-satellites, or even for propulsion of free-flying telerobots (such as have been discussed for Shuttle, Orion, ISS, or Hubble inspection applications). Currently, the primary RCS propellant used on spacecraft is hydrazine, which is extremely toxic and which therefore greatly complicates and increases the cost of ground handling operations prior to launch. Another key advantage for NASA would be the use of NOME RCS for any spacecraft that employs nitrous technology for other applications. NOME thrusters could be used for ultra fine control EVA thrusters if a nitrous breathing system  was being employed, or used as RCS on a manned spacecraft which employed a nitrous-based oxygen supply system. The breathing and NOME subsystems could draw their nitrous from the same reservoir, thus adding to the over all simplicity of the system. Furthermore, NOME could be used on any spacecraft that used a nitrous based main propulsion system (either as a monopropellant, or combining nitrous with a hydrocarbon in a bipropellant or hybrid engine). The overall result of using a non-toxic RCS propellant that serves other spacecraft functions as well would produce major gains in performance and system simplicity.","NOME technology also has the potential to be applied to numerous different areas. The first of these potential applications would be high altitude or undersea fuel cells. When nitrous is dissociated it produces nitrogen and oxygen gas. The oxygen gas could then be used with either hydrogen or methanol fuel cells to produce electricity. The nitrous reactor could be run for a short time to pressurize a cylinder with a plug of nitrogen/oxygen mix, which could then slowly be siphoned off to be used within a fuel cell. Another particularly interesting technology would be to pass the NOME reactor exhaust through a turbine and, using a generator, creating a very compact miniature power unit. NOME reactors could also include use on micro Sea Gliders to produce rapid buoyancy changes in this type of vehicle over very small periods of time. These small sea gliders would be able to travel underwater without propeller noise, providing numerous potential applications for both civil and military undersea use. NOME technology could also be used to create gas generators that could supply emergency breathing gas to trapped miners, people in underground shelters, or submarines through dissociation of reserve nitrous oxide.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Spacecraft Main Engine; Teleoperation; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

However, a significant challenge in scaling micro (<  100 W) EP devices up as well as scaling macro (> 1 kW) EP devices down is the lack of a compatible neutralizer technology in the meso scale ( < 1 kW).  Traditionally, the technology used for spacecraft neutralization has been the hollow cathode, though hollow cathodes require an unsatisfactory fraction of a propulsion system's propellant and power in the meso-scale regime.  In fact, they require such a large amount of propellant and power that system efficiency is reduced by 50-100%.  In addition, using a hollow cathode causes undesirable specific impulse reduction.The most promising technology for meso-scale neutralizers is field emission (FE), which requires the use of nano-scale sharp emitters and high electric fields to establish a beam of electrons.  The drawback of FE devices is that the nano-scale emitters become damaged when operated in elevated pressure environments (10-5 Torr), causing catastrophic failure.  The research proposed here is to develop field-emission cathodes for use in meso-scale EP that eliminate tip degradation not through attempts to minimize tip wear, but instead by incorporating self-assembling nanostructures that can repeatedly re-generate damaged emitter tips in space and fully restore the functionality of a damaged or degraded cathode. The procedure is the equivalent of having a MEMS fabrication and repair lab on-board the spacecraft.The re-generable emitters proposed here have been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory in work by Makela, et. al. dating back to 2007.  The re-generable neutralizers could enable highly efficient, high-Isp, low-mass propulsion systems operating between a few Watts and 1 kW by either scaling existing micro technologies up or scaling existing macro technologies down.","The proposed neutralization technique would be especially well suited (but not limited) to use in FEEP systems, where the FEEP ion emitters can be re-purposed as electron emitters for spacecraft neutralization.  In this arrangement two identical FEEP thrusters could share duties, with one performing neutralization and the other ion emission  swapping roles when the electron field-emitters need to be re-generated, and greatly reducing system complexity.  Furthermore, the architectural similarity between FEEP thrusters and the proposed neutralizer technique could enable a unique hybrid system: an array of emitters could be operated in electron-emission mode as the neutralizer for a meso-scale Hall or ion thruster during portions of a mission requiring high thrust-to-power, then switched over to ion-emission mode to function independently as a FEEP thruster when high Isp is desired.","The devices may find use in other space- and earth-borne applications requiring low-power, cold electron emission in environments that would be hostile to traditional Spindt-type emission cathode.  Re-generable field emitters could be used in electron microscopy, electron beam lithography, flat-panel video displays, etc.",Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Nanomaterials; Spacecraft Main Engine

The Peristaltic Dynamic Acceleration (PDA) stage is an addition to the exhaust of the EMPT that takes an existing, translating plasmoid and adds directed, kinetic energy with a set of sequenced magnetic field coils. The EMPT creates a high-density, magnetized plasmoid known as a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) using external RF antennas that produce a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF) throughout the thruster. The large FRC plasma currents together with the radial magnetic field result in a large JxB force that rapidly accelerates the FRC propellant out of the thruster. The Dynamic Acceleration stage then initiates a pulsed magnetic field behind the FRC increasing the magnetic field pressure gradient. These pulsed field coils can very efficiently add kinetic energy to a magnetized, closed-field plasmoid and be used to increase velocity and average thruster power from 1 kW to greater than 20 kW, all without any changes to the original thruster.The EMPT will be operated at maximum ionization efficiency at 2 kHz. The PDA will then accelerate the high-mass plasmoid to the required mission velocities. In this way power can be added to the device incrementally depending on the mission and power available. This also enables a so-called dual mode thruster that can operate over a wide range of power, thrust, and specific impulse while still maintaining constant gas flow for very long life, deep space missions. The PDA allows for the incremental development and qualification of the thruster, dramatically reducing total costs. Finally, the ability to rapidly and cheaply increase the power of a space-qualified thruster by factors of ten allow for the propulsion technology to grow with the available power for NASA science missions.","The high specific impulse operation of the EMPT will have applications for large earth observing science missions as a replacement for high-mass station keeping thrusters when coupled with ultra-light solar arrays. Additionally, as more (and less massive) power is available for interplanetary science missions, such as advanced radioisotope power (REP) systems and NASA ultra-flex solar panels (SEP), electric propulsion can find even larger roles. A low mass, 1 kW REP propulsion system would enable a host of deep space Neptune and Pluto orbiter missions. An advanced, variable power SEP system would enable small sample and return and orbiter missions from asteroids and planetary moons. Additionally, the variable power and thruster nature can apply immediate mass savings on any interplanetary mission with variable power requirements. The dual mode nature of the PDA will allow for use as both primary propulsion and station keeping for a given mission. Finally, the ability to rapidly and cheaply increase the power of a space-qualified thruster by a factor of ten allow for the propulsion technology to cheaply match and grow with the available power for NASA science missions.","The DOD is primarily interested in propulsion systems as either station keeping for large satellites or primary propulsion for small-sats. The EMPT has application for small satellite main propulsion and LEO-GEO transfer in earth orbit due to its high specific power, mid-mission power scaling, and expected high Thrust-to-Power (T/P). Additionally, the high specific impulse operation of the EMPT will have applications for large telecom and military satellite station-keeping. Finally, the variable power and thrust nature of the PDA has direct application to modern Operational Responsive Space (ORS) missions that require a single propulsion unit capable of in-orbit mission changes.",Launch Engine/Booster; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices

As it has been produced for the past several years, Ultramet's CVD rhenium has a yield strength of 43 ksi and an elongation of 19%, which makes it very attractive for propulsion applications. For high-pressure applications, however, even higher yield strength, especially at elevated temperature, is desirable. To address this need, Ultramet will build upon its recent success in alloy deposition techniques. By adding easy-to-deposit alloying agents to niobium and tantalum, room temperature yield strengths were increased from 19 ksi to 69 ksi for niobium, and from 37 ksi to 98 ksi for tantalum, while still maintaining excellent ductility. At elevated temperatures, the latter alloy's yield strengths were 26 ksi at 1600oC and 15 ksi at 1800oC, which compare quite favorably to rhenium's 19 and 11 ksi at the same temperatures. In this project, a similar alloying approach will be taken with rhenium to increase its yield strength, at both ambient and elevated temperatures. Increases in the rhenium yield strength will decrease the required wall thickness and hence reduce both the weight and cost of the combustion chamber. In addition to developing and characterizing novel rhenium-based alloys, the resulting properties will be used to modify the design of the 100-lbf Ir/Re flight chambers currently manufactured by Ultramet. The cost and weight savings afforded by using the new alloy in these bipropellant engines will be calculated. Designs will also be generated for a high-pressure 100-lbf chamber for NTO/MMH and a high-pressure 5-lbf chamber for use with the advanced, non-toxic monopropellant AF-315e. This latter chamber will be fabricated using the oxide-lined iridium/rhenium architecture, but the rhenium will be replaced with the higher-yield-strength alloy selected earlier.","The technology to be developed in this project can be used in virtually any NASA flight mission because the combustion chambers can be used with either storable propellants (e.g. NTO/MMH), ""green"" cryogenic propellants (e.g. LOX/CH4), or advanced monopropellants (e.g. AF-315e). Because these radiation-cooled combustion chambers will be lower cost than current Ir/Re chambers and yet offer the same performance, they can be used wherever C103 niobium or Ir/Re is used today. These applications include main and attitude control engines on Earth-orbiting spacecraft in both low and geostationary orbits, main and attitude control engines on interplanetary spacecraft, and pitch and roll control engines on launch vehicles. Mars sample return missions will also benefit from this technology.","Commercial applications include apogee topping motors for commercial satellites as well as pitch and roll control motors for launch vehicles. Military applications include both primary propulsion and divert and attitude control system functions for tactical missiles and ballistic missile defense systems. Because the proposed chambers can be used with storable propellants such as NTO/MMH, they can be used as drop-in replacements for Ultramet's iridium/rhenium chambers that are currently being manufactured and flown.",Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Metallics; Processing Methods; Spacecraft Main Engine

Modern Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) are a proven technology with flight heritage, established manufacturing readiness and testing channels that nearly meet the desired specifications (as shown in Figure 1).  However, the major limitation is that HETs fail to achieve all four of objectives simultaneously.This Phase I feasibility study is focused on a proof-of-concept experiment to alleviate the HET dual-mode operational envelope limitation for both high thrust-to-power and high specific impulse.   Starfire Industries believes that a ""low hanging fruit"" modification to HETs exists, and such an improvement would be evolutionary to enable multi-mission EP systems for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and DoD platforms.  Towards this end, Starfire has partnered with Aerojet Corporation to rapidly demonstrate feasibility in Phase I through experimental modification to an existing HET system.  If results are confirmed, a Phase II design can be driven to yield immediate upgrades for flight-qualified HET systems for near-term payback.","This SBIR addresses the Science Mission Directorate need for spacecraft propulsive hardware with increased performance and flexibility to enable more ambitious missions requiring high duty cycles, more challenging environmental conditions, and extended operation.

They have also been considered limited to only very low thrust levels, able to produce few microNewtons from individual emission sites.  This has motivated significant research into developing large microfabricated arrays of emitters in order to achieve greater thrust.  Busek, using an alternate approach, avoids the complications of large emitter arrays while obtaining about 2.5 milliNewtons/cm2 and about 13,000 emission sites/cm2, and has proven this at the 0.1mN thrust level for over 450 operating hours.  Combined with colloids' variable Isp capabilities and thrust/power superior to other electric propulsion devices, these new, high thrust colloid thrusters promise to enable new classes of missions benefiting from variable Isp of 200-5000s (or greater) and variable thrusts up to and exceeding 20mN.For the Phase I effort, Busek shall perform a proof-of-concept demonstrating scalability of its proven 0.1mN, cylindrical emitter into a swept linear or annular configuration (to increase emission area while preserving the cross-section), resulting in a 5mN prototype.  For the subsequent Phase II, the emitter will be scaled up to 20mN and packaged and tested with fully integrated propellant storage/feedsystem and electronics.","Primary NASA applications include missions requiring exceptional thrust/power in power-limited missions, and missions benefiting from variable specific impulse (200-5000+seconds) and throttleable thrust (10x throttling).  In many cases, the proposed colloid thruster may prove superior to most other electric propulsion technologies in nearly all metrics for power levels <200 Watts (where thruster efficiency has greater impact on total system efficiency).","The primary non-NASA application for the proposed thruster is to support development of colloid-based multi-mode propulsion using green monopropellants, where there is a lack of suitable thrusters at the milliNewton level or greater.  This allows a spacecraft to utilize shared propellant tanks for high thrust chemical propulsion as well as high Isp electric propulsion, and is particularly attractive for small spacecraft with limited mass and volume for multiple propellant tanks.  Additional applications include replacement of some of the lower thrust plasma-based electric propulsion devices, which suffer from decreased efficiency at low power due to unfavorable surface-to-volume scaling.  The variable Isp capabilities and higher thrust levels provide a useful multimode solution for spacecraft requiring both dwell/stationkeeping as well as rapid maneuvers from a single propulsion system.",Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Spacecraft Main Engine

With a low thrust, however, Hall thrusters need to operate for a long period of time to achieve the necessary velocity of the mission. For these missions, the lifetime requirements can reach into tens of thousands of hours. For Hall thrusters, the most important life-limiting process is the erosion of the channel walls. However, experimental verification of lifetime is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, computational method is a useful tool to predict thruster lifetime. Many of the Hall thruster lifetime models were developed, and some of theses models gave quite promising results. However, while qualitatively interesting, the results did not match well with experiment. The reason of this discrepancy is that these numerical models assume electrons as a fluid. The proposed innovation will provide a better understanding of the erosion physics and will be useful for future Hall thruster development, such as HiVHAc, with low cost and time.

It also helps the researchers to design that the hBN discharge channel erosion always shields the Hall thruster magnetic circuit elements from ion impingement. The model also would allow for researchers to understand the effect of the operation conditions and the thruster geometry to the channel wall erosion process.","A kinetic molecular dynamic erosion model has numerous applications outside of the scope of NASA.

The vehicle provides a platform to support the Earth Sciences Research program in the major focus areas of Atmospheric Composition, Weather, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Water and Energy Cycle, Climate Variability and Change, and Earth Surface and Interior. It specifically is well suited for regional coastal research. The vehicle supports the goals of the Airborne and Suborbital Science Program.

The Phase I of this proposed work will focus on the integrated MIDSJT device development and high-temperature packaging. Phase II will focus on the integration of the MIDSJT devices to construct full 3-Phase Inverter Motor Control Modules. Although SiC is the semiconductor material of choice for fabricating high-temperature (> 150 oC) power electronics, existing SiC MOSFET and JFET based transistor device technologies perform poorly at temperatures exceeding 200 oC. The proposed gate oxide-free Integrated MIDSJT device technology will overcome several problems associated with existing SiC device technologies by: (A) exhibiting desirable normally-OFF operation yet best-in-class on-state characteristics at temperatures as high as 500 oC, (B) eliminating parasitic inductances/capacitances associated with interconnecting discrete devices, and (C) eliminating high-temperature gate oxide reliability issues. Special device designs and fabrication processes will be investigated in this work for reliable device operation at 500 oC.  Novel power device packaging techniques in the areas of power substrate, die-attach, chip metallization and wire bonds will be explored to demonstrate reliable module operation at 500 oC after several thermal cycles.","Drive and control electronics for motors in the next generation robotic systems such as rovers have to be directly placed on the motor housing. Integration of 500 oC capable power electronics with the motor enables creation of distributed actuator systems with significantly reduced interconnects and wiring. Furthermore the motors and actuators have to be placed on the extremities of the robotic systems and are exposed to environmental parameters such as large temperature changes (-125 oC to 450 oC in the case of Venus, up to 350 oC for Jupiter).  The motor sensing electronics consists of a position sensor, digitizer, digital controller and digital to analog converter. The actuator drive consists of power switching devices that are configured in an H-bridge that is connected to the digital controller through pre drivers and buffers. For DC-DC converters, power ICs developed in this program connects power sources in a wide variety of NASA mission systems with power sources as Solar arrays, Brayton rotating unit, stirling radioscopes, and fuel cells with various loads like electric propulsion, communications systems, instruments and actuators. A power IC is also the building block for the interface between energy storage devices like batteries and flywheels with the energy sources and loads.

An integrated electric power system made using SiC high power devices will increase component placement flexibility within vehicles, double fuel economy by continuously operating smaller engines under optimum conditions, and reduce armor protected volume.  It will also enable increased acceleration and maneuverability due to immediate torque to the wheels or tracks, reduce vehicle thermal and acoustic signatures and reduce system cost and logistics requirements.

A miniature PMB technology is widely applicable to small mechanisms and will allow for a greater technological payoff with the next generation of small satellite missions.  Honeybee Robotics is developing a small, modular control moment gyroscope (CMG) technology for use on small satellites. The life limiting and power driving aspect of this technology as with any CMG or reaction wheel (RW), are the rotor bearings which operate at 12,000 rpm. Honeybee Robotics proposes to develop a miniature passive magnetic bearing (PMB) for small satellite ACS components such as CMGs and RWs. This cross-cutting technology can also be applied to any small mechanism that might benefit from low parasitic torque, low induced vibration (IV), and long life. PMB technology for small satellites will allow for a step increase in life for their ACS subsystems. Enabling a small satellite mission lifetime of 15+ years rather than 1-3 years is a game-changing development that will alter the way mission planners think about small satellite capabilities. Prototype units will be integrated with our Tiny Operationally Responsive CMG (TORC) technology to demonstrate the relative merits compared to traditional ball bearings.","Small satellites which are low cost and can be delivered in months (as opposed to years), are being eyed as platforms for rapid demonstration of new technologies (e.g., new propulsion, communications, power collection and MEMS technologies) and even important science missions (e.g., earth and space climate observation, biological sciences).  A miniature PMB technology is both cross-cutting and game-changing as it can be utilized in just about any small, high-speed mechanism on a satellite such as CMGs, RWs, and other instrumentation as well as increase the expected lifetime of small satellite missions by an order of magnitude.

The vision of CubeSats as technology demonstration platforms will only be realized when their data downlink capability matches their data acquisition capability.  At the moment, CubeSat communications are extremely limited.  To boost communications, they need more power and they need to focus and aim that power in the form of directed transmissions.

Using our proposed technology, a single reaction sphere can control three axes, substantially reducing mass, power, and cost when compared to a three wheel system. This device has no bearings: its spherical rotor is suspended within the stator by magnetic forces. Magnetic suspension reduces jitter, especially in a station-keeping mode where the torque and suspension forces can be reduced to a minimum. With clearances of ~1 mm and no critical balance requirements, this device has very loose mechanical tolerances, further reducing cost. For initial development we propose a version suitable for control of a 1-3 kg Cubesat. At this scale, where spacecraft moments of inertia are very small, our low jitter torque, simplicity, and low cost are most advantageous. We also believe this approach is most likely to lead to an early flight opportunity.","Any mission that uses reaction wheels for attitude control can potentially benefit from this technology.

Currently, constant conductance, copper-methanol heat pipes are utilized on balloon payloads to remove the waste heat. It would be desirable to use a Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP) instead, to allow the thermal resistance to increase under cold operating or cold survival environment conditions, keeping the instrument section warm.  In spacecraft, thermal management is achieved using axially-grooved aluminum-ammonia heat pipes and VCHPs, which are relatively expensive to manufacture and validate.   Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) is proposing a low-cost VCHP based on smooth-bore, thin-wall stainless steel tubing, with either methanol or pentane as working fluids, that is capable of passively maintaining a relatively constant evaporator (payload) temperature while the sink temperature varies between -90oC and +40oC.  The thin wall will be much lighter and will provide much better temperature control due to its higher thermal resistance, while the combination of working fluid and envelope material result in a heat pipe that is much less expensive to manufacture than standard grooved aluminum heat pipes. Spacecraft VCHPs normally have the gas reservoir at the end of the condenser, and maintain its temperature with electrical heaters.  The proposed VCHP moves the reservoir near the evaporator, eliminating the need for electrical  power to control the temperature.  Preliminary calculations show that either system, methanol based or pentane based, is capable of meeting the thermal performance requirements. For both the pentane and methanol systems, the evaporator (payload) temperature varies less than 6oC while the heat sink temperature varies from  90oC to +40oC.","The immediate application for this technology is thermal management for balloon-borne instrumentation systems.  It is expected that the technology developed will provide temperature stabilization of the instrumentation system without the need for power-consuming control or trim heat and without the need for heavy and expensive louvers or heat switches.  The technology will be based on low-cost stainless steel/methanol heat pipes, which use inexpensive smooth-bore tubing and whose charging and fabrication processes are much less costly and time consuming than the industry-standard axially-grooved aluminum/ammonia heat pipes currently used on spacecraft.  Other applications would be the variable conductance thermal link between the Warm Electronics Box (WEB) from lunar anchor nodes and the radiator. During the long lunar night, the radiator temperature drops considerably increasing the waste heat flow from the WEB. The VCHP regulates the waste heat flow to the cold radiator to maintain the WEB at warm temperatures.","One commercial application is VCHP heat exchangers in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  The current scheme uses a bypass valve, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control, requires power, and has a large pressure drop.  ACT believes that VCHP heat exchangers can replace the current heat exchanger and control system with a passive system that automatically maintains the output stream from the heat exchanger at a constant temperature.  The second application is adding feedback temperature control to ACT's current line of commercial isothermal furnace liners, which are annular alkali metal heat pipes that provide nearly isothermal temperature uniformity.  Adding feedback control will allow the temperature to be controlled within millikelvins, adding in isothermal processing of materials, thermophysical properties characterization, and calibration of temperature references.",Passive Systems

Specifically, the sensors would be integrated onto the load bearing seams and/or outer balloon mesh polyethylene surface of the pressurized balloon system to accurately and continually measure axial loads.  Large axial load forces and extreme temperature ranges are typical for scientific balloon missions; therefore a durable, flexible, and thermally stable sensor material is needed.  NanoSonic would use its highly flexible, low-modulus Metal RubberTM (MRTM) materials as strain/pressure sensors that are capable of large cyclic deformation without failure.  MRTM is a free-standing nanocomposite material produced by the layer-by-layer combination of high performance polymers and electrically-conducting metal nanoparticles that provide durability and recoverability for sensor transduction, and a wide thermal operation range.  Importantly, MRTM can behave like a rubber band in that it can be folded / compressed for stowage and then can be deployed and continually pressurized without failure.  Also, because of the very low amount of metallic nanoclusters in the system (<0.02 volume %), the sensor system is extremely low-weight and would not alter the performance of the balloon.","NanoSonic proposes to develop an innovative sensor system for ultra long duration balloons (ULDB) that will reliably operate in extreme environments for extended intervals.  NASA researchers depend on reliable terrestrial superpressure vehicles (such as ULDB's) to conduct scientific studies to obtain important information about the earth's atmosphere.  Incorporating nanostructured sensor materials into/onto the balloon itself will provide means to push the limits beyond current capabilities and would allow for more reliable missions.  Nanostructured Metal RubberTM sensors do not alter/impair the mass-density or modulus of the balloon membrane, and would provide the ability to measure the axial pressure during missions.  There is much commercial potential for low-weight high strain sensors for scientific balloons and similar inflatable systems, specifically for NASA and the aerospace industry.  NanoSonic's low modulus Metal RubberTM sensor plies and multi-element sensor arrays have unique applications in systems where strain is large and conventional stress/strain sensors mechanically fail.","There is a large market for low-weight high strain sensors for scientific balloons, high altitude morphing systems, and similar inflatable systems, specifically for NASA and the aircraft industry.

Technologies developed during this SBIR effort could be used for several NASA applications, including other planetary exploration missions, inflatable space habitats, and scientific terrestrial balloons.  NASA JPL's effort to develop a Montgolfiere balloon for Mars could benefit from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models validated with data generated by a similar Terrestrial Test Bed.

For this purpose it is reasonable (due to the high density of the Venus atmosphere) to use inflatable balloons, which occupy minimal space in the folded position and possess buoyancy upon being inflated. The Venus atmosphere contains hot (up to 460oC) clouds of sulfuric acid. The only kinds of material for an inflatable to withstand such high temperatures are metals. A sequence of operations is proposed to build balloons of different shapes with diffusion bonding of stainless steels or other alloys, which are most resistant against hot 85% sulfuric acid. However, even these materials possess a many times greater corrosion rate than that satisfying the current topic requirements on the balloon life time and areal density. In order to provide the required corrosion resistance, the fully bonded balloon will be coated with a thin layer of gold or tantalum by a PVD process or with gold by electroplating so that the entire laminate would possess an areal density of below 1000 g/m3. Building a seamless bellows by PVD is a backup option.","All extra terrestrial missions, which require lightweight materials for inflatables (balloons, bellows, ballutes, etc.) resistant against elevated temperatures and unfriendly environments, which can also withstand relatively high mechanical loads (including impacts) and retain strength at elevated temperatures.

Such a propulsion system is both simple and reliable, and offers reasonable performance.  However, the simplicity and reliability enjoyed today is the result of a nearly two-decade effort designed to identify and perfect a spontaneous catalyst.  Modern hydrazine replacements generally do not work well with hydrazine catalysts, so the enormous costs associated with a new catalyst development effort have stalled the widespread acceptance of potential hydrazine replacements.Our proposed effort will explore the use of an alternative ignition source that eliminates the need for a catalyst bed entirely.  It achieves the same simplicity enjoyed by traditional monopropellant propulsion systems, but dramatically increases thruster response time on both startup and especially shutdown.  It requires low power because it exploits a unique property of most of the propellants often cited as the future replacement for hydrazine.  It is also low cost because it requires a very low part count and development issues will be trivial.","Hydrazine monopropellant systems have been used on a number of satellites and spacecraft, including the Deep Space Climate Observatory, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, the New Horizons satellite, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Phoenix Lander, and the Advanced Composition Explorer.  Adopting a green, safe monopropellant that does not require a catalyst bed will find use throughout the Agency's inventory of future spacecraft and satellites that otherwise would have used hydrazine.  As a non-catalyst based ignition system is developed and flown, acceptance of a safe, green monopropellant will be rapid across the civil space community.","As with NASA applications, the primary non-NASA applications must necessarily include commercial satellites, a huge commercial market.  In addition, future missile defense kill vehicles will use divert and attitude control systems that operate with green propellants to eliminate hazards of shipping, using, and de-militarizing systems.

This volcanic ash particulate information would then be incorporated into standard E-PIREP reports as well as distributed via air traffic controllers. The innovation is a new capability for making in-situ measurement of cloud particulates to improve pilot awareness of hazardous operating conditions, such as those recently experienced by aircraft engines operating in the North Atlantic near Iceland.  Cloud and Ash particulate information is currently obtained by positioning a satellite to a location, produces limited data, and is cost prohibitive.IDI proposes to develop a flight deployable optical probe which will determine various airborne  particulates such as volcanic ash particle size and density.

An order of magnitude improvement in navigation performance will be achieved by fusing low-cost inertial sensor measurements with attitude and position measurements from a small-aperture GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensor. The Miniature Integrated Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam System (MIDAAS(TM)) obtains position, velocity, attitude, and time (PVAT) measurements directly from GPS signals. MIDAAS employs an innovative small single-aperture antenna to compute full 3-D attitude (roll, pitch and yaw) using only two RF channels, leading to a smaller, simpler, lower-cost GPS/A receiver system. A stand-alone (gyro-less) MIDAAS unit can also be used to provide attitude information in addition to position and velocity on very small platforms. A unique ultra-tightly coupled (UTC) navigation architecture makes the system inherently more robust to interference and significantly improves the attitude estimate. In addition, MIDAAS provides active anti-jam protection and multipath mitigation thereby further improving the system integrity and robustness. The system performance will be demonstrated during the Phase I effort with data obtained during several flight tests, and will be compared with a higher-accuracy, more expensive GPS/IMU system.","Integrating MIDAAS with a commercial-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU) will provide better than tactical-grade navigation accuracies at a low-cost, which in turn will enable highly accurate UAV platform attitude control with corresponding science payload instrument stability and pointing accuracy.

Furthermore, the improved attitude accuracy of the navigation system will enable precision flight control for highly repeatable terrain monitoring. The GPS/A technology is also applicable to spin-stabilized platforms such as sounding rockets. Furthermore, the anti-jam (AJ) GPS architecture improves the robustness of the system against unintentional and intentional interference thereby improving the probability of successfully completing each mission.","The MIDAAS GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensor technology and inertial navigation system (INS) is applicable to a wide range of military and civilian applications including manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), micro air vehicles (MAVs), unattended ground sensors (UGS), handheld positioning units, recreational/virtual reality orienting devices, radio-controlled (RC) vehicles, ground vehicles, and far-target locators (FTL).

By extending the plug and play concept to ""3D Print and Play""  in which entire satellites will be fabricated layer-by-layer into a monolithic, intelligent, conformal structure. Consequently, the development time is radically reduced, not from ""months to days"" but rather ""days to hours,"" by automating the manufacturing component of development.","CubeSats provide a key benefit to NASA from the extremely minimized SWAT of this platform. This translates into an easily deployable space platform that enables the opportunity to expand and accelerate experimentation with self healing networking, swarming, and sensor suites. The ability to 3D print structural electronic devices in the SPA platform with highly integrated sensor payloads will further accelerate these experiments. The ability to design and fabricate in 3D opens up new applications while driving the per satellite, per function cost. The capability to design and fabricate in 3D that is form factor and function agnostic opens the door to any application be it small like CubeSats, or large like TDRS. Total freedom in 3D will unlock new exploration, and platform opportunities.","CubeSats also fill a need in the DoD, and commercial sectors. The NRO is looking at networked CubeSat ""constellations"" as the next generation of satellites that provide redundancy as well as a smaller target for adversary countries to hit. Additionally, CubeSats provide a great opportunity for expanding education on the support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics for Universities and High/Middle Schools. The ability to 3D print CubeSats from a 3D graphic also pulls in an artistic skill set that will bring in a new thought process for CubeSats as well as other functional devices. This aesthetic also brings in a potential new breed of designer, or engineer from youth that operate in the cyber 3D world through gaming and graphic software like Adobe Illustrator. Any 3D object that can incorporate aesthetics with structure and with electronic function opens the door to many applications as well as those yet to be imagined.","Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Composites; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Metallics; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Processing Methods; Prototyping; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)"

The primary goal of the MAX-C mission is to acquire ~20 cores, 1cm diameter by 5cm long, and place them in a cache for return back to Earth. Before deciding which cores to return, scientists would also need to analyze rocks in-situ. The tasks required for the MAX-C mission therefore would include: 1. Acquisition of 1cm x 5 cm core for earth return2. Acquisition of a core for in-situ analysis3. Acquisition of rock powder for in situ analysis4. Brushing of rocks for in situ analysis (as done on MER)5. Abrading of rocks for in situ analysis (as done on MER)In this proposal we are advocating an approach used every day in terrestrial applications; that is having a single appliance (drill) with many attachments (various bit types for coring, caching, abrading, brushing and powder acquisition) for different applications. This approach offers mass, cost and volume savings and thus will be particularly attractive to the MAX-C mission.","Future robotic astrobiology and geology missions such as Mars Sample Return, Astrobiology Field Laboratory and other Mid-Range Rover missions will benefit greatly from the ability to produce and capture rock and regolith cores, abrade and brush rock surfaces using an arm-deployed, compact, low mass, low power device. A system utilizing a surface drill and a suite of bits for different applications could be deployed during lunar sortie missions by astronauts (i.e., hand held coring drill) since it is desirable to bring small cores back as opposed to large rocks, and/or abrade rocks in situ.","Scientists often use small drills to acquire core samples for the study of everything from geological classification to ocean drilling and surveying. Traditionally, petroleum engineers will use large cores to extract information about boundaries between sandstone, limestone, and shale. This process is time consuming so smaller cores are sometimes taken. This method of sampling is called sidewall coring and provides more information to the petroleum engineer than simply logged data. Scientists studying earthquake mechanics could also benefit in a similar fashion.

These missions involve the use of a coring tool to produce rock and soil cores. The MEPAG committee recommends that core acquisition take place directly into an individual encapsulation sleeve with a pressed-in cap. The improved sample encapsulation technology of this proposal can be activated while the drill bit is still in the drill hole, thus preserving sample integrity before the core is even extracted. It also insures the sample does not fall out during bit extraction. The sleeves can handle cores of rock, soil or regolith; and are translucent or transparent enabling inspection of the core after extraction. They preserve stratigraphy, volatiles, voids and gaps, and incomplete cores. A unique aspect of the sleeves instills the ability to preserve core integrity even in the vibration and shock environment of a sample return mission. This proposed Phase 1 effort involves a design trade study, analysis and a proof-of-concept test.  At the end of Phase 1, the innovations will be at TRL 4. A proposed Phase 2 effort would involve integration into a core drill design, environmental testing, and shock and vibration testing to advance the technology to TRL 6.","The Sample Encapsulation Technology of this proposal could be used for any sample collection or return mission to the Moon, Mars or Asteroids.

When the radio beacon-equipped OS is within range of the ERV's optical sensors, the ERV will optically track and approach the OS, maneuvering itself to place the OS within its capture device. One of the key technologies required to accomplish this mission involves a low-mass, highly reliable mechanism that detects contact with and captures the OS, and, once the OS is captured, moves the OS to a containment area for the return trip to Earth.  There is an on-going body of research into such capture mechanism designs and the various advantages and challenges of these technologies.

This proposal leverages the state-of-the-art research into sample capture mechanisms, contact dynamics and capture mechanism detection methods and builds on the team's experience with the Synchronized Position, Hold, Engage, and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) system to develop a low cost, LEO test strategy that minimizes the risk for later Mars deployment.","The primary application for the Capture Mechanism and SPHERES/ISS test strategy is in support of the NASA Mars Sample Return mission. A successful Phase1/Phase 2 project would result in a system design ready for implementation, integration, test and deployment with the MSR mission. While designed for MSR, the capture mechanism design and risk-mitigation test approach has applications for additional NASA sample-return missions, such icy-moons. Additionally, a successful demonstration of the cost-effective use of the ISS as a system checkout and launch platform has significant benefits to NASA in reducing the cost and risk of testing small systems in LEO.","We anticipate that there are also applications beyond NASA, particularly in the military and commercial sectors. For example, the capture mechanism design may have applications such as the capture and control of space debris in Earth Orbit threatening strategic and/or commercial assets within similar orbits. Such a mechanism, when used in conjunction with a debris tracking and control system, could approach and capture such debris and then maneuver the captured material either to a different orbit, or, if in LEO, to a reentry trajectory to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.","Actuators & Motors; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Deployment; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

The current GUI has many deficiencies, but also many strengths which we will incorporate in this new design.  We will capitalize on these strengths and build upon them by extending the functionality, thus increasing the range of possible uses, the total user experience and its scalability.Graphical user interfaces for performance tools are crucial in enhancing the users ability to understand analysis information gathered by a tool in the HPC environment because they give an immediate visual representation of the application's performance.   A graphical user interface allows users to quickly focus in on areas of the science and engineering application program where bottlenecks are occurring.The graphical user interface has been identified by Argo Navis Technologies LLC as the leading portion of the project that is preventing extensive adoption and use in this industry.  Numerous users, upon which this open source software project depends, have asserted many concerns regarding the current GUI.  Within this proposal several problem areas have been listed, along with solutions directly addressing each.  With this funding, Open|SpeedShop will become a predominant force in the HPC performance tools domain.","Open|SpeedShop has been available to researchers at NASA Ames beginning in 2007.  Since then, Open|SpeedShop research project personnel have given on-site tutorials at NASA Ames and have worked closely with NASA researchers to help profile their applications.While working with NASA researcher Dr. Sharadchandr Gavali to profile the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation application, the Open|SpeedShop team received valuable user interface feedback which resulted in many of the innovations listed in this proposal.  Notably, the ideas of performance analysis wizards that assist the user in interpreting gathered data and identifying changes to increase efficiencies; intuitive 3D views that allow the user to easily visualize large quantities of performance data; methods that enable the user to quickly determine the scalability of their application.Increasing the productive use of the Open|SpeedShop tool will empower NASA researchers to more efficiently utilize the computational resources that are available to them across the Agency.  The innovations in this proposal will accomplish this for NASA application scientists and computer scientists.","As an open source software project, Open|SpeedShop has been available to the high performance computing industry with its first release in 2004.  The primary Non-NASA customers to benefit will the researchers at the Department of Energy (DOE) Laboratories.   As described in the proposal the DOE and its laboratories have been research and development partners of Open|SpeedShop from the beginning.  All science and engineering application codes run on high performance computing systems are potential beneficiaries of the work proposed under this SBIR.  The Department of Defense is the next agency that will directly benefit from a more robust Open|SpeedShop open source software product.The HPC community will additionally benefit from another innovation that directly addresses issues seen with machines at the Department of Energy's leadership-class and university facilities that are being used remotely, nationally and internationally. The use of any parallel performance tool in a distributed way has typically been a challenging experience for the user.  Current tools typically run on the target system, meaning the user must contend with high latencies in interactions with the tool's Graphical User Interface.  Our remote Graphical User Interface (GUI) innovation approaches this problem by reducing the amount of data transferred over the network while allowing the user to interact with a more robust GUI.","Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Computer System Architectures; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Tools/EVA Tools; Verification/Validation Tools"

Even though its use has become commonplace in the business realm, its use in HPC is still limited to a few applications. This project aims at developing, prototyping, validating, and commercializing the world's first cloud-enabled acceleration library of linear algebra solvers. Considering that linear algebra is the most common computational bottleneck in scientific software applications (more than 70% of HPC cycles), the resulting Specialized Linear Algebra Cloud technology will directly impact numerous applications, such as the design of aerospace and automotive vehicles, exploration for new oil & gas reserves, nuclear energy research, and the design of computer chips, among many others.The Phase I work will incorporate innovations for removing the bandwidth bottleneck in the outsource model of a Specialized Linear Algebra Cloud. We will also design a core platform able to support solver-as-a-service technology in HPC environments. The Phase I technology will be evaluated in three different scenarios: (A) Infrastructure Cloud outsourcing computations to Specialized Clouds, (B) Infrastructure Cloud making use of internal Specialized Clouds, and (C) End-users accelerating code through direct access to Specialized Clouds.Accelogic's novel numerical libraries are expected to provide next-generation speed/efficiency to existing cloud systems, with direct application to NASA programs, other government applications, and many valuable uses in academia and the private sector.  The Phase I proof-of-concept work should advance the technology from TRL 2 to TRL 3, and we expect to reach TRL 5 during Phase II. A world-class combination of experts in algorithm design, computer networks, and numerical analysis pursue these development goals.","NASA's supercomputer users must solve large-scale linear algebra problems faster and cheaperyet with guaranteed accuracy. The linear-algebra acceleration cloud we envision producing during this SBIR project will meet this NASA need in the near term. We expect to generate a value proposition that results in a Phase III NASA acquisition (with cloud computing centers procuring our software, mainly through our hardware partners, as an add-on to their hardware enhancement purchases.) Accelogic could then sell an integrated solution that has a clear procurement channel, and that will work on Day 1. (Our Phase III partners will work closely with us to ensure seamless/high-performance integration.) In particular, the framework described in the proposal will enable NASA to take full advantage of cloud-enabled petascale computing by providing a set of tools that can be readily integrated into current (and future) applications by replacing standard calls to state-of-the-art solvers like ScaLAPACK and PETSc.","For other government customers (e.g., DOD) and private-sector users, the new technology will be integrated into Accelogic's HPC product line, LAPACKrc, which is Accelogic's heterogeneous library (currently under development) for solving linear algebra problems. This SBIR addresses the Internet/Intranet-based linear equation solver server that will allow users to submit jobs remotely and to pay on a job basis with no new hardware costs.  Large companies and government/academic/corporate supercomputer centers will purchase the server technology and serve its own users. Small and medium-sized companies needing ""speed on a limited budget"" will benefit from purchasing service from the availability of such servers on a job basis.  Technology-driven companies that must solve large-scale linear equation problems, such as those in structural design and computational chemistry, along with the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) industry, supercomputer manufacturers and industries providing cloud services will also generate demand.","Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Computer System Architectures; Data Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Although NASA now provides (together with other agencies such as the USGS)  a capability for accessing, manipulating, and visualizing these data, an enormous gap still exists between the sensor data and the visualization capability, largely due to the rapid technological advances with respect to desktop visualization of large datasets.  The challenge addressed in this research is to develop new methods for automating the access and processing of raw sensor data, sharing data and methods among researchers, and integrating visualization throughout the process.  To meet this challenge, we will develop two new innovations: Geo-Cloud and COAST HPGIS. Geo-Cloud is the distributed network environment that maintains connectivity between a geo-browser and Geo-Resources (sensor data, GIS datasets, models, simulations, and metadata).  The Geo-Cloud maintains all metadata (and ontology) required to efficiently catalog, locate, store, access, and update Geo-Resources.  The significance of the Geo-Cloud creation is that it is a highly performing, scalable, network environment that encompasses: 1) a high performance cloud computing (HPCC) environment, and 2) geographical context (HPGIS) whereby users can store, access, and manipulate extensive geographical resources.  The Geo-Cloud provides virtualized access to Internet2 and supercomputing resources for processing very large datasets and simulations.COAST HPGIS is an enhanced version of the NASA COAST product which is based on the NASA World Wind geo-browser.  COAST HPGIS includes plug-ins, overlays, and interfaces for COAST in order to enable interaction with the Geo-Cloud for real-time visualization of temporal and parametric simulations and models.","The development of the Geo-Cloud and COAST HPGIS technology will enable the integration of models and simulations used to conduct scientific studies using large NASA datasets.  The following NASA commercial applications are envisioned.--COAST HPGIS which provides access to extensive Geo-Resources from within the NASA COAST geo-browser allowing researchers to easily share GIS assets across a high speed network.--COAST HPGIS-PV which provides a capability to perform real-time parametric and temporal visualization of GIS data layers.  --COAST HPGIS-SPEC which allows COAST users to directly interact with powerful Spectroscopy resources to select, filter, and analyze multi-beam and hyper-spectral datasets.--COAST HPGIS-SIM which allows COAST users to interact with models and simulation of GIS data","Applications of the HPGIS technology will be limitless.  As researchers begin to test and share Geo-Resources and models and simulators, many new applications will be in demand.  In addition to the research community, we expect that the use of GIS-enabled data will grow in commercial markets that make use of scientific and industry-specific (market intelligence) data.

GRANT will be based upon a generic and flexible implementation of the optimal estimation inversion technique for atmospheric retrievals (OPT), and be driven by a state-of-the-art FUV-NIR atmospheric radiance model (AURIC) for its forward model. GRANT will possess a flexible, user-configurable sensor model for generating realistic simulated data that tailors the retrieval algorithm to a specific sensor and measurement system.The anticipated Phase I result will be a working prototype analysis tool for application to terrestrial and planetary atmospheres. This prototype will be validated against a focused set of existing retrieval algorithms using remote sensing data from several NASA and DoD sensors. Phase II will yield a prototype that includes additional retrievable geophysical parameters, has a graphical user interface, incorporates a detailed formal error analysis capability, and has improved forward modeling capabilities such as energetic particle transport and enhanced Visible/IR modeling.The TRL levels at the start and end of Phase I are estimated to be 3 and 4, respectively.","If the proposed development effort is successful, the fully functional Phase II analysis tool will be applicable to a wide range of current and future NASA missions including: Cassini-Huygens, CALIPSO, SDO, SORCE, NOAA-N, TIMED/GUVI, MAVEN, New Horizons, and IT-Energetics. Application of the Generalized geophysical Retrieval & ANalysis Tool for planetary atmospheres (GRANT) to these and other NASA missions will provide much-needed support for important science objectives such as understanding how the interaction of the solar wind with atmospheres affects planetary environments and evolution.  Most of these are current missions, for which the software would be adapted to retrieve geophysical parameters from existing data. Possible benefits range from validation of existing algorithms and data products to implementation of new retrieval strategies and additional data products.The full capability of the software, however, is best realized in applications to missions that are still in the development stage. In this scenario the analysis tool will be used to its full potential, initially aiding in the design of the sensor and measurement strategy and ultimately evolving into a tool for operational data analysis as the mission matures.  In this regard the IT-Energetics mission provides the ideal application of the GRANT software.","We anticipate potential commercial demand for the GRANT analysis tool from large aerospace contractors involved in the development of sensors, platforms and integrated mission design for geophysical remote sensing programs. The strongest demand in this sector will likely be for the software's simulation capabilities, which will provide a powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating competing design options in the sensor and mission development phase. We also expect demand for the software's retrieval and data processing capability from sensor vendors who continue to support operational and legacy missions through routine data production.Ball Aerospace has already recognized this potential by providing a letter of endorsement for this proposed effort. One particular application of interest is tailoring the prototype GRANT tool to support their CALIPSO program during Phase II. CALIPSO is a NASA satellite mission to study clouds and aerosols, for which Ball supplied two of the primary sensors.

Applications include Direct Broadcast of data products generated on board the planned HyspIRI mission, which will avoid the time-consuming bottleneck of hyperspectral image telemetry. By combining FLAASH with a new radiation transport look-up table, and adding geographic information to the metadata stream, a unique, near-real-time capability would be developed and demonstrated on the NASA Elastic Cloud or Infrastructure As A Service.

This minimization process of ""fitting"" a model todata is computationally demanding, since it requires evaluating the often complexmodels many times and minimizing a function of many variables. Fast, more efficientfitting techniques are therefore required in order to fully harvest the scientificoutput from NASA missions.In this project, we will develop a fast, general-purpose parameter fitting softwaretool suite taking advantage of inexpensive, high-performance graphics processingunits (GPUs).

COLLADA Computing algorithms will be developed in the JAVA language to support mathematical and topological operations on these COLLADA spatial objects on multiple compute platforms and operating systems.

Many major vendors are now supporting this technology and such systems are becoming increasingly common everywhere from university research labs to the Top500 supercomputer list.  To take advantage of these systems, however, requires understanding a new programming paradigm, namely the ability to program GPUs.  In this project, we propose the development of tools to make programming massive GPU clusters transparent to the developer, thus allowing them to access their extreme computational power without significant additional effort.  Specifically, we propose the development of dense and sparse linear algebra libraries that are optimized for the underlying GPU hardware but are called by the user from a standard, high-level interface.  This work will build off our NASA-funded and commercially-successful CULA libraries, a set of GPU-accelerated, dense linear algebra libraries that run on single GPUs.  More recently we have begun adding sparse linear algebra libraries to this package and prototyping their transition to multiple GPUs located in a single node.  The proposed effort will involve scaling this technology so it is available on massive GPU clusters, thus making the power of such systems easily accessible to all programmers.","Dense and sparse computations arise in an extremely wide array of applications.  For instance, finite element and finite volume methods (FEM, FVM) common in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) space; an area where NASA has many important efforts especially related to space missions and weather prediction. For example, the CFD code Overflow is widely used by NASA when designing launch and re-reentry vehicles. Currently this code is used to study the air loads on the NASA space shuttles when evaluating design changes. Another example related to NASA's space mission is the INS3D code. This CFD code is used to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for steady-state and time varying flow. This code has been used to study the gravitational effects of blood flow in the human brain under varying conditions. In addition to space mission problems, NASA also has a vested interest in CFD-based weather prediction models. For example, the NASA Finite Volume General Circulation Model (fvGCM) and Parallel Ocean Program (POP) codes are large-scale climate prediction models important for analyzing weather effects such as global warming and hurricane predictions. The availability of accelerated sparse solver libraries will be of immediate interest to a large portion of NASA's CFD computing projects that are typically bottlenecked by sparse computations.","Applications include the entire FVM and FEM space that further expands the applicability of our solvers to a large simulations in fields involved with modeling and simulation. For instance, the models used by circuit simulation, heat transfer, and structural mechanics can all are often solved on large HPC systems. Accelerated solvers will allow engineers to more quickly turn around designs with increased detail and accuracy. Large matrices commonly arise in other fields involving statistics and optimization where a large amount number of elements have various interactions. For example, electrical power systems, traffic flow optimization, economics, search index rankings, and the modeling of chemical processes are just a small sample of fields where the interaction of a large number coupled elements are represented through matrices. Accelerated solvers and decompositions will allow scientists to rapidly study larger problems in less time.The use of linear algebra also has applications in a field where GPUs are already prevalent: computer rendering. The realistic representation of real world phenomenon such as shallow water simulation, smoke and fire rendering, and depth of field calculation can all be achieved through sparse matrix calculations. These phenomena can be expressed as partial differential equations which can then be represented as matrices. For real time rendering GPU acceleration is a very accessible and attractive solution.","Analytical Methods; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Development Environments; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Programming Languages; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Data is not knowledge, however, and the challenge has been how to analyze and gain insight from the massive quantities of data that are generated.  In order to address the peta-scale visualization challenges, we propose to develop a scientific visualization software that would enable real-time visualization capability of extremely large data sets. We plan to accomplish this by extending the ParaView visualization architecture to extreme scales. ParaView is an open source software installed on all HPC sites including NASA's Pleiades and has a large user base in diverse areas of science and engineering. Our proposed solution will significantly enhance the scientific return from NASA HPC investments by providing the next generation of open source data analysis and visualization tools for very large datasets.  To test our solution on real world data with complex pipeline, we have partnered with SciberQuest, who have recently performed the largest kinetic simulations of magnetosphere using 25 K cores on Pleiades and 100 K cores on Kraken.  Given that IO is the main bottleneck for  scientific visualization at large scales, we propose to work closely with Pleiades's systems team and provide efficient prepackaged general purpose I/O component for ParaView for structured and unstructured data across a spectrum of scales and access patterns with focus on Lustre file system used by Pleiades.","Our tools will significantly impact large supercomputing systems such as NASA's Pleiades. Our approach build on existing NASA technology and installed visualization systems, including ParaView, and leverages work that our subcontractor SciberQuest has performed: kinetic simulations of the magnetosphere using 25K computational cores on Pleiades and 100K cores on Kraken. The major benefit of the work is that it will dramatically improve the IO bottleneck found in many supercomputing systems, including the Lustre file system used by Pleiades.","We expect our solution to find rapid adoption among the supercomputing user base since it circumvents the well known problems associated with visualization of large data sets with minimal interruption of existing visualization environments. We expect other non-NASA groups such as NSF's Kraken and Ranger, and DOE's Jaguar, to embrace this technology.","Computer System Architectures; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Processing; Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

The amount of data collected and stored electronically is doubling every three years. Many researchers are simply overwhelmed by the amount of data. Scientific visualization remains the dominant form of data exploration but current tools are focused on image creation and lack the much needed embedded analysis capabilities. To address this urgent need, we propose to develop and introduce a first-of-its kind tool kit called SciViz2.  SciViz2 brings together key innovations in three separate fields of scientific visualization, data mining, and computer vision to offer an integrated solution for physics mining of the most complex of data sets;  multi-dimensional, multi-variate data sets. SciViz2 bridges the existing gap in software technology by providing a scalable knowledge discovery tool that combines the power of machine learning techniques with scientific visualization.Our Phase I goal is to develop a prototype and demonstrate the viability of the solution by applying it to one of the most challenging data analysis problem, that is the data from peta-scale particle simulations.  The underlying physics involves complex interaction of multi-variates and the output involves both grid-based and particle phase space data with nearly trillion particles and over 200 TB of data from a single run.   Phase II activity would involve full development of SciViz2 and its dissemination to the wider community. Our close collaboration with NASA's HPC group will be heavily leveraged to test and release the software for open use.","NASA applications include all its supported areas of research based on high performance computing.

We will leverage Harmonia's past work on Rise plug-in for Ada, c, C++ to create product that builds on Eclipse Photran as well as pFUnit and FUnit.Facilities we will implement include annotating source code as an overlay to the existing code, so that developers learning about the code are free to mark it up without affecting the original code, and creating various views tracing execution, showing potential concurrency, etc. We also integrate unit testing, graphical editing of workflows to create scripts that are used with Fortran, support the analysis and porting of Fortran code to different target architectures, and provide a web service link to accommodate cases where the Fortran compiler runs on a different machine from the IDE.

In the MRWE, a stream of CO2 is heated by solar energy or waste heat from a nuclear reactor and then passed through a vessel containing Martian soil freshly removed from the ground. The hot CO2 will cause water absorbed in the Martian soil to outgas, whereupon it will be swept along by the CO2 to a condenser chamber where ambient Martian cold temperatures will be used to condense the water from the CO2. The CO2 is then pumped back to the heater where it is reheated and recirculated back to the soil vessel to remove more water.  Measurements taken by the Viking mission showed that randomly gathered  Martian soil contains at least 1% water by weight, and probably more than 3%. This being the case, the MWRE should prove to be a highly effective way of acquiring water on Mars. By doing so, it will eliminate the requirement to transport hydrogen to Mars in order to make methane fuel, and allow all the propellant needed for a Mars to Earth return flight to be manufactured on Mars using a Sabatier/electrolysis (S/E) cycle, without any need for auxiliary oxygen production through zirconia cells, reverse water gas shift cycles, or other systems. This is highly advantageous since the S/E cycle is the simplest and easiest to implement of all Mars in-situ propellant production methods. The ability to extract water from Mars will also serve to supply the crew of a Mars missions with copious supplies of water itself, which after propellant, is the most massive logistic component of a Mars mission. By eliminating the need to transport fuel, oxygen, and water to Mars, the MWRE will have a major effect in reducing the mass, cost, and risk  or human Mars exploration.","The primary initial application of the MRWE is to provide a reliable, low cost, low mass technology to produce water, hydrogen, and liquid oxygen on the surface of Mars out of indigenous materials at low power.

In addition, small versions of the MWRE could be used to help make the return propellant for a Mars sample return (MSR) mission on the Martian surface, thereby making such a mission both cheaper to launch and much easier to land, as the landing mass limits of current aeroshells will not be exceeded. This could be an enabling development for the MSR mission.","The MRWE could be useful in arid terrestrial climates.  Nations in arid areas, particularly the Middle East and North Africa, have spent billions of dollars on construction of evaporative and reverse osmosis desalination plants for irrigation and use for the populace.  Yet water is still routinely rationed in many of these countries.  Even in the driest regions of the Earth, the soil is several times wetter than on Mars, and the MRWE will operate an order of magnitude more efficiently.  Even if desalination technology remains more economical in coastal areas, MWRE units using solar concentrators to provide heat offer many advantages for millions of potentials users in landlocked nations such as Mali, Niger, or Chad.  Regions that are too far from the coastline to economically pipe water in, such as the Empty Quarter of Saudi Arabia, or the Western Desert in the United States, may also be potential markets.  It should be noted that in contrast to water obtained from natural liquid sources, the condensate obtained from water vaporized out of the ground will be pure, and much safer to drink than other supplies that may be available in underdeveloped areas. MRWE units sized for vehicles traveling in desert regions are also an attractive option.  Such units could reduce logistical requirements for the military and could also supply civilians operating in remote areas.  The MRWE concept would be ideal for these applications since it is very lightweight, cheap, and portable.","Conversion; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Heat Exchange; In Situ Manufacturing; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Surface Propulsion"

Standard size separation methods for dry materials often depend on gravity as the primary body force. For separation of small sizes, gravity-force is usually supplemented with vibration and shearing flow. Granular materials naturally stratify during shear-flow with larger particles rising to the top. Depending on frequency and intensity, vibrations alone can induce large particles to rise to the top in a granular bed, independent of shear flow.  The proposed centrifugal size-separators utilize the natural size stratification of flowing granular solids. They will function equally well under reduced gravity conditions and in vacuum. The nominal design is a configuration with only one moving part and no blades, or other high-wear components. Shearing flow and vibrations combined with a size-separating screen at the outside (or 'bottom') of the flow will separate particles, with the fines passing through the outer wall screen, and the coarse material passing axially through the continuous feed system. Multiple size separation streams are possible. Alternate designs with shear-enhancing blades, 'above' or inside the screen, will also be evaluated. Various approaches for screen deblinding, and other robustness enhancements, are part of the proposed designs. With appropriate selection of passing-screen size, and deblinding enhancements, the centrifugal-sieves could be used for regolith processor feedstock conditioning to remove material > 0.5cm diameter, and with alternate settings and screen size, also used for a degree of beneficiation, to select particular size ranges that have the highest percentage of desired mineral content.  The centrifugal-sieve concept can be scaled to any desired mass flow rate.","Reliable, robust separation methods that operate independent of gravity level would be useful for granular materials size separation for regolith processor feedstock conditioning. For example, the proposed centrifugal-sieve could remove regolith particles > 0.5 cm diameter before dumping the material into a storage bin during excavation operations for oxygen extraction.  The proposed centrifuging sieve could also be used for a degree of mineral beneficiation to separate particles by size and thus, increase the concentration of particular minerals which are more prevalent in certain size fractions of bulk regolith. The proposed centrifugal-sieves can operate in low-gravity (1/6-g and 3/8-g) and micro-gravity as well as utilize multiple feedstock sources.  The proposed separation concept can be tested in 1/6 g flight experiments and ground vacuum environments.  The Discrete Element method (DEM) regolith flow simulation software that will be enhanced and utilized in the selection and evaluation of sieve designs will also be of value as a verified simulation tool for ISRU equipment design.","Size classification is utilized throughout the mineral, chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  Improved methods to achieve size separation, especially gentle methods suitable for friable materials, could have wide applications.  Granular solids are an integral part of the multi-billion dollar fundamental chemicals and agriculture industries.  Size segregation is a small but important aspect of the fundamental materials industries. A portion of the size-separation currently done with vibrating screens and gravity, could be replaced by the proposed method, and even a small slice of the solids separations business could be significant economically for a startup company.","Minerals; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

For engineering-scale problems FE analyses utilizing soil-mechanics-based constitutive models have long been utilized in civil engineering to evaluate stresses and deformations up to failure, even including some plastic flow. The extremely large strains, bulking and recompaction behavior in excavation, hopper flow and regolith processing, however, are generally beyond the capability of most FE codes. Mesh-free methods offer an attractive option  especially when coupled with critical-state soil-mechanics based constitutive models allowing unlimited shear deformation and flow. This Phase-1 project will enhance a new mesh-free SPH-based simulation model, initiated as part of an earlier SBIR project, to demonstrate its potential to meet NASA's need for a robust simulation tool for regolith manipulation and flow. Enhancements include providing smooth transitions as new free surfaces are created, parallelized algorithms so that high resolution can be maintained as the physical scale of the problems is increased to realistic engineering sizes, and inclusion of realistic cohesion in the critical-state soil-mechanics constitutive model. The large fraction of very fine particulates in lunar and Martian regoliths (e.g., particles < 20-microns) precludes particle-scale DEM models from ever being able to both maintain particle-scale fidelity and simulate engineering-scale problems. Utilization of larger-than-nature 'calculational particles' in DEM code leads to new challenges  calibration of those 'particles' so that the calculational material will reproduce the constitutive behavior of the original granular assembly. The mesh-free SPH model developed here has the potential to become a new robust simulation tool to address NASA's challenging regolith manipulation and flow problems.","New high-fidelity simulation tools for cohesive powders will be applicable to a wide range of ISRU situations including excavation, transport, handling, platform mobility, slope stability and wheeled vehicle traction analysis. New designs in all of these areas will benefit from improved robustness and fidelity of simulation models. The ability to test sensitivity of equipment designs to regolith model parameter values, can greatly assist in prioritizing regolith characterization measurements and subsequent optimization of equipment designs once the properties of the regolith have been more accurately characterized. Constitutive models specially designed for very low consolidation states of regolith (which can occur in reduced gravity environments such as on lunar or asteroid surfaces) will provide new capability for simulation and engineering analysis of tools and mission hardware including sample acquisition and handling.","The pharmaceutical industry has a large number of applications, which would benefit from significantly improved simulation capabilities for cohesive powders in a variety of pharmaceutical material manufacturing, transport and handling operations.  The FDA's Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative emphasizes the need for pharmaceutical makers to understand the processes they use and to design the processes for quality, reliability, robustness and consistency. These goals overlap significantly with NASA's needs to better understand the processing of bulk cohesive granular material.

Currently envisioned ISRU plants include production of oxygen from hydrogen reduction of lunar regolith and extraction of water from Martian regolith or asteroid material.  These ISRU processes require heating of the regolith to high reaction temperatures.  Once the reaction is complete, most thermal energy exits the system in the spent regolith batch and is therefore wasted.  Creare proposes to recover this heat and use it to preheat fresh regolith prior to entering the reactor.  Our novel heat recovery design is purely passive, robust, and compact to accommodate tight mass and volume constraints.  Our heat exchanger promises to recover 80% of the otherwise wasted thermal energy.  This energy savings can either be used to reduce the power plant size or speed up the production rates of the ISRU system.  The Creare team has firsthand knowledge of the current ISRU research status and has the necessary background in mechanical design, heat exchanger design, as well as the facilities and commercialization expertise, to make this project a success.","The main application area for NASA for the proposed heat exchanger for ISRU plants will be for future missions now being planned to Mars and the Moon, as well as other bodies such as Near Earth objects (NEOs).  Long duration missions to the Moon will need substantial amounts of resources for life support and energy.  Martian sample return missions and manned missions to Mars may be prohibitively expensive, technically exigent, and unacceptably risky unless resources can be produced on Mars.For example, NASA will need an ISRU propellant production plant on Mars for the sample return mission that it is envisioning in the 2020s.","Many commercial processes involve the heating of particulate matter to high temperatures to affect a certain reaction, e.g., Portland cement kilns, drying processes in the agricultural and paper sectors, etc.  As energy costs increase and with the focus on limiting green house gas emissions, more emphasis will be placed on improving the overall energy efficiency of such processes.

The innovative reactor technology ""flashes off"" desired hydrocarbon products as they form, thus preventing the over-cracking of the polymers into more volatile hydrocarbons.  This leads to improved selectivity for low vapor-pressure hydrocarbons, which are easier to store as fuel in large quantities at low pressures, as well as tunable molecular-weight products for multiple applications.  Our design approach in Phase I will use a combination of heat/mass transfer modeling with pyrolytic kinetics modeling for PE and PP, which will be used as a model system for waste plastic pyrolysis.  We will first demonstrate, using our pyrolytic model, that the hydrocarbon product distribution can be modified and tailored by varying the reactor and condenser temperatures, nitrogen gas flow rate, and system pressure.  We will also build and test the reactor system based on our model results.  Controlling the product distribution of a flash cracking reactor while minimizing parasitic losses will be the primary challenge during the Phase I effort.","The target NASA application for the proposed technology is in-situ liquid fuel production in the moon using waste plastics and other organic materials.  The purpose of NASA's effort for In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is to harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration to create products and services, which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration.  Such capabilities are considered extremely important to human expeditions to Mars which, because of the distances involved, would be much longer missions entailing a minimum of 500 days spent on the planet's surface.  We anticipate that the proposed system can be used during lunar days, in conjunction with solar heating and excess solar-electrical power, to generate fuel that can be stored and used during lunar nights.  Lunar nights can last up to 334 hours, and storage of electrical energy in batteries and flywheels for use during lunar nights is not practical even with the most advanced electrical storage technologies available today.  Liquid fuel obtained from plastic waste will inherently be low in sulfur and can be readily used in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for electrical power generation at night.  This fuel can also be used to power generators, heaters, and similar appliances needed in space missions.","Other government agencies can also benefit from the proposed technology.  The US Air Force is breaking ground on pilot-scale FT jet fuel production facilities, and our technology is equally applicable to the cracking of FT waxes.  Other military applications include in-situ generation of diesel-like fuel to operate the DoD's portable diesel-engine electric generators.  Electric generators are usually the largest consumer of fuel on the battlefield, and this fuel often must be trucked in at a high ""fully burdened"" prices that can be in excess of $100/gallon.  The proposed technology can of course also be used for commercial conversion of plastic waste into liquid fuels, as companies like Envion and Global Finest have shown with similar technologies.  This is likely to be our break-in market, as there is a great need to make use of the used plastic that is currently being incinerated or kept in landfills for decades.  The proposed technology can later be adapted for upgrading unconventional petroleum reserves, including tar sands, oil shale, and heavy crude.  Unconventional petroleum reserves are an important component of world petroleum reserves, and innovative upgrading technologies will be required for economically converting them into useful transportation fuels.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Conversion; Heat Exchange; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Polymers; Processing Methods; Remediation/Purification; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Waste Storage/Treatment"

NASA has a need for equipment to generate, handle and store hydrogen. In terms of handling hydrogen, conventional rotating mechanical pumps and compressors require extensive modification and have limited reliability. Electrochemical pumping and compression of hydrogen occurs without any moving parts and is highly reliable and efficient. Sustainable Innovations has demonstrated up to 6,000 psi of compression using electrochemical cell hardware.However, for high flow applications, such as a 6 CFM hydrogen pump for NASA, a departure from traditional electrochemical cell hardware designs is needed. The proposed Expandable Modular Architecture cell design, allows a large variable footprint for the electrochemical stack. This is achieved using modular cell parts to create large active area cells. The modular parts are inexpensive to manufacture and can achieve the high tolerances need for large active area cells. The proposed Phase I activity will demonstrate a single cell Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump & Compressor (EHPC) using the EMA design to validate the modularity of the cell components. The ability to stack large active area cells will also be demonstrated with a four cell EHPC. For both pieces of cell hardware, cycling a pneumatic device will be demonstrated. A manufacturing study will also be undertaken to validate the compatibility of the EMA design with cost reduction pathways. This will facilitate establishing the design criteria for a 3-4 CFM  1,000 psi EHPC to be constructed on Phase II","An Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump & Compressor (EHPC) using an EMA cell design is applicable to several NASA applications. For extraterrestrial in situ resource utilization the EHPC will be able to handle the flow rates, 6 CFM, needed to recirculate hydrogen and facilitate pneumatic transport. Terrestrial NASA applications include capturing, purifying and compressing purge gas for various experimental rocket test stands.In extraterrestrial applications it is envisaged that the EHPC variable footprint will allow construction to conform to geometric constraints of a spacecraft. In addition, the simplicity of the systems balance-of-plant, a regulated power source, and the proven high reliability of electrochemical based devices means that redundant units may not be needed. The EHPC technology would add a key tool to NASA ability to move and store hydrogen efficiently and safely in extraterrestrial environments.A large amount of hydrogen used during testing of rocket engines and other space systems is wasted due to cryogenic boil-off loses and pre-test purging. The ability to efficiently capture, purify and compress this hydrogen for reuse, relies on handling large flow rates. Very large cell active areas are needed to meet this need. The EMA cell design facilitates the building of a large scale EHPC to recycle hydrogen. This will be economically beneficial to NASA while lowering the carbon footprint of NASA testing.","The emergence of hydrogen based economy will necessitate the ability to pump and compress large amount of hydrogen. A range of EHPC products with an EMA cell design will facilitate a hydrogen economy by delivering hydrogen to fueling stations and providing the compression for vehicular refueling. Assuming the adoption of a pipeline hydrogen based infrastructure, there is a need to pump the hydrogen along the pipeline to the fueling stations. A medium to large size fueling station would require 300 lbs per day of hydrogen, which at 500 psi is 1,730 cf. A 30 CFM EHPC system, would allow a fueling station to store a day's worth of fuel in 2 hours. Hydrogen powered vehicles require hydrogen at 6,000  10,000 psi to facilitate efficient volumetric storage. Sustainable Innovations' cell hardware has already demonstrated a Compression Ratio (CR) of over 400, which is significant greater the then CR of 20 needed to compress hydrogen from 500 psi to 10,000 psi. Therefore a EHPC system with a EMA cell design and a large flow rate capacity would be a invaluable tool in the developemnt of a hydrogen based economy.","Actuators & Motors; Conversion; Distribution/Management; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Storage"

CO2 conversion is expected to be ≥90% with near 100% CH4 selectivity at high throughputs and at low operating temperatures (≤~350oC). The technology will allow use of Martian in-situ resources for producing rocket propellant, reactants, and life support needs such as oxygen to significantly extend the duration and range of human/robotic planetary exploration.

A series of high efficiency sorbents sequentially removes contaminants at temperatures above dew point. Sorbents are regenerated, and contaminants are recovered in concentrated form. The RCRS is installed downstream from lunar soil reduction reactors to protect hardware from corrosion, to protect catalysts from poisoning, and to reduce the load on aqueous contaminant removal processes used in advance of electrolysis. Custom, high-porosity, high-capacity sorbents are used to minimize sorbent mass and sorption reactor volume while also minimizing process pressure drop. Sorption reactor volumes are small compared to the volume of soil reduction reactors. High porosity and sorbent durability are imparted through the use of organic and inorganic fillers and binders during manufacture of the sorbents. The RCRS imposes very little parasitic load on ISRU oxygen recovery systems during the course of sorbent regeneration and recovery of contaminant byproducts. The basic RCRS process can be tailored to provide contaminant removal for a wide range of reducing gas compositions.",The primary initial application of the Regenerable Contaminant Removal System is for sulfur and halide capture and recovery in support of lunar oxygen production.

Alternatives to low-temperature wet chemical systems have been sought to avoid the capital and operating expenses associated with chilling process gases for contaminant removal and subsequent reheating for the intended applications.

NASA is seeking for technologies in advanced cryogenic fluid storage and transfer to reduce launch operation costs by providing higher efficiency, lower maintenance and longer life while improving safety and minimizing consumable losses.   To address the NASA needs, we propose to develop novel, sprayable, fire resistant, composite coating for insulation of advanced cryogenic fluid storage systems.  The novel insulations will offer affordable cost, high strength and flexibility, high thermal stability, excellent durability, and easy processability through spraying technique, which will result in improved efficiency and reliability of the cryogenic systems.  Once the feasibility of fabrication of lightweight cryogenic insulating materials by the proposed technology is demonstrated in Phase I, we shall scale-up this technology in a Phase II program to meet the NASA's requirements.","Primary attributes of the proposed composite coatings include fire retardant, broad range of temperature applications (from cryogenic to elevated temperatures), lack of outgassing, and good mechanical properties.  Therefore, these materials are the ideal choice for lightweight insulation in space applications.  One such application is cryogenic insulation for fuel tanks on major rocket propulsion systems.  Another is thermal insulation on the louvers of communications satellites where intermittent exposure to sun and darkness requires these materials operating temperature range.  The technology proposed in this program will help NASA to reduce the cost of space flight.  Our materials will provide NASA with robust cryogenic solutions and, therefore, will significantly decrease space mission failures.","The new insulation's ability to maintain its flexibility at cryogenic temperatures makes it a superior choice for cryogenic expansion joints, designed to absorb expansion/contraction stresses.  Some examples of cryogenic applications of these new materials include medical storage/transport units, cryogenic fuel tanks, and wind tunnels. The technology developed under this program can benefit aerospace, marine, aircraft, electronic, electrical, rail, automotive, recreation, building materials, and construction industries.  Immediate benefit from the proposed Phase I program is the design and fabrication of a composite-based spray deposition insulation system for thermal protection of aircraft surfaces.  The ability to tailor the thermal and mechanical properties of proposed thermal coating system allows it to be a flexible solution to meet a wide range of technological needs.  The new composite based materials can be used as thermal insulation on marine vessels.  They can also be shaped for easy installation as pipe covering.

Future NASA missions will require hydrogen liquefaction systems for earth-based, planetary, and lunar surface missions.  A critical part of these systems is the cryogenic turboexpanders, which must be designed for high-speed operation and long life, and must be robust against the pressure and momentum excursions and the surface tension effects associated with two-phase flow.  On this Phase I/II program, Creare will build and test a cryogenic turboexpander for use in a hydrogen liquefier.  The turboexpander will be reliable, compact, lightweight, and efficient and will be able to operate in a two-phase system.  We have prior experience in designing and building wet turboexpanders for terrestrial applications as well as small turbomachines for space applications.  We plan to leverage this experience to build for NASA a wet turboexpander suitable for operation in both terrestrial and space environments.  Our turboexpander will have the innovative option of recovering the expansion work through use of an alternator (i.e., turboalternator) instead of dissipating work using a brake wheel.  This approach greatly simplifies controls, improves reliability, and reduces system mass and input power.

For example, the Single Aperture Far-IR (SAFIR) telescope and other cryogenic telescope missions must provide distributed cooling and multiple heat lift. Also, the management of cryogenic propellants requires distributed cooling through integrated heat exchangers for zero boil-off, densification and cooling of structural members. To address these requirements, we propose to develop a lightweight, continuous-flow cooling loop that can provide cooling and temperature control to multiple, distributed and broad area loads. This approach allows relatively simple mechanical and electrical integration and maintains high refrigeration system efficiency. The basis of the loop is a set of cold check valves that converts the oscillating pressure, which characterizes the operation of regenerative cryocoolers, into a quasi-steady pressure difference that can be used to drive a continuous flow of cold gas over distances of several meters. This Integrated Circulator (IC) has the potential secondary benefit of rapid and therefore precise load temperature regulation of multiple sensors or structures using actively controlled throttle valves to regulate the local gas flow.","There are many potential NASA applications for the Integrated Circulator(IC). A pulse tube cooler with an IC (PTC/IC) can provide active shielding and re-liquefaction for zero-boil-off (ZBO) dewars. For example, the manned Mars mission, which requires the in-situ manufacture of propellant, will require the capability to store seed hydrogen, as well as, liquid oxygen and liquid methane for substantial periods of time. NASA also has terrestrial applications for zero-boil-off technology, including cryogenic propellant preservation. Other applications are cooling large deployable telescopes and multiple distributed loads such as CCD cameras","There are numerous potential commercial applications for zero-boil-off technology. It has been pointed out, that ZBO would be advantageous for systems used to cool superconducting power lines, superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage, high temperature superconducting filters for cellular telephone base stations, and MRI magnets and SQUID magnetometers for heart and brain studies. In each of these applications, cryocooler reliability is an issue. Using a system cooled by a ZBO dewar addresses the reliability issue by ensuring that cooling liquid is always present. In the event of a cooler failure, the stored liquid provides a buffer i.e., a period of time during which the cooler may be repaired, or at worst the dewar refilled. It seems, then, that there exists a large potential market for ZBO technology and hence the PTC/IC proposed here.",Active Systems; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Infrared; X-rays/Gamma Rays

LV-MLI might significantly improve upper stage cryotank thermal insulation, reducing cryopropellant boiloff losses and increasing payload capacity for commercial missions with long coasts for MEO and GEO orbit insertion.ULA will participate in this program by sharing Atlas/Delta aerodynamic launch load data, discussing requirements of this new aeroshell insulation blanket, and reviewing test data to help development and implementation of LV-MLI.  LV-MLI would have to have feasibility proven in Phase I, reaching TRL3.  Further testing would occur with larger scale ground test articles, then an LV-MLI coupon could be flown over SOFI on an Atlas Centaur mission in view of a rocket camera.

Vehicles such as the EDS, orbital propellant depots and commercial space habitats will require both MMOD protection and thermal insulation.MMOD-IMLI may provide: Higher thermal insulation performance per layer or mass than conventional MLI Substantially lower mass for equivalent critical diameter particle protection than current Whipple or Stuffed Whipple shields  To stop 6.3mm particles, a Whipple shield must have a mass of 15 - 20 kg/m2 (including standoffs), a four layer Nextel Multishock shield would be 10.8 kg/m2, and a MMOD-IMLI advanced multishock shield theoretically could have a mass as low as 4.1 kg/m2 MMOD-IMLI would provide both thermal insulation and MMOD shielding in one integrated structure","As with NASA's spacecraft, instruments and satellites, commercial and DoD spacecraft and cryogenic space instruments may require both MMOD protection and thermal insulation.  MMOD-IMLI can be custom engineered to fit specific requirements for MMOD shielding and thermal insulation for any given mission.  MMOD-IMLI provides a robust structure with predictable and repeatable performance, and assembly could be cost efficient.  MMOD-IMLI might become the material of choice for future spacecraft.New Commercial Orbital Transportation Service vehicles, commercial space stations/habitats such as under construction by Bigelow Aerospace, and future orbital propellant depots will benefit from an effective lightweight thermal/MMOD blanket/shield.Quest's partner, Ball Aerospace, currently provides MLI for spacecraft for NASA, DoD and commercial space ventures.  The DoD space market is about equal to the NASA and commercial market, or approximately $100M over twenty years.","Ceramics; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Passive Systems"

ESPRIT is a single camera system that monitors the exercise activities of the crew, detects markers placed on the body and other image features, recovers 3D kinematic information of the human body pose, and compiles statistical data about the exercise activities. There are two main challenges for motion capture using a single camera: (1) lack of depth information, and (2) partial occlusion of parts of the body. To overcome these challenges, the proposed framework relies on strong priors on human body pose, shape, and motion dynamics to resolve pose ambiguities. Besides marker locations, it extracts other image features that provide additional cues for recovering pose. It combines both discriminative and generative approaches to achieve robust pose estimation and tracking performance.","Crew exercise is important for maintaining health and fitness of astronauts, especially in preventing adverse health problems associated with long-duration space flight, such as losses in muscle strength and endurance, bone density, balance and aerobic capacity. The proposed ESPRIT system will support NASA's Exercise Countermeasure project for observing crew's exercise activities, performing motion capture and kinematic analysis, and will contribute towards the understanding the effect of microgravity in physical activities.  ESPRIT is designed to satisfy the constraints in size, weight and power consumption imposed by the spacecraft environment. The system will be easy to set up and operated by the crew.","Non-NASA applications include uses in medicine and rehabilitation, such as gait analysis, orthopedics, and other applications for monitoring skeletal movement. Other applications include personal fitness and support of the aging, human-robotics and human-computer interaction, simulation, immersive reality, and video games. Potential customers include government research agencies such as Air Force Research Laboratory for human performance analysis and human factor engineering; National Institute of Health for rehabilitation research; physiotherapy clinics and nursing homes for patient monitoring, and sports equipment manufacturers for biomechanics studies.

Heart, lung, intestine, and circulatory function can be assessed through careful listening.  There are numerous situations, however, where the faint sounds collected using an ordinary stethoscope are overwhelmed by ambient noise.  Such is the case in spacecraft, where room is scarce and noise generating equipment is always nearby.  Here, a stethoscope employing laser Doppler vibrometry is proposed.  Through an innovative design employing adaptive filtering, the new-technology stethoscope will provide immunity to external noise while providing conventional auscultation sounds for easy interpretation by medical professionals.  Phase I and Phase II development will result in a system that is lightweight, rugged, efficient, and compact, making it suitable for use in space.  The system will provide enhanced medical care for astronauts in space, allowing auscultation sounds to be transmitted back to mission control medical personnel despite the high levels of ambient noise present in the spacecraft.","The system developed through Phase I and II is expected to transition to a large number of applications within NASA.  The system will become standard equipment on manned space flights, including flights to the International Space Station and long duration flights to new destinations, where it will be utilized to provide both local and remote medical monitoring and diagnoses.  The stethoscope will also find numerous applications within NASA for terrestrial applications.  The system is well suited for use in administering emergency medical care in numerous noisy industrial settings, such as vehicle/payload assembly buildings, engine test facilities, and during aircraft or helicopter flights.","The innovative stethoscope system has numerous non-NASA applications.

This system incorporates a hybridized sensor configuration and novel signal processing algorithm that will separate low-intensity body sounds (<25 dBA) from a noisy background (>70 dBA) experienced in spaceflights with a 20-dB signal-to-noise ratio. The non-invasive and space-qualified AUSCU-SCOPE is safe, easy-to-use for a non-expert crew member and does not require extra training of clinicians to Doppler sounds. Additionally, the system easily connects with space telemetry systems via Ethernet, firewire, USB, and wireless 802.11 for transmitting sound data for distance diagnosis. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate feasibility of AUSCU-SCOPE through system design, simulation, assembly, and testing of a benchtop prototype, which will reach TRL-level 4 by the end of Phase I. In Phase II, POC will develop a fully functional prototype at TRL-6 and demonstrate high-fidelity spaceflight auscultation capability in the presence of a 70-dBA noise. The results will enable NASA to perform spaceflight auscultation even against significant background noise.","The weightless environment of spaceflight can cause health problems; for example, fluid shifts and lack of resistive motion can harm cardiovascular performance.

Although the electronic stethoscopes made by 3M and Thinklab have some simple built-in filters, those filters cannot differentiate important internal body sounds from interfering background noise. Other devices used Doppler effects, which cannot be easily interpreted by physicians. We propose a high performance approach to enhancing auscultation capability. The idea is to utilize a second microphone to pick up the background noise and then use the microphone signals to improve the quality of stethoscope signals. There are several key advantages of our approach. First, the second mic is attached to a recorder, which is independent of the stethoscope. That is, the current stethoscope can still be used without any modifications. Second, the background noise level in the stethoscope will be reduced significantly, as we will apply advanced and fast algorithms to eliminate the background noise. Two algorithms will be evaluated. One is based on adaptive filtering, which is a time-domain approach. The other one is based on spectral subtraction with multi-band scaling. These algorithms have been applied by our team to speech enhancement applications in very noisy environments such as battlefield and also astronaut's helmet.","We strongly believe our algorithms will yield excellent performance in this NASA application (remote monitoring of astronaut based on auscultation). In Phase 1, we will perform extensive simulations and experiments to prove the feasibility of our algorithms. In Phase 2, real-time prototypes will be developed and evaluated.","The proposed system can also be used in doctors offices, military and civilian hospitals, etc. We plan to integrate our software into some commercial products made by 3M and Thinklab.

Research has shown that different parameters of bone health can be elucidated from ultrasound characteristics at different frequencies, and the goal of TRS is to make a device that can produce the nearly 5 octave range necessary to evaluate these parameters. TRS will utilize PMN-PT single crystal piezoelectrics, which have inherent advantages over traditional materials, and integrate this with photolithographic micromachining methods to produce a device with high sensitivity and bandwidth that surpasses other systems. Bone scans will be used to show both the resolution and depth of penetration characteristics of the device and its applicability for future in vivo use in space.","With the potential as a low-cost system, the ultrasound method could be implemented as a series of units for astronauts both in space and before or after returning. The applications of the material and methods can also be integrated into other areas, such as evaluation of materials (non-destructive evaluation) while on the job.

The device should unobtrusively monitor and detect neurophysiological markers of stress that could lead to behavioral or performance deterioration. The neurodiagnostic monitor should be lightweight and compact and should require minimal time or effort for the crew to use. Among the various neurodiagnostic modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are most amenable for integration into a lightweight, wearable system that can be adapted for use in Space. We will demonstrate the feasibility of a wearable multi-modality neurophysiological device for monitoring stress. The wearable monitoring system will provide a real-time functional imaging of cortical activity while the crew performs Exploration mission activities.","Crewmembers on long Exploration missions must remain productive in confined and crowed environments in which workloads are heavy, sleep is difficult, and where there is isolation from family and friends. Developing methods that allow crewmembers to deal with stress and other psychological challenges of long voyages will be critical to successful missions. The proposed neurodiagnostic device can be used to monitor levels of stress as well as the general psychological health of the crew during Exploration missions. The device can also be used to measure the degree of mental workload during performance of complex and cognitively challenging tasks and can be used to design and optimize the tasks. The low mass and low power consumption required for the wearability of the device are also key factors for space applications as launch costs are directly determined by mass and volume.","In addition to monitoring the behavioral health of the crew during space missions, the proposed device can be used to diagnose and treat various neurologic diseases and psychiatric illnesses. The device, for the first time, allows ambulatory, dual-modality functional imaging of cortical activity. The system can be designed as ambulatory units for use primarily in home settings as well as stationary units for use primarily in clinical settings.",Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Medical; Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures

Additionally crew skills can decline over extended mission duration onboard ISS. These stressors can impact task performance both in terms of increased errors and decreased efficiency. As humans go deeper into space, these issues will become even more pronounced. Methods are needed to monitor tasks as they are performed and to detect degraded task performance. TRACLabs proposes to develop algorithms and software for monitoring human performance of procedures. Our approach will integrate performance measuring software with procedure software and the displays used to execute procedures. We will build on prior work by TRACLabs on the Procedure Representation Language (PRL) and our agent software that aids humans interacting with PRL procedures. The performance measuring software will use techniques developed at the University of Pittsburgh that monitor keystrokes and mouse utilization to compute the speed and accuracy of individual pointing and text entry actions and adherence to procedure definitions. We will adapt techniques for measuring task performance of the disabled to measuring task performance of the able-bodied when stressed. We propose that performance changes due to these situational disabilities can be detected in the same way as performance changes due to physical disabilities. These techniques are particularly attractive for use at NASA because they are non-invasive and do not require additional equipment to implement. Performance measures will be computed in real-time as tasks are performed and thus will be available for use during task performance. Procedure information will guide the collection and interpretation of the human task performance data.","As NASA human exploration missions go further into space, astronauts must adjust to longer duration missions with less real-time support from Earth. For such missions, situational disabilities like fatigue, high workload, and skill-loss - already a problem for ISS - will only become more common. ISS provides an invaluable testbed for experimenting with techniques to detect and remediate such degraded task performance. The proposed project provides a precursor to conducting task performance experiments on the ISS. We propose to prove out non-invasive techniques for measuring task performance in real-time in an ISS like environment. We will use ISS procedures represented electronically in the NASA developed Procedure Representation Language. We will emulate the way these procedures are used with the ISS PCS displays, or next generation concepts being developed for Orion. As a result, we expect the Phase II project to produce techniques and technologies useful for such ISS experiments.",Degraded task performance due to situational disabilities is not unique to NASA. Soldiers interacting with intelligent robotics and smart weapons under stressful circumstances are subject to similar performance effects. And like NASA the Department of Defense (DOD) relies on procedures to guide task performance.  In consequence the proposed technology for detecting degraded performance should be of interest to DOD.   This technology has application in the private sector as well.  There is growing demand for technologies that increase the independence of an aging populace and enable seniors to remain in their homes longer. The proposed technology has potential application as part of home monitoring and automation technology. Seniors would interact with smart appliances through intelligent electronic instructions that monitor and correct the actions they take.  This should improve both safety and quality of life.,Man-Machine Interaction; Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures

AP plasma is well known to be highly effective in promoting oxidation, enhancing molecular dissociation, and producing free radicals and other types of high energies. It has recently attracted much attention in food industry due to its potential of being a non-thermal and highly effective sanitation method. The proposed technology will support sanitation of food preparation surfaces and equipment, food storage containers, and surface sanitation of delivered fresh fruit and vegetables, and freshly prepared foods in a space based habitat. It can function in reduced gravity and pressure environments, and is efficient in terms of waste and resource use. It may also have applications in air and water purification, allowing some sharing of components and training procedures. During this Phase I effort, two different reactor designs will be built and tested. Their performance will be evaluated on tomato, lettuce, Teflon, and/or other non-food substrates, all of which will be inoculated with Salmonella enterica.","Non-thermal plasma can be used to sanitize fresh foods grown in the space habitat and to sanitize raw ingredients either produced on orbit or sent up as bulk raw ingredients. It is also an ideal technology for sanitation of food production, food processing and food preparation equipment and surfaces. The technology appears to be efficient in terms of resources such as water and mass, and can replace chemical disinfectants in most applications. The function of this technology is insensitive to reduced cabin pressure and reduced gravity. Other potential NASA applications for cold plasma technology include preflight decontamination of instruments for planetary exploration to remove chemical residues as well as microbes, and for use in air and water decontamination systems. The portability of the technology may also allow for individuals to sanitize workstations or other common use areas.","The proposed non-thermal plasma sanitation technology can create more effective ways for reducing the number of cases of food-borne illness due to contaminations. Existing food sanitation technologies center around the use of chlorinated water to reduce contaminant levels, which is not portable, requires consumables, and is not entirely effective. Irradiation of fresh foods has been used to increase shelf life and reduce contaminants, but public perception may not be positive. Non-thermal plasma technology is scalable, can be portable, does not require consumables, and does not affect the flavor of fresh foods. The technology could be implemented in a small volume application (e.g., a restaurant or kitchen), a medium volume application (e.g., a raw food processing facility or farm cooperative), or a large volume application (e.g., a food packaging plant). The relatively low power consumption of the technology makes it a good candidate for green power facilities or remote access applications.","Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation)"

These test impacts have been demonstrated from 3 to 7 kilometers per second at both NASA WSTF and Sandia National Labs.  In all cases, radio frequency (RF) energy was captured as radiated from the impact and conducted from the impact by the target material.  If these broad band impulses of energy can be received and analyzed, it will be possible to locate the point of impact.The problem lies in the processing of a ""messy"" broad band signal.  The innovation herein is that these signals may be ""cleaned up"" and become useful by means of passive RFID Surface Acoustic Wave circuits.A SAW device, commonly used for inexpensive inventory coding and security entry systems can be excited by the energy from an HVI.  The result would be transmission of a unique code, distinguishable from RF noise and other encoded SAW responses by a receiver/decoder.  SAW devices are inexpensive, require no power, and are physically small and robust.  They can be manufactured in quantity at low cost (as demonstrated by the commercial use of the devices as throw-away inventory markers).  SAW devices placed over the surface of vehicles or structures exposed to HVI impacts could detect the HVI RF impulses and respond with a unique code that would identify the location of the impact.Thus, an impact detection and location system could be implemented where the RF impulse energy from a HVI is used to encode and transmit a signal to a passive receiver that would provide useful information on the location and magnitude of the HVI.To best execute this program, Invocon is joined by another small business  ASRD.

Space flight has an adverse effect on the human immune response.  During space flight the immune system weakens and some herpes viruses that are typically latent begin to appear in the saliva.  Currently, saliva samples are taken in space and preserved for post flight assay.  The presence of reactivated herpes virus in saliva samples is an indication of a weakening immune defense.  RST Bioscience LLC proposes an innovative in flight assay to monitor the efficacy of the immune system in-situ.RST Bioscience has designed a test that is perfectly suited for space flight.  The test will be small, light weight and easy to use.  The sample used in this test will be saliva, which can be easily collected through non-invasive means.  Results are delivered in minutes to hours.  The test is sterile and disposable, used sample is contained and disposed of along with the disposable kit.  There is no heavy equipment needed to process samples or read results.  The kit is self-contained.  Phase 1 will focus on assay development.  In phase 2 we will build and test a prototype of the disposable delivery device.",The primary NASA innovation is an in situ assay kit that provides (1) real-time assessment of immune function (2) early warning of pilot susceptibility to infectious disease (3) the opportunity to learn how time in space relates to weakening of immune defenses (4) the capability to map genetic markers that indicate resistance to the effects of time in space on compromising immune function (5) data that will allow for the correlation of specific environmental variables with weakening of the immune system (6) a chance to evaluate specific counter measures designed to protect and preserve the integrity of immune defense.  The innovation would enable scientists to better understand the risks of prolonged space exploration and to develop strategies to protect astronauts on long journeys.  We believe we are beginning at about TRL 3 in Phase I and plan to advance the technology to TRL 6 by the end of Phase II.,"RST will produce a kit for clinical use.   Current methods for detecting Herpes Zoster virus do not have the combination of features and benefits RST can offer.  Unlike existing products, we test saliva as opposed to blood or cerebrospinal fluid.  Our test is therefore much less invasive.  Any potentially infectious sample is contained in the completely disposable kit, which is discarded at the end of the test.  Our test will be self-contained requiring no capitol equipment. RST kit is based on antibody specificity.  This creates the opportunity to configure the kit to detect a massive range of targets by simply changing the antibodies.  Other disease agents, biological warfare agents and environmental pollutants are examples of the different types of molecular targets we could configure our kits to detect.

We propose an alternative way to monitor the health or illness of the crew members that would provide continuous monitoring of blood analytes. This information can be transmitted back to ground control in real time. The method could bypass the need to preserve biological specimens.  This novel multivariate system would measure the optical rotation of laser polarized light reflected from human skin as well as scattering and absorption characteristics directly related to the concentration of certain blood analytes that reliably indicate the state of health of the individual.","This apparatus will have a large impact on monitoring of an individual's overall health. Continuous health data will be valuable for understanding of a person's physiological changes as a mission progresses.  Extended space flight such as to the moon, International Space Station, or potentially Mars missions would benefit greatly from continuous testing rather than requiring samples to be taken, stored at constant temperature and preserved until coming back to earth. Additionally, this technology could also be used for NASA ground support that would benefit from monitoring due to mission critical requirements.","Non invasive monitoring of blood composition would revolutionize medical diagnosis and monitoring of outpatients and hospital scenarios.   Continuous monitoring in a hospital or a patient at home will give important information that can alert a health professional of either abnormally low or high levels that need to be evaluated.  The technology is particularly applicable to Glucose monitoring for patients with Diabetes as the current method of drawing blood 4-5 times a day to measure glucose levels is non-ideal. According to MarketResearch.com, Glucose monitoring devices are set to reach $16 Billion by 2014.

The Phase I detailed development includes a tightly-integrated coupling of computational fluid dynamics and structural dynamics codes to better predict the nozzle side loads due to flow separation.  In addition, improvements will be identified to both the loads process and the combination of dynamic loads in the time domain to support finite fatigue life predictions.  These improvements to the loads definition will provide an improvement to the engine development process by providing better loads estimations which can be used to reduce conservatism and to significantly improve performance with reduced weight, cost, and development time.  Phase II will include efforts to validate the fluid-structure interaction tool with experimental data and further develop and validate the new loads process methodologies.","NASA's next generation launch systems require propulsion systems that deliver high thrust-to-weight ratios, increased trajectory averaged specific impulse, reliable overall vehicle systems performance, low recurring costs, and other innovations required to achieve cost and crew safety goals.

Pyrovalves are generally used for critical safety functions in almost all liquid and solid rocket systems and are designed to be fail-proof and provide extremely reliable actuation.  However due to the lack of mature analysis tools, current design practices and safety analysis are heavily based on empiricism and are testing driven.  The innovation proposed here is a comprehensive design and analysis tool that can characterize the transient performance of pyrotechnic actuators and provide a virtual test bed to assess performance and functional margin of these systems.  The objective under this effort would be to develop a comprehensive three-dimensional transient tool that would simulate the gas dynamic interactions with combustion, and model thermal effects in the valve material.  For more complex initiator designs where multiple initiators may be fired, the tool could be used to identify ""skew"" effects resulting from the offset between the initiator firings.  Since pyrovalves are ubiquitous and necessary for any rocket system, the tools and technology developed here would be useful to a broad variety of programs of core interest to NASA including the constellation program.","The end-product will be a high-fidelity, numerical simulation software (CRUNCH CFDREG code) that would predict the transient performance of  pyrotechnic actuators,  provide design support by supplementing current empirical rules, and diagnose system anomalies.  Since pyrovalves are critical component of any space mission, our product addresses core needs of NASA missions including the Constellation program, the Mars science laboratory, as well as the new heavy lift rocket that may be designed.  Pyrovalves are typically used for critical safety functions including emergency deployment of landing gears, chute deployment, and fuel flow control for thrusters.  Consequently, pyrovalves have to be fail-proof and need to provide extremely reliable actuation with 99% reliability and 90% confidence interval level.  However design and safety analyses have been largely testing driven and heavily based on empiricism since analysis and design tools are not mature.  Our product addresses this critical need and would provide a reliable and well-validated tool.","The commercial market for our product is large and includes the broad aerospace and defense industry as well as safety and fire-suppression devices in the general industry including the nuclear, chemical processing and oil sectors.  Pyrotechnic actuators are extensively used in products such as fire suppression systems (for deployment and dispersion of suppressants), electric disconnects in safety systems (for high speed termination of electrical circuits), air-bags and safety restraint systems (as a rapid gas generator), cable cutters and explosive bolts among numerous other applications.  For these applications, characterizing the transient performance of the system is vital and the availability of a well-validated, reliable computational tool can play a key role in the design process for these critical elements. In addition to these traditional markets, commercial space ventures ranging from space transportation systems (COTS) for the international space station (ISS), to low-cost satellite launch systems would be receptive to this product.","Launch Engine/Booster; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Main Engine"

On a strict density basis, this aluminum engine would be ~30% of the mass of a nickel engine which already has a 22:1 T/W. Optimizing the design for aluminum will drive the performance even higher.This aluminum injectorhead/thrust chamber assembly will eventually be coupled to carbon-carbon nozzle assemblies. The result will be high performance, non-toxic engines with significantly increased Thrust-to-Weight Ratios approaching ~100:1. These engine assemblies can eventually be scaled up for resusable launch vehicle upper and lower stages or down into smaller in-space thrusters","The NASA-related applications for devices fabricated from diffusion bonded layers of etched Aluminum foil are vast, assuming the process can be developed to provide even moderate material strength and retain a relatively high thermal conductivity. The non-toxic NOFBX-based thrusters are suitable for on-orbit position and attitude control thrusters for NASA spacecraft, and particularly suitable for Mars ascent applications. Small aluminum-based rocket motors have the potential to obtain very large thrust-to-weight ratios, which is important for small-scale Earth-based launch vehicles as well.","Both pure commercial entities and non-NASA government agencies are likely customers for the high performance rocket engines enabled by the proposed development.

The proposed coating technology will adhere to and protect engine components such as injectors, combustion chambers, nozzles, and nozzle extenders.  Conventional high temperature coatings applied by chemical vapor deposition inadequately adhere, and often spall.  The proposed coating will distribute stress induced by thermal cycling and improve adhesion, resulting in an improved and longer lasting coating.  The high temperature phase of ZrO2 is produced by controlling nucleation, grain growth, and grain size via the unique features of our deposition technique. The increased surface energy of the nanograins results in the formation of a dense cubic phase of zirconia, which is stable at very high temperature.Phase I will develop a base-line process for applying highly adherent, thermally-resistant cubic ZrO2 layers on in-space propulsion substrates with a functionally graded ZrON metalloceramic transition layer at the metal interface. The deposition guidelines for nanocrystalline ZrON/ZrO2 coating will be perfected to each unique substrate in Phase II. In addition, a number of metallic components will be coated and delivered to NASA to be evaluated for in-space propulsion use.","Thermal resistant coatings could be used for a multitude of NASA's engine components to protect the parts from high heat exhaust. The coating is applicable to a majority of substrates, from polymers to metals.  Once commercialized, the coating application would take little time and would cost much less than replacing the engine components. A longer lifetime of the relevant parts would be particularly attractive for lengthy in-space missions.

Therefore, the development of a crack resistant coating system on nuclear thermal propulsion fuel elements that is insensitive to hydrogen corrosion and erosion is considered enabling.  Technology Assessment & Transfer Inc. (TA&T) proposes a systematic approach for CVD deposition and evaluation of a family of niobium carbide (NbC) coating systems for both uranium carbide-zirconium carbide solid solution [(U,Zr)C] and advanced triple carbide (uranium carbide-ziconium carbide-niobium carbide) solid fuel elements designed for use in space nuclear power and propulsion reactors.  These refractory metal coating systems will be evaluated in high temperature hydrogen and helium in concert with a preliminary performance modeling effort.","The development of a high quality coating for space nuclear reactors will be enabling for the development of nuclear thermal propulsion, in particular if one uses fuel elements based on the Rover/NERVA heritage design or the Pebble Bed design. These coatings are considered a critical technology for first in-space applications of solid core nuclear thermal propulsion systems.  The higher specific impulses afforded by NTP will provide significantly shorter travel times to the moon and Mars, reducing the time in zero gravity for manned missions and greatly increasing the speed of cargo/supply deliveries and unmanned exploration missions.","The development of a high quality coating for space nuclear reactor fuel elements could have potential across a variety of nuclear applications. A variety of designs exist for the next generation nuclear power plant, such as the Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) and the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR). In the case of both of these the final fuel form has not been decided. The triso fuel particle has been suggested for both as well as clad solid fuel pins. Either of these two fuel forms could benefit from an improved fuel coating of this type. The idea of using mixed carbides (U,Zr)C, (U,Nb)C, which would allow for much higher operating temperatures, for both pellets and solid fuel pins has been put forth and both would require a cladding material.

Highly porous and structural foam material was produced by chemical vapor infiltration of uranium, niobium, and zirconium carbides into a foam matrix. The foam structure and versatility in fuel composition were used to take advantage of the potential for high power density, high thermal efficiency, and small core size. The lifetime of this fuel material, as well as current pellet-type fuels in industry, would benefit greatly from the development of an impermeable surface coating that would prevent hydrogen attack of the underlying fuel and contain fission products for extended periods. Tungsten is an attractive surface coating in terms of temperature capability, hydrogen compatibility, and neutronics, but is inherently brittle and prone to cracking when subjected to modest mechanical or thermal stress. Ultramet has extensive experience in development of tungsten alloys with improved ductility for applications including ballistic penetrators and liners for solid rocket motor throats. In this project, Ultramet will develop the processing for deposition of thin tungsten-rhenium alloy coatings on open-cell foam fuel elements. Components will be exposed to high temperature hydrogen at Ultramet, followed by surface and cross-sectional coating characterization. Sandia will perform preliminary modeling experiments to determine the optimal concentration of rhenium in the coating and coating thickness. The potential exists to utilize the proposed containment coating over a variety of high-efficiency open-cell foam fuels including carbides and cermets.","Propulsion technologies are sought that will enable dramatic improvements in space transportation safety, reliability, and cost. Key to this goal is the application of innovative, non-traditional propulsion technologies, devices, and systems that could significantly increase the structural margins of future launch systems and substantially reduce the mission times for interplanetary and deep-space spacecraft. Development of such technologies is sought to enable ambitious commercial, robotic, and human exploration missions in the future.

The current baseline radiator uses titanium/water LHPs, however, deployable radiator and trace heating features are required to keep the water in the condenser from freezing when the radiator is turned off. The proposed project will develop high temperature toluene LHP radiators that will minimize the freezing problem, since the freezing temperature of toluene is roughly 100oC lower than water. Preliminary calculations on the toluene LHP radiator showed that a graded wick is required, with the pore size decreasing from the center to the surface of the wick. One goal of the project is to develop a graded alumina wick that reduces wick mass, back conduction, and pressure drop, enabling toluene as the working fluid. The ceramic wicks will also have near net shape fabrication, eliminating much of the current machining which adds costs to the LHP wicks. Optimizing the radial variation in porosity and permeability reduces the transport line sizes of toluene LHPs, significantly improving their mass and performance. The ceramic wicks can also be used in conventional LHPs, potentially reducing the LHP wick mass, pressure drop, and back conduction by 50 to 90% when compared with conventional nickel wicks. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating these wicks, demonstrate the wicks' machine-ability, conduct life tests, and evaluate the benefits of a graded wick versus a conventional wick with uniform properties. In Phase II, ACT will fabricate and test toluene LHP radiators with graded ceramic wicks to fully demonstrate their performances. We expect the technology to reach TRL 6 at the end of Phase II.","The immediate NASA application is high temperature toluene LHP radiators for the VASIMR propulsion system. These radiators are used to remove heat from the Helicon section of the VASIMR rocket and reject the heat at around 200oC. While water LHPs have been baselined for the first generation of VASIMR rockets, the water must be prevented from freezing in the LHP condenser. The freezing point of toluene is roughly 100oC lower than water, minimizing the freezing problem. Wicks with optimally graded pore radius and permeability properties in the radial direction are required to enable the use of toluene as the working fluid. The ceramic wicks developed on the project will be able to meet this requirement while also reducing mass and back conduction. These wicks can also be used to reduce the mass and improve the performance of conventional ammonia LHPs. NASA is currently examining space power systems for spacecraft and the lunar surface. ACT plans to use the ceramic wicks developed on this program in future LHPs that it manufactures for NASA spacecraft as well as DOD and commercial satellites.","LHPs with graded ceramic wicks can also be used in commercial and military satellites. Another application is cooling of aircraft components, for both manned aircraft and UAVs. ACT has already identified actuator cooling as one area where graded wick LHPs can be very beneficial.

MPD thrusters, however, have traditionally been plagued by poor thrust efficiencies due primarily to power lost into the anode caused by the Hall effect. We propose to combine three innovative techniques to create a high thrust efficiency MPD thruster.  The first is an unconventional applied magnetic field geometry that counter the Hall effect near the anode surface, the second is shaping of the electrodes to optimize current uniformity, and the third is ""through-anode"" propellant injection to prevent depletion of the anode plasma.  In prior experiments we demonstrated elimination of the anode fall using these novel magnetic fields, and in recent simulation efforts we developed novel magnetic nozzle designs that succeed in counteracting the current concentrations and plasma starvation effects that cause the anode fall.  These magnetic nozzles also showed the ability to increase the amount of axial thrust extracted from the accelerated plasma by over 50%.  In the Phase I, we will test the effect of a prototype 'optimized' magnetic nozzle on the thrust efficiency of a MPD thruster; both the magnetic nozzle prototype and thruster test article are already constructed.   Additionally, we will develop technology for through-anode propellant injection, and evaluate its performance through tests and simulations.","Manned exploration of the asteroids, Mars, and the outer planets will require fast transport of personnel and supplies to these destinations.  Due to their high specific impulses and ability to process hundreds or thousands of kilowatts of power in a small device, MPD thrusters can provide shorter trip times and higher payload fractions than currently available propulsion technologies.  However, significant improvements in MPD thruster efficiency and lifetime are required to achieve this potential.  The anode propellant injection and electrode geometry optimization innovations to be developed in the proposed effort have strong potential to achieve the necessary efficiency and lifetime improvements, and thus may enable MPD thruster technologies to dramatically reduce trip times and costs for manned and robotic Exploration missions.","Magnetically nozzled MPD thrusters will also provide cost-effective in-space propulsion for orbit raising of commercial spacecraft such as GEO communications satellites and orbit transfer of large DoD payloads.  In terrestrial applications, MPD thruster derived technology has applications in environmentally-friendly materials processing, for uses such as selective material ablation, ion implantation, and surface tempering.

According to NEMA, magnet wire is required for the production of 90% of all electricity. As industry attempts to shrink process size and increase output from these devices, their operating temperatures increase and conventional wire insulation tends to fail. High-temperature magnet wire allows for continuous operation under these environments. Few competitors exist that are producing magnet wire capable of functioning in this temperature range.","Electric propulsion devices such as Hall effect thrusters make use of electromagnets to steer and confine charged particles as an integral part of the propulsion system. Current designs are limited by the capability of the magnet wire to survive high-temperature operation. The operating temperature in current designs is a result of both joule heating effects derived from high current loads dissipated by the magnets and close proximity to hot plasma from the thruster. Improved insulation will increase the maximum operating temperature, allowing for greater flexibility in placement and design while also facilitating higher field strengths through larger current loads across the magnet circuits.","This topic addresses the need for functional high-temperature magnet wire coatings. Eltron Research & Development has the experience to produce a conformal insulating coating that far exceeds the maximum working temperature of current magnet wires while maintaining excellent flexibility and mechanical toughness.

PCI's short contact time catalysts offer the potential for faster reaction rates, higher conversions and a reduced need for recycle. In addition, strategies will be explored for more effective mechanical and chemical approaches to carbon removal and catalyst regeneration.  The approach offers a potential for an ultra-compact Bosch reactor with improved effectiveness and robustness, with lower pressure drop and power requirement.","Targeted NASA spin-off applications include future ISRU concepts for Mars missions.  A Bosch reactor offers a potentially more efficient use for hydrogen in producing water and oxygen, but suffers from heretofore intractable limitations",Targeted non-NASA applications for high quality carbon formation will be explored.,"Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients)"

A critical component in life support loop closure is the removal of carbon dioxide (produced by the crew) from the cabin atmosphere.  An attractive approach for removal of carbon dioxide is the Bosch reaction, where carbon dioxide is reacted with hydrogen (produced from water electrolysis) to produce solid elemental carbon and water.  However, no technology currently exists for the continuous operation of a Bosch reactor.  The process cannot be run in a continuous manner because of degradation of the catalysts, which are required to precipitate carbon at a reasonable rate.  In this Phase I SBIR, PH Matter, LLC will develop a catalyst for the continuous formation of carbon in a system fed with carbon dioxide and hydrogen.  Researchers will demonstrate continuous operation of the catalyst in Phase II.  Based on the catalyst performance, a reactor will be designed to allow continuous carbon formation without the need for regular maintenance.","The main application for the technology being developed for NASA will be as a component in life support systems.  As NASA plans longer manned missions beyond earth's atmosphere, the technology will enable continuous removal of carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere without the removal of oxygen as well.  These systems will be used in spacecraft, space stations, and planetary bases to maintain habitable environments.  On earth, this same technology can be used for submarines.","Non-NASA applications for the technology could include improved processes methods for the manufacturing of nano-structured carbon.  The technology will enable scalable and continuous production of nano-materials.  Such materials could have multiple uses, including polymer composites, coatings, electronics, catalysts, sorbents, sensors, and electrode materials.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients)"

One of the limiting factors in space exploration, particularly outside of low earth orbit (LEO), involves the power draw and significant mass in oxygen, water and other supplies needed for life support. Bio-electrochemical systems (BECs) are a class of technologies capable of treating water while generating electricity or other value-added products such as methane and hydrogen. In this particular project IntAct Labs proposes a variable-output BEC cell that switch between cathode reactions, generating water, hydrogen, or CO2 reduction to water and methane, depending on the operation. A properly designed cell might thus switch between cathodic outputs based on day-to-day exploration needs, while continuously treating BOD at a bio-anode at ambient temperature and pressure. During Phase I IntAct Labs will construct a variable output BEC cell, demonstrate simultaneous BOD treatment and value-added product generation with ersatz exploration wastewater streams, and conduct preliminary systems analyses to determine the relative benefit in mass and power associated with operating the system with each output at two unique process points in the ISS Water Recovery System. Based on these experimental and simulation studies, Phase II R&D will focus on one, two, or all three operating modes. Through Phase II and Phase III R&D we hope to develop and test a system for potential utilization aboard the ISS or related crewed systems.","The development of a mobile, variable output BEC system for wastewater treatment provides a range of potential commercialization options for IntAct Labs. First, successful Phase I and Phase II R&D could lead to a larger research program funding by NASA and/or other space agencies, constituting an important source of income for an R&D company like IntAct Labs. Second, the concept is being provisionally patented and the research will result in intellectual property and know-how which could be spun-off or acquired by larger firms seeking to develop the next generation life support systems for NASA such as Lockheed Martin or Hamilton Sundstrand.","The proposed system might also find use in other mobile water treatment applications. In particular the military may find the flexibility of the proposed system useful for treating water at mobile bases, such as forward operating bases. The system might prove useful for wastewater treatment for humanitarian applications such as disaster relief or developing world infrastructure. These and other options with be thoroughly investigated and pursued during Phase I and Phase II R&D.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment"

The microporous membrane's function is to prevent liquid wastewater from direct contact with the ionomer, a condition that would reduce the effectiveness of the ionomer.  The ionomer's unique characteristic of selective permeability suggests a possible role in water purification processes.  This activity is accomplished by means of the sulfonic acid groups.

Additionally, this would not only limit the number of replacement components to be carried on a long term crewed mission, but would also lower launch weight and equivalent system mass.  Lynntech proposes to provide proof-of-concept for innovative stimuli-responsive smart coating functionalized particulate air filter surfaces which respond to an applied stimulus by generating a pushing off force to trigger lifting off of adherent particles which are responsible for lowered air flux and reduced airborne contaminant removal efficiency.  The aims of the effort involve the preparation and down-selection of suitable self-cleaning particulate air filter surfaces followed by a demonstration of the in-place regeneration of the modified high efficiency particulate air filter surfaces in a simulated flow through air filtration system using standard regolith simulants to mimic airborne dust.  The maturation and eventual availability of this reagentless self-cleaning technology will allow NASA to more efficiently close the air revitalization loop and thereby sustain the vision for existing and future manned deep space missions.","Potential NASA applications include unique regenerable air revitalization components, to allow increased service life through periodic self-cleaning cycles, lower the number of replacement units and decrease the equivalent system mass.  Cleaner air quality will eventually contribute greatly to NASA's goal of closing the breathing air recycling loop and sustain the vision for long term manned exploration missions of the future.","Potential non-NASA commercial applications include regenerable HEPA filter modules for consumer homes and commercial and government offices and facilities.

The system has three unique features: (1) the methane pyrolysis reactor that does not rely on high single-pass efficiencies (which will make the system robust), (2) it incorporates batch processing modes, cleaning cycles, and a carbon capture device (which makes it reusable), and (3) it uses palladium membrane technology to separate the hydrogen from the methane stream (which makes the H2 effluent very pure). ORBITEC proposes the Hydrogen Generator by Methane Pyrolysis with Carbon Capture, herein referred to as the H2Gen system. During Phase 1 of this effort, ORBITEC will test the four major components of the system: the methane pyrolysis reactor, the carbon removal mechanism, the carbon capture device, and the hydrogen remover. The performance and efficiency of each component will be tested and characterized. Phase 2 will expand upon these efforts and a full-scale brassboard prototype will be developed and built, maintaining the efficiencies of the system while optimizing overall mass and volume.","As the future of manned spaceflight will depend on creating and utilizing a water-based economy, this technology will ultimately benefit NASA human spaceflight as it will assist in closing the water resource loop by recovering additional water (when used with the Sabatier system) from waste resources for all long-duration manned missions. This technology will not only support future long-duration objectives such as lunar surface, Mars transit, and Mars surface missions, but with the extension of the ISS operation, the H2Gen system could be employed on the ISS and used with the existing Sabatier system.

Current CO2 reduction technology to recapture oxygen as water utilizes the Sabatier reaction, in which, two moles of water and one mole of methane are produced for each mole of CO2 reduced.  Unfortunately, only half of the hydrogen consumed in the reaction can be recovered by water electrolysis.  In contrast, the Bosch reaction produces water and elemental carbon, recovering all hydrogen consumed and closing the O2 - CO2 reduction loop.  Previous experience has shown the primary problem with the Bosch reaction is carbon production, which deactivates the catalyst and eventually plugs the reactor.  An innovative Regenerative Bosch Reactor (RBR) is proposed to overcome this problem, in which, a bed of small spherical ferromagnetic catalyst beads is periodically agitated using mechanical or magnetic forces to abrade carbon from the catalyst surface. Carbon is expelled from the RBR by the gas stream and collected downstream.  The Phase I project will demonstrate catalyst regeneration. A prototype RBR will be designed, assembled, and thoroughly tested during the Phase II program providing NASA with a test bed for independent evaluation.   The RBR will improve atmosphere loop closure and lower the ESM for CO2 reduction by recovering all of the hydrogen reductant.","The NASA application for this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future, long duration exploration objectives beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where efficient, reliable, low ESM atmospheric revitalization to reduce logistics burden for ECLSS hardware.

The complete recovery of hydrogen will lower the ESM for this technology compared to Sabatier reaction based methods.  Moreover, long-term Bosch reactor operation with the concomitant lowering of hydrogen resupply penalties will favor this approach in future atmospheric revitalization systems used aboard spacecraft and within extraterrestrial habitats.","There are two major areas for commercial application of the RBR technology.  The first area concerns the mitigation of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.  In this case, industrial processes can be retrofitted with a RBR system that converts carbon dioxide to a collectable solid, carbon, and a harmless gas, water vapor.  The second commercialization area concerns reactor technology, and in particular, applications where catalyst fouling by reaction byproducts are a significant concern.

For long-duration human missions, drinking water can come from a variety of sources including treated humidity condensate, urine, hygiene water or makeup sources (e.g., water brought up from the ground or obtained through fuel cells). There are concerns that reclaimed water may contain trace toxic metals and/or the recovery and treatment processes may result in corrosion and leaching of metals during storage (methods for spacecraft guidelines). As a result, these systems must be continually monitored to ensure the health of the crew.The overall objective of the proposed program is to develop a field compatible electrochemical sensor for the identification and measurement of trace heavy metals in the water. Phase I will investigate the optimal design configuration, electrode configuration, and operating conditions, which will enhance sensitivity and enable reproducible detection of the dissolved compounds such as cadmium, nickel, silver and zinc in water.  The proposed process can be carried out rapidly without the use of dangerous chemicals and will fulfill NASA's need.","Applications include a compact electrochemical monitor, which can be integrated into the water recovery system to identify and measure a list of trace heavy metals in the water.","There is also growing demand for field-deployable monitoring systems which would provide reliable on-site monitoring for wastewater quality assessment (pre- and post-treatment) by waste treatment facilities (private and municipal) and government regulatory/enforcement bodies (e.g., U.S. EPA).","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Space Transportation & Safety"

Spectral range, detector speed, spatial resolution become critical for fast fire detection as well as for avoiding costly false alarms. Current detectors are bulky, have low mechanical and temperature strength, and cannot be easily integrated into networks. Miniature, chip-based dual-color high-temperature visible- or even solar-blind optical sensor system would allow for fast and false alarm-free fire detection and recognition, thus providing a fast and reliable response in separated UV and IR bands with high spatial resolution, and ""smart"", artificial neural networks based signal analysis Moreover, development of such sensors will promote fabrication of multi-pixel dual-band UV/IR focal plane arrays with a visible- or solar-blind imaging capability.  This project will also consider integration the optical sensor system with existing state of the art smoke sensors for detection of smoldering (flameless) fires as well. One of the approaches for such integration is based on placing the remote high sensitivity dual-band UV/IR focal plane arrays integrated smoke detectors in areas that are prone to possible fires, such as aircraft or spacecraft engines and power circuits. These devices will then communicate with one central control system that analyses the nature and type of flame and sound an alarm accordingly. The second approach is to integrate the smoke and the high sensitivity dual-band UV/IR focal plane array detector into a unit controlled by one system, and then place them in a close proximity of possible fire sources.","The proposed technology targets aerospace applications, where the speed of fire detection and avoidance of false alarms is very critical. Current detection systems are prone to alarm from dust and humidity and are inaccessible by crewmembers for inspection during flight. The Federal Aviation Administration requires that aircraft compartments are equipped with fire detection systems. A false alarm is estimated to occur in the aircraft 100 times more than a true alarm. This results in emergency diversion landings that are costly and that may needlessly compromise the safety of the flight. Current regulations require that the detection systems alarm within one minute of the start of a fire. The overall objective of this project is to develop a viable technology to avoid false alarms in the aircraft compartments by introduction new detection systems. The proposed detection system based on fast and intelligent multi-criteria analysis, will minimize the false alarms by sensing and then comparison of two or more aspects of a fire's signature before alarming. A particular NASA interest is in hydrogen flame detection. During fuel loading operations, a large flare stack flame creates reflections that can often fool other fire detection systems, creating a false alarm. A UV/IR detector can be very sensitive in spotting small hydrogen flames by filtering out the ultraviolet and infrared radiation emitted from the large flare burns and the flame's reflection from surrounding metal.","A large market already exists for photodetectors used in fire detection applications. IMS leadership in this market will be provided by the reduced costs, high quality and reliability, high sensitivity, and suitability for both industrial and residential applications. For example the hydrogen flame detection technology can be used in the oil drilling industry. An oil rig burns off waste gas when drilling, such as the large hydrogen flare stack burns on the launch pad, which can trigger false alarms in the fire detection system. Because hydrogen gas is nonpolluting, the detector is expected to gain in popularity for commercial uses. Other industries targeted as having potential interest in the detector are aviation, research laboratories, gas and electronic manufacturers and power generation. Multi-pixel devices planned in the Phase II project will result in dual-color solar-blind imaging devices, which will extend the application potential far beyond the fire/flame detection devices market. These applications will include advanced object and target detection, recognition, and monitoring for military and space-related purposes. A number of novel devices can be developed including optoelectronic fluorescence and chemical sensors, pressure sensors, miniature cold-cathode electron emission sources, particle detectors, multilayer ceramic capacitors, high temperature devices, and hard coatings.","Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Data Processing; Detectors (see also Sensors); Emitters; Fire Protection; Infrared; Multispectral/Hyperspectral; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Transmitters/Receivers; Ultraviolet"

One of the limitations of heat pipes is the capillary limit, which states that the sum of pressure drops of the working fluid cannot exceed the capillary head developed by the wick.  Since most of the working fluid pressure drop is incurred in flow through the wick, it is important to reduce the wick resistance as much as possible while still being able to transport the required thermal load. All heat pipes made today have the same wick throughout the heat pipe.  This facilitates manufacture, however it causes a great deal more resistance to liquid flow than is minimally required.  By breaking the wick up into several different regions in which the wick properties are different, a more optimal stepwise wick is proposed.  Preliminary calculations done by the PI indicate that the capillary limit of a heat pipe can be increased by a factor of 2x to 3.5x, depending on the number of discrete steps the wick is divided into.   The proposed program aims to demonstrate the improvement in capillary limit experimentally.","This concept could be applied to any NASA application where conventional heat pipes are used.  Radiator panels, reactor cores, electronics thermal management are all candidates to name a few.  Heat pipes with higher capillary limits would enable either longer heat pipes, smaller (& lighter) heat pipes, or increased power transport within current SOA weight and volume envelopes.",Many non-NASA commercial applications would also benefit from more capable heat pipes.  Most military electronic systems rely on heat pipes for thermal management. Laptops and desktop computers could make use of this innovation to enable the use of smaller heat pipes that consume less material and therefore weigh less and cost less than current uniform wick heat pipes.,Heat Exchange; Passive Systems

Antimicrobial coatings are needed to prevent growth of microbes and formation of biofilms on the condensing surfaces inside the CHX and maintain a healthy spacecraft environment.  Creare has developed a highly adherent, hydrophilic, antimicrobial coating that can be applied to heat exchanger surfaces.  However, recent studies have shown that the lifetime of this coating may be limited in prototypical environments.  We propose to develop an improved coating process that builds on our prior coating development but adds features to extend the lifetime, potentially to ten years.  In Phase I we will prove the feasibility of our approach through theoretical studies of coating stability, deposition of trial coatings, analysis of the coatings, and measurement of coating performance after exposure to prototypical environments.  In Phase II we will scale up and refine the process, produce prototypical CHX cores with the hydrophilic and antimicrobial coating, and demonstrate performance after extended exposure to prototypical environments.","The condensing heat exchanger is a critical component for control of humidity and maintenance of a healthy environment on manned spacecraft.  Any spacecraft or lunar/planetary base intended for long duration operation with closed-loop life support will need a CHX.  Applications include future lunar or Mars bases and manned interplanetary spacecraft.  The coating will also be useful for potential upgrades to the environmental control system on the International Space Station, which has experienced degraded operation due to failure of hydrophilic coatings on condensing heat exchangers.",Efficient and reliable condensing heat exchangers will be needed for fuel cell generators or fuel reforming systems for portable electric power generation or onboard vehicular fuel cells or reformers.  These heat exchangers are required for water-neutral operation and hydrophilic and biocidal surfaces are needed for long-term reliability of the system.

They are superior to technologies such as loop heat pipes, louvers, MEMS systems, electrostatic systems, phase change materials, and others. A key requirement is a high Turn-Down Ratio (TDR, ratio of high/low emittance), up to 10.0, and Delta-emittance, up to 0.55. In ongoing and recent prior work (for Air Force, JPL, NASA), this firm has developed a novel, patented variable emittance skin technology, based on conducting polymers (CPs), microporous membranes and ionic liquids, with proven, space-environment performance. The proposed work will develop this with further, radical innovations including entirely new CPs, to achieve a TDR of ca. 8.0 and possibly up to (from current ca. 3.0), and Delta-emittance of ca. 0.60 (from current ca. 0.50). The more than eight innovations are based on actual, prior experimental data and include  incorporation of new CPs, alteration of the substrates and surfaces, radical increase in doping level, use of new ionic liquid electrolytes with higher conductivity and several others.","This technology may displace extant, alternative technologies (e.g. those listed in the Abstract) on manned and unmanned space platforms, e.g. those originally planned under NASA's Constellation mission and now to be transitioned to new science missions, and small (micro-, < 20 kg, nano, < 2 kg) as well as large spacecraft. It will also give rise to much greater engineering design flexibility in space platforms as well as spacecraft, potentially opening doors to profound new applications. The potential variable emittance market is estimated at several hundred m^2 per year, with a substantial (> 50%) portion for NASA.","This technology may not only displace extant technologies for manned and unmanned space platforms and small as well as large spacecraft, as described under NASA applications above, but also give rise to much greater engineering design flexibility in space platforms as well as spacecraft. This may potentially open doors to profound new applications, e.g. in micro-satellites such as the CubeSats which currently have no thermal control means. This would ""democratize"" space, allowing small and medium businesses to launch their own, dedicated satellites.

An optimal thermal control system must effectively vary the amount of heat dissipation while at the same time not burdening the spacecraft by utilizing the extremely limited spacecraft resources, such as mass, volume, or power.  Several previous thermal control systems have successfully utilized movable louver and pinwheel type designs for enabling thermal control.  Each type of louver system has the drawback of utilizing moving parts that can break or bind, and only enable course thermal control.  A much better approach would be to have a conformal, flexible type louver system. The CAC system implements a variable thermal control system that consists of a thin membrane (< 1mm) that is comprised of a plurality of small electrostaticly operated ""louvers"" that can be adjusted to varying degrees of inclination for variable heat rejection. The flexible electrostatic  variable emissivity louver membrane is not only extremely lightweight, but also has the added benefit of being completely conformal to a spacecraft surface.","Given more stringent requirements being placed upon new satellite and human inhabited spacecraft, thermal control systems are a major consideration and must be designed in such a way so as not to place a heavy burden upon available spacecraft resources.  Due to the unique flexible metalized insulating material conceived of for this NASA research, the manufacturing requirements will be greatly simplified compared to that of manufacturing traditional MEMs based devices.  Because of the simplicity of the design, it is not beyond the scope of CAC's capability to manufacture hundreds of such flexible louver systems per month.  The flexible conformal louver system consists of a simple metalized thin insulating sheet, with either stamped or laser cut flaps.  CAC currently has produced far more complex oxygen monitors for GE Medical used in MRI's and has manufactured over 12,000 units used worldwide over a 15 year timeframe.","Several potential commercialization schemes may be possible for non-NASA applications.  One potential commercial application is in the area of creating an adaptive, conformal array antenna.  By adjusting individual louvers, a potentially steer-able or even phase adjustable antenna could be realized.By placing the thin flexible membrane (without radiator) within the panes of a double pane high efficiency window, a variable emissivity reflector could be realized.  If the insulating membrane is transparent, and the metal coating is thin enough, the flexible louver system can be made virtually transparent to visible light.  By closing the electrostatic louver flaps during summer months, the incident solar radiation could be blocked from entering a dwelling.  Likewise, during winter months, the electrostatic louvers could be opened to allow the lower winter sunlight into the dwelling.  Connecticut Analytical has a long record (20+ years) of converting research into viable commercial products.","Passive Systems; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Thermal"

The human hand demands a complex range of motions, a close fit, an ease of movement, and a lack of bulk that is at odds with the engineering and durability requirements of an inflated safety garment.  While precision motions of the fingers are relatively well met by NASA's current I.L.C./Phase VI gloves, the torque required for more gross power grips such as translating along bars or grasping tools is significant.  This torque comes not from the individual fingers or phalange-phalange joints, but at the joint between the fingers and the palm, or the metacarpal-phalangeal joint. In addition, this motion is difficult to precisely measure.  The human hand is capable of omni-directional multifaceted movements that are challenging to mimic robotically.  In addition, the presence of a human wearer makes the measurement impossible to repeat accurately, but it is required to adequately reproduce the movements of the glove. FFD in collaboration with The Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) propose to develop a glove pattering specific to the bending of the metacarpal-phalangeal joint, and a robotic instrument suitable to measure this torque.  This will lead to even more functional glove pressure garments, and to a more refined way of measuring them.","Highly functional pressure garment gloves have always been and remain a coveted and marketable product for NASA.  Pressure garment gloves directly effect an astronaut's performance in space.  In recent years, with NASA's ""wall of EVAs"" necessary for ISS assembly, we have seen the critical role gloves play in the big picture of spacewalking.  Because of the very high cost of EVAs, and their inevitability, investments in more functional spacesuit glove technology have significant payoffs.  As astronauts are able to use their hands better in spacewalks, so will they become more efficient and reliable workers.   FFD hopes to work with current NASA contractors such as ILC Dover to merge and develop useful new glove technologies.","Highly functional spacesuit gloves have a potential market outside NASA in commercial high altitude and space flight.  As commercial space flight becomes more common, the market for affordable and effective pressure garments will surely increase.  The pressure garment glove is perhaps the most critical element of the suit, in terms of motion requirements and effects.

With current and anticipated space activities, mission times will need to be extended without increasing the size and weight of the portable life support system (PLSS).  While much of the recent work on the development of new CO2 control strategies has centered on solid sorbents that can be regenerated during the mission, these system add ""on back"" hardware, increasing weight and complexity, and reducing reliability.  A simpler approach is to use a membrane system to separate CO2 from the O2 environment.  Unfortunately, separating gas phase molecules with the needed selectivity is difficult with standard membranes.  However, identifying a low vapor pressure liquid sorbent that will react with CO2 to form a meta stable product, could facilitate the needed separation.  Therefore in this Phase I project, Reaction Systems will develop a supported liquid membrane that will have high permeance and selectivity for CO2 compared to O2, advancing the TRL from 1 to 4 by the end of the Phase I.

In addition, with only slight modification, the technology could be applied to CO2 control in spacecraft and on the surface of Mars.","In addition to the wide spread use for NASA applications, identifying effective means to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion is an area that is receiving much attention.  The wide spread use of fossil fuels has caused a substantial rise in the concentration of atmospheric CO2, a recognized green house gas and further increases in atmospheric CO2 are not desirable.  Thus, there currently is a great deal of interest in the development of methods to sequester CO2 from combustion processes.

Miniature flexible humidity-sensitive patches, connected to an optoelectronics reader by an optical fiber, will allow great flexibility in fitting the sensor element into the space suit. The sensor materials will consist of a luminescent indicator, whose emission lifetime depends on humidity, supported in chemically and mechanically passive polymer film. Since measurements that rely on emission lifetime are insensitive to indicator bleaching, and fluctuations in the light source and/or the photodetector, the measurements will be reliable and stable. The advantages of using optical sensors include easy miniaturization, immunity to electric and electromagnetic fields, and amenability to multiplexing.

Sensors capable of monitoring traces of water in CO2, O2 and H2, among other gases, and that would improve life support systems control, could be designed using the same sensing technology and optoelectronic unit. Such an approach will extend the potential application of IOS's humidity sensors to address different NASA needs. The advantages of using optical sensors include easy miniaturization, immunity to electric and electromagnetic fields, and amenability to multiplexing.","Humidity sensors with high performances requirements are used in a number of aeronautic applications. IOS will explore the advantages of developing miniature humidity-sensitive patches that can be interrogated through an optical cable for monitoring humidity in aircraft applications. A number of industries can benefit from using high performance relative humidity sensors to control their processes. Examples include construction materials manufacturing, paper manufacturing, and the food industry, where accurate and reliable humidity monitoring could provide manufacturers with a competitive advantage. A number of well-established companies offer humidity monitors to these industries. To our knowledge, however, none of these companies offer fiber-optic humidity sensors. The basic technology of these companies is comprised of hydroscopic polymers and capacitance measures. The specific features of the optical sensors developed by IOS will be exploited by collaborating with and establishing licensing agreements with, companies already established in this market.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)"

This will address NASA requirements for innovative deployable secondary structures that have minimal mass, high packaging efficiency, and multi-functional utilization. The primary usage of the floor will be to provide a light weight, deployable walkway for a habitat, which meets the appropriate strength, stiffness, and stability requirements. In Phase 1, ZIN will design, analyze and breadboard the necessary joints to  enable the structure to be readily deployed and/or un-deployed, while maintaining the appropriate stiffness. The secondary purpose of the floor will be to take advantage of the walkway's cross sectional geometry and utilize it to provide water storage within the floor. The floor will house electrical and plumbing interfaces, which will connect these utilities between two sides of the module.

Ionic liquids, because of their unique properties such as low volatility, low flammability, and flexibility of chemical design are showing promise as the next generation of chemical reagents.   Mechanical and chemical testing to date has shown that this IL epoxy monomer, when cured with a commercial aromatic diamine curing agent, yields a polymer resin with high tensile strength, excellent bond strength to aluminum and steel, high toughness, low CTE, and low moisture permeability.  Performance comparisons of the ILE to several commercial epoxies showed the ILE had superior tensile and bond strengths.

In thisPhase I SBIR project, we propose to test the feasibility of three key technological changes which couldsubstantially reduce the volume, mass, and power requirement of the TD-THz instrumentation, making itmore suitable for use by an operator in space. The current instrumentation paradigm is that a multi-purposeTD-THz control unit is used to provide common drive, data acquisition, and analysis functionality tointerchangeable sensors and imaging which connect to the control unit with a fiber-optic/electricalumbilical. However, the current COTS control unit is substantially larger and heavier than would bedesirable for a space-flight capable unit. The proposed developments would enable a control unit for ahand held NDE imaging tool, sufficiently robust for spaceflight, no larger than a small shoebox. It shouldbe possible to reduce the size of the control unit to approximately one sixth of the current values to, forexample, 14 in. X 8 in.

These systems must be highly integrated and self-sufficient, low mass, simple to operate, provide reliable information, and use little command processing power.  Eddy current testing (ECT) is a widely practiced and critically important nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method used in aerospace, yet it relies on decades-old wire-coil sensors and scanning.  RMD, in collaboration with Wyle Laboratories, proposes a revolutionary structural imaging and NDE technology based on a permanently affixed, flexible sheet containing a two-dimensional array of microscopic, directionally sensitive, solid-state eddy current sensors.  The modular sensing sheet could be added to the spacecraft while in space or before launch.  The sensing sheet will be thin (approximately 100 um thick) and highly flexible so that it can be mounted on curved surfaces.  Energy independent, wireless arrays could be affixed underneath thermal insulation, paint or other coatings, and images created by a CPU integrated on the sensor array.  These images permit structural assessment and NDE of many components throughout the lifetime of a mission. The system will be largely independent of the command computer and power systems, have little external wiring, and require almost no human attention.","The proposed technology provides an entirely new method for structural analysis and NDE that permits the long-term high resolution detection of minute defects and aging effects in difficult to access areas.  The proposed NDE technology will be useful for inspecting crew compartments, fuel tanks, flight surfaces, support structures, engine casings, titanium castings, hydraulic lines and other components that are made of standard or advanced metallic materials. The technology will permit inspection of thick components in 3-D. For materials testing and development, incipient defects can be detected and their propagation monitored and analyzed during aging. Since the technology can be used to improve manufacturing and the selection of materials, and to test finished components and aging systems, it will have a broad impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of NASA missions.","The advanced ECT, NDE and structural analysis technologies proposed here would enable inspectors to detect extremely small defects with a simple to install, operate and interpret NDE technology. Eddy current testing is the most widely used NDE technique with a market value in excess of $200M/year in the US alone.

Thus, monitoring condition and stress in the composite overwrap, including the fiber layers most prone to failure is needed during both preflight qualification and spaceflight. We will develop practical Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) capability for use during spaceflight and surface mounted magnetic stress gages (MSGs) for preflight qualifications/testing and in-flight monitoring.  NDE will address damage produced by impacts from micro-meteoroid orbital debris (MMOD). In addition, we will investigate the need to inspect through multi-layer insulation layer (MLI).The goal is to demonstrate feasibility of (i) volumetric stress monitoring using light weight, surface mounted MSGs, and (ii) practical, portable and easy to interpret NDE for use by crews during spaceflight, with limited training and minimal logistics support. Dual purpose electronics will be adapted to the constraints of spaceflight for NDE and MSG data acquisition and the feasibility of developing extremely light weight and small form factor electronics suitable for space flight will be investigated. This proposal is founded on successful implementations of JENTEK MWM-Array technology for the Space Shuttle leading edge RCC and recent feasibility demonstrations for MSG volumetric stress monitoring on COPV sections. The MWM-Arrays and MSGs use linear drive winding constructs to selectively induce eddy currents in different fiber layers to assess damage and monitor stresses.","If this project is successful, an enhanced inspection capability will become available to NASA that will support improved life management of COPVs.  Improved NDE of COPVs was identified in the 2008 KSC High Priority Technology Needs.  NDE and stress monitoring during spaceflight with a minimal logistics footprint would enhance flight safety and provide capability for in-flight condition assessment, mission adaptations, and maintenance. Furthermore, this capability can support NDE and stress monitoring for other composite structures of interest to NASA.","Enhanced inspection required for qualification testing are needed for widely used gas cylinders and other pressure vessels used throughout industry.  Stress monitoring during COPV operation will enhance life management capabilities.  Composite SCBA tanks that are widely used by fire and rescue personnel are currently limited to a 15 year life from date of manufacture by the department of transportation. This restriction is partly due to the fact take there is no accepted method to characterize damage in composite SCBA tanks. If this project is successful the techniques developed in it can be adapted to composite SCBA tanks to provide reliable damage assessment of these cylinders.

The proposed innovation adds a coherent detection capability to the interrogator receiver, allowing the phase of the received signal to be measured.  As is done in GPS signal processing, the phase information allows precise measurement of range (from the interrogator to sensor) as well as motion, and if multiple antennas are used, angle of arrival (i.e. direction) can also be sensed.   The investigation will include optimizing waveforms for the new measurement capabilities and will extend the detection range well beyond the 21 feet.  Other objectives are to develop a compact integrated sensor and antenna, synchronize timing and phase in a multiple interrogator network and improve RF performance on both the transmit and receive side of the interrogator. The proposed interrogator is based on a quadrature receiver technique and will also include wireless backhaul for instantaneous distribution of measurement data. The proposed interrogator and SAW sensors are to operate at the 915 MHz frequency band.

Additional NASA applications include the monitoring of structural integrity, extreme temperature, extreme pressure, toxic or lethal environments.  Airframe safety and the required/planned maintenance process are also potential applications. This technology can allow the feasible embedment of sensors in key structural components of an airframe for persistent monitoring both during flight and as a post flight analysis.  Critical states of air flight could be instrumented without the increased cost of weight associated with fiber optic or wired communication.","Potential Non-NASA commercial include the Automotive Industry, Civil Engineering structures, Chemical and Biological sensing and detection, and the oil industry.

A fundamental requirement for success with these technologies is that they operate using valid models or ontologies of the application domains.  Making ontological information available to automated systems is difficult because 1) domain experts reason in domain terms, not the formal logic of ontologies; 2) the states and configurations of the specific objects in the domain are both voluminous and dynamic, making manual entry and maintenance prohibitive; and 3) the data required, especially state updates, need to be extracted or imported from other disparate systems.  This proposal seeks to investigate, design and test a framework for consistent ontological modeling both within and across domains that can be exploited by automated planners currently being developed by NASA's exploration technology program.  Specifically we will investigate a modeling framework that provides 1) an ontological representation of domain information in a standard format that can be used by NASA's developing planning software, 2) an interactive editing environment to allow domain experts to construct and maintain the ontological information; and 3) a general, systematic, and maintainable semantic mapping from external data sets into the user-constructed ontology.","Procedures are at the core of all NASA missions, especially human space missions.  Mission planning is also at the core of all space missions due to the high cost of space assets such as astronauts, equipment and communication links.  Since domain models are essential to both generating plans and executing procedures, our technologies will have applications across many NASA programs, from Mission Control to on-board NASA vehicles and outposts.  We expect applications of our technology to first of all impact ISS operations by helping to unify not only planning and scheduling programs, but also disparate research programs through a common set of domain models and concepts.  Our work will provide connection to automated planning technologies development through the Automation for Operations (A4O) project run out of NASA ARC.  We will work closely with Dr. Jeremy Frank at NASA ARC during Phase 1 to ensure our relevance to the A4O projects.  More important, the domain ontologies along with their mappings to ISS data sets can be the way in which some of their dispersed knowledge is consolidated and managed.","The number of robotic entities becoming available for military operations is increasing dramatically and their capabilities are evolving at a rapid pace. As the military begins to use automated planning technologies for the efficient use of these increasingly complex resources they will be plagued with the same modeling problems as NASA.  Our technology will again serve as a unifying framework to capture military domain models for use across a variety of automated technologies used for the generation of efficient plans that integrate human and robotic units.  We also see a need for domain ontologies to support the use of procedures and planning in operations such as refineries, chemical plants, nuclear and other power plants and any installation that has established standard operating procedures that must be carefully followed under often stressful situations.  As these industries move to electronic procedures tied to system telemetry and integrated with planning for more efficient and safer operations, they will require our ontological framework to maintain a consistent representation of their domains.",Command & Control; Computer System Architectures; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Development Environments; Inventory Management/Warehousing; Knowledge Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation)

This system will be called the Predictive System Awareness Tool, or PSAT.","The NASA applications for this technology include decision support for the flight controllers in the Mission Control Center and an improved level of trust in autonomous software used in the MCC.This technology will provide the flight controllers with improved situational awareness, by providing them information about predicted future events and situations in the vehicles and systems that they are monitoring. This will enable them to work more efficiently and safely, by giving them the information they need to make informed decisions. At the same time, this technology will give the flight controllers more visibility into the workings of autonomous software, especially the planning software, which will help them to trust the software and the plans that the software produces.","As autonomous planning software is used more widely, this technology will follow along, supporting the users of autonomous software, supporting their decision-making, and enabling them to trust and rely on planning and other autonomous software to produce a reliable product.  We foresee that autonomous software will begin to penetrate the marketplace within the next few years, creating a valuable opportunity for this technology.  By placing ourselves on the cutting edge, S&K Aerospace will be in an excellent position to exploit the newly developing markets.",Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling

However, these advancements still require trading reliability for convenience.  Frequent minor failures are acceptable in casual environments, but critical systems cannot make the same exchange.  The software systems that NASA develops could greatly benefit from machine learning technologies that have been applied to casual computing, if the software developed by learning algorithms could be verified.We propose to apply formal methods to machine learning, and specifically Programming by Demonstration (PBD).  The existing technology readiness level is very low: no known verifiable PBD systems have been deployed and the existing research in the area is limited.  The Phase I effort will result in publications and a prototype implementation of a verifiable PBD system using SMT solvers.  Phase II will build on Phase I publications and prototypes to demonstrate increased verification capabilities through the application of more complex formal methods, such as model checking.  Verifiable machine learning would allow for trainable systems that meet critical properties, but are still adaptable to specific use cases.  Such tools could be re-purposed for multiple applications without incurring the development costs associated with manual automation techniques today.","Crew-facing tools, remote control systems, and stored procedure authoring could all benefit from the capabilities offered by programming by demonstration and machine learning.  Enabling these technologies to be applied safely will open up many opportunities at NASA for application re-use and productivity improvements through customization and fast, robust, macro/procedure creation.  Improving automation in these areas will allow for more complex stored procedures to be used on un-manned craft and manned craft can take advantage of greater robustness through increasingly complex automatic navigation.  Customization benefits will enable astronauts and remote operators to train general purpose tools (such as robotic arms) to perform complex repetitive operations at the press of a button simply by demonstrating the task a few times.  These technologies have the potential to greatly increase the speed and reliability of NASA mission control, sample collection, and repair work.","Machine learning and automation tools extend into all industries, bringing about improved human-computer interactions through per-user and per-task customization.  While many tools have already been applied to casual computer use, there are myriad domains that have yet to adopt learning techniques because of the absence of behavioral guarantees.  For example, reliable human review to ensure information assurance, remote piloting of UAVs, and even system administration tasks all require high levels of reliability, yet these tasks are also rife with meticulous and error-prone tasks that currently must be performed by trained experts.  Formally verified learning tools will be able to address these needs without increasing the risk associated with automation today.",Analytical Methods; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction

And high quality, optimizing schedulers have rarely been integrated with such planning systems and only at a very coarse level.  Little research regarding interleaving scheduling and planning has been done.  Meanwhile, we have studied and implemented human scheduling decision processes over a 20 yr. period, developing the Aurora scheduling architecture in the process, which executes very rapidly and has solved scheduling problems in dozens of diverse critical domains.  We propose to intimately integrate high speed, high quality scheduling algorithms from Aurora with NASA's existing EUROPA 2 architecture and expose high level descriptions of individual scheduling decision methods to end-users, enabling users to compose and configure these scheduling methods.  A combined EUROPA-Aurora system would allow for more efficient plans and more optimal scheduling.  It would allow EUROPA to better handle scheduling problems in its current domains and be better applied to domains with  more significant scheduling issues.  Better schedules will get more science done with the same time and resources.  In Phase I, we will determine the requirements of the integrated EUROPA-Aurora system for the types of domains that would most benefit from the integration and will determine additional heuristics, algorithms, methods and techniques needed for Aurora for those domains.  We will develop the Integration Design, including determining, with NASA's input, whether it is most beneficial to integrate Aurora with EUROPA directly or to port algorithms from Aurora to EUROPA.  We will prove feasibility of the integration by implementing an integration prototype and applying it to two different domains to show its efficacy, generality, and adaptability.  Two options that we are already familiar with are planning/scheduling for ISS operations and autonomous spacecraft/robots.","There are many similarities between NASA's autonomous and real-time planning and scheduling applications and similar applications in the DoD, which is a main Stottler Henke customer.  In particular the DoD and defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, and Northrop Grumman are all current Stottler Henke customers) are dealing with the explosive growth of unmanned vehicles and need to increase their autonomy.  Stottler Henke is already involved in those efforts such that EUROPA-Aurora can be marketed to our current contacts in the defense industry.  Additionally, we are already marketing Aurora, our general intelligent scheduling framework, and customizing it for a variety of domains.  EUROPA-Aurora can be marketed to this existing Aurora product customer base, which has already generated over $3 million in revenue for Stottler Henke.

The MESFET technology is fully CMOS-compatible and can be integrated alongside conventional MOSFETs with no changes to the process flow. Unlike the MOSFETs however, the MESFETs do not require a fragile metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) interface and are extremely robust. With breakdown voltages in the range 10-50V the MESFET operating voltage greatly exceeds that of the accompanying CMOS. The combination of CMOS compatibility with high breakdown voltage allows for integrated DC-to-DC power conversion solutions that would otherwise require discrete components based on laterally diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor (LDMOS) devices. The MESFETs are intrinsically radiation tolerant up to 1 Mrad(Si) and have been demonstrated to work over the temperature range -196C to +150C. The Phase 1 R&D we are proposing will characterize the large signal switching performance of the SOI MESFETs for buck converter applications in extreme environments.","Wide temperature range, radiation hard DC-to-DC buck converters that are compatible with advanced CMOS technologies will be widely applicable to NASA science and exploration missions scheduled for the next decade and beyond. The high radiation tolerance we have demonstrated is attractive for orbital earth science studies as well as lunar and interplanetary missions. Our technology may even be suitable for spacecraft that are exposed to high space radiation environments such as the Europa Jupiter System Mission that might accumulate a TID of 1-3 Mrad over a 10 year mission lifetime. Missions to the outer reaches of the solar system often make use of a radiothermal generator (RTG). The power management components of these systems are therefore exposed to on-board radiation from the RTG and require the high level of radiation tolerance we expect from the MESFET technology. The wide temperature operating range will be useful for robotic systems on the Moon or Mars. The current Martian rovers use a thermally controlled warm-electronics-box (WEB) to ensure critical electronic components are not exposed to the full thermal variation of the external environment. Our wide temperature range MESFET technology will allow more circuits to be placed outside the WEB, enabling  missions to hostile and extreme environments.","With expected annual worldwide sales of $6.6B in 2010, switching converters represent 26% of the global semiconductor market for power conditioning analog components.  Switching regulators are also one of the fastest growing segments in the power conditioning IC market with compounded annual growth rates of 17% projected for the period 2007-2012. The growth in linear regulator sales is driven largely by portable consumer electronics including cell phones, PDAs, laptop and tablet computers, and a variety of other portable devices that require high performance power management.

However, dust mitigation and removal remains a difficult task, particularly given the nature and morphology of space-born particulate materials and the strong bonds they can develop with any surface. Several mechanical techniques involving shaking and wiping have been devised to address this problem, but these are difficult to implement and expensive to maintain over mission life cycles.One successful innovation that has been developed and tested for dust removal is the ""electrodynamic shield"" or EDS. The EDS is composed of inter-digitated, electrically conductive electrodes connected to an AC power supply. The main parameters that govern the efficiency of dust removal are the voltage and the frequency of the AC signal applied to the electrodes. Poly Adaptive, LLC, proposes to investigate the novel application and use of nanoscale materials to address severe limitations of existing EDS designs caused by the metallic electrodes that reduce the amount of radiation reaching solar panels. Successful Phase I results will show the feasibility of an EDS that is transparent and can be placed on top of any surface.","The EDS technology is vital for the success for any ESMD program in which spacecraft or robotic systems are exposed to dusty environments throughout the solar system. Dust agglomeration has been a major deterrent to overall mission duration and has reduced reliability and adversely affected mission success. Since there are no dust-free surfaces within the solar system, it cannot be assumed that, simply because there is no atmosphere, dust cannot deposit onto a surface. Furthermore, regardless of the robotic system sent to a planetary system, there will always be systems or subsystems that cannot tolerate dust, including power subsystem components such as solar panels, optical lenses for instruments and cameras, thermal radiators, batteries, etc. Therefore, there will always be a NASA need for dust removal systems, and the EDS has been proven to be the best technology to address this critical issue.","There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications for the proposed technology: solar panels, windows, windshields, aircraft coatings, blades, optical devices, pharmaceutical devices and installations, drapes, blinds, household surfaces, engine components, filters, etc. All of these devices could potentially benefit from inherent dust removal systems. An early application of greatest interest to Poly Adaptive, LLC, is to develop electronic dust shied (EDS) systems for commercial solar panels. Since large-scale solar installations usually are located in sun-drenched desert areas where dry weather and winds sweep dust into the air and deposit it onto the surface of solar panels, the need for self-cleaning these surfaces is critical. The EDS technology should certainly be one of the potential candidates to solve this problem.","Adaptive Optics; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Coatings/Surface Treatments; Lenses; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Mirrors; Nanomaterials; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Telescope Arrays"

Energy storage applications, human-rated exploration vehicles, in-space propulsion systems, un-manned aerial vehicles, robotic and manned rovers require steady state output electricity generation to maximize the operational capabilities and successfully achieve complex missions.  Proton exchange membrane (PEM) based fuel cell systems offer the highest efficiency and the lowest weight energy conversion systems to generate electricity for space applications. The efficiency and lifetime of the current PEM fuel cell systems is mainly governed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts.  Lynntech proposes a novel electro-catalytic approach with an advanced ORR electrocatalyst that utilizes a stabilized platinum alloy supported on an electrically/ionically conductive mixed oxide that addresses the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art ORR Pt Black or carbon supported catalysts. Alloying with transition metals improves the microstructural properties of platinum and increases ORR rate, therefore increases the efficiency.  The mixed oxide component effectively decomposes peroxide radicals and suppresses the peroxide radical production, which minimizes the peroxide radical damages on the membrane, hence leading to significant increase in the fuel cell stack lifetime.","Lynntech's advanced ORR catalyst technology can address the need for lighter weight, more reliable regenerative fuel cell systems for electrical energy storage applications.  Such systems are required for NASA's future human exploration missions, particularly for stationary power for permanent bases, for large extra-terrestrial and interplanetary exploration and cargo ships, and for human-rated exploration vehicles, in-space propulsion systems, un-manned aerial vehicles, robotic and manned rovers.","Lynntech's Advanced ORR catalyst technology has applications in the fuel cell industry in the following markets: Stationary power systems (Telecom power, backup power, primary power); transportation power system (automotive fuel cell power, fork lifts); portable power systems (portable generators, portable battery chargers); and power systems for niche applications (space applications, un-manned aerial vehicles).",Conversion; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Generation; Nanomaterials; Storage

As the demand for on-board power and total energy-storage capacity has continued to increase, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of battery technologies with higher energy- and power-density potential. Although substantial advancements have been made in this class of batteries over the past ten years by both domestic and foreign suppliers, substantial limitations still exist in: energy and power densities, operational temperature limits, safety, and lifecycle and lifetime performance.  To address this need, ADA Technologies, Inc. proposes the use of advanced nanocomoposite electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes to enable increased performance and safety in lithium-ion batteries as compared to state-of-the-art devices.  The high capacity, high rate capability and high cycle life performance potential of the proposed advanced nanocomposite electrodes in combination with the inherent non-volatility and non-flammability of ionic liquids holds substantial potential in meeting this objective.  This proposed project will result in improved specific energy and power, wider operation temperature ranges, inherently safer operation, and excellent storage / cycle life as compared to current Li-ion batteries.","If proven technically feasible and commercially viable, the proposed technology could see immediate use in on-board power systems for existing and/or future space exploration vehicle programs.  The combination of high performance (e.g., high energy and power density, cycle life, etc.) and increased safety for the proposed technology as compared to state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries holds substantial potential in greatly increasing the operational performance of NASA extravehicular activities, landers and rover platforms.","Beyond NASA, the proposed technology would also be broadly applicable to military and commercial satellite markets where a similar need for high specific properties (energy and power density) and high cycle life) exists.  Finally and beyond the spaceflight community, the proposed technology could see use in numerous other applications where a need for high performance and safety in lithium-ion batteries is of great interest.

We propose to develop a Stirling generator to meet NASA needs.  Our Stirling generator adapts technology we have developed for high-reliability long-life (> 10 years) space-based Stirling-cycle cryocoolers and proprietary compressor and expander technology.  Our compressor and expander technology enables near-isothermal compressions and expansions, which allow our Stirling generator to achieve a high percentage of the Carnot thermal efficiency.  In Phase I, we will generate a preliminary design of our Stirling generator and project its efficiency.  In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate a prototype Stirling generator and deliver the prototype to NASA for functional and environmental testing.  In Phase III, we will build and sell Stirling generators for many government and private-sector applications.","The high reliability and high efficiency of our Stirling generator will enable our Stirling generator to meet NASA needs for advanced power conversion technologies for high power space exploration applications.  Also, NASA needs high-efficiency space nuclear power systems for space electric propulsion and surface power systems in support of human missions.  Nuclear systems are anticipated to enable effective long surface stay crew habitation and operations, long-range surface mobility and planetary cargo transfer.  Initial planetary outpost power levels are anticipated to be between 30-50 kWe with anticipated growth to 100's kWe. Additionally, space nuclear electric propulsion will require technologies capable of effective and efficient multi-hundred kilowatt systems. Technology performance goals include; reducing overall system mass, volume, radiator area with reduced cost and increased safety and reliability.   NASA needs high-efficiency (> 20%), compact, lightweight, and reliable power conversion with heat-source temperatures in the range 900 to 1100 K.  Our compact, lightweight, and reliable Stirling generator will meet NASA needs for space nuclear power systems.","There is a large market for our Stirling generator for hybrid vehicles.  Our Stirling generator uses large pressure amplitudes and a high operating frequency to produce a compact power-dense unit.  With a high power density, material costs are low, so our Stirling generator will have low costs when it is mass-produced.  Our proprietary compressor and expander technology will give our Stirling generator for hybrid vehicles a high efficiency.  Our Stirling generator can easily be coupled with a burner that has the ability to burn multiple alternative fuels.  Our Stirling generator is quiet, which is important for automotive applications.  Our Stirling generator is attractive as a backup power generator for residential and commercial applications.  The quiet operation of our Stirling generator makes it especially attractive for this application.  There are many military applications that could benefit from a miniaturized version of our Stirling generator (a ""micro-Stirling generator"").  For example, the Army needs a compact, lightweight, and efficient electrical generator to couple with burners the Army is currently developing for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and unattended sensor systems.  Our micro-Stirling generator will meet needs for a compact, lightweight, and efficient electrical generator.","Conversion; Generation; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

Both reusable and ablative TPS have been developed to protect spacecraft.  Typically, reusable TPS have been used for the Shuttle where the reentry conditions are relatively mild while ablative TPS materials have been used on planetary entry probes where high heating rates are generated.  Additional advances in TPS design are needed to deliver large payloads to the moon and Mars, and to explore the outer planets.  Flexible or deployable aeroshells offer an approach for achieving larger aeroshell surface areas for entry vehicles than otherwise attainable without deployment.  Larger surface area aeroshells offer the ability to decelerate high-mass entry vehicles at relatively low ballistic coefficients.  However, for an aeroshell to perform even at the low ballistic coefficients attainable with deployable aeroshells, a flexible thermal protection system (TPS) is required that is capable of surviving reasonably high heat flux and durable enough to survive the rigors of construction, handling, and deployment.

During a previous NASA LaRC funded High Mass Mars Entry System study, Andrews Space found that while inflatable aerobrake designs potentially offer the lowest-mass solution, they are challenged from the uncertainties of dynamic response of large soft structures at the sizes required, and from the risks associated with cleanly separating the lander/payload from the decelerator. A ""Petal Brake"" concept was introduced as an integrated hypersonic entry system design that addresses these issues.  The design performs hypersonic aerocapture and entry maneuvers as a biconic aeroshell, then deploys to provide higher drag just prior to terminal descent and landing.  It covers a wide range of EDL environments, is structurally determinate, with minimal aero-elastic issues, and with positive separation characteristics during jettison.  During Phase I of this project, Andrews proposes to further advance the operational Petal Brake concept by designing and evaluating a point-of-departure petal-brake design for Mars entry, defining a potential test program, then generating a detailed subscale petal-brake design suitable for manufacture, wind tunnel testing, and high altitude deployment testing in Phase II.","The petal brake decelerator has primary application to the aerocapture and aerobraking of large payloads into Mars or other planetary atmospheres. This has direct benefit to future planetary exploration missions.  A smaller deployable petal brake could be used for recovery of payloads from Earth orbit as well.  A petal brake could be used for controlled de-orbit and disposal, recovery of materials testing cargo, to recover biological and high value cargo from low earth orbit free flyers or from the International Space Station.  Larger deployable petal brake configurations could also be used to retrofit existing cargo vehicles, such as the Orbital Cygnus, ATV or HTV and enable a recovery capability.","The petal brake decelerator has commercial applicability to the recovery of large and small payloads from suborbital conditions or from Earth orbit to support low cost launch or cargo recovery. One application of this innovation may include recovery of launch stage hardware for reuse. SpaceX is planning on recovering their Falcon 1E and Falcon 9 second stage, and the deployable petal brake could be an enabler given their physical size and configuration.  Booster recovery could also be enhanced by deployable interstage drag devices.

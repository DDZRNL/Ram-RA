10-2 A1.04-9528,NNX11CG56P,Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies,Multifunction Lidar for Air Data and Kinetic Air Hazard Measurement,Ophir Corp,"10184 West Belleview Avenue, Suite 200, Littleton, CO 80127 - 1762",(303) 933-2200,Loren M Caldwell,caldwell@ophir.com,"10184 West Belleview Ave., Suite 200, Littleton, CO 80127 - 1762",(303) 933-2200,,,,,3,5,"Ophir's Phase I research was highly successful and all contract objectives and tasks were successfully completed.  In Phase II, Ophir proposes to continue this important research by developing and flight testing a multifunction, low-cost, laser radar capable of enhancing aviation safety by accurately measuring kinetic air hazards, providing supplemental air data, and enhancing ride comfort.  The innovation is providing a single, cost-effective sensor that has multiple-use functionality, in a package that is easily integrated onto commercial aircraft.  Conventional air data systems provide critical information to the aircraft for safe flight, but there are vulnerabilities, as evidenced by the recent Air France accident.  A more robust air data system for flight controls on aircraft is needed - particularly to measure airspeed in icing and severe weather conditions.  This proposed sensor also detects and quantifies kinetic air hazards which impact the safety of air traffic; enhances ride comfort while reducing airframe fatigue; decreases fuel consumption, and reduces the frequency and severity of encounters with turbulent events.  Building upon the Phase I design and performance trade studies, Phase II will finalize the prototype design, assemble the working prototype, perform Proof-of-Capability laboratory testing, package the prototype for flight testing and demonstrate the multifunction lidar technology in a representative flight environment (TRL 5).","Airspace transformation to NextGen may be significantly safer by providing additional information for kinetic air hazard detection.  NASA has pioneered many innovations and improvements for wind hazard detection, warning and forecasting. This innovation enables this airspace transformation by providing wind hazard measurement and resulting real-time information for air traffic operations.  This innovation will not only increase in-safety flight, but also may impact the volume of traffic able to traverse the continent due to the provision of resultant weather warnings.  Also, safety of the air traffic system will be improved with the provision of a supplemental air data system on commercial aircraft.  NASA has shown the utility of lidar wind and air data measurements over the years, however, the systems have been quite cumbersome.  Ophir solves this challenge by providing a supplemental air data system and a dual-use kinetic air hazard monitoring system in a small size, weight and power consumption package, as well as at a low cost.","The Non-NASA commercial applications for this multifunction lidar include commercial aircraft manufacturers, manned and unmanned military aircraft developers, and manufacturers of conventional air data probes.  The regional jet market and the Air Force aircraft developers may also benefit from the air data measurement capability of this lidar for new aircraft flight testing and calibration.  The commercial markets have been reticent to adopt an optical air data sensor due to the size, weight and power consumption factors, as well as, the single function nature of the sensor.  But, the ability to condense the sensor and offer multimode operation enables the market acceptance and ultimate sensor commercialization.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Detectors (see also Sensors); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)"

Box 13377, Minneapolis, MN 55414 - 5377",(651) 602-9732,,,,,3,6,"Adaptive control offers an opportunity to fulfill aircraft safety objectives though automated vehicle recovery while maintaining performance and stability requirements in the presence of unknown or varying operating environment. Future aircraft are a natural application of adaptive control. These aircraft will be more fuel efficient, have longer operating ranges though more flexible aircraft structures. This increased flexibility will tightly couple structural and rigid body modes. The traditional control approaches to address the aeroservoelastic (ASE) will not work due to this coupling. Furthermore, the application of adaptive control to these flexible aircraft may result in undesired ASE excitation leading to structural damage or failure. Hence an integrated flight control system is needed for gust load alleviation, flutter suppression and rigid body control of the aircraft which works in concert with the adaptive control system for improved resilience and safety. MUSYN proposes an integrated approach based on linear, parameter-varying (LPV) control to the design of integrated flight control algorithms. Phase II research is focusedon developing a fully functional prototype tool suite to model, identify, analyze, design, simulate and implement in real-time,  linear, parameter-varying (LPV) ASE controllers. The objective is to combine the integrated LPV flight control system with adaptive control to preserve rigid body performance during upsets while mitigating ASE effects. The prototype LPV tools will be used to analyze and design an inner-loop LPVASE and adaptive outer-loop controller for the MAD-MUTT test vehicle. The LPV designs will be validated in software-in-the-loop andhardware-in-the-loop testing prior to their implementation and flighttest on the MAD-MUTT vehicle. The objective is to demonstrate the viabilityof the LPV tools suite to analyze and synthesize integrated controllers for highly flexible aircraft.","The immediate NASA application will be the Multi-Utility Aeroelastic Demonstrator (MAD), Multi Utility Technology Test-bed (MUTT)vehicle being transferred to NASA Dryden in Summer 2012. This aircraft will provide an experimental flight test capability for aeroservoeleastic control research. Lockheed Marting and the USAF developed this test bed to investigate the use of active control strategies for highly flexible aicraft. The MAD-MUTT vehicle is an ideal facility to use the LPV framework for modeling, identification, analysis, control, simulation and real-time implementation of LPV controllers. The proposed research will develop an integrated LPV flight control for the MAD-MUTT test vehicle. The performance and robustness of the LPV design will be accessed and compared with a baseline aeroservoelastic system.","Non-NASA commercial applications fall under two categories: (1) Uninhabited aerial systems (UASs) like SensorCraft, for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and (2) Space, automotive and ship transportation systems. MUSYN or the companies it has worked with have already demonstrated the application of LPV control techniques to aircraft, launch vehicles, automotive suspensions, trucks, missiles and underwater vehicles. All these systems are seeing increased aeroservoelastic coupling due to the push for more efficient, lightweight structures. The software tool develop in the SBIR addresses a unique need that is currently only being addressed by European aerospace companies using proprietary software tools. A Matlab based LPV Control Toolbox would address a need in the US aerospace and transportation communities and complement the robust control tools already developed MUSYN.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

It is based on a high fidelity Fatigue Damage Assessment Network (FDAN) which includes 1) a coupled continuum damage and discrete crack model for ply damage characterization; 2) a moment schema finite element coupled with XFEM for efficient crack growth simulation in a thin ply; 3) a mixed mode fatigue delamination module to account for the mode mixity and failure mode interaction; and 4) an adaptive fracture process zone model for mesh independent delamination growth. A reduced-order model of FDAN will be generated using a combined response surface and a Gaussian process surrogate model builder to perform the subsequent probabilistic analysis efficiently.  For the module verification and validation, experimental studies at the sub-component level will be performed along with the use of a damage monitoring and characterization system. The developed toolkit will be used to perform damage prognosis and risk informed life management using SHM data. GEM has secured commitments for technical support and commercialization assistance from Clarkson University, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Boeing.","The results from this research will have significant benefits to enhance the aviation safety program in NASA. It will result in: 1) a commercially viable, accurate, computationally efficient, and user-friendly probabilistic residual life assessment tool for characterizing fatigue crack growth and performing damage analysis at the presence of uncertainties in design and loading parameters; 2) an integrated analysis framework for fatigue damage prognosis and health management of aging structures; 3) a virtual testing tool to reduce current certification and qualification costs which are heavily driven by experimental testing under various stress conditions; and 4) innovative probabilistic methods and reliability assessment procedures to facilitate the structural health management.  The developed tool integrates advanced crack insertion and growth characterization, innovative fatigue damage modeling, and efficient probabilistic methods into a seamless framework for probabilistic crack growth analysis and structural damage prognosis.","Structural aging under fatigue loading is one of the most common failure mechanisms in civilian structures such as buildings, bridges, power lines, pressure vessels, and ship structures. The developed probabilistic fatigue life prediction tool can be used effectively and efficiently to assist a designer and rule-maker to answer the following questions: 1) does a proposed design have an acceptable risk of fatigue failure; 2) how tolerant is a proposed design of a crack without the risk of catastrophic failure; 3) if a crack is found in service, how long is it safe to leave the crack before repair; 4) the vessel's mission and operational profile have changed, what are the implications for fatigue and fracture risks; 5) how often should the vessel be inspected for fatigue cracks; 6) what crack size does a structural health monitoring system need to be able to detect to reduce the risk of fracture; and 7) how can measured loads from a structural health monitoring system be used to update the fatigue risks? The tool can be used to assist commercial and military industries to reduce the cost of test-driven design and process iterations with the use of the virtual testing tool. Finally, teaming with LM and Sikorsky, highly visible aircraft manufacturers, will considerably shorten our development cycle from producing a prototype research orientated tool to commercially accessible design software.","Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Characterization; Composites; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Structures; Verification/Validation Tools"

Vast amounts of FOQA data are distributed between many computers, organizations, and geographic locations. This project develops methodology for transforming such distributed data into actionable knowledge in application to aircraft health management from the vehicle level to the fleet level to the national level. The distributed data processing methodology provably obtains the same results as would be obtained if the data could be centralized. The data mining methods are efficient and scalable so that they can return results quickly for 10Tb of distributed data.This data mining technology that we call Distributed Fleet Monitoring (DFM) developed in SBIR Phase I satisfies these requirements. The data are transformed into models, trends, and anomalies. The model training and anomaly monitoring are formulated as convex optimization and decision problems. The optimization agents are distributed over networked computers and are integrated through remote connection interface in a scalable open grid computing framework. Though the data and the computations are distributed, they yield provably the same optimal solution that would be obtained by a centralized optimization.DFM feasibility was demonstrated in the problem of monitoring aircraft flight performance from fleet data using large realistic simulated datasets. We demonstrated efficient computation of quadratic optimal solution by interacting distributed agents. The feasibility demonstration successfully recovered aircraft performance anomalies that are well below the level of the natural variation in the data and are not directly visible. The algorithms are very efficient and scalable. Phase I demonstration extrapolates to processing 10Tb of raw FOQA data in under an hour to detect anomalous units, abnormal flights, and compute predictive trends.",The developed software architecture and framework support objectives of NASA Aviation Safety Program by enabling aircraft monitoring applications using large distributed data sets. The architecture is open for integration of third party algorithms. It could enable transition of NASA data mining research into practical use in the aviation industry. The architecture is suitable for use in existing and future FAA and NASA portals for safety monitoring of data from multiple airline operators.,"One application of Distributed Fleet Monitoring (DFM) technology is to multivariable FOQA monitoring of commercial aircraft fleet. The architecture is most suitable for use in existing and future FAA nation-wide systems for safety monitoring of data from multiple airline operators. The technology allows monitoring of distributed data sets from different airline while keeping the source data private; only pre-processed abstracted data are collected for centralized processing. The unique value of the technology is in fleet-wide monitoring of aircraft performance that allows improving the safety of operation. DFM monitoring of FOQA data can be used for commercial airlines and military aircraft fleets. The software is automated and easy to deploy because it relies on data-driven models. In addition to improving safety, the technology can be used for condition-based maintenance and fuel consumption monitoring.  DFM allow to monitor both airframe and propulsion. There are multiple applications in jet and turboshaft engine fleet monitoring in commercial and military fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. Other potential applications are to monitoring turboshaft engines in ground vehicle fleets. DFM technology could be applied to monitoring of energy generation and power distribution systems. This includes fleets of gas turbines used for power generation, wind turbines in wind farms, power distribution transformers and other such equipment.",Aerodynamics; Computer System Architectures; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Knowledge Management; Process Monitoring & Control
10-2 A2.02-8821,NNX11CD82P,Combustion for Aerospace Vehicles,An Instrument to Measure Aircraft Sulfate Particle Emissions,"Aerodyne Research, Inc.","45 Manning Road, Billerica, MA 01821 - 3976",(978) 663-9500,Michael T Timko,timko@aerodyne.com,"45 Manning Road, Billerica, MA 01821 - 3976",(978) 932-0280,,,,,3,5,"Aerodyne is developing a sulfate detection instrument, based on the Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectrophotometer (TILDAS) technology and therefore termed the ""TILDAS-sulfate"" instrument, for measurement of the size-resolved sulfate PM emissions of aircraft engine combustion. Over the past 10 years and through a series of NASA led efforts, the Aerodyne Research Inc emissions team has made a series of contributions to on-going NASA programs to characterize aircraft engine emissions. Despite progress, significant knowledge gaps exist – especially for combustion emissions of alternatives to petroleum jet fuel. During this SBIR effort, we tested instrument performance in the absence of interferences, in the presence of >20-fold excess sulfur dioxide interference, in the presence of a combustion gases containing nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons as potential interferences, and for particles ranging in size from 100 to 300 nm. Instrument sensitivity was shown to be at least 600 ng per meter cubed (on a 1-sec cycle). In Phase II, we plan to: upgrade the instrument and incorporate improvements to Aerodyne's TILDAS technology to improve the detection limit to as low as 60 ng per meter cubed – on a 1-sec data acquisition cycle; test the upgraded instrument in the laboratory; demonstrate the instrument in the field for characterization of aircraft engine particle emissions.","NASA applications include characterization of aircraft sulfate emissions and atmospheric particle characterization tests.  Sulfate is one of the major categories of aircraft particle emissions and it plays a crucial role in determining the size distribution of particles in the evolving plume.  Sulfate is an important contributor to the urban and atmospheric PM balance.  NASA is spearheading efforts to encourage adoption of alternatives to petroleum jet fuel and the TILDAS-sulfate instrument can play an important role by helping to demonstrate the potential emissions reductions possible with the alternative fuels.  In terms of atmospheric studies, sulfate is emitted directly from a number of anthropogenic sources (coal-fired power plants, aircraft) and formed in the atmosphere by oxidation of sulfur dioxide. Time resolved measurements of particle sulfate would permit differentiation from potential sulfate sources, crucial for better understanding and mitigation.  The field of atmospheric nucleation is both active and – due to potential climate change implications – timely.  An instrument capable of field deployment and simultaneous measurement of <50 nm sulfuric acid and trace gas sulfur dioxide would provide valuable information to resolve current debates on the importance of sulfuric acid and organic materials to atmospheric nucleation processes.","NASA, EPA, SERDP, U.S. Air Force, FAA, airport operators, and engine manufacturers are all aircraft particle emissions stakeholders.  EPA in particular has maintained that aircraft emissions regulations must taken into account both non-volatile particle (soot) emissions and volatile (sulfate and organic) particle emissions.  The FAA has been considering mandating use of lower sulfur jet fuels and the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy are aggressively pursuing low-sulfur synthetic fuels and synthetic fuel blends for use in their aircraft.  We anticipate working with these partners to characterize particle emissions, develop better airport and Air Force base operation procedures, and design lower emissions aircraft engines and fuels.  The TILDAS-sulfate instrument will be an important capability in these efforts.  A primary factor in all of these is reduction of particle emissions, specifically sulfate particle emissions.  Few commercial instruments are capable of providing direct measurements of sulfate particle emissions, and none of them match the specifications we are targeting for the TILDAS-sulfate instrument.  Additional potential non-NASA applications include: diesel exhaust characterization, atmospheric chemistry studies, urban air quality studies, and industrial pollution characterization.  Out of these applications, DOE and NOAA are specifically interested in improving understanding of anthropogenic contributions to climate change and the role of particle emissions.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors)"

During Phase I, the LES/FW-H model was validated against matched sets of flowfield and companion acoustic data acquired at NASA/GRC for round nozzles. The flowfield validation included detailed comparisons against imagery, mean flow measurements and turbulence statistics. During Phase II, the end-to-end LES/FW-H noise prediction model will be demonstrated and validated by applying it to high aspect-ratio rectangular nozzle designs, proposed for testing at NASA GRC under the Fundamental Aeronautics Program. The model will also be validated against acoustic and flowfield data from a realistic jet-pylon experiment, thereby significantly advancing the state-of-the-art for LES. This critical validation will provide the foundation for proceeding to application of this innovative methodology in supporting the design and optimization of control concepts, e.g. chevrons, bevels, etc., as well as ultimately performing predictions of noise emissions from full-scale, realistic nozzles with complex exhaust flowpaths, airframe/propulsive jet interactions, etc.","The research proposed is of direct relevance to NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program, with its focus on development of supersonic commercial flight, while meeting current and future noise certification levels. In parallel with airframe design for supersonic flight, advanced propulsion concepts are also under development, with non-axisymmetric, rectangular nozzle designs that incorporate noise control concepts. The engines that will be used with these aircrafts require significant advances in noise control technology – an undertaking for which high-fidelity LES modeling will prove crucial in providing insight into physics and also complementing laboratory tests. The validated model will support NASA's upcoming tests of scale-model single or dual rectangular nozzles, as well as nozzles with chevrons and bevels. The same high-aspect ratio rectangular nozzles are also of interest to the Subsonic Fixed Wing Project.","The proposed research is directly applicable to the US Navy's development of noise suppression technology for the F/A-18 E/F and JSF/F-35B programs. The F/A-18 E/F program office is currently engaged in development of retrofits for the General Electric F414-400 engine that entail the replacement of their nozzle seals with a new design of seals which feature chevron extensions at the trailing-edge. Comparable modifications are also being considered for the General Electric F404-400 engine for the F/A-18 C/D aircraft. Over the longer-term, the Navy's focus is shifting towards advanced suppressions concepts beyond chevrons, etc. for next-generation propulsion systems, where high-fidelity modeling will be crucial in supporting technology development. The proposed technology also has applicability in the automobile industry. Although significant resources are being spent in reducing noise from vortex shedding from side-view mirrors, the efforts are presently hindered by the absence of high fidelity predictive tools.","Acoustic/Vibration; Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Atmospheric Propulsion; Characterization; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Launch Engine/Booster; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Tao Systems and CUBRC propose to develop a wide-bandwidth, thin-film heat transfer sensor system that quantifies the high frequency SWTBLI at duplicated flight conditions. This effort combines Tao Systems' high frequency-response/high-sensitivity electronics and signal processing techniques with the unique expertise of CUBRC in high-speed, high-enthalpy flows to obtain spatiotemporal information for the development of physics-based turbulence models.","In aeronautics, heat flux sensors will help meet measurement challenges in providing validation and verification of CFD codes for heat transfer. Development of reliable turbulence modeling and CFD codes depend on making precise aerothermodynamic measurements of heat flux on various test models. NASA ARMD specifically cites prediction of transition and flow separation as high-priority objectives for the future of aeronautics, and heat transfer measurements is a key tool in providing insight into the dynamics of flow phenomena in SWTBLI regions. Specific applications of interest include SWTBLI at high enthalpies (flap forces and Scramjet), laminar/turbulent transition (crossflow instability), and unsteady separated/reattaching backshell flows on capsules.","Apart from the military hypersonic applications, high-sensitivity, high-bandwidth heat transfer instrumentation would be useful for general spatiotemporally accurate measurement of temperature and heat flux. The electronics could be used for measurements in turbomachinery (turbine blades) and for pulse detonation engines. One interesting commercial application where high-temperature heat flux measurement would be useful is fuel cell research, in which spatiotemporal heat flux is critical for performance evaluation.

In a modern gas turbine engine, these temperatures can exceed the blade and disk material limits by 600 ¿F or more, necessitating both internal and film cooling schemes in addition to the use of thermal barrier coatings. Internal convective cooling is inadequate in many blade locations, and both internal and film cooling approaches can lead to significant performance penalties in the engine. Micro Cooling Concepts has developed a turbine blade cooling concept that provides enhanced internal impingement cooling effectiveness via the use of micro-structured impingement surfaces. These surfaces significantly increase the cooling capability of the impinging flow, as compared to a conventional untextured surface. This approach can be combined with microchannel cooling and external film cooling to tailor the cooling capability per the external heating profile. The cooling system can then be optimized to minimize impact on engine performance.","The proposed Phase I effort directly supports core NASA research efforts in turbine engine development, as well as the multi-agency Verstaile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) initiative. It is also applicable to two-state to orbit designs.","Military and commercial aircraft can both benefit from this technology, which permits higher combustion temperatures with lower engine penalties than state-of-the-art turbine blade cooling technologies. The blade cooling concept could be also applied to power generation plants, which are also seeking means of operating at higher temperatures and efficiencies.More generally, the enhanced impingement cooling techniques proposed here could be applied to a variety of cooling problems in the electronics, industrial processes, automotive, and laser industries.","Active Systems; Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Heat Exchange; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Processing Methods"

Several researchers have adopted an optimization framework for solving problems such as flight scheduling, route assignment, flight rerouting, nationwide traffic flow management (TFM) and dynamic airspace configuration. Computational complexity of these problems have led investigators to conclude that in many instances, real time solutions are computationally infeasible,  forcing the use of relaxed versions of the problem to manage computational complexity. The primary objective of the proposed research is to accelerate optimization algorithms that play central roles in NASA's ATM research, by parallel implementation on emerging high performance computing (HPC) hardware. The Phase I R&D effort implemented a Simplex-based Dantzig-Wolfe (DW) decomposition solver that exploits both coarse-grain and fine-grain parallelism in the sub-problem and master iterations of the DW decomposition. The implementation also exploits the sparsity in the problems, to manage both memory requirements and run-times for large-scale optimization problems. This parallel implementation was used to solve a Traffic Flow Management (TFM) problem with 17,000 aircraft (linear program with 7 million constraints), in 15 seconds. The implementation is 30¿ faster than the exact same code running on the CPU. It is also 16¿ faster than the NASA's current solution that implements parallel DW decomposition using the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) on an 8-core computer with hyper-threading.Based on the promising Phase I results, the Phase II R&D effort will explore Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) methods to solve optimization problems arising in the terminal area and on the airport surface, in addition to DW decomposition for the nationwide TFM problem. Phase II work will develop operational prototypes of the algorithm implementations on HPC hardware, and deliver them to NASA for further evaluation.","Proposed R&D effort will enable rapid solution to large scale optimization problems formulated by NASA researchers in the air traffic domain such as flight scheduling, route assignment, flight rerouting, national traffic flow management and dynamic airspace reconfiguration. The optimization software suite will enable real time execution of many optimizations problems that were deemed infeasible due to computational complexity.  The software suite developed under the proposed research will enable solutions to such problems without resorting to approximations.","High-complexity large-scale optimization problems arise frequently in the industry in several areas, such as: 1) Layout planning: designing the layout of equipment in a factory or components on a computer chip to reduce manufacturing time and minimize cost,  2) Network optimization: setup of telecommunications networks to maintain maximum throughput and quality of service during outages, 3) Resource allocation problems, optimal search and routing, 4) Supply chain management: managing the flow of raw materials and products based on uncertain demand for the finished products, 5) Transportation: managing freight transportation and delivery systems,  6) Scheduling applications: personnel staffing, manufacturing steps, project tasks, network data traffic, sports events and their coverage.

The technology presented provides an integrity check on all ADS-B data that is independent of all primary surveillance modes and is 100% robust to all Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing attacks.  An important by-product of that integrity check provides us with the further ability to do aircraft-to-aircraft relative positioning that is more accurate and more reliable than any civilian system in existence today.  The ADS-B integrity check and the aircraft-to-aircraft positioning can provide a further basis on which to enhance the safety of the National Airspace System (NAS).Our innovation extends ADS-B into a new standard for providing safe, secure, and authentic surveillance, which is required for Separation Assurance (SA) and Traffic Flow Management (TFM) in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).","Traffic Flow Management (TFM), Separation Assurance (SA), Super Dense Operations (SDO) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the National Airspace all make heavy use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B). This proposal presents technology that brings extra capability to ADS-B in the form of unspoofable authentication and a method called differential co-processing that can calculate the relative position between aircraft more accurately than any civilian method today. The potential impact of these capabilities on NASA's NextGen requirements ranges from ADS-B authentication, detection and identification of attacks; to using better relative positions to determine more accurate wind-shear models and enabling precise trajectory modeling during Very Closely Spaced Parallel Approaches (VCSPA). In short, the GPS Based Location Authentication and Differential Co-Processing could change and accelerate the course of NextGen development.","ADS-B is a public interface, an easy target for attack. The US Air Force is actively studying how to add security to ADS-B to ensure that attempts to disrupt military missions are identified and counter attacked. In particular the Air Force is concerned that enemies could add ghost aircraft to congested airspace for the purpose of disrupting C17, C130 and C5 flights that supply troops overseas. The GPS Location Based Authentication (GBLA) technology presented in this document can solve that concern. In addition the Differential Co-Processing techniques to calculate relative position between aircraft can act as a backup to the air-to-air radars currently deployed for operations such as formation flying. The largest military application of GBLA may not be in aviation. GBLA provides military quality GPS authentication without needing a reference copy of the secret military GPS codes. GBLA embedded into a handheld GPS receiver allows that receiver to be built entirely with civilian hardware, drastically reducing the cost of the receivers.",Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring)

A completely new circuit and system approach called Self Recovery Logic (SRL) is proposed for development herein which is able to function at the full speed afforded by the fabrication process and able to tolerate SEU impacts not possible with legacy circuits.  Moreover, a truly fault tolerant system is projected to replace Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) as the on-chip means for fault tolerance.  With the proposed building blocks in place, advanced reconfigurable and reprogrammable high speed devices can be implemented.

It is conjectured by many that radiation effects will impact terrestrial applications as transistor feature sizes continue smaller.  In real time control applications, radiation effects can have costly impacts in terms of financial, physical or human loss.  Real time control is evident in aircraft, security, financial transaction, power system control, and even automobile systems.  It is extremely difficulty to diagnose SEU issues because they are not easily reproduced, and therefore it may take some time before SEU is recognized as a source of problems in commercial electronics.

They serve as absolute reference for tracking of spacecraft during the downlink laser communication.  For such space communication link distances the beam spread due to diffraction is significant enough that only few photons are collected by a moderate size optical telescopes on the spacecraft. This necessitates photon-counting detectors suited for the space environment, along with increasing the output power of the laser beacon. Ultra low noise silicon avalanche photo-detector (Si-APD) based position-sensing detectors are used on the spacecraft to detect the laser beacons. Such Si-APDSs are also radiation-hardened and compatible with space-environment operation. It is therefore desirable to operate at shorter wavelengths ~1000nm, where Si-APDs have improved spectral responsivity. This helps to improve the SNR for tracking, and consequently reduce the uplink laser power requirements. Under Phase 2 program Fibertek will design and build a single-channel uplink laser beacon transmitter operating at 1030nm, capable of 500W average output power and 500kHz 16-PPM ary format operation. Inputs from end-user will be solicited for intended use and application, so as to drive the design requirements.  Baseline multi-stage 1024nm nm 300W Yb-fiber amplifier architecture demonstrated in Phase 1 will be transitioned to highly robust 'all-fiber' configuration.  Proposed design and prototype hardware is based on COTS fiber-optic technology platform, thereby leading to TRL = 4 – 5 level for the SBIR Phase 2 deliverable."," Compact, robust, and high-efficiency 1030nm laser transmitter for uplink beacon application for deep-space communication.  Highly compact, and cost-effective low power (40–100W) uplink laser beacons for near-Earth optical space communication links, e.g. as part of the NASA-SCaN roadmap. Alternately, using uplink laser beacons with higher powers, smaller aperture optical telescopes (~15-30cm) can enable high-bandwidth space optical communication links. The various design parameters and trade-offs are applicable to the design of other 1-m long-pulse lidar transmitters for NASA application (e.g. for atmospheric column sounding). Similarly, most principles carry over to the design of 1.5-m fiber laser/amplifier based lidar transmitters."," Laser illuminator and high-rate fine-tracking for directed-energy (DE) applications.

This effort raises several issues for the network management in the future integrated space networks. First, an integrated network management function, which uses common standards and implementations, is needed to serve as the interface for all SCaN network customers. Second, satellite operations currently use a highly manual approach. The research and development of autonomous operations has been conducted recently but is still at early stage. Third, due to different characteristics of space networks, security management mechanisms and other network management functions that are widely adopted in the traditional networks are not fully suitable to space networks. In addition, several issues related to Bundle Protocol exist and need to be further investigated to enhance the performance of bundle delivery in delay tolerant networks. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Security-Enhanced Autonomous Network Management (SEANM) scheme for reliable communication in space networking, which allows the system to adaptively reconfigure its network elements based upon awareness of network conditions, policies, and mission requirements.","The proposed DTN networking and network management solution has potential to largely reduce operation costs while maintain or even enhance the reliability for the NASA missions. Due to the heterogeneous nature of network assets and the lack of autonomy, the developed solution can be applied to the NASA's efforts on the integration of its current agency networks. The potential customers of our solution include robotic and human missions at locations ranging from the near Earth (e.g., EO-1) to deep space (e.g., Mars exploration) and SCaN program.","The proposed solution also has great potential in dynamic military applications. Given the GIG vision, such heterogeneous and dynamic wireless networks will be common and therefore robust and reliable communication is necessary. The proposed cross-layer information sharing architecture, mechanisms, and the developed network management tool can be applied to various military networks potentially supporting a number of major programs like Airborne Networks Program, Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Future Combat System (FCS), etc..

Implementing reliable translation is challenging, time-consuming, and error prone.We propose to develop Intelliface, an intelligent tool for developing interfaces between diagnosis and planning systems. Intelliface will help ensure that plans are revised appropriately when faults occur in complex space systems. In addition, Intelliface will reduce the effort needed to integrate diagnosis and planning systems. Intelliface will encode and apply a qualitative understanding of generic types of devices and their underlying physics (e.g., electrical storage, distribution, and consumption; fluid flow and storage; signal processing, etc.) in order to identify each activity's direct and indirect resource requirements and their dependencies. Intelliface will use the results of this reasoning to generate resource declarations, updated resource availabilities, and some planning constraints in the planning domain modeling language. In addition, Intelliface will support NASA's top-down systems engineering processes for specifying system functional requirements, performance requirements, and interfaces at each system tier.During Phase 2, we will develop a technology readiness level 6 software prototype that demonstrates the feasibility, utility, and usability of the Intelliface concept within a NASA-relevant environment.","Promising non-NASA applications include the management of commercial and government computer systems and communication networks that are used to process large, scheduled computing and data transfer tasks. Management of scientific computing clusters might benefit from Intelliface technology because the servers at various scientific computing centers have different capabilities due to differing hardware, software, and data. Also, batch scientific computing jobs are resource-intensive, so they are scheduled individually.","The primary target applications will be the integration of diagnosis and planning functions for NASA manned and unmanned missions, technology studies such as Desert RATS, and resource management of NASA satellite network resources.

Locker-sized processing facilities, which were typically transported up to and down from the International Space Station during the shuttle era, quite simply consume too much volume, mass, and power to be accommodated as part of both the upmass and downmass on current space transportation vehicles. As a result, more analysis must be accomplished on ISS, which makes on-orbit analytical tools critical to the continued success of microgravity research. The Analytical Cassette transfer Tool (ACT) is a low-cost, disposable device that efficiently transfers experiment samples in a safe and contained manner from unique experiment specific spaceflight hardware to on-orbit analytical tools that enable real-time analysis in microgravity.  ACT interfaces with several flight qualified processing payloads to extract experiment samples via a needle-less septum  and then allows transfer of those samples into a number of different on-orbit analytical devices, including such instrumentation as the Light Microscopy Module, the Microfluidic Flow Cytometer, a Spectrophotometer, and/or a Mass Spectrometer. Applications in life and environmental sciences include sampling liquid cultures/suspensions or sampling spacecraft water for quality evaluation.  ACT functions within or outside of on-orbit gloveboxes to safely transfer any liquid material from one container fitted with the ACT mating receptacle to another container fitted with a receptacle. Its safe, simple, effective, and with its economical advantage, ACT is destined to become the new standard fluid transfer device for the ISS and future space research venues.  For the Phase II project, Techshot will develop a flight version of the ACT and subject it to the major spaceflight integration tests.","ACT offers important potential NASA commercial applications, as well as a significant return on NASA's SBIR investment. Techshot expects to commercialize the ACT by incorporating it into the company's spaceflight service program that it offers to NASA mission programs, as well as for other Government agencies such as investigators funded by the National Institute of Health's Biomed-ISS program. ACT provides an innovative tool for transferring liquid samples from unique experiment specific spaceflight hardware to on-orbit analytical tools, thus enabling real-time analysis on ISS. Both physics and life science investigators can expect to benefit from ACT since it can safely transfer, store and manipulate a host of fluid media to enable both processing and analysis of samples. Overall, the science research community will be better served with increased capacity of getting more samples processed and analyzed in space, and NASA will be one step closer to realizing its goal of fully utilizing ISS as a national laboratory.","Building on its heritage of developing and integrating space flight hardware, and then conducting experiments in space, Techshot expects to soon offer flight experiment services to non-NASA customers, including the private sector and university researchers. The success of Techshot's processing facilities like the Avian Development Facility (ADF), the ADvanced Space Experiment Processor (ADSEP), and soon the ACT, will enable Techshot to serve more researchers and offer more diversified services on ISS. In combination, this broad range of services is expected to improve Techshot's competitive position. Furthermore, with the expected availability of commercial launch vehicles (e.g. SpaceX, Orbital), once these vehicles begin routine visits to the ISS, and eventually to commercial space stations (e.g. Bigelow) and free fliers (e.g. DragonLab), the economics of transporting and processing materials in microgravity should become far more compelling. And eventually, given enough commercial launch vehicle capacity, ACT could become the fluid transfer tool of choice to support the processing of larger quantities of high-value materials, including cells, pharmaceuticals and other high-value medical-grade materials. Finally, the potential also exists for an ACT patent and licensing to companies interested in selling such a product to ground-based research labs for use in BSL-3 facilities where additional containment of hazardous biological materials is critical for employee safety.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biomass Growth; Biophysical Utilization; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Image Processing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Medical; Nanomaterials; Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures; Polymers"

The space station itself has a limited lifecycle as well, thus long-term and/or high-risk development programs pose issues for science 'return on investment', if the technology cannot be adequately matured before the station is decommissioned. Thus innovative systems and technologies that minimize impact on limiting resources such as up-mass, down-mass and crew time, and can do so in the near- to mid-term, are highly desirable. One such area includes the various rechargeable battery systems on ISS used extensively for cameras, camcorders, laptops, communication systems and other portable science and diagnostic equipment. A common (universal) battery charging system for ISS, with the flexibility to accommodate current and future rechargeable battery requirements for payloads and equipment, could reduce the cost of use of the ISS for payload developers. Such a system would not only simplify the safety and integration process for battery-operated ISS applications, but also reduce up-mass by making use of existing ISS resources. In its SBIR Phase I program, Aurora Flight Sciences laid the groundwork for such a system, based on the needs of current and planned ISS battery system requirements. The results of the study indicate that a universal rechargeable battery system is feasible and could significantly reduce up-mass and crew-time to support current and future ISS programs. Expanding on the feasibility study performed in Phase I, Aurora will deliver a protoflight charger system and supporting documentation at the conclusion of Phase II. The proposed system will be fully developed in compliance with NASA safety and integration criteria within the 2-year SBIR Phase II timeframe, facilitating procurement of flight and ground support hardware by NASA in a potential Phase III program.","The proposed innovation serves to increase the science capability of ISS, enabling extended use of SPHERES and other battery-operated facilities.  The establishment of the ISS as a National Laboratory has significantly enhanced the accessibility of its facilities to organizations outside of NASA and the DOD, including other governmental agencies, research institutions and commercial entities.  The universal charger will enable use of these facilities beyond the retirement of the space shuttle. On the government side, the development of a universal charger forms the basis for space research that is at the core of NASA and the DOD.  The proposed system provides an upgrade to existing ISS facilities to greatly increase the lifetime of onboard assets. The addition of a universal charger to the SPHERES testbed and other facilities allows for increased research capabilities. SPHERES itself has multiple applications: it is a precursor to technology maturation for inspection satellites for ISS and other manned and unmanned NASA vehicles. Its forthcoming visual-based navigation system enables algorithm development in support of new applications such as standoff cameras for unmanned systems, imaging terminal capture for mars sample return missions, and will support a constantly changing workspace during robotic assembly and servicing missions. All of these applications will require additional battery systems and could benefit from the use of a universal charging system for ISS.","DoD applications include the enabled use of ISS research facilities for multiple purposes.  Additionally, opportunities may exist in the commercial, institutional and government sectors to 'sell' test time on SPHERES (and other ISS facilities that have been enabled by this innovation) to organizations for developing and validating vision and assembly capability for future satellite applications. This service could be analogous to the way in which the National Testing Service (NTS) provides facility rental and support for both commercial entities and institutions. Table 1 shows projected return on investment for selling SPHERES test time on ISS. Since SPHERES is the only known long duration, microgravity test facility for the development of satellite maneuvering algorithms, an opportunity exists to extend usage of this testbed to organizations outside of NASA. While the proposed innovation itself is not expected to be commercially profitable as a stand-alone item, it enables future researchers to reduce ISS payload development costs, and reduces up-mass overhead for future launches to ISS, thus creating a significant return on investment.",Distribution/Management; Process Monitoring & Control

Furthermore, this detection technique can be applied to MEMS designs fabricated in a variety of processes, freeing up more design space and enabling a MEMS design not limited by MEMS fabrication constraints. This combination of factors allows for a broader design space and thus the sense resonant frequency will not have to be closely matched to the drive resonant frequency. This separation of frequencies results in a device that is inherently more stable and easier to manufacture.

In addition to completing all of the proposed Phase I objectives, we designed vacuum windows, made significant progress on the mechanical design, fabricated the electron gun electrodes and circuit block, and conducted machining trials, and brazing experiments.  The successful Phase I results at 94 GHz along with Teraphysics' proven results at 95 and 650 GHz warrant further development of the 94 GHz TWT in a Phase II program.  If awarded, we will apply our relevant experience and the Phase I results to fabricate, assemble, and test a 94 GHz TWT.  The advantages of implementing high efficiency TWT amplifiers into NASA spacecraft compared to the current state of the art include lower system power requirements, reduced payload volume and reduced thermal management challenges.","The TWT is a vacuum device invented in the early 1940s for amplification of radio frequency (RF) power.  Because of their high power, broad bandwidth, compact size, reliability and high efficiency, vacuum electron devices are used in several NASA applications including high data rate communications, radar, spectroscopy and remote sensing. Vacuum devices have a long history in NASA applications and are chosen for their unsurpassed efficiency, reliability, and power at high frequencies.  They have been employed countless times by NASA in applications such as advanced cloud and precipitation radars, advanced SAR, radio science and telecommunications.  In the area of telecommunications, this amplifier could enable very high data rate communications for links between orbiting satellites; planetary spacecraft; planetary surfaces and orbiting spacecraft; and deep space and earth. This 94 GHz technology would also increase the volume of data transmitted for low earth orbiting spacecraft that are in view of a ground station only briefly.","Military applications include high data rate, network-centric communications and anti-jam and low detection warfare communications; airborne, ship borne, and ground-based radar; jamming; and decoy applications.  Commercial applications include satellite communications, radar, imaging, and materials processing.  Teraphysics has the capability to commercially exploit this technology, and it would have a wealth of commercial opportunity. The upper end of the mm wavelength band will be attractive to space commercial users because of the large amounts of contiguous spectrum that are available for broadband, high data rate, satellite and wireless terrestrial communications. This is also applicable at E-Band where larger bandwidth is commercially available as well as around 140 GHz where there is more spectrum and fewer competing allocations. The technology developed for the proposed 94 GHz TWT can readily be applied at E-Band or operation above 100 GHz. In fact, the same 94 GHz slow wave circuit proposed here can operate at E-Band simply by increasing the beam voltage.

SiC UV APDs implementation is challenging due to some material defects, relatively not-well modeled device operation, and very high absorption coefficients near 200nm wavelengths. The objective of this proposed work is to extend the state-of-the-art in UV sensors by: a) developing SiC deep UV detectors, and b) improving their responsivity down to near 200nm wavelengths. We plan to accomplish this goal by using the SiC UV APD design simulator developed in Phase I, and making further improvements as we introduce new design concepts to improve the responsivity utilizing novel design and fabrication techniques tof the critical n+ top contact layer on the APD to reduce charge recombination in the UV absorption layer.We will develop unique fabrication techniques to improve surface quality of the SiC APD structure. This effort will be led by Auburn University, which has developed state-of-the-art fabrication methodologies and capabilities for SiC MOSFETs, in collaboration with CoolCAD who will design the devices and the implantation process.Our main effort will focus on generating a built-in surface field by creating a steep doping profile right at the surface. Since steep dopant gradients necessary to create a field within 40nm of the surface are not feasible using epitaxial growth techniques for SiC, we will develop implantation and dopant activation sequences, and backend processing techniques to achieve this goal. By creating a field in the deep UV absorption layer (~40nm), we will reduce the initial recombination of electron-hole pairs created by the UV photons and increase current reaching the multiplication region of the APD.","Characteristics such as visible-blind operation and potentially 1E15 factor lower dark current than Silicon make SiC based detectors especially attractive for the many UV and EUV needs expressed in NASA's future missions. These programs include the Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM) for monitoring atmospheric ozone and related gasses as well as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission for monitoring aerosols, ozone, air pollution and coastal ecosystems. In addition, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-S) will require instruments to monitor UV from solar flares and the Sun's atmosphere, as well as the Sun's extreme UV radiation. According to the Heliophysics Roadmap of 2009, EUV Avalanche Photo detectors will be necessary for imaging very low intensity UV radiation in order to amplify extremely low photon flux UV signals. The low dark current of wide band-gap SiC APDs will help to realize low flux UV detectors, where detecting flux rates as low as six photons per second are being sought. SiC APD's will operate at relatively low voltages compared to PMTs. By utilizing solid state technology, wide bandgap based UV spectrometers will offer a lightweight and small volume instrument option for use in space vehicles.  In summary, SiC APDs will provide benefits to NASA for many years by expanding its imaging capabilities into the EUV regime with higher resolutions and enhanced signal-to-noise ratios.","Non-NASA commercial applications include UV spectrometry for the military, the semiconductor industry, as well as the food processing and healthcare industries where bacterial sterilization, identification, and classification, are important. A particular unique application that can take further advantage of the wide bandgap of SiC detectors, in addition to solar-blindness and low noise qualities, is their applicability to high temperature operation. High temperature applications can include monitoring of UV in rocket plumes and jet engines. Fires in jet engines are of safety concern to the U.S. Air Force and commercial airplane manufacturers. We plan to develop relationships with firms that develop and market sensors, such as Integrated Micro Sensors of Houston, Texas, in an effort to partner with them to license or market high temperature UV sensors that are a unique outcome of this R&D effort.

Solid-state silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are efficient, light, and reliable, but the front-illuminated designs demonstrated to date have poor UV response, limited sensitive area and optical fill-factor.To solve the above problems, a large-area, back-illuminated silicon photomultiplier (BaSiPM) array technology has been developed. The BaSiPM technology will integrate SiPM pixel arrays, fabricated on domestic, large volume commercial CMOS fab, with wafer-scale thinning. Short-wavelength light is absorbed near the surface of a silicon detector, and moving the optical entry surface to the back side of the wafer enhances UV response by ensuring that all photo-carriers are generated on the correct side of the junction for efficient avalanche multiplication. Placing the optical entry surface on the back of the wafer also improves the optical fill since it is no longer be necessary to shine light through the quench resistor network on the front surface of the detector. Lastly, back-thinning the detector wafer significantly reduces the mass per unit area of the focal plane array. Voxtel has successfully demonstrated the ability to perform wafer-scale back thinning fabrication for superior UV sensitivity. Three SiPM architectures (25 variations) have been characterized and studied in detail and their performance compared with commercially available SiPMs. The design of a large format focal plane design, including a mechanical model, mounting, and alignment will be developed using the proposed technology.","Orbiting Wide-angle Light-collectors (OWL): OWL is an Earth-orbiting system to study air showers initiated by >1E19 eV particles.Focal Plane for Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detection (RICH): RICH is a particle detector that can determine the velocity, v, of a charged particle.

On this program, Creare proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative cryocooler that produces refrigeration at temperatures of 30 to 70 K and rejects heat at a temperature of 150 to 210 K with extremely high efficiency.  The heat rejected can be absorbed by an upper stage cryocooler or rejected to space through a small cryo-radiator.  The overall mass of the cryocooler, cryo-radiator and electronics is nominally 6 kg, the area of the cryo-radiator is 0.8 m2 and the input power is significantly less than current state-of-the-art cryocoolers.  The electronics utilize parts that are tolerant to 300 kRad total ionizing dose.  In addition, the cryocooler technology is extremely reliable and scalable, and produces no perceptible vibration.  The key innovation is a cryogenic compressor which has heritage to the cryogenic circulator developed by Creare and operated on the Hubble Space Telescope for 6.5 years.  On the Phase I project, we optimized the cryocooler design for a particular mission class and predicted the performance of the cryocooler using a combination of analyses and component-level test data.  On the Phase II project, we will build and test a demonstration cryocooler and cryo-radiator.  The Phase II testing will be structured to achieve a TRL of at least 5, and will include cryogenic performance and launch vibration testing.","The successful completion of this program will provide mission planners with an extremely high performance, lightweight, and compact cryocooler that can meet requirements for a variety of missions.

Once at TRL 8 system is demonstrated at the end of Phase II, we will expand the number of dosimeter-equipped aircraft with the objective of global aviation radiation risk mitigation.

In this SBIR project, we proposed to build an airborne atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) profiler implementing a Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) technique.  This airborne instrument can also be used on the ground for measuring vertical HCHO profiles.  To our knowledge, there exists no previous formaldehyde remote sensor that can measure range resolved formaldehyde profile by any technique.  The instrument will be able to provide an HCHO profile from an aircraft flying at 20 km altitude to the ground at a 1 km range resolution, and achieve sensitivities better than 70 part-per-trillion-by-volume (pptv) concentration levels at a range of 1 km at nighttime with one second averaging time.  In addition, we will explore the feasibility of daytime operation achieving sensitivity of less than 1 part-per-billion-by-volume (ppbv) at a range of 3 km.  In Phase I we have built a breadboard formaldehyde profiler instrument and demonstrated the capability of performing highly sensitive nighttime formaldehyde measurements. The outcome of the Phase I work established the feasibility for high sensitivity detection of range resolved HCHO, and provides the design of the prototype sensor.","The HCHO profiler can be easily mounted on an aircraft or deployed ground based, which makes it a suitable candidate for a lot of currently active and future NASA missions.  HCHO is a primary measurement objective in two missions of the Decadal Survey (GEO-CAPE and GACM). The proposed sensor allows profiling of formaldehyde for Earth science research such as, climate science, environmental monitoring and commercial pollution compliance efforts. With minor adaptations such as using a UV laser at different wavelengths, the sensor can be used to measure fluorescence signal of other chemicals such as NO, NO x , NO2, and OH, etc.","Several government agencies including NASA, EPA, DoE and DoD have identified the need for instruments for formaldehyde detection.

These analyzers, which will exploit both conventional mid and near-infrared tunable diode laser spectrometry and LGR's patented Off-Axis ICOS technology, will be capable of meeting the stringent weight, power, and environmental requirements for UAS deployments. At the conclusion of the Phase II effort, LGR will deliver and deploy two complete systems. The first analyzer will make extremely rapid (> 20 Hz) airborne eddy flux covariance measurements of CO2 and H2O.  The second instrument will measure CO2 isotopes aboard SIERRA, allowing a better understanding of the chemistry, transport, and exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, anthropogenic sources, and natural carbon sinks and sources in the terrestrial biosphere. Airborne measurements enable regional-scale investigations of carbon sources and sinks as well as measurements where conventional tower flux deployments are infeasible.  These data will complement current satellite observations by providing higher horizontal resolution and vertical profiling, enabling better quantification of carbon sources and sinks.  Such deployments are critically important to NASA's Earth Science Division, because they enable more efficient and cost-effective Earth observations.","The NASA Earth Science Division is primarily concerned with studying how the global environment is changing and how such changes affect human civilization.  The majority of these observations involve using satellite data to make measurements of key atmospheric species on the planetary scale. Such observations are critical in quantifying the ozone cycle, greenhouse emissions, the hydrological cycle, and aerosol formation (and the resulting radiative forcing).  In order to verify and complement satellite data with better accuracy, faster time response, and higher spatial resolution, NASA seeks to develop innovative in situ sensors for these important gases.  Moreover, in an effort to make such deployments more numerous, efficient, and cost-effective, these analyzers need to be highly accurate and deployable on unmanned aerial systems (UASs) and other small aircraft.  The objective of this SBIR program is to develop and deliver atmospheric gas analyzers that are suitable for such platforms.","Besides its application to NASA, a compact, ultrasensitive gas analyzer also has significant commercial application.  Through a series of strategic partnerships, LGR is developing a suite of analytical sensors to measure trace gases for environmental research laboratories, industrial process control monitoring, and military applications.

No sample preparation is necessary. As an important component of the Raman/LIBS instrument in Phase I, we developed, built and tested a 1.5 cubic-inch, Q-switched, solid state laser fitted with commercial, off-the-shelf optical components.  The laser produced ~1 mJ, < 2 ns-duration pulses at 523-nm wavelength and was used to analyze a norite sample by means of Raman/LIBS techniques.  In Phase II we propose to further miniaturize and ruggedize the Phase I laser to a size of < 1 cubic inch. We will scale up the energy-per-pulse up to 2 mJ and test the laser in a wide range of environments such as vibration, vacuum and temperature. We will design and test the optics in a CHAMP instrument modified to accommodate the compact laser.

The laser we propose to develop is compact, efficient, rugged and reliable, making it ideal for planetary missions.","Commercial applications are in portable LIBS systems to replace the current bulky, inefficient lamp-pumped lasers. LIBS, besides having scientific applications, can also be used in industrial applications for process control through monitoring of exhaust streams, analysis of pharmaceuticals, profiling of metals, composition determinations of minerals in mining and detection of contamination in the environment.This laser architecture can be coupled to an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) instead of the SHG non-linear process and produce ~ 1 mJ, <10 ns pulses with a TEM00 mode and spectral output in the laser eyesafe regime around 1.5 microns.

These so-called vector vortex waveplates (VVW) are complex optical components wherein the optical axis orientation is azimuthally modulated in space at a high spatial frequency. In the Phase 1 of the project, we showed the feasibility of fabricating VVWs that would meet requirements for astronomy applications due to small singularity size, high topological charge, high contrast, and broadband functionality. The breakthrough polarization conversion and beam shaping technology of printing VVWs developed in the Phase 1 will undergo further fundamental improvements in the Phase 2 of the project along with further optimization of photoalignment materials and liquid crystal polymers to fabricate and deliver VVWs characterized by: subwavelength singularity sizes; spectrally broadband/achromatic functionality, particularly, for infrared wavelengths; stability to radiation and large temperature variations; and functionality at cryogenic temperatures.

The project outcomes include innovative advances in component design and fabrication and substantial progress in development of high-resolution deformable mirrors (DM) suitable for space-based operation. Space-based telescopes have become indispensible in advancing the frontiers of astrophysics. Over the past decade NASA has pioneered coronagraphic instrument concepts and test beds to provide a foundation for exploring feasibility of new approaches to high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. From this work, NASA has identified a current technology need for compact, ultra-precise, multi-thousand actuator DM devices. Boston Micromachines Corporation has developed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) DMs that represent the state-of-the-art for scalable, small-stroke high-precision wavefront control. The emerging class of high-resolution DMs pioneered by the project team has already been shown to be compact, low-power, precise, and repeatable. This project will develop a system that eliminates the leading cause of single actuator failures in electrostatically-actuated wavefront correctors – snap-through instability and subsequent electrode shorting and/or adhesion. To achieve this we will implement two innovative, complementary modifications to the manufacturing process that were proven successful in Phase I. We will develop a drive electronics approach that inherently limits actuator electrical current density generated when actuator snap-down occurs, and we will modify the actuator design to mitigate adhesion between contacting surfaces of the actuator flexure and fixed base electrode in the event of snap-down. This project will results in a MEMS DM with 2048 actuators and enhanced reliability driven by current-limiting drive electronics.","Space based astronomical imaging systems are inherently challenged by the need to achieve diffraction-limited performance with relatively lightweight optical components. Given the current constraints on fabrication methods, it is necessary to develop new methods of manufacture to increase reliability and prevent single actuator failures. These higher-quality deformable mirrors will enable diffraction-limited performance for many space-based optical systems such as space-based observatories, interferometric telescopes and coronagraphic instruments for programs such as EPIC, TPF-C, TPF-I and PECO. By providing wavefront control and correcting for static and thermally induced aberrations of larger optics in a space-based optical platform, the use of a space-qualified MEMS DM will result in a significant performance improvement. Producing a more reliable and robust MEMS DM will also have a significant benefit for non-space-based optical instruments. BMC has had success developing arrays up to 4096 elements for the Gemini Planet Imager and with further research can achieve fewer actuator failures during the manufacturing process and better reliability during use.","Reliable, small stroke, high precision deformable mirrors and associated drive electronics have a few commercial applications. The following applications apply to all Boston Micromachines mirrors that benefit from new manufacturing processes developed which increase reliability.Space surveillance: BMC has success developing arrays up to 4096 elements for astronomy which can be used for space-based systems. These programs are funded by Department of Defense administrations with classified agendas. Optical communication: Lasercomm systems would benefit from this new architecture for long-range secure communication.Microscopy: The capabilities of non-adaptive optics-enabled Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) and Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy(SLO) devices have reached their limits. By increasing reliability, users will be able to utilize high-resolution equipment for use in detecting disease in uncontrolled environments. Other modalities affected include two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) and coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS).Pulse-Shaping: Laser science strives to create a better shaped pulse for applications such as laser marking and machining, and material ablation and characterization.

Currently, a large portion of the mirror stroke must be used to flatten the MEMS DMs. In the case of the large-stroke segmented MEMS DMs manufactured by Iris AO, there is sufficient stroke for wavefront correction after flattening. However, the resolution is significantly reduced because the dynamic range of the digital-to-analog converters (DAC) used to operate the DM is spread over multiple microns of stroke rather than the 0.5 micron range required for a coronagraph. This Phase I SBIR will make substantial improvements in the fabrication process of MEMS segmented DMs that reduce the deleterious residual surface-figure errors. It will do so by systematically addressing the sources of the segment position variations as well as addressing low-spatial frequency chip bow that can result in large peak-to-valley deformations across the DM array. The Iris AO DM architecture will also be modified to enable picometer resolution actuation with ultra-precision drive electronics.","The DM architecture developed here is a perfect match for visible nulling coronagraphs (VNC) that were studied for ATLAST, DAViNCI, and EPIC. In addition to the VNC, Iris AO technology can be a key enabling component in a host of future NASA missions that include Space Astronomy Far Infrared Telescope (SAFIR) Life Finder, and Planet Imager. Other potential programs such as Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) and ultraviolet telescopes will also require adaptive optics. Finally, ground based telescopes, like the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), Keck, and Gemini North & South, require adaptive optics to remove aberrations caused by air turbulence.","In addition to NASA systems, the proposed adaptive-optics technology would find immediate application in several military communications and imaging products. Air Force and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) both are interested in satellite AO. Systems used in military surveillance such as in the Predator drone and Global Hawk would benefit from the high-resolution, light weight, and low power consumption afforded by Iris AO's MEMS. Military contractors have also shown significant interest in using Iris AO technology for long range imaging through turbulent air. The thick mirror segments can be coated with dielectric coatings and are thus useful for laser-guidestar uplink corrections and beam shaping for laser machining. The DMs can also be used to correct horizontal-path aberrations for free-space laser communication links and reconnaissance.

The thruster consists of nine porous-surface emitters operating in parallel from a common propellant supply.  Each emitter is capable of supporting over 70,000 electrospray emission sites, with the plume from each emitter being accelerated through a single aperture, eliminating the need for individual emission site alignment to an extraction grid.  The total number of emission sites during operation is expected to approach 700,000.Phase II results will focus on optimization and characterization of the thruster fabricated during the Phase I effort, as well as fabrication of additional porous emitters for full-scale testing.  Propellant will be supplied to the thruster via existing feedsystem and micro-valve technology previously developed by Busek, under the NASA ST7-DRS mission, and follow-on electric propulsion programs.  Methods for extending thruster life beyond the previously demonstrated 450 hours, will be investigated and include potential alternate emitter materials selection, and bi-polar thruster operation.  The life extending capabilities will be demonstrated on a sub-scale version of the thruster developed.","Primary NASA applications include missions requiring exceptional thrust/power in power-limited missions, and missions benefiting from variable specific impulse (200-2000+seconds) and variable thrust (10x throttling).  In many cases, the proposed colloid thruster may prove superior to most other electric propulsion technologies in nearly all metrics for power levels <200 Watts (where thruster efficiency has greater impact on total system efficiency).","The primary non-NASA application for the proposed thruster is to support development of colloid-based multi-mode propulsion using green monopropellants, where there is a lack of suitable thrusters at the milliNewton level or greater.  This allows a spacecraft to utilize shared propellant tanks for high thrust chemical propulsion as well as high Isp electric propulsion, and is particularly attractive for small spacecraft with limited mass and volume for multiple propellant tanks.  Additional applications include replacement of some of the lower thrust plasma-based electric propulsion devices, which suffer from decreased efficiency at low power due to unfavorable surface-to-volume scaling.  The variable Isp capabilities and higher thrust levels provide a useful multimode solution for spacecraft requiring both dwell/stationkeeping as well as rapid maneuvers from a single propulsion system.",Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Spacecraft Main Engine

To withstand the high loads during terrestrial launch, rhenium chambers with improved mechanical properties are needed.  Recent EL-FormTM results have shown considerable promise for improving the mechanical properties of rhenium by producing a multi-layered deposit comprised of a tailored microstructure, i.e., Engineered Re. During Phase I, an AMBR size chamber was produced to demonstrate formation of the Engineered Re material in both the throat and barrel regions.  Tensile tests showed the Engineered Re  material had a yield strength greater than 40ksi at room temperature.  In addition, Engineered Re deposits were produced on multiple mandrels at one time, i.e., multi-component process demonstration.  During Phase II, the Engineered Re processing techniques will be optimized. Detailed characterization and mechanical properties test will be performed.  Optimization of the multi-component fabrication technique will result in a 30% or higher reduction in chamber fabrication costs.  The most promising techniques will be selected and used to produce an Engineered Re AMBR size combustion chamber for testing at Aerojet.","Targeted NASA applications are the ascent/descent engines and reaction control systems for missions such as the Mars Sample Return and Orion MPCV.

To better plan this mission and create a robust optimized balloon design, NASA requires the ability to more accurately evaluate the convective heat transfer characteristics of the balloon operating in Titan's atmosphere.  Based on limitations of previous efforts, NASA has requested proposals for a testbed to support CFD validation.  Leveraging the results of the Phase I effort, Near Space Corporation (NSC), proposes to develop and operate two full scale Testbeds (~9 m diameter) in order to help validate CFD models for the TSSM Titan Montgolfiere balloon.  The Testbeds will incorporate new envelope design innovations and state-of-the-art data acquisition methods to enable data intensive tethered and free-flight tests.  Utilizing its unique balloon facility located in a large blimp hangar, NSC will conduct iterative tethered hangar tests of the full scale Testbeds (which is not possible in existing cryogenic test chambers). These flights will enable better IR imaging and flow characterization measurements.  The acquired data will provide critical input to incrementally improve and validate the CFD models.  The outdoor drop/inflation test and a free flight test will retire technology risks associated with the future Titan mission in addition to generating the validation data necessary to improve the existing CFD models.  NSC proposes to develop and operate a mature TMTT system during Phase II, generate pertinent data that will be used to improve the CFD models, and leverage the effort to create valuable technology with both NASA and non-NASA commercial applications.","Technologies developed during this SBIR effort could be used for several NASA applications, including planetary exploration missions, inflatable space habitats, and scientific terrestrial balloons.  The primary target market for the Titan Montgolfiere Terrestrial Testbed is the Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM), including preparatory research projects, as well as the actual mission.  NASA JPL's efforts to develop a Montgolfiere balloon for Mars could benefit from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models validated with data generated by a similar Terrestrial Testbed.  The capabilities developed during this SBIR could also be used to embed sensors directly into inflatable space habitats and use IR imaging to monitor performance.  Another potential application would be to embed temperature sensors into scientific terrestrial balloons and use IR imaging in order to better understand the performance, and help optimize innovative balloon concepts and designs.  NSC intends to provide services based on the technical capability developed during this effort.  In all, these technologies will enable a variety of promising products and services relevant to NASA and its mission.","Several non-NASA applications could be targeted with the technologies developed during this effort, including the monitoring of commercial inflatable space stations and lighter-than-air vehicles.  At least one private commercial space technology company seeks to place inflatable space stations in low earth orbit in the next decade, and could benefit from the technologies developed through this SBIR.  These technologies could also be used to monitor the performance and integrity of airship and aerostat hulls, which are increasingly used by the US Military for low-cost situational awareness in combat zones.  To ensure that this new technology is used for commercial applications, NSC will leverage the technical capabilities developed during this effort to provide accessible services to non-NASA customers.","Airship/Lighter-than-Air Craft; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Contact/Mechanical; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Fluids; Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Infrared; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Passive Systems; Prototyping; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Support; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Thermal; Thermal Imaging (see also Testing & Evaluation); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

During the Phase I effort an uncalibrated brassboard system was built and flight tested using a manned biplane. The brassboard system comprised an experimental single-channel (L1-only) software GPS receiver, and a 720 deg/hr inertial measurement unit (IMU) costing only $1k. The performance of the brassboard system was comparable to that of a $42k precision reference system that comprised a dual-channel (L1 and L2) GPS receiver and antenna, and a tactical-grade (1 deg/hr) IMU ($24k). This tactical-grade performance was achieved by fusing low-cost inertial measurements with attitude and position measurements from a GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensor. The Miniature Integrated Direction-finding Attitude-determining Anti-jam System (MIDAAS(TM)) obtains position, velocity, attitude, and time (PVAT) measurements directly from GPS signals and employs an innovative small single-aperture antenna to compute full 3-D attitude (roll, pitch and yaw) using only two RF channels, leading to a smaller, simpler, lower-cost GPS/A receiver system. During the Phase II program, a form-fit-function prototype system will be designed, built, and flight tested in an operational environment. The prototype performance will be compared with that of a higher-accuracy, more expensive attitude reference system.","Integrating MIDAAS with a commercial-grade IMU will provide tactical-grade navigation accuracies at a low-cost, which in turn will enable science payload instrument stability and highly accurate pointing accuracy for NASA's manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This low-power novel navigation system will satisfy the size, weight and power (SWAP) constraints of most civilian and military small-scale remotely operated vehicles and unmanned systems. Furthermore, the improved attitude accuracy of the navigation system will enable precision flight control for repeatable terrain monitoring. The GPS/A technology is also applicable to spin-stabilized platforms such as sounding rockets and space launch vehicles. Furthermore, a unique ultra-tightly coupled (UTC) anti-jam (AJ) GPS navigation architecture makes the system inherently more robust to interference and significantly improves the attitude estimate, thereby improving the probability of successfully completing a mission even in the presence of unintentional and intentional interference.","The MIDAAS GPS-based attitude (GPS/A) sensor technology and inertial navigation system (INS) is applicable to a wide range of military and civilian applications including manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), micro air vehicles (MAVs), unattended ground sensors (UGS), handheld positioning units, recreational/virtual reality orienting devices, radio-controlled (RC) vehicles, ground vehicles, and far-target locators (FTL). The technology appeals to customers who desire robust position and attitude measurements for platforms that have stringent cost and size, weight and power (C-SWAP) constraints.

The PowerCube concept integrates three innovative component technologies to provide these capabilities:  First, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water-electrolysis fuel cell supplies gH2/gO2 to a simple pressure-fed thruster to provide 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water. This approach enables the CubeSat to launch with 'inert' propellant to comply with P-POD limitations on stored energy and then process the water on-orbit into high-Isp fuel. Second, a deployable solar array that stows along the long sides of the CubeSat and deploys in a 'windmill' configuration provides up to 96 W peak. Third, a 3DOF 'carpal-wrist' gimbal, in conjunction with magnetic torque coils, enables sun-tracking of the solar panel, vectoring of the thruster, and precision pointing of payloads. The combination of ample power and water electrolysis will provide up to 6 m/s of delta-V per 90 minute orbit for a 3U CubeSat. Compared to other CubeSat propulsion technologies, the PowerCube thruster will enable more rapid orbital maneuvering and significantly lower contamination issues.  Our Phase I effort developed a detailed baseline design for the PowerCube, and built and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the water-electrolysis thruster.  The Phase II effort will mature the electrolysis thruster component to the engineering model level, develop and simulate methods for attitude control and precise pointing of both panels and payloads using the gimbal and torque coils, and develop a detailed design for the entire PowerCube module to enable flight validation in follow-on Phase III efforts.","The PowerCube system can serve as a complete bus for small satellites, for applications ranging from rapid-response Earth-sensing to orbital debris remediation (development of such systems is underway at TUI). Allocating a larger portion of the CubeSat mass to fuel would enable PowerCube to be used for CubeSat missions to the moon. Cost-effective inspection of in-orbit resources is possible, from the space station to orbiting satellites. Lastly, the PowerCube could serve as a low-cost technology test platform, providing a testbed that can deliver propulsion, attitude control, and power to experiments or technical demonstrations.","The PowerCube system makes the CubeSat platform significantly more capable and able to serve a broader range of missions. This includes industry, military, and university customers. For industry, the PowerCube system provides an inexpensive platform for Earth sensing with  orbit-adjustment capabilities and full attitude control, as well as ample power for communication and instrumentation. As a rapid-response platform for military applications, the PowerCube can provide a low-cost solution for deployment of Earth-sensing or communications capabilities to a specific theater. The thruster and fuel-cell systems are modular and can be split from the remainder of the PowerCube system and marketed as a stand-alone propulsion unit capable of providing 300 Ns of impulse per 100 mL of water and an estimated Δv of 6 m/s each orbit, significantly greater than electric propulsion thrusters at this scale.

This is a challenging problem, since quantities of interest typically can not be directly measured but instead must be inferred. These inferences are made by solving inverse problems, where complex forward models are inverted to estimate parameters of the model. These parameters correspond to physical properties of the environment. Because of the complexity of many forward models, inversion is usually accomplished by minimizing the difference between observations and model predictions through adjustment of model parameters. This minimization process is computationally demanding, since it requires evaluating the forward model many times and minimizing a function of many variables.In this project, we propose to develop, using low-cost high performance hardware accelerators, a fast general-purpose parameter fitting software tool suite for fitting model parameters to observed data. The tool suite will allow NASA scientists to use state of the art high performance computing resources to speed their work. In the Phase I of this project we have shown that the three key components of model fitting, namely model evaluation, gradient calculation and cost functional minimization, can be accelerated using graphical processing unit (GPU) technology. The Phase I work has laid the foundation for Phase II of the project, where the components investigated and developed will be integrated into a parameter fitting tool suite. During Phase II, we will work closely with NASA scientists from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and other missions to develop further capabilities of the tool suite.","Because of the widespread use of optimization techniques in parameter estimation, the software developed in this project will be used extensively by NASA scientists working on present and future missions. Moreover, with the increasing amounts of data to be processed, hardware accelerated optimization software will provide a valuable, time-saving tool to NASA scientists. Missions that will directly benefit from the proposed software are SAGE III, SDO and Glory, to name a few.","Parameter fitting is a general capability used across many disciplines.

NASA has a need for equipment to generate, handle and store hydrogen. In terms of handling hydrogen, conventional rotating mechanical pumps and compressors require extensive modification and have limited reliability. Electrochemical pumping and compression of hydrogen occurs without any moving parts and is highly reliable and efficient. Sustainable Innovations has demonstrated up to 6,000 psi of compression using electrochemical cell hardware. However, for high flow applications, such as a 6 CFM hydrogen pump for NASA, a departure from traditional electrochemical cell hardware designs is needed. Our work in Phase I demonstrated an Expandable Modular Architecture cell design, that allows a large footprint for the electrochemical stack. This is achieved using modular cell parts to create large active area cells. The modular parts are inexpensive to manufacture and can achieve the high tolerances need for large active area cells. The proposed Phase II activity will leverage the key developments in Phase I and demonstate the scalability of this device for critical NASA and commercial applications.  This will include increasing the active area/capacity of the electrochemical cell stack by a factor of 5, and to increase pressure capability from 200 psi to 750 psi.  The resultant unit will be utilized to actuate pneumatic tools that could be used in space.","An Electrochemical Hydrogen Pump & Compressor (EHPC) using an EMA cell design is applicable to several NASA applications. For extraterrestrial in situ resource utilization the EHPC will be able to handle the flow rates, 6 CFM, needed to recirculate hydrogen and facilitate pneumatic transport. Terrestrial NASA applications include capturing, purifying and compressing purge gas for various experimental rocket test stands. In extraterrestrial applications it is envisaged that the EHPC variable footprint will allow construction to conform to geometric constraints of a spacecraft. In addition, the simplicity of the systems balance-of-plant, a regulated power source, and the proven high reliability of electrochemical based devices means that redundant units may not be needed. The EHPC technology would add a key tool to NASA ability to move and store hydrogen efficiently and safely in extraterrestrial environments. A large amount of hydrogen used during testing of rocket engines and other space systems is wasted due to cryogenic boil-off loses and pre-test purging. The ability to efficiently capture, purify and compress this hydrogen for reuse, relies on handling large flow rates. Very large cell active areas are needed to meet this need. The EMA cell design facilitates the building of a large scale EHPC to recycle hydrogen. This will be economically beneficial to NASA while lowering the carbon footprint of NASA testing.","The emergence of hydrogen based economy will necessitate the ability to pump and compress large amount of hydrogen. A range of EHPC products with an EMA cell design will facilitate a hydrogen economy by delivering hydrogen to fueling stations and providing the compression for vehicular refueling. Assuming the adoption of a pipeline hydrogen based infrastructure, there is a need to pump the hydrogen along the pipeline to the fueling stations. A medium to large size fueling station would require 300 lbs per day of hydrogen, which at 500 psi is 1,730 cf. A 30 CFM EHPC system, would allow a fueling station to store a day's worth of fuel in 2 hours. Hydrogen powered vehicles require hydrogen at 6,000 10,000 psi to facilitate efficient volumetric storage. Sustainable Innovations' cell hardware has already demonstrated a Compression Ratio (CR) of over 400, which is significant greater the then CR of 20 needed to compress hydrogen from 500 psi to 10,000 psi. Therefore a EHPC system with a EMA cell design and a large flow rate capacity would be a invaluable tool in the developemnt of a hydrogen based economy.","Actuators & Motors; Conversion; Distribution/Management; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fluids; Fuels/Propellants; Generation; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Launch Engine/Booster; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Material Handing & Packaging; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Processing Methods; Remediation/Purification; Resource Extraction; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine; Storage; Surface Propulsion; Tools/EVA Tools; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

Future NASA missions will require hydrogen liquefaction systems for spaceport, planetary, and lunar surface operations.  A critical part of these systems is the cryogenic expansion turbines, which must be designed for high-speed operation and long life, and must be robust against the pressure and momentum excursions and the surface tension effects associated with two-phase flow.  On the Phase I project, we identified and optimized a liquefaction system for spaceport operations.  We demonstrated by analysis the benefits of using expansion turbines in the product stream instead of the customary Joule-Thomson throttle.  We designed a set of high-performance turbines for use in these systems.  On this Phase II project, we will demonstrate cryogenic expansion turbines for use in hydrogen liquefiers.  The expansion turbines will be reliable, compact, lightweight, and efficient and will be able to operate in a two-phase system.  They will have the innovative feature of recovering the expansion work through use of an alternator instead of dissipating work through a brake wheel.  This approach greatly simplifies controls, improves reliability, and reduces system mass and input power.","The result of this Phase II project will be the demonstration of expansion turbines for small- to medium scale hydrogen liquefiers.  These expansion turbines provide between 1.4 kW of refrigeration at nominally 80 K to 0.5 kW of refrigeration at 20 K.  The turbines will be suitable for liquefiers for spaceport, planetary, and lunar surface operations.  The turbines may also be used in high-capacity cryocoolers for cooling high temperature superconducting motors, generators, and transmission lines.  These cryocoolers are needed for advanced superconducting electric aircraft being developed by NASA.","The commercial potential of an advanced turboalternator are significant and include cooling for laboratory- and industrial-scale gas separation, liquefaction, storage, and transportation systems; high temperature superconducting motors, generators, transmission lines, and magnetic resonance imaging systems; liquid hydrogen fuel cell storage for the automotive industry; and commercial orbital transfer vehicles and satellites.",Cryogenic/Fluid Systems

The transducer will be capable of measuring backscatter, attenuation, reflectivity and other ultrasound parameters of bone in the spine or hip that have been correlated with physiological bone density, structure and porosity through systems that provide high fidelity but are not space-capable.  The Phase I program showed that a compact ultrasound transducer with more than 4 octave bandwidth could be produced using the special properties of single crystal piezoelectrics and special processing techniques, a bandwidth 175% larger than that of conventional transducers.  The Phase II program will extend the capabilities of the Phase I transducer by providing more sensitivity, and optimizing the frequency content relative to the acoustic field.  Additionally, TRS will team with Stony Brook University to further analyze the relationship between the bone structure and ultrasound parameters towards eventual use in space.  TRS will deliver a robust, wideband transducer that can be integrated with NASA components at the end of the program.","With the potential as a low-cost system, the ultrasound method could be implemented as a series of units for astronauts both in space and before or after returning. The applications of the material and methods can also be integrated into other areas, such as evaluation of materials (non-destructive evaluation) while on the job. The cryogenic performance advantages of single crystal have been shown in adaptive optics applications, showing that this could be a very adaptable technology.","There is potential for the ultrasound system to be used as a low-cost diagnostic tool in the medical setting, particularly in areas where the larger, more costly imaging tools such as CT and MRI are not available.

Real-time monitoring of this data in nuclear thermal engines would greatly improve operational safety and performance, reduce operational costs, and significantly impact maintenance costs and reliability. Even though some extreme environment sensors become available recently, it is still impossible to directly and accurately measure the critical operational parameters of NTP engines due to the lack of extreme environment electronics for those sensors. Data from extreme environment sensors is delivered via wire-line to an external actively cooled electronics box, where it is processed. This approach presents significant drawbacks such as the need for complex shielded wiring harnesses that not only are heavy but also limit sensor location and signal quality (i.e., signal to noise ratio).  Additionally, these systems suffer from reliability issues due to wiring connections.

We will adapt our existing reservoir cathode technology to this purpose.  Reservoir cathodes are the only emission sources that are capable of supplying the necessary current density (>5.0 A/cm2) and life (>100,000 hours) for next generation high-power thrusters.  More powerful thrusters are needed for interplanetary and lunar missions, as well as earth escape and near-earth space maneuvers.  Reservoir cathodes are able to sustain high rates of barium diffusion to the cathode surface to overcome the high rate of barium removal in ion engines. The key Phase I innovation was flexible supports for the cathode matrix.  This prevented the matrix fractures and reservoir leaks of previous reservoir cathodes for ion engines.  Cathode operation and stability was verified.  In Phase II,the design is refined and tested in actual ion engines. The key challenge is the stresses exerted on the cathode tube and reservoir due to differential expansion and large temperature excursions.  These originate from the outside heater and also from heating due to collisions with the cathode.  These stresses can lead to fractures and weld failure.  Our innovation solves this problem.  This was proven on the Phase I device.In Phase II we further test and optimize the Phase I device and perform life testing on it.  We build cathode assemblies for insertion into ion engines which we test in an ion environment at e beam, JPL and Colorado State University.  Their maximum specific impulse will be measured.","Mars and lunar cargo missions, and the upcoming Juno mission to Jupiter.  Also, piloted interplanetary missions become feasible with sufficient cathode output and life.  Earth transfer, stationkeeping and earth escape would occur at less cost, size and mass.  Improved conventional reservoir cathodes, following from this effort, are needed in linear beam amplifiers to increase data rates in space communications.  Output power, life, bandwidth, and frequency will all improve with better cathodes.

Paragon Space Development Corporation¿ (Paragon) proposes to continue our investigation into the use of microporous-ionomer membrane technology to improve the robustness and effectiveness and simplify water recovery processes for space applications.  Improved robustness and effectiveness will be evident through (1) reduced loading on the downstream post processor due to the ionomer¿s unique property of selective permeability, (2) near complete removal of water from wastewater, and (3) inclusion of a backup barrier between the retentate and permeate.  The technology offers simplification over existing technology through (1) a lower dependency on moving parts, and (2) integrated capture of wastewater solutes for disposal.  Phase 1 testing showed that 99% of the contaminants in concentrated pretreated urine ersatz were removed by the proposed technology and virtually complete dewatering of the brine was achieved in a configuration that would appear to be insensitive to gravity and orientation.  As the technology is fully developed, it can be inserted into existing and/or developing water recovery system architectures to increase water recovery rates beyond that currently available to date.  The application of this technology for spacecraft water reclamation will be referenced as IWP (Ionomer-membrane Water Processor).","Contemplated long-duration missions to the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, and Mars will be mass-constrained. The successful development and application of ionomer-microporous membrane pair technology  to spacecraft water processing will lead to improvements in the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of these systems. These improvements will in turn translate directly into safety improvements and mass reductions..","The non-NASA applications are significant as fresh water demands are becoming a serious problem at various regions of the planet.

Using an automatic side-stream sampling technique, this compact, electrochemical sensor will use small volumes of water and detect metals in the low parts-per-billion range. The novel coupling of a high-performance novel electrode material, microarray electrode geometry, and a highly sensitive sensing algorithm allows for a sensor with low detection limits and excellent specificity. Additionally, the sensor will show long-term repeatability and reliability, while requiring minimal maintenance or user calibration time. The sensor and its components have been engineered to function in a microgravity environment and for easy integration with the Water Recovery System. Giner will partner Johnson Space Center to ensure the ability of the sensor to detect trace metals in a range of reclaimed water samples and determine the appropriate concentrations. This sensor will detect trace heavy metals in water in near real-time, allowing for timely response and resolution to water contamination problems.","International Space Station Water Recovery SystemThe Water Recovery System (WRS) aboard the International Space Station reclaims water from several sources, including humidity condensate, urine, and hygiene water. Extensive filtration and processing allow its reuse as drinking and wash water. However, incomplete water processing, resin failure, or leaching from metal coatings could lead to unsafe levels of metals in the crew drinking water. Trace toxic metals such as Cd, Ni, Ag, Zn, and Mn have been found in water samples from various expeditions at potentially dangerous concentrations and pose a significant threat to the crew. While Cd, Mn, Ni, and Zn are contaminants leached from the zinc coatings and stainless steel in the spacecraft water distribution lines and the humidity heat exchangers, Ag is added as a residual biocide to processed water. NASA has expressed a need to include measurement technologies to assure that the trace heavy toxic metal content of the water falls within acceptable limits and that the WRS and storage system are functioning properly for long-duration missions. A real-time sensor would allow the crew to quickly diagnose and resolve the metal contamination problems, thus protecting the health of the crew.","Portable sensor for the determination of heavy metals in drinking water: Contamination of drinking water with various heavy metals is a world-wide problem. Successful development of a compact sensor for trace toxic metals in water would open the door to portable water analysis and water quality monitoring. Current techniques require the shipment of the sample back to a laboratory, which is cost-prohibitive and time consuming. This portable sensor would allow more frequent and more extensive water quality monitoring, which would lead to increased safety of drinking water worldwide and assurance that the metal contents of the water falls within acceptable limits for drinking water.Portable sensor for the determination of heavy metals in surface water, groundwater, and river water: Another potential application of this sensor is for the detection of heavy metals in environmental waters, where high heavy metal content can negatively affect various aspects of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Data Processing; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics)"

This firm's unique, patented variable-emittance skin technology, based on conducting polymers, microporous membranes and ionic liquids, with proven, space-environment performance, remains at the world forefront, with highest known Delta-emittance, good Turn-Down Ratio (TDR), very low power, low cost. Phase I work demonstrated separate emittance variation from 0.065 to 0.816,  Delta-emittance > 0.48, and long-term space durability, with one ""breakthrough"" innovation, two  very significant innovations. A clear, specific pathway was demonstrated for combining low/high emittance in single devices to achieve TDR of 7.1, possibly 10.0. Phase II work will use this as basis to increase the TDR to > 7.1, possibly > 10.0, keeping the dark-state emittance ca. >/= 0.80.  Surface Solar Absorptance will be further reduced from present ca. 0.31 to as low as possible (objective 0.09 to 0.24).

Current activity is focused on extending mission times without increasing the size and weight of the portable life support system (PLSS).  Although CO2 sorbents that can be regenerated during EVA are being studied, these system add ""on back"" hardware, increasing weight and complexity, and reducing reliability.  A simpler approach is to use a membrane system to separate CO2 and H2O from the O2 environment, however separating CO2 from O2 is difficult with standard membranes.  However, developing a low pressure liquid sorbent that reversibly absorbs CO2, could facilitate the needed separation. In the Phase I project, Reaction Systems synthesized new CO2 low vapor pressure sorbents that had good reversible CO2 absorption capacity and demonstrated high selectivity for CO2 over O2 in a supported liquid membrane tests. Therefore we demonstrated the feasibility of employing a supported liquid membrane to control CO2 in EVA.  In Phase II we will improve the performance by increasing the sorbent loading, reducing its viscosity, and optimizing the membrane support.  We will then design and construct a prototype, that is sized to control the metabolic CO2 generation of a single crew member.","The most immediate application of the technology being proposed herein is the control of CO2 levels in the space suits of astronauts during EVA.  This is a critical need as NASA mission objectives include extending the duration of EVA missions and the use of membrane technology has many important advantages over the regenerable sorbents and systems that are being developed currently.  In addition, with only slight modification, the technology could be applied to CO2 control in spacecraft and on the surface of Mars.","In addition to the wide spread use for NASA applications, identifying effective means to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion is an area that is receiving much attention.  The wide spread use of fossil fuels has caused a substantial rise in the concentration of atmospheric CO2, a recognized green house gas and further increases in atmospheric CO2 are not desirable.  Thus, there currently is a great deal of interest in the development of methods to sequester CO2 from combustion processes.  Other commercial applications would include the control of CO2 in underwater vehicles and other enclosed spaces and the development of rebreathers for SCUBA gear.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients)"

These secondary structures must increase utilization of the primary pressurized volumes by accommodating hardware, experiments, storage space, and cable routing.  The expandable structures must use minimal launch mass and volume, be easy to install, and maximize operational volume and structural performance in a crewed or material transfer pressure vessel. Utilizing unique materials and innovative mechanical designs, CTD has created a new class of deployable structures for increasing the utility of inflatable habitats. These new concepts are referred to as Composite Rollable Extendible Slit-Tube Structures, or CRESTS. CRESTS can provide room divisions or load bearing floors and provide mounting for racks, storage and cabling. CRESTS are stowed by rolling slit-tube beams, lateral support battens, and floor or wall surfaces into a single compact tube. CRESTS have been designed for linearly expanding lunar modules and for toroidal inflatable orbital habitats. CRESTS are elastically strained deployable composites that provide a positive deployment force and an inherent geometric lock-out to occur once the deployment is complete.  This technology can address the challenges within this application of being lightweight, yet rigid.","The intent of this technology development is to provide NASA with a means for enhancing the utility of inflatable habitats for future space exploration. The first direction that extended space exploration will take us is still undefined, but it is becoming more evident that expandable structures can greatly increase the crew living environment where ever we go. CTD will be ready and is advancing the technology TRL of secondary structures appropriate for expandable habitats for both surface and zero-g exploration. With the goals set by NASA to support the manned exploration of other planets, the development of innovative structure technologies that will advance expandable exploration space modules and surface based habitats is a necessity.  The proposed deployable technology will make significant progress toward this end by providing a low-cost, mass-minimized deployable structure that can be used to maximize operational volume and structural performance of a crewed or material transfer pressure vessel.","The most immediate Non-NASA application for this technology is to work with companies developing low earth orbit commercial habitats and help advance their product lines. Full-scale demonstrations of working hardware that will greatly increase the utility of their type of habitat will be essential to attract commercial investment. This technology is protected by patent and by unique materials and engineering for extremely thin composites, making collaboration efforts the best possibility for product advancement. However, licensing of technology can also be considered to allow commercial entities to have a higher degree of design control.In addition, all forward progress with stiffer laminates, more complex geometries, integration techniques and deployment methodologies are applicable across all of CTD's rolled structure programs.

Our success in Phase 1 showed that it is possible for subject matter experts (SMEs) to author ISS model information to produce a consistent model useful for planning, scheduling and procedure execution.  In this Phase 2 proposal we aim to fully develop the authoring and data integration portions of our design and to integrate the resulting models with our interactive planning aid for flight controllers.  The benefits for NASA operations are that the resulting modeling framework will 1) make available a consistent domain model that need not be reproduced for each automation project, unify the often disparate sources of EVA and Core Systems information, provide for rapid update of ISS configuration information, thus allowing automation applications to provide results based on the most recent data, provide a consistent view of the domain so as to minimize error in authoring procedural data.","Procedures are at the core of all NASA missions, especially human space missions.  Mission planning is also at the core of all space missions due to the high cost of space assets such as astronauts, equipment and communication links.

IonoGlide lubricants offer low-temperature performance with limited off-gassing and high decomposition temperatures. ISL's approach is to introduce proprietary additives to the ionic liquid matrix to impart thermal stability and enhance lubricity. This depresses the apparent freezing point while maintaining high decomposition temperatures. Through electrostatic interactions, the proprietary additive and ionic liquid form an order. With near metallic surfaces, this quasi-ordering contribute to improved lubricity. Phase I testing shows that ISL's lubricant outperforms top commercially available lubricants. ISL will work with a major NASA contractor to test lubrication efficiency under simulated field conditions. IonoGlide lubricants are envisioned for use primarily in metallic ball-bearing conditions at low pressures.","In collaboration with its industrial partners, ISL will continue to develop IonoGlide lubricants for NASA-specific applications ranging from Mars rovers to use in robotic arms for extravehicular missions. A potential operational limitation of remote robotic systems is lubrication failure at low temperature. IonoGlide lubricants promise continuing mission-critical performance in the harsh Martian environment.

For the vehicle and equipment market, synthetic engine oils along with hydraulic and transmission fluids will drive an expected $4 billion in demand by 2013. According to the same report, the market for heat transfer fluids increased 6.8% between 2003 and 2008 to a value of $1.3 billion. This is the niche within which NASA applications fall. Heat transfer fluids are used in antifreeze, energy production, asphalt, laun¿dry, biotechnology, metalworking, mining, process manufacturing, and refrigeration and heating systems. In the commercial arena, variants of IonoGlide will find uses in aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, synthesis, engineering fluids, and marine sectors.","Active Systems; Actuators & Motors; Airship/Lighter-than-Air Craft; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Coatings/Surface Treatments; Command & Control; Composites; Contact/Mechanical; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Development Environments; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fasteners/Decouplers; Fluids; Inertial; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Knowledge Management; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Man-Machine Interaction; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Material Handing & Packaging; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Mission Training; Operating Systems; Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Passive Systems; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Space Transportation & Safety; Structures; Support; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Teleoperation; Tools/EVA Tools; Training Concepts & Architectures; Transport/Traffic Control; Tribology; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

Unfortunately, conventional technology developed over this time period has required a complex balance of plant that adds to the overall weight of the system package. Research in the past two decades resulted in the creation of systems that minimized balance of plant components, but had significant current density and efficiency limitations, limiting their use. This SBIR program builds upon recent success in the development of a high-pressure electrochemical cell architecture and inserts novel water management technology to generate a passive liquid feed electrolyzer capable of operating at 2,000 psi - and scalable to higher pressures. If successful, implementation of this new technology can save substantially on system weight with a high system operational efficiency and enhanced current density capability.","The successful development of an advanced passive liquid feed electrolyzer capable of operation at high pressure will be instrumental in supporting energy storage requirements for many NASA space missions. In particular, the ability to efficiently generate hydrogen and oxygen at high pressure allows the creation of high energy density systems for long-term space travel, Lunar and Mars bases. In addition, oxygen produced at high pressure can be used to meet space life support needs, including recharge of the EMU. Furthermore, successful development of high pressure cell technology can be instrumental in the creation of efficient hydrogen recovery systems that could result in substantial savings due to hydrogen loss resulting from cryogenic boil-off.","The hydrogen market is huge, currently about 10 million tons/year in the U.S. alone and a multi-billion dollar business. Industrial markets, such as refineries, ammonia production, chemical plants, etc, use most of the commercial quantities of hydrogen. Most of the hydrogen is either shipped to the end user via pipeline or trucked as compressed gas, at pressures of ~2,000 psi or greater. However, other applications for the hydrogen economy, especially vehicle refueling applications, require higher pressures, up to 12,000 psi. Successful development of efficient, high pressure water electrolysis systems is critically important in meeting these developing needs. It is anticipated that the worldwide combined industrial and emerging vehicle market for hydrogen will be >100 billion dollars.","Conversion; Distribution/Management; Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Processing Methods; Resource Extraction; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Storage"

Mega-ROSA will enable extremely high power spacecraft applications, including: Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft, SEP space-tug, and large-scale Planetary and Human Exploration missions because of its ground-breaking stowed packaging efficiency, high deployed stiffness / strength, low-cost and straightforward ground test capability. The innovative and synergistic Mega-ROSA solutions, to be validated to a TRL 6 level during the proposed Phase 2 program, will enable future high power missions through low cost (25-50% cost savings depending on PV and blanket technology), high specific power (>200 W/kg to 400 W/kg BOL at the wing level depending on PV and blanket technology), extremely compact stowage volume (>50 kW/m3 for very large arrays), high deployment reliability, platform simplicity (low parts count and reduced potential failure modes), high deployed strength/stiffness (>5X stiffer and stronger than rigid panel arrays of similar sizes), high voltage capability, scalability to ultra-high power (100kW to several Megawatts), and operability in unique environments (high/low illumination, high/low sun intensity and high radiation).","NASA space applications are comprised of practically all Exploration, Space Science, Earth Science, Planetary Surface, and other missions that require photovoltaic power production through deployment of a lightweight, modular and highly scalable structural system.  The proposed technology is particularly well suited for ultra-high power applications including, but not limited to, high power spacecraft, Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft, space-tugs, and large scale Planetary Science applications.  Because the Mega-ROSA technology can package much more power into a given launch vehicle envelope than any other solar array it potentially enables future cost-constrained NASA SMD/ESMD (and other) missions because the stowed-package of an ultra-high-power array actually can fit within the designated compact stowage volume of a smaller, less expensive and more readily available launch vehicle.  Mega-ROSA's ability to potentially reduce launch vehicle needs could literally provide a step function in large NASA SEP / Exploration mission cost savings.","Non-NASA space applications are comprised of practically all missions that require photovoltaic power production through deployment of a lightweight and modular structural system.  The proposed technology is particularly well suited for ultra-high power applications including: high power spacecraft, space-tugs, power station applications, and other large scale applications.  Mega-ROSA is well suited for applications requiring affordability, lightweight, scalability/modularity, compact stowage, operability within high radiation environments, high voltage operation, and operation in LILT and HIHT environments.  Applicable non-NASA space missions include: LEO surveillance, reconnaissance, communications and other critical payload/equipment satellites, LEO commercial mapping satellites, MEO satellites & re-supply space-tugs, and GEO commercial communications satellites. A strong commercial infusion path has been identified for the Mega-ROSA technology and the proposed Phase 2 program.  DSS has a formed strategic relationship with Orbital Sciences Corporation and Space Systems Loral for this program and the Mega-ROSA technology to help expedite commercialization / technology infusion into their high power applications.","Composites; Conversion; Deployment; Generation; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures"

Inverted Metamorphic Multi-junction (IMM) solar cells can enable these arrays, offering higher efficiencies of >33% and lower mass and flexibility, but integration challenges of this thin crystalline cell technology need solution.  The Thin Hybrid Interconnected Solar-Array (THINS) technology allows robust and reliable integration of IMM cells into a flexible blanket comprising standardized modules engineered for producibility.  The modules support the IMM cell by using multi-functional materials for structural stability, shielding, CTE stress relief, and integrated thermal and electrical functions. The Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of key THINS component, including the structurally stabilized IMM cell, and integration with advanced multi-functional substrate and superstrate components, and completed the modularity approach for interfacing into the Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA) deployable structure, while improving standardization and manufacturability. Design evaluation shows figures of merit for array level specific power, including deployable structure, greater than 400W/kg and volumetric efficiency greater than15kW/m^3, significantly higher than current approaches. The low mass and low stowed volume provides a path to package 300kW in a single launch with a deployment approach that uses simple, robust mechanisms.  Phase II advances the THINS/ROSA technology, incorporating advanced  4 -Junction IMM solar cells into THINS modules using demonstrated spaceflight qualified materials, testing module coupons in thermal cycling and plasma environments, fabricating a full-scale module to demonstrate automatable manufacturing processes, integrating that module and inactive modules (with cell simulators) into the ROSA deployable structure, and culminating in a full-scale deployment demonstration.","NASA technology objectives have traditionally included solar arrays with high specific power, high power capability, high voltage capability, compact packaging, and modularity for improved schedule responsiveness, standardization, qualification traceability, automation, and lowered cost.  Lightweight, high power solar arrays with compact packaging is a key enabling technology for meeting NASA goals of establishing a capability for Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP), as well as for long-duration manned missions. In particular, providing tens to hundreds of kilowatts can be enabling for outer planetary missions, allowing improved SEP performance during cruise, and providing significant power (hundreds of watts) for the objective mission, despite the minimal sunlight available at the asteroid belt, Jupiter and beyond. The THINS/ROSA array also has the advantages of improved electromagnetic cleanliness because of the capability for flex-circuit back-wiring, encapsulation, and the continuity of coverglass materials to create a continuous grounded, shielded enclosure.  Such a technology can be enabling for high performance electric and magnetic field instruments often used on NASA science spacecraft, such as THEMIS, MMS, and Maven, and could also enable the higher voltages needed for direct drive SEP approaches.","The ability to fit tens of kilowatts in a compact stowage envelope is of great benefit to commercial missions, where high power translates directly to improved spacecraft revenue. Improvements in reliability and reduced costs are also of great interest to commercial spacecraft suppliers, since the solar array can often drive the total spacecraft and launch costs, and reliability is needed to avoid the failures that drove up costs of commercial missions significantly in recent years.  The ability to package high power with compactness can significantly reduce launch costs by enabling smaller, economical  launch vehicles, and high efficiency reduces cost by reducing solar array area and therefore the required hardware and station-keeping costs.  The modularity concept provides a means of improving process control and standardization to improve reliability and reduce the cost of manufacturing and qualification.  Significant interest in this technology has been expressed from commercial spacecraft providers such as Boeing, Orbital Sciences and Loral.  Vanguard has been working extensively with Boeing on its development of high power, flexible arrays, such as the Integrated Blanket Interconnect System (IBIS), which is a version of Boeing's High Power Solar Array (HPSA)  that incorporated earlier versions of THINS, and which would benefit from the technology maturation achievable with the continuation of this SBIR.",Composites; Conversion; Generation; Telescope Arrays

Graded Preform PICA (GPP) will be achieved by the continued development of lightweight, graded density carbon preforms which will decrease the overall areal mass of the resulting TPS material while enhancing its thermal performance capability.  The preform material designed to achieve this goal is comprised of a more mechanically robust, ablating outer layer and a lower weight, lower thermal conductivity inner layer than state-of-the-art PICA material. The ablative outer layer and thermal inner layer will be integrated in a continuously cast, monolithic material with equivalent capability for resin impregnation and conversion to PICA as the baseline existing preform material (FiberForm®).  During the proposed Phase II program, FMI will continue to develop its capability to produce graded density preform material to achieve TPS areal mass reductions estimated between 17-25% relative to PICA with the goal of improving ablation performance. The developed preform materials will be converted to GPP and then characterized mechanically, thermally, and tested for ablation performance.  In addition to providing a pathway for these enhancements to tile acreage PICA TPS ablator material, FMI will incorporate the developed processing methodology to produce near net-shaped cast PICA TPS material preforms with a reduced density gradient compared to baseline manufacturing techniques.","The Stardust Sample Return Capsule completed its objective with earth reentry in January 2006.  Mars Science Laboratory Aeroshell heat shield has been completed and delivery of the Curiosity rover to Mars is scheduled for 2015.  With the successful fabrication of these PICA TPS heat shields in support of NASA flight missions, FMI has quoted and is prepared to continue supporting PICA heat shield missions. The program proposed will assist FMI in support of the NASA missions including ORISIS-REx and Mars EDL development by demonstrating near net-shaped density control and areal mass reduction.  While OSIRIS-Rex is intended to use Stardust-like TPS, the demonstration in this program will validate improvements over the Stardust preform and provide a baseline for future missions.  Thus, a successful program will enable other NASA TPS mission requirements.","PICA preform development conducted under this program program would support commercial space operations including Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS).   During 2008, NASA entered into contracts with Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to utilize their COTS cargo vehicles, Cygnus and Dragon respectively, for cargo delivery to the International Space Station (ISS).  PICA is an enabling technology for earth return vehicles. More tightly controlled TPS preform density and resulting properties increases utility and reliability for commerical space applications.","Aerobraking/Aerocapture; Composites; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Processing Methods"

Tailored structures are comprised of the right materials, at the right place, in the right orientation, in the right amount. Whatever the material or structural configuration, excess weight is driven out through optimization, within the limitations of the manufacturing approach. NASA’s Advanced Composites Project is focused on the manufacturing approaches that enable more efficient composite structures. CRG has been laying the foundation for the design and production of tailored structures for more than a decade. CRG’s vision for tailored airframes and structures begins with unitization, enabled by Smart Tooling for affordable manufacturing of complex composites. CRG began work on Smart Tooling for fuselages in 2005, targeting fully-integrated, single-process skins, stringers, and frames. CRG subsidiary Spintech launched in 2010 to commercialize Smart Tooling into the aerospace industry. Today, CRG brings robust capabilities in composite structural optimization, expanding capabilities in aerospace composite fabrication, and Spintech’s Smart Tooling technology to provide NASA with unitized fuselage configurations with an unmatched combination of affordability and structural efficiency.","Supporting NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, this project's technologies directly address requirements for tailored airframes and structures resulting in mass reduction for improved fuselage structural efficiency. The goals support NASA's roadmap for Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles - Subsonic Transport, and the Advanced Composites Project. This project's technologies enabling structural unitization lead to reduced manufacturing cost, reduced operating costs resulting from reduced fuel burn, and reduced emissions, leading to cleaner and more affordable flight in the future.","This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises. Government systems that would derive the same benefits would include future DoD aircraft, both manned and UAS. This technology's attributes for reduced manufacturing costs and reduced operating costs should yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for aircraft production by the major OEMs, prime contractors, and Tier 1 suppliers in both the commercial aircraft and defense industries.",Air Transportation & Safety; Composites; Processing Methods; Prototyping

Despite decades of research towards making CFD predictive and reliable, it has not proven so due to the significant uncertainties in physical models, initial/boundary conditions, computational mesh, numerical schemes and methods. In the proposed effort CFDRC in partnership with Virginia Tech and UTSI, aims to directly address these issues by integrating dimensionally adaptive sparse grid uncertainty quantification (UQ) method with an existing reacting CFD solver. The proposers demonstrated this approach to be suitable for achieving this objective during Phase I on a NASA-LaRC nozzle-isolator lab-scale setup. The proposed effort will deliver a practical user-friendly automated software tool combining UQ with CFD (UQCFD), capable of identifying and characterizing regions of high-uncertainty in the CFD code and the associated work-flow, and thereby, provide guidance to the CFD modeler to increase fidelity of those regions. UQCFD software has the potential to make significant impact on a wide variety of application utilizing CFD predictions including design and development of next generation supersonic and hypersonic flight vehicles.","Non-intrusive uncertainty quantification, that does not require the CFD code to be modified, has been identified as an enabling technology by NASA to advance the role of computational fluid dynamics codes in the Design Development Research and Engineering community developed by the aerospace industry, ultimately leading to utilization for flight certification. The proposed computational product offers a direct solution to link the various sources of uncertainties to predictions made by CFD tools, thereby enabling the usability of CFD tools for making risk-informed design decisions. The adaptive sparse grid method offers a significant advantage over other uncertainty quantification methods due to the ability to handle non-smooth system response with complex probability density distributions and much smaller number of required CFD simulations. This product can be a highly effective tool for wider applications requiring aerothermodynamics calculations where the lack of confidence in modeling parameters and predictive capability of the CFD codes has limited their impact.","The work established in this project including the Uncertainty Quantification workflow process and automated software tool can be generalized for potential applications to a wide range of applications utilizing CFD software. More specifically, this work can be transitioned to support a significant number of other non-NASA applications where reacting CFD modeling tools are utilized. Energy and propulsion applications such as gas-turbine combustors, augmentors, rockets, and many others can benefit from the product developed in the proposed work.","Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Atmospheric Propulsion; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Quality/Reliability; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

The requirement to advance towards more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly aircrafts demands battery systems that can operate for longer periods of time in a safer and more reliable manner. An attractive technique that can be used to increase battery pack life is that of active balancing. Active balancing is typically used to increase the amount of energy put into or extracted out of a battery. If performed efficiently and accurately, active balancing can translate into longer battery life and more efficient battery utilization. Active balancers presently equalize either voltage or State of Charge (SOC) in a group of cells or super-cells in series. The more accurate in-operando SOC active balancers depend on on-line SOC estimation algorithms that are typically based on terminal voltage, current, and temperature. These algorithms (e.g., Coulomb counting, Kalman-based filter estimation, etc) accumulate errors and/or become unstable as a consequence of measurement errors, model simplifications, and the lack of an accurate battery parameter determination and tracking method, which is critical as the battery ages and/or operates under unforeseen conditions. To assist with this problem we propose to develop an active balancing electronic system that can jointly balance the battery pack and measure battery health related parameters without additional hardware. We propose to use this efficient electronic system to demonstrate an improved active balancing system capable of battery life enhancement and safety operation.","NASA has great interest in methods and approaches for intelligent monitoring and innovative techniques that enable extended and safer operation of aircraft with electric propulsion systems.

Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) and Hybrid Electric architectures rely heavily on batteries to achieve fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions. DEP Aircraft of the future have demands for Energy Storage Systems with large counts of cells put in series and parallel to achieve needed voltage and energy levels. The X57 Maxwell Battery comprises of over 6000 cells. As the pack goes through repeated charge/discharge cycles, as well as environmental cycles, each individual cell begins to lose its capacity. Advanced high energy density chemistries (>300Wh kg) are particularly vulnerable.  Cell to cell capacity variation causes the entire pack to be limited by the weakest cell. Traditional Passive Balancing topologies are limited in their ability to address cell mismatch on the discharge cycle. Active balancing allows a dynamic measurement & control system to discharge cells at variable rates. With a more robust measurement & control architecture, Active topologies have the ability to integrate more advanced algorithms. These algorithms include predictive health monitoring, life based management, physics based cell modelling. Batteries can last longer, avoid thermal runaway, and avoid maintenance.

No deployed Li-Ion battery system in Aviation today has an active topology. This is due to the stringent FAA DO311 requirements which require designers to show that their systems can meet a 1E-9 probability requirement of failed condition occurring such as overcharge. This is achieved through redundancy and the elimination of single point failures. With charge current being transferred from cell to cell, no one has achieved a cost effective design that meets the 1e-9 requirement. If the TRL is advanced on such a topology, the economics of lithium becomes much more compelling given the much improved cycle life. Other key markets who could benefit from Research would be the Air Taxi Manufacturers. Much of their business model is based on the economic properties of the battery. Right now cell manufacturers who are achieving the energy density targets for the application are no where near the cycle life requirement to make this market viable.

Airworthiness certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a critical step towards NAS integration. To match the expected FAA safety and reliability standards for UAS certification, novel technologies are needed. Conventional manned air vehicles meet FAA standards via hardware redundancy, an option unavailable for UAS due to size, weight, and power constraints. This challenge was addressed in Phase I via the so-called algorithmically redundant approach, where multiple fault detection and isolation algorithms work in parallel to detect faults more reliably. Using FAA-approved procedures like fault tree analysis or failure modes and effects analysis, reliability of algorithmically redundant systems is computed. This approach will be extended in Phase II to include flight control system hardware and control laws in the loop, and will involve validation via flight testing. A comprehensive methodology and accompanying software toolbox will result: STI Approach for Fault Estimation and Reliability for UAS (SAFER-UAS). SAFER-UAS is an overall reliability estimation approach based on theoretical analysis, simulation runs, and flight tests, serving as a vital step toward certification.","The proposed STI Approach for Fault Estimation and Reliability for UAS (SAFER-UAS) Toolbox directly addresses three strategic thrusts in the current NASA ARMD Strategic Implementation Plan. Thrust 1: ""Safe, Efficient Growth in Global Operations"" is addressed by a sustained focus on reducing UAS risks to maintain acceptable safety levels for all air traffic. Thrust 5: ""Real-time, System-Wide Safety Assurance"" is addressed by the developed analytic technique that mitigates UAS risks toward integrated, system-wide safety assurance. Thrust 6: ""Assured Autonomy for Aviation Transformation"" is addressed by the innovative FDI framework that will better enable safe integration of UAS into the NAS. Additionally, NASA is addressing air traffic management for low-altitude drones by developing a system to ensure safe UAS entry into this airspace. This rapidly growing industry includes emerging UAS applications such as package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and environmental monitoring. The SAFER-UAS toolbox will benefit this system by providing safety assurance.","The UAS industry is experiencing rapid growth the private sector. The low-altitude (200-500 ft.) drone industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years with the emergence of new autonomous UAS applications including package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and environmental and agricultural monitoring. It is well-known that Amazon is pursuing the use of UAS for package delivery and a successful demonstration of this was achieved in late 2016. At higher altitudes, emerging commercial UAS technologies include high-altitude communications relay systems for expanding internet access to remote areas. Both Google and Facebook are pursuing this technology and have purchased the companies of Titan Aerospace and Ascenta respectively. The proposed SAFER-UAS Toolbox will be beneficial for ensuring that new UAS in all of these applications will be safely integrated with less required hardware redundancy, reducing required size, weight, and power (SWaP), and increasing achievable performance bounds.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

In Phase I, ATAC developed a machine learning based aviation POA decision support tool (DST), which improves the state of the art of today’s airline, airport and FAA POA processes by providing automated, results-oriented POA outcomes. We provided a proof-of-concept for this POA DST by demonstrating how the Phase I prototype allows airline, airport and FAA personnel at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) to perform faster, more efficient and results-oriented post analysis of individual departure banks to obtain actionable operational insights. Encouraged by our promising proof-of-concept demonstrations in Phase I, we propose to carry forward this research in Phase II of our SBIR project towards the eventual goal of developing a commercial licensable Cloud-based POA Platform that can be accessed by NASA, FAA, airline, airport or other commercial systems or personnel in a “Platform-As-A-Service” (PAAS) mode. This proposed capability provides a one-stop platform for gate-to-gate, complete POA including aviation data acquisition, storage, analytics, and root cause diagnosis, in a post-analysis mode as well as a real-time, continuous operations monitoring mode. The proposed continuous operations monitoring mode accelerates operations analysis work related to NASA’s ATD-2 project. The proposed second airspace focused use case supports multiple NASA research programs, including ATD-2's CLT to Northeast corridor (NEC) departure flow operations analysis, IDM NEC enroute constraints analysis, ATD-3 weather-efficient routing analysis and System Wide Safety anomaly detection. Moreover, by providing the ability to perform results-oriented POA on diverse operations (UAM, IDO), the SBIR enables the future NAS to rapidly learn from operational inefficiencies, and improve new traffic management and operations paradigms.","The CIDAS-P technology has application across multiple NASA projects. CIDAS-P's automated, results-oriented post operations analysis (POA) complements ongoing ATD-2 CLT operations analysis efforts. Phase II continuous ops monitoring and NEC surface-airspace ops analysis capabilities support development of ATD-2's Strategic Scheduling component, and accelerates progress towards the next phase of ATD-2. CIDAS-P collective inference analysis on weather-driven en route rerouting scenarios can accelerate evaluation and continuous improvement of ATD-3 rerouting technologies. ATM-X's IDM research will benefit by leveraging CIDAS-P as a reliable, results-oriented method for evaluating the effectiveness of enroute TBFM-TFMS coordination strategies. CIDAS-P's airline ops analysis use case supports NASA Airline Operations Research Group (AORG) in its objective of infusing NASA-funded technologies into airline tools. CIDAS-P can also significantly improve System Wide Safety (SWS) project's anomaly detection algorithms, by providing reliable, automated collective inference based guidance on whether the identified safety alerts are false positives or missed safety alerts. Research into future diverse operations (UAM, IDO) also stands to benefit by CIDAS-P enabled continuous operations improvement guidance. Working software prototypes and collective inference algorithms can be incorporated into NASA software analysis platforms such as DASH, SMART-NAS testbed, FACT, or FACET.","The main commercial application for the proposed technology is as a DST to be used by operational and/or analytical personnel at airlines, ANSPs, or airports, (or by aviation consultants) for analyzing root causes for observed operational efficiencies or irregularities at the end of a day of operations at key airports and airspaces. The CIDAS-P collective inference engine will enable staff to differentiate the impacts of factors under their control versus not under their control, to assist in improved operational decision-making around operational procedures, and technology and resource investments.

The proposed technology applies concepts from statistical modeling and machine learning to reliably predict likely future evolution of airport traffic as well as the evolution of other influencing factors such as runway capacity over time. A machine learning tool will drive multiple what-if analysis simulations, each with a slightly modified “initial condition” which may be defined by flight simulation start times (i.e., gate pushback times) as well as allocated taxi routes. Multiple simulations, each driven by one set of initial conditions will be run for each closure time-window option being investigated. Thereby, for each closure time-window option, we will obtain not just one but a distribution of performance metrics, which is a more realistic estimate of likely performance as opposed to a single point value. This ability to reliably predict future performance and the uncertainty associated with it, is a significant step up from the predictive analytics that are available today to airport airside operations staff. The technology would also be applied to determine the multiple futures of closing airspace for any variety of common reasons that would include a commercial space launch use case.","NECP, by extending its planning domain to cover closures of airspace regions, provides a capability that will be beneficial to the new NASA programs that address the management of new types of air traffic (e.g., UASs, Commercial Space Operations (CSO), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations).  Gaining predictive insight to unregulated airspace and relationships to currently regulated airspace that a UAS/CSO/UAM vehicle routing may transit is not currently afforded by any platform. NECP is relevant to the NASA ATM Technology Demonstration-2 (ATD-2) subproject in which NASA plans to address current-day surface traffic management shortfalls by demonstrating Integrated Arrival, Departure, Surface (IADS) scheduling technologies and transitioning them for field-implementation. NASA's ATD-2 technologies are expected to become critical parts of the FAA's NextGen Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) capability, deploying surface traffic management solutions at NAS Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs).  At winter weather impacted airports, the deployed TFDM/ATD-2 technologies will benefit from our proposed NECP DST to improve decision-making during runway closures. NASA's AORG is gaining a better understanding of winter storm effects on NAS operations (especially airports) and developing knowledge and tools to reduce cancelations and delays. Our innovation has been included within the FACT program and supports these capabilities by enabling improved decision-making during runway closures.","Direct FAA-related post Phase II applications for NECP include: (1) an analysis tool focused on the assessment of airport construction impacts, (2) a Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO) benefits analysis tool, (3) a platform to support collaborative airline-ANSP decision making around adverse weather based airspace closures, (4) a UAS airspace impact analysis tool, and (5) a Commercial Space Launch impact analysis tool set. ATAC is in active discussions with potential FAA customers in the FAA NextGen and Air Traffic Organization (ATO) on related support projects. We plan to leverage these contacts to showcase NECP's novel collaborative decision making and analytical capabilities and promote the FAA's adoption of NECP for the above applications.  In addition, airlines are often adversely impacted by airport movement area closures and/or airspace closures and the changing nature of the NAS.  Integration of increasing numbers of UAS as well as Commercial Space Launches increase the imperative of developing novel and efficient ways of dealing with these disruptions. NECP provides the airlines and/or airports with a reliable data-driven approach to collaboratively plan, analyze, predict, notify, and execute such closures. Each organization can also tailor its NECP platform to additionally provide metrics that measure impact on their own corporate, network-wide operations or business objectives, and then help drive agreement on the solution(s) that best fit stakeholder goals.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Computer System Architectures; Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Sequencing & Scheduling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

To estimate runway capacity, PARC analyzes historical data describing an airport’s traffic movements, operating conditions, operating procedures, and geospatial data to determine the time intervals between successive aircraft using an airport’s runway and variables that influence it. Variables may include facility, aircraft, flight plan and weather conditions. Second, PARC uses the data to construct Bayesian Network (BN) statistical models of the joint probability of inter-aircraft time spacing and the variables for each airport’s runway. Third, PARC performs Monte-Carlo simulations of the traffic planned to use each runway, sampling the BN models to estimate the spacing of successive takeoff, landing and taxi crossing aircraft, to obtain a distribution of possible runway capacities. Fourth, PARC selects a a target runway capacity from the distribution for airport traffic management. The advantages of PARC are adapting to the characteristics of the airport and accounting for the anticipated operating conditions to provide accurate estimates of runway capacity. Phase I demonstrates processing of FAA System Wide Information Management (SWIM) traceable data sources for modeling for 1-year of data for Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport (KATL). Phase I uses the data to constructs BN models of inter-aircraft time spacing and to validate the models. Phase I demonstrates the greater accuracy of the BN models in representing and predicting inter-aircraft time spacing than a simpler single-event probability model. Phase I demonstrates sampling of the BN models for different airport, aircraft and flight plan conditions to obtain inter-aircraft spacing values to be used in Monte-Carlo simulations for capacity prediction.","PARC could be used by the NASA Airspace Technology Demonstration-2 (ATD-2) traffic scheduling to compare the throughput implied by scheduled runway operations to runway capacity as per operating conditions. Specifically, if tactical runway schedules are constructed to meet minimum statutory spacing requirements, PARC could assess whether the resulting schedules comply with appropriate or typical spacing buffers. PARC could be used in other ATD-2 decision support and real-time control tools to support planning and management of airport runway configuration; allocation of runway capacity to arrivals, departures and crossing runway traffic; and/or metering of airport traffic for macroscopic Traffic Flow Management (TFM) or finer-grained Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) applications. Specifically, PARC could estimate airport runway capacities for runway configuration planning, traffic metering and management, and demand-capacity balancing. PARC could be used in the ATD-2 system to assess in-trail separations of aircraft at the runway (measured from surveillance data) and alert controllers to occurrences of excessively small spacing values of low-probability, indicating a shift in the operating characteristics to be addressed. PARC could be used to estimate airport runway and airport-wide arrival and departure capacity values for modeling and simulation of traffic under different operating conditions for concept and technology research and development activities.","PARC could be a decision support tool for FAA Airport Tower Controllers to plan airport runway configurations and utilizations (e.g., dedicated versus shared, arrival-departure capacity allocations for shared runways). PARC could be a decision support tool for FAA Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) and the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) to estimate the arrival capacities of US airports for anticipated operating conditions for demand-capacity balancing. PARC could be a tool for FAA Airport Tower Controllers to compare in real-time spacing measured from airport surveillance and infrastructure data to modeled spacing and alert of anomalies. PARC could be used by the airport authority, airline or airlines, or a third party to manage surface traffic in the non-movement area of the airport including planning and control of movement area exits and entries, gate assignments, departure reservoirs. PARC could be implemented as an analysis tool for airport consulting agencies to use in airport master planning. Specifically, PARC would be used to estimate the airport runway capacities for numerous operating conditions and compare the capacities to anticipated traffic to determine the need for modifications to, or addition of, runways to increase capacity. PARC could be used to compute and compare the effective and theoretical capacities of an airport?s configurations for efficiency assessment and traffic management.","Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Characterization; Command & Control; Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Man-Machine Interaction; Process Monitoring & Control; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Transport/Traffic Control"

Voice is still the main source of ATC-pilot communications and a large body of airspace situational awareness and operationally-related information is contained therein that never makes it effectively back into broader National Airspace Systems (NAS) use. Our innovation provides access to that information, in real-time, and with the built-in analytics to use that information to identify anomalies and provide alerts.

After additional validation, our innovation can provide alerts to controllers for flights deviating from clearance instructions.Preliminary discussions with airline decision support tool providers suggest interest in a version of ILSA that would operate in the AOC to provide real-time and prognostic support to dispatchers. The concept is to provide dispatchers with current and predicted information on airspace and aircraft risk status. This information, combined with data on crew and aircraft assignments from AOC information systems, can alert the dispatcher that, for example, a crew operating at the end of a long flight may be entering a region of medium or high risk. The value of this combined information is indicated by the two most aircraft rashes that occurred when the crews were flying non-normal times (0600 hours or at the end of a long trans-Pacific flight) with the ILS out, and in the UPS case with degraded weather. Operators and controllers report on recurring congestion in subsectors that cause inefficient deviations from planned routes. These inefficiencies do not typically get reported to the ATSCC and thus do not get de-conflicted in the planning process.

Technologies which can be used for real-time risk assessment of UAS flights are being developed by UTM Safety researchers, but there is currently no user interface to connect these technologies with the UTM managers and/or UAS operators. We propose to develop a human autonomy teaming interface system (HATIS) composed of specialized tools, multimodal interfaces, and human autonomy teaming software, which will permit human operators and UTM/UAS automation to collaborate for real-time risk management and mitigation (RMM). In Phase I, we collaborated with NASA to identify hazard categories and UTM RMM roles and automation capabilities; developed high-level system requirements and a system architecture along with three test cases; demonstrated a proof-of-concept with interactive mockup interfaces; and validated HATIS potential as a product for key market segments, including NASA labs conducting research in human autonomy teaming (HAT), landfills conducting  real-time environmental monitoring and reporting, and UAS manufacturers. In Phase II, we will spiral the development in HATIS in two builds: 1) HATIS1, which includes both building basic interfaces that allow the operator to visualize risks and collaborate with the automation to manage risks, and conducting the first integrated test and evaluation with usability and software; and 2) HATIS2 which includes extending HATIS to include level-of-automation management, play-based control, voice interaction, and conducting the second integrated test and evaluation with usability, software, and interoperability. We will implement a comprehensive risk mitigation plan that involves creating emulators of UTM RM algorithms and testing with these emulators if direct testing with RM algorithms is infeasible, and incorporating NASA input in preliminary and critical design reviews throughout each build.","Potential NASA applications of HATIS span four NASA directorates.  In the ARMD, HATIS can provide programs such as UTM, UAS-in-the-NAS, and SMART-NAS with an interface system that allows the operator to team with the UTM automation to evaluate (via live virtual constructive distributed environments) and manage risks associated with flying UAS in terminal and congested airspace.  In the HEOMD, HATIS can be integrated into human-system interaction subsystems that enable crew and ground controllers to better supervise robots in space exploration mission.  Such integration would enhance the management of risks associated robots working remotely in space.  In the STMD, HATIS can be augmented with human-swarm interaction interfaces for controlling a multi-agent system as an ensemble.  Such augmentation would enable the operator to visualize the risks and work collaboratively with the swarm automation to manage the risks associated with the swarm operations. In the SMD, HATIS dynamic function allocation capability and play-based control can be a valuable asset for astronauts to use augmented reality systems to carry out procedures through various sensory modalities, reduce dependency for ground support, enhance situational awareness, and reduce cognitive overload while performing complex tasks.","HATIS associated support services will fulfill needs of several organizations.  The first group will be landfills that could use a network of drones for real time environmental monitoring and reporting.   The second group will be companies that build UAS (e.g., Northrop Grumman, Aerovironment, General Atomics, Boeing) and manufacture UAS avionics systems (e.g., Honeywell, L3).  As these organizations develop new technologies and new concepts of operations, they will need software such as HATIS integrated into their ground control station in order to rapidly conduct risk-evaluations of their ConOps.  The third group is made up of DoD labs researching and developing human machine teaming applications (e.g., the Air Force's Autonomous Wingman, the Army's Air Mission Commander, and the Navy's Autonomous Swarmboats).  HATIS will facilitate research on important topics such as trust, transparency, and function allocation between human and automation. The fourth group are: a) companies that have developed UAS technologies or systems for package delivery or emergency response applications (Google, Amazon); and b) cargo companies that may use UAS to transport cargo (UPS, FedEx). These companies will need to conceive, design, build, and test specific UAS, GCSs and ConOps to expand their business operations and markets. As with small UAS manufacturers, these organizations will also provide a market for actual multi-UAS GCSs.

There are several ways to capture and pressurize CO2, including freezing at cryogenic temperatures, mechanical compression, and absorption. Completed studies on each approach, have generally favored cryogenic temperature and mechanical compression solutions. Recently, mechanical compression has gained momentum through the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), which utilizes an Air Squared compressor for mechanical compression of CO2. If this approach is pursued further for a larger system, there are still several questions concerning reliability over 10,000 hours of autonomous operation in Mars environment and scalability. Air Squared plans on addressing these issues as part of Phase II.","The proposed innovation is a Martian Atmosphere Scroll Compressor (MASC). Dealing with the low pressures of the Martian atmosphere, the MASC functions like a vacuum pump utilizing Air Squared scroll compressor technology. During Phase I, Air Squared tested several orbiting and spinning scroll prototypes on CO2 at a wide range of discharge pressures and superior efficiency was demonstrated with lower discharge pressures. Parallel efforts by NASA-JPL on MOXIE, showed no performance degradation of the SOXE at reduced pressures down to 4.4 PSIA. Additionally, reducing the cathode pressure provides more margin against starting to electrolyze CO. For this reason, Air Squared has decided to focus exclusively on collection-only in an attempt to concentrate efforts on a lightweight and efficient MASC, supporting oxygen generation. The following proposed Phase II work will further develop both a spinning and orbiting scroll MASC for providing 2.7 kg/hr of CO2 at discharge pressures between 4.4 and 15 PSIA.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  To meet NASA?s ambitious goal of human exploration of Mars, the MASC provides in-situ resource utilization for the production of oxygen and fuel derived from the CO2 rich Martian atmosphere. Designed to minimize size, weight, and power requirements without compromising efficiency, the MASC is applicable to NASA?s many atmospheric collection and monitoring demands. Engineered for the collection of CO2 for the Mar Rover 2020 mission, the MASC is a next-generation evolution of Air Squared?s successful MOXIE scroll compressor, re-imagined for human exploration of space. Scaled up, the MASC would apply to storage and utilization of CO2 on future Mars missions to supply the raw materials for oxygen and fuel production. Scaled down, the MASC could be integrated onboard NASA?s crewed spacecraft to collect and analyze atmospheric particulate to monitor the safety of the astronauts on board. Additionally, the MASC could fulfill the atmospheric monitoring and safety needs on board the ISS by collecting CO2 and other toxins and regulating the breathable environment. Via a low power, compact, and reliable design, the MASC could reduce space transit fuel costs for Mars exploration crews by supplying them with oxygen and fuel for the journey back home.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; Where size, weight, and power are at a premium, the MASC excels, making it a perfect fit for military and commercial aerospace markets. The MASC could replace state of the art air compressors in On-Board Oxygen Generation Systems (OBOGS) which recycles cabin atmosphere in military aircraft, eliminating the need for heavy and tightly temperature controlled liquid oxygen tanks, thereby extending mission lengths and increasing pilot performance. Air Squared has an existing partnership with Cobham Manufacturing to produce scroll air compressors in their OBOGSs and once testing is completed, the MASC would be a next-generation upgrade for military aircraft. A spinning scroll compressor design, like the MASC, would minimize space and weight needs while maintaining versatile compatibility with several different military aircraft.  Integrated as an air compressor for aviation potable water systems, the MASC could provide more efficient, lighter, and smaller solution to the commercial air transportation industry. The MASC could reach a market already established in Air Squared?s partnership with Airbus to retrofit their current potable water system. The adaptive MASC would solve previous reliability issues through its less complex spinning scroll design. If successful, the spinning scroll MASC will provide a pathway for tailoring the technology to the additional compressor and vacuum pump applications in the commercial aerospace industry.; ; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Pressure & Vacuum Systems"

Hydrogen fire detection is critical for rocket propulsion safety and maintenance. A significant fire at a rocket test or launch facility could be catastrophic to infrastructure or even worse, to human life. Detection monitoring is problematic as hydrogen flames can be nearly invisible during the day. Non-imaging, Non-visible fire detection technology has limited range and can suffer from false alarms from sources outside the region of interest. Low-cost visible imagers, commonly used for wide-scale routine surveillance, have limited utility detecting hydrogen fires. Although it has been known for decades that multispectral imaging outside the visible range can be used to detect fires with low false alarm rates, the price of such systems and the lack of processing algorithms and ability to implement them in real-time has largely prohibited their use. During this project we will develop a low-cost imaging capability that fuses data collected from sensors operating in the (1) solar blind ultra-violet, (2) thermal infrared, (3) mid-wave infrared, and (4) visible spectrum, using advanced spectral, spatial and temporal processing techniques optimized to detect and generate alerts associated with hydrogen fires in real-time. This multi-sensor, multi-processing approach will enable us to automate flame detection with extremely low false alarm rates. This multisensory imaging research could also support NASA's important cool flame microgravity research occurring on the International Space Station.","This technology has near term direct application for monitoring hydrogen fires within several NASA propulsion test and launch facilities. This capability will enhance the safety of these facilities and potentially facilitate required maintenance procedures. NASA rocket motor testing centers that would benefit from this include SSC, MSFC, GRCPBS and WSTF. KSC, responsible for the SLS and Orion launches that continue human spaceflight within NASA, and the Launch Services Program that provides launch operations oversight at several locations including Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg AFB would also realize safety and maintenance benefits from this technology. NASA is currently conducting experiments on flame interaction and extinguishment onboard the ISS. Fire burns differently in microgravity and although our technology is optimized for hydrogen flame phenomenology, it has wider potential use in NASA's cool flame research portfolio and could, for example, be used to support follow-on Saffire and FLEX experiments. FLEX experiments have shown low-frequency flicker that our temporal algorithms could exploit for terrestrial fire detection and discrimination.","Government facilities managed by the Rocket Propulsion Test Program Office, including Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Redstone Test Center (RTC), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) as well as commercial facilities including SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and Orbital ATK could all enhance their safety and facilitate their maintenance efforts by employing this technology to monitor hydrogen and other flames. There are several established markets and applications that incorporate significant amounts of hydrogen gas in their processes that would benefit from our flame detection technology. These markets primarily include petrochemical facilities, heat treating facilities for aerospace and automotive applications, fuel cell production facilities, food processing facilities (for hydrogenation) and potentially thermonuclear power plants. An emerging application is hydrogen fuel cell fueling station monitoring.

The micro-channels are produced in a size range of 100-200 microns such that the boundary layer thickness inside is drastically reduced when mixtures of helium and hydrogen gas flow through the channels. This thin boundary layer enhances the thermal and mass transport fluxes to the channel walls increasing the separation rate.  With this micro-channel approach, the membrane surface area to volume ratio is maximized reducing the operating costs and capital costs for the unit.","The present cryogenic separation process for this helium-hydrogen gas mixture is energy intensive, and newer demonstrations using proton-exchange membrane based separation processes are difficult and costly to scale to the size needed to process this large quantity of gas. Accordingly, Reactive Innovations is developing a metal membrane based micro-channel separation unit that is readily scalable and inexpensive to produce and operate. The micro-channel separation technology maximizes the separation area per unit volume giving enhanced thermal and mass fluxes to separate hydrogen from the helium mixture.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration uses substantial quantities of helium gas to purge hydrogen from fuel lines during spacecraft launches, rocket engine testing, and other processes at NASA facilities. A typical shuttle launch used about a million cubic feet of helium where six times this amount is expected for the space launch system and multipurpose crew vehicle launches. This helium gas contaminated with hydrogen is expensive and energy intensive to purify and recover. Because of helium shortages and rising prices, cost effective recovery and reclamation of helium from hydrogen-helium gas mixtures is of great economic significance to NASA and to the nation.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; Beyond NASA's use, helium is an important irreplaceable inert gas used in a variety of scientific and industrial fields such as oil and gas detectors, the nuclear industry, medical applications, cryogenics, and welding. However, due to the growing demand for helium, the market supply is becoming tighter and costs are increasing.  Currently, cryogenic distillation and pressure-swing adsorption are the prevalent methods widely used for helium separation, especially in natural gas feedstocks. The cryogenic distillation and pressure-swing separation methods involve complicated operations and require considerable energy consumption. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop simple, low-energy, and low-cost methods for separating helium from other gases. Other potential uses for this separator unit include removing hydrogen from natural gas processing plants, and separating helium-hydrogen mixtures used in medical MRI imaging, semiconductor processing, welding, and nuclear processes.; ; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Fluids; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Material Handing & Packaging; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Success is often determined by the ability of patients to tolerate the most aggressive regimen. The ability to deliver effective radiation therapy is limited by toxic side effects to healthy normal lung tissues. These side effects often cause breaks in treatment or dose-limiting toxicity after treatment, and, therefore, limit the amount of radiation that can be delivered to the tumor. No current therapies are effective to protect healthy normal lung tissue from the damaging effects of radiotherapy.

Achieving high thermal efficiencies and reliability while maintaining volumetric and mass efficiency has been the key challenge with these kinds of refrigeration/freezing systems in a microgravity environment. Previous state of the art refrigerator/freezer systems such as the ISS RFR, use thermoelectric thermal control with very low overall system COP of around 0.36 (in freezer mode).Alternatively, terrestrial cold food storage systems utilize much more efficient vapor compression thermal control systems, making the systems lighter and more compact. Currently, these systems do not have provisions to fulfill the load and reliability requirements of space applications and are also not designed for microgravity operation. An example would be Kelvinator KCCF220QW chest freezer. This freezer can maintain temperatures as low as 26͒C at COPs of around 2.2 to 2.4.Air Squared is proposing the development of a Zero-gravity Vapor Compression Refrigerator (ZVCR). The ZVCR is an oil-free, scroll driven, vapor compression food storage system that is thermally efficient, lightweight and reliable. Similar to conventional systems, the ZVCR will include four major components: compressor, condenser, expansion device and evaporator. But, instead of a heavy and oil lubricated working fluid compressor, it will use an advanced oil-free orbiting type scroll compressor and expander developed by Air Squared. Its oil-free design will remove system’s operational reliance on gravity while keeping the design compact & lightweight at higher efficiencies. For expansion work recovery, a scroll expander based on the same technology as the compressor will be used to further improve the system’s performance. Custom heat exchangers will be designed for efficient operation in microgravity while considering the size, weight and reliability requirements.","Via an innovated compact scroll technology, the ZVCR transports the benefits of earth-based refrigeration and thermal control into space for long-term human exploration. Installed on ISS resupply modules, the improved COP, minimized space and weight and maximized reliability designed into the ZVCR would allow for more food and supplies to be stored on NASA missions. The reduced weight and increase payload afforded by the ZVCR would decrease fuel costs and increase mission durations for potential Mars exploration. In addition to the ZVCR space refrigeration applications, Air Squared can easily modify the system to meet a diverse set of NASA?s efficient thermal control needs. As a waste heat rejection pump, the ZVCR could provide precise thermal control for spacecraft operating at high ambient temperature locations. A larger ZVCR could efficiently control the livable environment and crew accommodations as an environmental control unit for spacecraft or stations. Regardless of electronic, cabin, or food storage thermal management, a compact, lightweight reliable, and efficient ZVCR could increase the efficiency of NASA operations.","With a compact duet scroll compressor and expander design, the reliable and efficient ZVCR is poised to impact the aerospace and aviation thermal control market. The oil-free nature of the proposed ZVCR reduces the need for oil separation and componentry within thermal systems that demand reduced size and weight in low and zero gravity environments. Implemented on board military aircraft, the ZVCR would provide excellent waste heat rejection and thermal systems control of precise atmospheric temperatures and cabin pressurization. Due to the efficient vapor compression refrigeration, the ZVCR could increase storage life, capacity, and low temperature cooling as an active container system for aviation cold transportation of food and medical supplies. The ZVCR would not rely on dry ice for refrigeration, allowing additional logistical flexibility in the event of delayed flight schedules. Reliable and efficient oil-free cooling and heating systems have substantial potential for both terrestrial and aerospace applications.","Active Systems; Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation)"

The ISHM solution would reduce the cognitive load on the crew given the abundance of information that has to be reasoned upon in a timely fashion. This will be critical for improving mission and system safety. The solution will utilize habitat's real-time system health assessment, anomaly and failure detection, machine learning and active learning techniques to provide clear and concise decision support to improve situational awareness and perform proactive corrective actions. The solution provides the ability to report and incorporate previously undiscovered anomalies through a visually intuitive active learning interface. QSI's Hybrid modeling concept leverages domain information from various knowledge sources such as SysML, VISIO, etc. to augment its data-driven models with system-level interdependencies, which provide critical insight into the system when new anomalies need to be identified by the human-in-the-loop.

However, even well-trained personnel can make errors when carrying out procedures. The risk of these errors increases when task loads are too low or too high, when multi-tasking or switching between tasks, when interrupted, when complex team coordination or handovers are required, and/or during stressful situations. In these situations, users can become fatigued or complacent, or they can lose situation awareness due to overloaded working memory, automaticity, loss of vigilance, cognitive tunneling, ineffective information scanning, or susceptibility to confirmation and other biases. When these cognitive states occur, users are prone to committing errors such as wrong steps, skipped steps, mode errors, completion errors, default errors, and perseveration.","The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent assistant that monitors users, such as crewmembers performing procedural tasks, maintains estimates of the crewmembers' cognitive states (including situation awareness and affective state), identifies situations where the user is at risk of making errors, and selects appropriate interventions that reduce the likelihood of errors. Depending upon the situation and the cognitive state of the user, the assistant will select an intervention that increases user awareness of important situational elements that the user may be missing; and by changing the level of automation, the assistant will reduce user workload.","The assistant's modular architecture facilitates plugging in of different data models and algorithms required to monitor user performance, assess situation awareness and cognitive states, identify states that might lead to errors, and intervene to prevent those errors.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; The technology resulting from this research will monitor user actions and physiological data and estimate the user cognitive state to detect increased risk of specific types of errors.

(MIS) is developing the VULCAN system to address NASA’s requirement to produce high-strength, high-precision polymer and metallic components on-orbit with comparable quality to commercially-available, terrestrial machined and inspected parts. Such capability enables the in-situ manufacturing of critical parts for human and robotic spaceflight and without dependence on terrestrial resupply. MIS combines spaceflight-proven microgravity process controls and payload support systems, such as environmental and thermal controls, with a modular manufacturing and post processing system that generates a net shape final product.","The VULCAN technology is primarily intended for sustaining human spaceflight operations, first on the ISS and, later, on long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, or other destinations in the Solar System. MIS has built industry alliances with such companies as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Bigelow Aerospace to evaluate the optimal concept of operations for in-space manufacturing as an enabling technology for the NextSTEP Cislunar Habitat. MIS is also working with UTC Aerospace Systems and Paragon to develop ECLSS design principles for repair and replenishment by in-space manufacturing. Robotic expeditionary missions can also employ the VULCAN technology for autonomous repairs while building the infrastructure preceding human habitation. Local robots may retrieve and install VULCAN-generated parts automatically or via teleoperation. Such capability may be necessary to ensure continuity of operations without direct human intervention and enable human crews to focus on mission objectives.","The Department of Defense has a demonstrated need for advanced manufacturing capabilities in locations and on forward-deployed platforms without regular logistical support or available resources for traditional fabrication and finishing technologies. Perhaps the foremost example is the US Navy submarine fleet. While aircraft carriers are commonly referred to as ?cities at sea? because of their size and on-board industrial capacity, the nation?s attack and ballistic missile submarines deploy for months at a time and must function as entirely self-contained units with no physical connection to the outside world. Submarines on patrol duty may only surface during departure from base and upon return. When away from home port, there are only two submarine tenders in the entire US Navy, one each for the Atlantic and Pacific fleets, which limits underway replenishment opportunities. These 23,000-ton ships carry physical plants comparable to a small city and are often retasked for mobile fleet support activities, exacerbating the need for an in-situ solution. Much like spacecraft, submarines also have limited volume and environmental constraints on their operations. A tactical version of the VULCAN device gives the DoD a modular, common manufacturing system deployable on mobile platforms, such as submarines, destroyers, transport aircraft, and trucks, and in fixed locations with limited external support, such as Forward Operating Bases and advance airfields.",In Situ Manufacturing; Processing Methods; Prototyping

Instead, the MAMBA-Process relies on an ingot forming technology to create a metal ingot.  This ingot can then be milled and machined to form a precision part using a standard CNC milling technique.  In order to minimize astronaut time and exposure to the process, the MAMBA-Process will be highly automated and outfitted with a robotic assistant, capable of removing the ingot from the press and placing the ingot in the mill.  Automated tool changes are also possible for the mill, enabling complex shapes with fine edge finishes.  Testing of the process technologies led to a lab demonstration of ingot formation and milling in the Phase I effort, maturing the MAMBA Process to TRL-3.  In the Phase II effort, a full scale engineering unit will be built and tested, maturing the various the payload subsystems to TRL-5 and preparing the work needed to validate this technology for flight.","The innovations proposed in the MAMBA-Process would allow NASA to create precision parts on-orbit as needed.  Rather than fly a storage room of potential spare parts, the MAMBA-Process could be used to make these components when a need arises, limiting the initial launch volume.  In addition, the acceptance of used parts into the Positrusion-Press sub-technology allows for the recycling of used or failed parts, minimizes stored waste, and enables a closed loop ecosystem for metal fabrication. The ability to re-use mass taken on mission, dependent on the mission stage, would greatly increase capability per budgeted mass.

This sub-market is particularly complimentary to the Made In Space program for ZBLAN optical fiber production. ZBLAN optical fiber manufactured in microgravity has both a lower attenuation rate and a wider transmission window than traditional silica fiber. While fiber produced on-orbit can be used to increase the efficiency of existing fiber networks, it can also support higher-output transmitters that utilize microgravity-grown nonlinear optical crystals to exceed the material limits of silica fiber.One high impact application that NLO crystals are ideally suited to is the efficient production of UV light by second harmonic generation (SHG). A high efficiency conversion could potentially take incoherent light and produce UV from a low energy source such as an LED. Several inorganic NLO materials have transparency in the UV range including BPO4, which has a lower range of 130 nm. This would be a game changing system for medical and industrial UV applications such as lithography and machining.Another important application is efficient measurement of terahertz wave sensors.; ; Ceramics; Materials & Structures (including Optoelectronics); Nanomaterials; Organics/Biomaterials/Hybrids; Processing Methods; Waveguides/Optical Fiber (see also Optics)"

Furthermore, the panel stated, “...research on animal models will be constrained without the ability to manipulate the gravity variable as a factor modulating the fundamental processes underlying organ system homeostasis.” In response, Techshot has proposed to develop an innovative Rodent Centrifuge Facility (RCF-QL) that utilizes four locker locations (Quad Locker) in the EXPRESS Rack for life science research. The counter-balanced centrifuge is designed to provide a facility to allow rats and mice to live and be observed in simulated gravity between 0-1 g for up to 90 days. This streamlined design is more cost efficient and provides up to five cages. Each cage can accommodate at least six 30 gram mice, three 200 gram rats, or two 400 gram rats per cage. Each individual cage has adlib food and water, controllable lighting, and video monitoring. The habitat is temperature controlled with constant airflow throughout the cages. Air flow entraps waste in a filter that also treats the waste for bacteria and odor. Additional air filters will remove odors and ammonium from the animal enclosure. The subsystems design will minimize crew time. Each subsystem requiring change-out during the 90 day experiment will be designed to be simple and intuitive in operations. The RCF-QL will be the only facility capable of providing group housing for rats and mice, with a medium diameter centrifuge (20 in., 0.508 m) and a large rotating cage volume (up to 850 in3, 13,929 cm3 for the cage). All hardware cage features are designed to utilize the NIH animal care and use standards.","The Rodent Centrifuge Facility - Quad Locker (RCF-QL) offers the largest diameter centrifuge research tool flown on ISS. The RCF-QL is a unique and powerful instrument for novel life and microgravity science research. Techshot's initial targeted application of the proposed innovation is an offering of both the equipment and services associated with flight hardware and integration activities, which are highly desired by NASA-funded scientists. The RCF-QL will enhance NASA's position in exploration research by allowing rodent experiments at Moon or Mars gravity - a long-standing interest of NASA's intramural and extramural gravitational physiology users. Its large cage geometry will allow the investigation of a variety of systems, biological and physical, with larger allowed volume than any other ISS centrifugal research device. And it can provide 1-g control conditions for experiments in stationary hardware such as animal and plant habitats. The RCF-QL will have the additional advantage that Techshot is uniquely qualified to provide these space flight services, just as the company has done for PI's on a variety of flight experiments for the nearly 30 years, including, for example, the Techshot rodent Bone Densitometer, and its artificial-gravity payloads such as the Avian Development Facility and the Multi-use Variable-g Platform.","Techshot sees tremendous potential commercial applications for the Rodent Centrifuge Facility - Quad Locker (RCF-QL) in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies where life science research holds promise for cell replacement therapies for bioregenerative diseases. Techshot already has been in talks with pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis and Eli Lilly regarding long-term rodent research aboard the ISS. In addition, the company has a long standing relationship with the CASIS, with which it has been working to identify and facilitate industry users of ISS and Techshot spaceflight hardware technologies. The company also already has conducted multiple recent face-to-face discussions with Robert Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace and Christian Maender of Axiom Space regarding deploying research systems such as the Techshot RCF-QL aboard their respective private commercial orbiting vehicles. Techshot also will commercialize the RCF-QL by incorporating it into the company's spaceflight service catalog it markets to other federal agencies such as NIH, NSF, and DoD.",Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biophysical Utilization; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Medical; Physiological/Psychological Countermeasures

Many NASA trajectory design packages (OTIS, EMTG, MALTO) have already had their own code streamlined, and it is now the serial execution of existing NLP solvers that represents the largest bottleneck. It is the goal of this Phase II effort to further develop the CUA OpenMP Nonlinear Optimization Tool (COMPNOT), which will utilize shared memory systems to significantly improve the time-to-solution of NLP problems. As large-scale shared memory parallel systems, such as Intel’s Xeon Phi family, become more commercially available, COMPNOT will greatly expand the market for a parallel NLP solver, even enabling most modern desktop computers to effectively run it. Phase II will focus largely on creating a distributed/shared memory hybrid mode, enabling COMPNOT to take advantage of the shared memory nodes that comprise large distributed memory systems.  Additionally the development of hardware-specific optimization, focusing on the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), will be a priority. At the end of Phase II, COMPNOT can begin integration into NASA trajectory design packages, significantly reducing the time-to-solution.","NASA currently utilizes SNOPT, IPOPT, and WORHP software packages for astrodynamics applications such as the design of complex spacecraft trajectories and other optimal control problems, but could greatly benefit from the introduction of a parallel large-scale, nonlinear, sparse optimization solution one which does not have its speed bottlenecked by a single processor. The core NLP algorithm proposed to be used in COMPNOT has already been shown to result in a reduction in execution time, thereby reducing the optimization's turn-around time and improve communications between both designers and scientists. COMPNOT would take this effort, and refocus it to multi-core machines so that individual NASA scientists could perform advanced optimizations on a desktop. Our solver would act as a significant force multiplier for existing NASA tools such as GMAT's collocation-based low-thrust transcription and EMTG""s inner loop solver. Additionally, COMPNOT could improve run-times across all forms of problem optimizations, including trajectory design, resource management, attitude determination and control, and vehicle design.","Government agencies other than NASA, as well as commercial markets, would benefit from the improvements inherent in COMPNOT, especially given the widespread use of nonlinear programming techniques as a primary method for solving some of the most difficult technical computing problems. For example, in economics the product-mix with price elasticity problem can be formulated as a nonlinear program and solved with a tool like COMPNOT. Another field that depends heavily on efficient and robust NLP solvers is operations research, with the facility location problem and network optimization problems being archetypal examples of operation research challenges that may be cast as nonlinear programs. Furthermore, industries dealing with problems such as power grid design, weather prediction, and crop planting optimization could benefit from COMPNOT's speed enhancements.","Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Operating Systems; Programming Languages; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Verification/Validation Tools"

Space missions require small size, weight, and power (SWaP) among the hardware components. As a result, monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) are well suited to fill this need. In Phase I of this SBIR, Custom MMIC Design Services, Inc. (Custom MMIC) analyzed a number of commercially available Gallium Nitride (GaN) MMIC process technologies from domestic foundries based in the United States, and selected the optimum process for linear power amplifiers (PAs) - the 0.2 um GaN  process as offered by Northrop Grumman Space and Technology (NGST). Custom MMIC’s use of novel small- and large-signal linear power amplifier (PA) circuit design techniques led to circuit simulations exhibiting a large signal gain greater than 22 dB from 31.7 to 32.3 GHz, a linear output power of 13 W, input and output return losses of better than -20 dB, a PAE of 41% PAE, and an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 4.5% for 8PSK 500 MHz modulation. In addition, Custom MMIC’s use of the balanced amplifier topology allowed the simultaneous independent optimization of input/output return losses and internal PA impedances for linearity and PAE. As a result, Custom MMIC has produced a design that represents a new industry state-of-the-art benchmark for linear Ka-Band GaN MMIC PAs.  In Phase II, we will develop not only the MMIC hardware that represents this design for JPL at Ka-Band (31.8 - 32.3 GHz) but also a similar linear PA for GSFC at K-Band (25.5  - 27 GHz) and a saturated radar PA for JPL at 35 GHz.","The improvements and innovations achieved during the Phase I portion of this 10-20 W, KA-Band GaN MMIC PA and subsequently manufactured in a follow-on Phase II will allow us to develop other state-of-the-art, linear, high efficiency PAs for NASA at other frequency bands. Specifically, Custom MMIC can apply these Phase I results to improve the 5 W, 25 to 27 GHz Power Amplifier as previously developed for NASA Goddard, and the 5 W, 35 GHz Power Amplifier for Radar Applications as previously developed for NASA JPL, such that both amplifiers can be increased to greater than 10 W output power with better PAE.  Other NASA Applications could be 1) NASA deep space missions that require high data rate Ka-Band downlinks, 2) Mass, power and volume challenged surface missions to moons, asteroids and comets (such as Europa Lander), and 3) Future NASA instruments that require Ka-Band radars (such as Mars 2020).","Linear GaN PA MMICs represent a new frontier in microwave research and development, though to date few manufacturers have been able to turn such efforts into viable commercial products. Custom MMIC is one such company that has made the successful transition from design to production on a number of GaN amplifiers, and so is well suited to bring an expanded portfolio of new GaN amplifiers to the market in a timely and efficient manner. Custom MMIC will use the follow-on Phase II SBIR contract to bring a number of new 10-20 W, Ka-band high power amplifiers to the commercial space.The 25-27 GHz GaN 5 W linear amplifier is being well received in the commercial markets. A customer has already designed it into a new product and we are transitioning to production. We are in discussions with this customer as to whether the performance can be improved. It is likely that when this SBIR program transitions to Phase II we would also target this lower frequency band for a 10 W linear variant.","Ad-Hoc Networks (see also Sensors); Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Microwave; Radiometric; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport); Transmitters/Receivers"

However, the cost to develop and procure this type of antenna prohibits this technology from widespread use. The proposed innovation substantially reduces the control complexity of phased arrays by reducing the control set from MxN phase controls to M+N phase controls where M and N represent the number of rows and columns in the phased array. By reducing the control complexity, not only are the phased array devices simplified, but the control distribution network is substantially reduced. This simplification ripples across the entire phased array to improve physical integration and thermal management which often cost as much as the phased array components. This is particularly important for high frequency antennas where unit cell sizes become a significant impediment to system implementation. This proposal summarizes the Phase I SBIR findings definitively demonstrating the phased array innovation feasibility and applicability to future NASA Ka band communications and sensors. This phased array technology does not rely on future advancements in device technology and controls but is realizable using proven, inherently radiation hardened MMIC device technology widely available today. A prototype demonstration is proposed that will operate from 25.25 to 27.5 GHz with 8 dBm output power at each unit cell to illustrate millimeter wave phased array capabilities.","There is a growing list of small satellite and cube satellite missions enabled by industry advances in very capable, low power and miniature digital signal processing hardware. Because the proposed phased array development is expected to result in significantly lower system costs, this phased array technology should be considered for small satellite payload and data transfer subsystems. By providing a communication solution that can be electronically steered, spacecraft attitude management is simplified allowing the payload to point at the primary target longer without interruption for data off-loading. Furthermore, by lowering antenna system costs, larger apertures can be deployed to significantly improve EIRP and G/T metrics essential for long range, high throughput capacity links. A high gain, electronically steered antenna at millimeter waves in Low Earth Orbit can reduce ground station antenna sizes enabling the deployment of small ground stations to avoid scarce resource conflicts. There is also the possibility of making the Ka band antenna compatible with K/Ka band SATCOM links to provide an additional means of transporting data or command and control messaging. The proposed phased array technology not only reduces the cost of millimeter wave phased arrays but enables significant bandwidths (20% or greater) to support commercial, military and NASA spectrum. One potential mission is replacement of gimbaled Ka band antennas on JPSS-3 & JPSS-4.","The proposed phased array beamforming architecture is a significant breakthrough in phased array technology. By drastically reducing the uniquely addressed (and routed) commands to steer electrically large phased arrays, the overall system cost is reduced associated with phased array integration. This is often an overlooked subsystem when attempting to reduce phased array system costs. The control distribution network often impacts how the phased array is temperature controlled by adding significantly to the backside physical interconnects eliminating critical surface area for thermal controls. The proposed technology can directly improve existing large phased array systems used for radar or communications. However, the low cost potential does sacrifice exquisite performance levels typically attributed to tracking radar systems that have the ability to adaptively null jamming signals or achieve very low sidelobe levels due to unit cell controls that have been eliminated with this architecture. Nevertheless, the proposed beamforming architecture can enable phased array application to mobile communication markets where spatial diversification is required for high capacity and frequency re-use. These markets include satellite communications such as for inflight entertainment and 5G high speed microcells. Other applications include sensors for Counter UAS or missile seekers where microwave and millimeter wave offers avenues for small size.",Antennas; Electromagnetic

For most trace gas species switching accuracy on the order of 10 MHz is also required. Further complications for many DIAL systems are that the platform moves (airborne or space craft) and that the lasers are often high peak power, pulsed lasers. The combination of a moving platform, pulsed laser, and the requirement that the online and offline measurements be made in essentially the same volume implies that the online/offline switching time be less than ~ 1 ms, and many cases even shorter. To date, most lasers used in DIAL systems rely on piezo-electric (PZT) mechanisms for the cavity length changes needed for the frequency switching. Typically this limits wavelength switching speeds to a few hundred Hz. This relatively slow frequency switching prevents researchers from fully exploiting DIAL systems utilizing the high efficiency, multi-kHz lasers or the lower repetition rate, dual pulse lasers systems that are now available.

Our approach to the proposed locking module was an innovative synthesis of all electro-optic (EO) based switching and locking, a compact and efficient EO driver design that reduces voltage requirements by 4x over conventional designs, a novel EO voltage profile that eliminates electrochromic darkening, and a larger off-set locking capability that eliminates the requirement for an additional phase shifter in the cavity.

Multiple NASA researchers have been developing three wavelength (1064 nm, 532 nm, and 355 nm) High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) systems as candidate lidars for the ACE mission.2) 3-D Winds: Space-based measurement of winds has been identified as a critical mission for enhancing both weather and climate modeling. 355 nm airborne demonstrators for this mission include a direct detection wind lidar that was built at GSFC and an Optical Auto-Covariance Wind Lidar (OAWL) being developed at Ball Aerospace.3) Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM): A scaled up version of the 355 nm pumped Ozone DIAL system being developed at NASA Langley is a strong contender for the GACM mission for global ozone measurements.4) NASA Langley High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO): This is an ongoing lidar development program for airborne measurements of methane and water vapor. Our proposed high speed locking and switching technology is critical for achieving the desired performance for the 1 kHz, 1 m pump lasers and the optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) used to generate the 1.65 um and 1.57 um beams used to measure methane and water vapor.","In addition to our NASA customers, Fibertek does significant lidar development work with various DoD agencies that would benefit from the proposed effort. Two specific examples are briefly described below.1) Single-frequency blue lasers for use in underwater communications: Since the early 1970's the U.S. Navy has made major investments (>$100M) in attempts to develop single-frequency blue lidar systems for underwater communications. Fibertek has supported these development efforts and anticipates that the successful development of the proposed technology would enhance our chances of winning future business in this area.2) Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) systems for precision air drop: An unmet need for the Army is a compact and robust DWL system that could be used to quantify the vector wind fields in the vicinity of regions where supplies will be dropped from medium to high altitude aircraft. The technology proposed here would enhance Fibertek's ability to respond and compete in this business area.",Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)

The Phase II component of this goal is to fully test the performance characteristics of a prototype deployable antenna reflector, with an aperture greater than 0.5 m under controlled conditions. The mesh used in the reflector is gold plated molybdenum. The weave of the mesh will be developed early in Phase II to achieve the tight tolerances required for operation up to 100 GHz (W-Band). Characterization measurements of the currently available mesh have been completed and will be used as a baseline to quantify improvements measured from the newly developed mesh samples.

Such a reflector antenna can be used for active and passive microwave remote sensing, communication systems, and other applications. Apertures up to 2 m can use a similar approach, operating up to 100 GHz.

Such compact antennas have a potential to significantly lower NASA costs for Earth observing systems and enable Solar system exploration with much more compact spacecrafts, such as CubeSats. This reduction in costs and the increased operational frequency of the proposed antenna would allow the creation of CubeSat constellations for the same cost as a single traditional satellite, such as ATMS.  This has the potential to significantly increase the revisit time of a specific area for a given mission, drastically improving the utility of such applications.

Box 7804, Loveland, CO 80537 - 0804",(970) 290-6426,3,6,"MMA has proposed a technical approach creates a highly simplistic antenna architecture by taking advantage of natural mechanics of high-strain composite materials to create a 1D parabolic reflector surface. At smaller scales (1-2 m2), the architecture allows continuous reflector surfaces for ESPA-class spacecraft, while at larger scales a modular architecture is taken advantage of to produce much larger apertures without requiring comparatively large spacecraft. The effort will develop a large aperture at Ku, Ka, and W frequencies using rollable shell surfaces that combine the surface accuracy of rigid reflectors with the packaging advantages of flexible reflectors.  Developing a stowable, “morphing”, high-strain composite reflector surface with sufficient surface roughness and position knowledge for frequencies up to 94 GHz will enable large apertures with reduced stowed envelope and can dramatically reduce the hardware, instrument and mission implementation costs. Originally inspired by the shape of a beam being deflected under load, MMA is using analysis and lab testing to determine the prescribed loading configuration capable of deflecting a semi-rigid member into a parabolic curve. By using the mechanics of bending rather than molding and manufacturing to prescribe the reflector’s shape, the system provides a repeatable method of forming a parabolic surface. This architecture lends itself to a structurally simple system, providing high reliability and low complexity. Phase I efforts demonstrated through analysis and prototyping that loading conditions exist for isotropic beams to form a surface closely matching a parabola, while RF performance simulations verified the reflector’s ability to perform with minimal gain losses up to 95 GHz. The phase II effort will build upon this early development to design, build, and test a deployable tri-band antenna system.","NASA utilizes multi-band radar for precipitation and moisture related weather monitoring instruments. Recent missions have incorporated large, expensive antenna systems that drive large mission costs such as the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission ($1B). The availability of a relatively large aperture (2 square meters) that performs at Ku/Ka/W frequencies but can stow in a small volume (~.001 cubic meters) enables missions to be conducted on much smaller, less expensive satellite platforms (300-400 kg ESPA/ESPA Grande) that can be launched as secondary payloads on larger rockets, or utilize many of the emerging lower cost rockets for a dedicated launch. This approach supports rapid deployment of experimental missions as well a mission which utilizes multiple satellites in a constellation to provide faster revisit times and also enables instrument upgrades and rapid, low cost replacement/replenishment.The broad frequency capabilities of this antenna technology also support commercialization into other RF applications required by NASA including communications, other applications of RF remote sensing and imaging, etc.","The same economic drivers that support NASA commercialization of this technology apply to non-NASA markets. The DoD, foreign countries, and commercial interests are all in need of improved, timely weather data.The U.S. military has expressed interest in smaller, lower cost, dis-aggregated satellite system architectures that support rapid upgrades and replacements. This technology can support such efforts in precipitation measurement, hurricanes, ocean surface winds and many more weather needs with more accurate and timely data availability from low earth orbits. Many countries suffer the negative effects of typhoons and hurricanes and actively fund low cost weather satellite missions that can be greatly enhanced by this antenna technology.Commercial entities are also potential data consumers for such efforts as disaster relief and assessments of weather damage, agricultural impacts, etc.As mentioned above, the wide band capability of this technology also supports a wide range of other RF applications that will also drive commercialization of this antenna/reflector technology.",Electromagnetic; Microwave; Radio

However, the full potential of Type-II superlattice has not been fully explored and alternate superlattice architectures hold great promise. Despite demonstration of SWIR photodetectors based on this material system, there has been no report about Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors that have been sensitive to visible light. We propose to develop Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors and focal plane arrays for NASA's imaging and spectroscopy applications in the spectral band from visible to extended short-wavelength infrared (0.4–2.5 um) with a very low dark current density. In mid- and long-wavelength infrared spectral bands, Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors already offers performance comparable to the state-of-the-art mercury cadmium telluride but at a fraction of the cost due to the leveraging of commercial growth and process equipment. Our goal is to extend that benefit into the short-wavelength infrared. Using the best material currently available and a novel bandgap-engineering design and process, we will fabricate photodetectors and, ultimately, focal plane arrays.","In Phase I, we are going to demonstrate photodetector designs based on Type-II superlattices, which can cover spectral range between 0.4 to 2.5 um with a very low dark current density (<10^(-11) A/cm2) at temperatures below 100 K.. In Phase II, we are going to continue reduction of the dark current density to <10^(-13) A/cm2-level at temperatures below 100K.

Visible-SWIR imaging will be able to identify the type of vegetation that is present and whether the vegetation is healthy. It can provide a benchmark on the state of the worlds ecosystems against which future changes can be assessed. Moreover this imaging method can assess the pre-eruptive behavior of volcanoes and the likelihood of future eruptions as well as the carbon and other gases released from wildfires.

LongWave Photonics is proposing to develop a high power, frequency tunable, phase/frequency-locked, single mode, External Cavity THz quantum cascade laser (ECT-QCL) system with >2 mW average power output and a clear path to increase the power to >10 mW. The system includes a THz QC gain chip based on SISP or metal-metal waveguide with an integrated horn or lens structure to reduce facet reflectivity.

The gain chip will be packaged in a high-reliability Stirling cycle cooler with all external component integrated under the same enclosure.","NASA applications include the use of the QCL as an LO for >2 THz receivers for future missions. Here the narrow linewidth (<100 kHz) of the QCLs can be used to resolve Doppler-limited low-pressure gasses (~MHz linewidth). The external cavity QCL LO will be a frequency tunable, compact replacement for any gas-laser LO. The resulting source will be a compact, reliable, table-top sized THz high power with narrow linewidth . It will be an easy-to-use platform for NASA researchers to study the performance of other key components in the receiver such as Schottky or HEB mixers. THz QC gain chip can also be used as the power amplifier providing gain for solid-state frequency multiplier or as the low noise preamplifier in the heterodyne receiver to reduce overall noise temperature.","Initial applications for this technology are mainly research markets for low-pressure gas spectroscopy. The narrow line width and the ability to provide real-time frequency information and frequency tunability of THz radiation also has great appeal. Another potential application is to replace THz gas laser used for THz detector power calibration. Long-term applications include industrial uses for trace gas detection.

The use of lattice-matched bulk GaN substrates provides low dark/leakage current by minimizing defects from the substrate, while alternately AlN substrates can be used to provide backside-illuminated, high fill factor UV-APD devices. In addition to low dark current noise, the solid-state UV-APD devices demonstrate high quantum efficiencies with very high avalanche gains (>10^5). For the Phase II SBIR effort, we shall model, design, develop, and demonstrate the AlGaN UV-APD array technology for implementation in future NASA missions. We will work with NASA for modelling UV-APD arrays for performance improvements in NASA Earth Science systems. Magnolia will collaborate with Prof. Russ Dupuis of Georgia Tech, an expert in III-N material growth and device technology, for MOCVD growth, fabrication, and characterization of the UV-APD array devices. This will entail the enhancement of surface passivation techniques for further performance improvements, developing high quality, low resistivity n- and p-type contacts, as well as incorporating antireflection coatings. It is expected based on measurement data that these devices can perform in Geiger-mode at ~355 nm with high single-photon detection efficiencies for operation in photon-starved environments.

A variety of research studies funded by NASA, DOE and NOAA tomeasure the fluxes of CO2 from average conditions have been performed. In particular, flux measurements of CO2 in the boundary layer are critical toward understanding the carbon budget for this important greenhouse gas. The World Meteorological Organization has met its goal of 0.1 ppm CO2 accuracy for land based field sensors with gas chromatography and nondispersive infrared instruments. However, these instruments are poorly suited for small aerial platforms because of their high power requirements, large size and/or weight specifications. This proposal directly addresses NASA's need for high accuracy, small aerial platform, CO2 instrumentation for their Sierra and Dragon Eye UAVs, other unmanned aircraft such as launched and tethered balloons, and remote, unattended ground platforms where low power, compactness and self calibration are important. This instruments fits in with NASA's Technology Roadmap for satellite validation under the ASCENDS program and the OCO2 mission, as well as independent high resolution, nonintegrated CO2 profiles.To address this instrumentation need, Southwest Sciences has  developed a compact (< 1 L), low power (< 2 watts), light weight (<1kg) diode laser based instrument to measure dry air corrected CO2 concentrations.  Phase I was successfully completed. We achieved the Phase III targets in Phase I with a drift accuracy of <1 ppm at >1 hr and short term precision of 0.2 ppm at 1 second under static conditions. Over a 300 torr pressure range, 12°C temperature range, and 1.6% water addition, the system  successfully measured within a standard deviationof 0.7, 0.8 and 0.4 ppm respectively of the actual concentration. The source of deviation was well characterized in Phase I and can be further reduced in Phase II.","High accuracy, dry air corrected CO2 instruments for UAVs and manned aircraft would bridge the gap between current land based and satellite platforms.  NASA would have new tools for making high accuracy mixing ratio measurements where manned airborne observations are risky (i.e. North Slope of Alaska) or for manned flights to replace current commercial instruments that are not meeting NASA's requirements with respect to speed, precision, and/or accuracy.","A direct commercial application of this project is the sale of research and environmental monitoring instrumentation to academic researchers, government agencies for large research and monitoring programs, and commercial entities for regulatory compliance applications.  Although this proposal initially targeted UAVs and can be extended to manned aircraft, it can be further adapted as a rack mount and even as a hand held ultra portable instrument.

Given the high launch cost and shift toward smaller payloads, reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of space-based navigation systems is a critical need. Atom-interferometric inertial sensors have demonstrated superior performance over conventional inertial devices owing to the intrinsic stability of atomic systems. Central to making cold atom sensors practical is their ability to reliably operate for extended periods without user intervention. Current laser diodes, which are at the heart of atomic sensors, suffer from power degradation and mode hops on timescales incompatible with long term deployment. Because these properties are inherent to the diodes, it is prudent to circumvent these problems with diagnostic protocols aimed at early detection and action. Diodes close to mode hopping can be temporarily taken offline to tune away the mode hop via current and temperature. Diodes with degraded power can be taken offline entirely in favor of a healthy diode. This approach will provide a robust, wavelength-agnostic technique to deliver reliable, long-lived laser sources at atom sensor-relevant wavelengths. AOSense proposes to develop a cold atom laser module (CALM) capable of supporting a broad range of atomic sensors. Development of the CALM laser module will result in a ruggedized and reliable laser source capable of autonomously driving an atom-based sensor within the space environment. Such an effort would enable space-based applications for atomic sensors such as IMUs, clocks, and magnetometers, opening up significant market opportunities in the defense and commercial sectors.","Frequency stabilized lasers are at the heart of atomic sensors and their robust operation will be required for any future NASA mission that relies upon an atomic sensor. Atom interferometric sensors can be configured as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity sensors, magnetometers or precision time keeping devices. In each case they are best-in-class sensors and have the potential to enable new missions and applications of interest to NASA. Atom interferometers configured for gravity sensing can be used to map the earth's gravity gradient from orbit or to characterize the mass distribution of an asteroid for redirect missions. Atomic magnetometers offer the potential for improved remote sensing of magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients and could be used for precise characterization and monitoring of magnetic fields from orbit. Gyroscopes and accelerometers based on atom interferometry can provide orders of magnitude increases in inertial sensitivity which could lead to dramatic improvements in navigation and guidance systems. Ultra-precise atomic based gravity sensors and optical clocks could provide new methods for detection of gravity waves and tests of general relativity. Finally, robust frequency stabilized lasers are useful for non-atomic applications such as LiDAR and coherent laser communications.","Robust frequency stabilized lasers will also benefit the development of atomic sensors for non-NASA applications. Atom interferometric sensors can be configured as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity sensors, magnetometers or precision time keeping devices and therefore can be applied to a wide range of military platforms in addition to commercial applications. Precision navigation systems based on atom interferometric inertial sensors have the potential to provide precision positioning in environments where GPS signals are not available. Atomic gravimeters and gravity gradient sensors can be used for geophysical exploration and homeland security applications.

When integrated into a mico mass spectrometer the instrument can be used for air monitoring and breath analysis for future human habitation in space.","An ultra-compact UV laser nominally operating at 262 nm can be used in advanced research and development and industrial manufacturing such as micro-material processing for the manufacturing of printed circuit boards and electronics. UV lasers are used in biotechnology and medical markets for sterilization and disinfection of devices. UV lasers are used in cosmetic dentistry mainly to facilitate chemical bonding and bleaching of organic enamels and other procedures. Atomic and molecular spectroscopy and chemical dynamics are additional experimental uses for UV lasers. With the removal of a nonlinear crystal, this laser can operate at a 532 nm which is suitable for treatment of glaucoma. Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty and Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty use green lasers for glaucoma treatment. They are used to open up the drainage angle of the eye, allowing easier flow of fluid and relieving pressure in the eye.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Characterization; Lasers (Machining/Materials Processing); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Minerals; Prototyping; Ultraviolet"

WOLFEChip uses cutting-edge laser micromachining to fabricate fully-three-dimensional optical elements that focus excitation laser light into a MCE microchannel to excite fluorescence. The fluorescence emission is collected using custom-designed high-numerical aperture collection optics immune to misalignment of the chip up to 1-mm. This improves on current and past implementations of MCE-LIF by (1) greatly miniaturizing the optical elements which comprise a significant amount of space in MCE-LIF systems; (2) making the entire LIF optical system monolithic and immune to misalignment which greatly enhances the vibration-resistance of the entire system; (3) making the system immune to operator-to-operator variations caused by the periodic need to carefully align traditional MCE-LIF systems; and (4) greatly reducing measured stray light and thereby potentially increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MCE-LIF system by employing right-angle excitation/emission optical geometries and through the use of high-quality fluorescence-free fused silica. LMT will deliver a complete MCE-LIF system featuring a refined WOLFEChip design created in Phase I.","WOLFECHip is especially well-suited for detecting life on Ocean Worlds in the solar system (e.g., Europa, Titan, Enceladus) as well as other smaller bodies (e.g., asteroids, comets) and rocky planets (e.g., Mars). For the detection of life, an unambiguous, highly-sensitive, definitive approach is required and MCE-LIF is an ideal technique for detecting life by measuring the relative abundance and chirality of amino acids and other important biomarkers. Key benefits of MCE-LIF for space exploration include: (1) its levels of detection are orders-of-magnitude lower than more traditional high-TRL gas chromatography approaches; (2) the technique uses minute volumes of reagents; (3) the instrumentation inherently requires very little power and mass; and (4) MCE-LIF is highly-suitable for dealing with liquid samples. WOLFEChip will be a great stride towards further miniaturizing and ruggedizing MCE-LIF hardware for upcoming mission opportunities by fully integrating the critical LIF optics on-chip thereby reducing mass, size, and the need for mechanical stability/alignment of external optical systems to micro-scale features.","WOLFECHip technology allows MCE-LIF systems to be ruggedized and maintained by less-skilled personnel and so has many uses outside of NASA. Due to its sensitivity, specificity, portability (both in terms of mass and ruggedness), and flexibility it can be used in many different situations including (1) environmental research of terrestrial and marine waters (e.g., detecting important biomarkers or nutrient sources); (2) process control and monitoring of closed water systems (e.g., Naval shipboard water monitoring, water treatment centers); (3) pharmaceutical research; (4) monitoring and identification of organic pollution in water, soils, and sediments (e.g., pesticides, fuels, drugs); (5) the detection of biological and chemical weapons. Advantages of WOLFEChip over existing electrophoresis technologies are its portability (enabled by its size and its rugged optofluidic implementation of LIF), resolution (MCE-LIF is inherently higher-resolution than CE due to the injected plug size), and operator-to-operator invariance (other MCE-LIF systems require an operator to manually align optics into a MCE chip, leading to LIF efficiencies varying based on the skill of the operator; WOLFEChip uses integrated optics to avoid this). In Phase III, LMT will seek to establish commercial relationships with vendors of MCE-LIF systems for marketing commercial-implementations of WOLFEChip to environmental scientists, water-quality monitoring authorities, and the United States Navy.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Lenses; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Prototyping"

In preparation for such a mission, spacecraft will have to pass through clouds of ice particulates, which will pose challanges in organic species collection, and possible damage to instruments. Accordingly, there is a need for simulating the production of hyper velocity ice in the size range of 50nm through 2 microns. The NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range was designed to propell solid projectiles for studying the effects of meteorite impacts on celestial bodies and potential micro-meteoroid damage to spacecraft. “At the far end of the barrel, a gunpowder explosion is used to compress hydrogen gas to as much as 1 million times atmospheric pressure, firing a projectile pellet at speeds between 7,000 and 15,000 mph”. This approach is not suitable for ice particles, so we have developed a novel ice gun using electrosprays that can achieve a hyper velocity net result without damage to the sample grain.","In order for NASA to probe plumes that produce ice particulates, a source for creating high speed particles is required to see whether a spacecraft can pass through and collect samples without denaturing the trace organics sought that may indicate the presence of life. Our system offers a means to create a bolt-on ""ice-gun"" source for any NASA facility, allowing studies on water fountain emissions, but for the simulation of comet tail media, organic molecule production from hyper-velocity impacts, and for re-entry simulation research.","Non-NASA applications might include possible micro cleaning applications like particulate bombardment on silicon chips or other surfaces in vacuum.

The technical achievements included: 1) first high quality mirror with carbon nanotubes 2) First nanotubes grown on metallic coatings  3) Dark patterned carbon nanotubes  with micron-scaled features.   During Phase II we will work with the NASA and STScI collaborators to determine how to improve these components and deliver second generation components to extend the performance of the STScI test bed in support of implementation on future NASA missions such as HABEX or UVOIRS.  In addition we will work with NASA collaborators to design and fabricate carbon nanotube coated Lyot Stops for the Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC) test bed, also of key importance to the decadal missions referenced above.  Lastly, we plan to collaborate with the LISA telescope team at NASA GSFC to design and fabricate a carbon nanotube apodization mask on a powered secondary mirror that could be used in single crystal silicon telescope as a pathfinder for LISA.  One of the technical goals of Phase II are to pattern more complex Lyot Stop geometries while maintaining geometrical accuracy through the nanotube growth process.  Further optimization of the apodization masks for coronagrahic use include: 1) increasing the metallic coating reflectance to near ideal  2)  optimization of the nanotube darkness on the metallic coatings 3) greyscale patterning of carbon nanotubes and medium reflectance coatings on the mirrors to achieve enhanced diffraction suppression.  For the LISA telescope diffraction spoiler application we will demonstrate patterning and growth of carbon nanotubes at the micron scale which when combined with metallic nanostructures can provide enhanced field suppression; another enabling technology to NASA missions.","Stray-light and diffraction suppression is critical to NASA instrumentation because it improves signal to noise and observational efficiency in high contrast regions present in Earth, solar and coronagraphic applications. The PI and ANP/LC have delivered a large variety of instrument components including, baffles, stops, tubes and beam dumps. Development of a process compatible with reflective coatings and high quality optics for this SBIR, will enable an entirely new class of components and instrumentation for scientific observations. NASA requires calibrators for all manner of instruments to allow scientific data to be of the highest accuracy. On-mirror diffraction suppression is enabling for e-LISA as the telescope is used in duplex and requires extreme suppression of the the high power transmitted beam. This is also a challenge in Laser Communications and of great interest to NASA that will be addressed by this SBIR. Carbon nanotubes have the highest emissivity ever measured and arenearly ideal in this respect. We expect that further enhancement of the rob ustness of carbon nanotube coatings demonstrated in this SBIR will result in the use of this technology on more NASA instruments. The PI has built and tested carbon nanotube absorber thermal detectors with superconducting transition edge detectors; a modified CVD process will make the use of carbon nanotube absorbers compatible with more detector technologies.","During Phase I of this SBIR we developed coatings and chemical vapor deposition processes compatible with high surface quality single crystal silicon mirrors.  Phase II will continue optimization of these optical components for NASA and commercial use.  We believe that this technology can be applied to autonomous vehicle imaging where stringent stray light control is required to enable robust operation in challenging lighting conditions.  In addition, success during Phase I has initiated collaborative efforts with the Swatch group, who are interested in patterning nanotubes on gold or silver coated substrates for high end watches.

The methods, being applicable to produce high-performance deformable mirrors with a large variety of pixel densities and actuator counts, are also proposed to seamlessly integrate the DM manufacturing process with a novel large-scale driver ASIC, hence an enhancement of the proposed batch manufacturing process by reliably packaging DMs with high yield, zero failure pixel, and with high optical qualities, and on top of these offering the demanded high-resolution mirror surface control. Low payload, high performance, low cost, and low power, are the four keys that can lead a DM to successful implementation into NASA's high-performance systems. For lab testing, concept inspiration, and concept validation, the AO communities need high-performance but low-cost DMs to study wide variety of AO concepts on a tight budget and in a timely fashion; on the other hand, once an AO concept is approved, a space-based adaptive optics system will additionally demand low payload and low power dissipation for space-based deployment. The proposed DM manufacturing and ASIC integration  aims to develop DMs to meet the two staged needs through one joint DM-ASIC development program.","In general, future high-performance systems for: (1) correction of aberrations in large-aperture, space-deployed optical interferometers and telescopes, (2) high-resolution imaging and communication through atmospheric turbulence, (3) laser beam steering, and (4) optical path alignment, (5) propagation of directed laser energy through atmospheric turbulence, will require deformable mirror (DM) wavefront correctors with several hundred to millions of elements. More specifically, NASA missions and instruments that would benefit from the proposed DM manufacturing/packaging technology are WFIRST (near future), Visible Nulling Coronagraph (VNC), single aperture far-infrared observatory (SAFIR), Extrasolar Planetary Imaging Coronagraph (EPIC), and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF).

The proposed work focuses on a technology gap that NASA has identified as critical for space-based exoplanet imaging: production techniques for small-stroke, high-reliability, high-precision deformable mirror systems. The main objective in this Phase II project is to substantially increase the state-of-the-art for the number of actuators in a compact MEMS DM system using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) production processes and employing a multiple-layer approach to integrating routing line layers in the device. MEMS DMs will be bonded to custom manufactured printed circuit boards using conductive epoxy bonds and flip-chip alignment based on a new stencil printing process demonstrated in the Phase I project. The proposed work includes testing and evaluation of surface topography of DMs before and after bonding and assessment of actuator yield and reliability.","High-actuator-count deformable mirrors have a few astronomical NASA commercial applications. The following applications apply to all Boston Micromachines (BMC) mirrors that will benefit from new manufacturing processes developed for this program and from subsequent reduced cost. Astronomy: Post applications in this category can be broken into two categories: space telescopes and ground-based telescopes. In the case of space telescopes, there are a number of missions/mission concepts that require the wavefront control provided by the proposed high actuator count deformable mirrors.  These include the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) telescopes. For ground-based telescopes, BMC has already had success developing arrays up to 4096 actuators for the Gemini Planet Imager and multiple smaller devices for high contrast imaging testbeds at Nanjing University, Space Telescope Science Institute, and University of Nice.

Increasing actuator count and reducing cost of fabrication will enable users to purchase higher-resolution equipment at a lower cost for use in detecting disease. Modalities affected include two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF), second- and/or third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG), and 4Pi microscopy, coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) and super-resolution localization microscopy techniques.

Using FCP is as simple as spraying or brushing it on a surface of interest, allowing it to dry for 15 minutes, and stripping off the rugged coating when desired. Multiple measurements, including at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, show that FCP cleans better than any existing method, including the complicated, expensive, and hazardous CO2 snow, leaving no detectible residue. FCP is used to clean telescope optics at the Keck Observatory, GTC in the Canary Islands, Vandenberg Airforce Base, etc. The polymer was used by LIGO to clean the optics that enabled its breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves, and enables the THAAD missile interceptor by protecting and cleaning its optics. FCP was even used at the Smithsonian Institute to clean irreplaceable gems such as the Hope Diamond, demonstrating potential uses far beyond optics. Our technology is a crosscutting solution enabling the demanding cleanliness requirements of the Exo-S Starshade probe’s occulter, reducing the duration and cost of meeting Planetary Protection requirements without damaging sensitive components, and providing cleanroom-level cleanliness without the cleanroom, including for semiconductor manufacturing. Since our Red FCP exhibits anomalously high adhesion to certain metals and the amorphous metallic glass of Starshade petal edges, we developed in Phase I a variant with lower adhesion to metals. While the resulting adhesion was too low to be optimal, it demonstrated the adhesion tunability of our product. In Phase II, we produce 18 variants, identifying the lowest-cost one that provides optimal adhesion to protect, clean, and minimize the contribution of peeling to a mission’s alignment error budget. We also develop Standard Operation Procedures and training for application and removal.","Our surface-specific stripcoatings will provide superior cleaning & protection from recontamination.

For example, the LIGO experiment used our FCP to clean the optics that enabled its breakthrough gravitational-wave discoveries. As in LIGO, the contamination control requirements for the Starshade and the Large Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) missions are so demanding that without the performance level of our technology, we believe those missions will not launch. LISA was recently selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) for its third large Cosmic Vision mission, while Starshades are seen as a key technology for the HabEx mission, currently under study.

Our technology development roadmap shows production of the first meter-class mirror segments in time for the 2020 Decadal Survey, and an excellent solution for multiple Priority 1, 2 and 3 Technology Gaps identified in the COR 2016 and 2017 PATRs. Our meter-class 3d/AM silicon carbide segments will meet or exceed all NASA requirements for the primary mirror of a FIR Surveyor such as the Origins Space Telescope (OST), and may also provide a solution for the LUVOIR Surveyor.

A cost of $60K to 3D print/AM  large segments looks readily achievable, as does an optical surface that has nanometer-scale tolerances. Our encapsulated lattice construction provides a uniform CTE throughout the part for dimensional stability, incredible specific stiffness, and the added benefit of cryo-damping.

In recent years, GEO satellite service providers, such as DirecTV, have been requesting more powerful satellites to handle the wider bandwidth needed to keep up with the data demand (DirecTV now offers 4K video). To meet broadband internet demand, companies have turned to LEO satellites, which due to their closer proximity to Earth, have a lower delay of signal (latency) over a GEO satellite. This is important for broadband internet given it is a two-way communication.

The potential business opportunity of expanding the PML capacitor market to that of high voltage and high capacitance MLCs, which are prone to micro-cracking, are costly and have inferior dielectric properties, will be explored.","Radioisotope power systems (RPS), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) and Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) are programs that will directly benefit from this development. Hall thruster PPUs voltage requirements include a 120V input for a 300V direct drive.  Also, roll-out photovoltaic arrays are tailored to 120V and 300V for SEP applications. These are voltage ratings that are ideally suited to PML capacitors. In addition to the higher voltage DC-link capacitors targeted by this program, lower voltage PML capacitor can replace tantalum (Ta) capacitors that are commonly used in many aerospace systems.  When compared to Ta capacitors, the prismatic PML parts have a wider voltage range, higher frequency response, superior lower temperature performance and lower Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR), which often forces the use of multiple capacitors in parallel to reduce heat dissipation.","Capacitors are used in most all electrical and electronic systems ranging from consumer electronics, to industrial electronics, medical instrumentation, transportation, communications and defense. DC-Link capacitors are needed to absorb ripple currents and transient voltage pulses created by switching devices such as IGBT, IGCT and MOSFETs used to convert lower DC voltage to higher DC and AC voltages. The proposed PML DC-link capacitors, have applications in inverter circuits used in renewable energy power generation systems, including photovoltaics and wind power generation, hybrid and electric vehicles and modular energy storage systems tied to the smart grid. PML capacitors are smaller, they have lower cost and higher performance, which will improve life and reliability of power converters. Hybrid and electric automotive drives will particularly benefit from the higher temperature and lower volume and weight of PML capacitors.  Sigma Technology has partnered with several automotive OEMs and Tier-1 automotive suppliers and is in the process of supplying PML capacitor samples for evaluation.  Unlike the surface mount PML parts developed for NASA these are larger capacitors, that carry 100s of Amps and will be used to replace metallized polypropylene capacitors which are larger that PML and have temperature limitations.",Conversion; Distribution/Management

The high resolution, low quiescence and extreme throttling capabilities of Busek electrospray propulsion, combined with the customizable moment arms afforded by ROCCORs compact deployables will ensure the system is applicable to a wide variety of mission concepts.  A preliminary performance map was obtained for the BET-1mN thruster, demonstrating hundreds’ of µN’s of thrust from a single emitter.  Time of flight measurements indicated mixed mode operation (droplets/ions), indicating that updated thrust control algorithms may be necessary, as present implementations focus on droplet or ion dominated emission.  Thrust modulations were demonstrated via control of flow rate and beam voltage, demonstrating deep throttling and operation over a wide range of conditions.  Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) for two integrated BET-1mN thruster systems were provided to the ROCCOR LLC and used to develop requirements for the boom.  A notional 2m deployable boom design was developed and static load modeling performed to identify deflection.  Under the Phase II effort, Busek shall update test setups to include in-situ mass flow measurement during direct thrust measurement in order to fully assess thruster performance.  Additional thruster characterization shall focus on completing parameterized thruster performance while also measuring thrust noise, stability, and capturing electrospray plume sweeps.  Updated thrust control algorithms will be implemented in hardware/firmware and commanded thrust control demonstrated as part of an integrated test with the BET-1mN thruster.  Deployable boom requirements will be updated and a prototype boom fabricated and tested.  Static load testing will be performed to validate Phase I modeling results.","The proposed technology has numerous applications NASA missions improving both scientific and practical capabilities. Precision pointing applications include astronomical science objectives, such as exoplanet observations or other space-telescopes, laser communications and space situational awareness. In all cases, the greatly improved pointing over existing SoA (e.g reaction wheels) afforded by the proposed technology would both enhance pointing accuracy/stability and reduce the need for complex vibration and control accuracy mitigation strategies such as the use of active optics (e.g. fast steering mirrors). Laser communication benefits are particularly relevant with active NASA programs pursuing, for example, optical communication for Mars missions.  Space situation awareness and identification of solar system objects would benefit from an ability to precisely track commanded attitude profiles while holding target positions <1 pixel. In this manner, long integration times can be facilitated permitting resolution of extremely dim (small) objects.  The system developed here also applications to highly precise position control including formation flight missions and those requiring disturbance free flight. Disturbance reduction has been recently demonstrated in space by Busek's colloid thrusters, larger than those proposed here, on the NASA ST-7/ESA LISA Pathfinder mission.","Potential non-NASA customers include, international partners (such as ESA), the DoD and commercial EO missions. The readily configurable nature of the proposed technology would enable customized applications to simultaneously meet customer needs in precision pointing and disturbance compensation; therefore, maximizing the commercial applicability of the technology. Furthermore, the ability to scale both thrust output and boom moment arm, by virtue of Busek and ROCCOR's respective scalable technologies, enables rapid customization of the system. Commercial EO applications may include optical communication pointing supporting high bandwidth up/downlinks or precision pointing in earth orbit for earth observation organizations.

The Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS) will use the existing flight radio, antenna, attitude determination and control, and other subsystems of the spacecraft to provide the host spacecraft with an autonomously generated absolute position estimate. CAPS is a peer-to-peer navigation solution that is a self-sustaining, scalable, and evolvable innovation that operationalizes and leverages investments made in algorithms, flight computers, and radios over the past decade. CAPS can be thought of as a subsystem of a host spacecraft that can process inter-spacecraft range and range-rate measurements between multiple spacecraft in cislunar space to determine absolute position estimates for all participating spacecraft. The focus of the proposed effort is to design and develop key software components that will prepare CAPS for flight demonstrations and ultimately broad adoption by future missions to the lunar vicinity.","There are many potential customers for CAPS. Applications that benefit NASA are the first priority. These missions include missions such as Orion EM-1, Lunar Flashlight, Lunar Ice Cube, LunaH-Map, Skyfire, Orion EM-2-5, Deep Space Gateway Power and Propulsion Element, Deep Space Gateway Habitat, Resource Prospector, and MoonRise to name a subset. Ultimately any mission operating in orbit around or on the surface of the Moon would be a potential key customer. Notably, missions that include distributed scientific sensing platforms would particularly benefit from the capability that CAPS would deliver.","Other potential customers for CAPS include commercial companies such as lander and orbiter activities. Further market opportunities are expected in support of international customers. A convergence of science and exploration missions at or around the Moon is expected in the coming years, which will be accompanied by numerous commercial and international missions.

Two-phase pumped loops are an ideal solution for these applications. A critical need for these pumped loops is a microgravity-compatible evaporator having a large cooling area to maintain the temperatures of multiple electronics and instruments. The evaporator must be able to accommodate multiple heat loads with a wide range of heat flux densities and allow heat loads to be mounted on any available locations of its cooling surfaces to facilitate vehicle-level system integration. To this end, Creare proposes to develop a lightweight, compact evaporator with innovative internal design features to adaptively distribute liquid refrigerant to heated areas, preventing dryout in areas with high heat flux. This advanced flow distribution feature reduces liquid recirculation flow in the pumped loop and thus the system power input. The design features also provide strong internal structural support for the evaporator, reducing the size and mass of the evaporator cover plates. In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of the evaporator by developing a preliminary evaporator design, predicting its overall performance, and demonstrating its key performance features and fabrication processes by testing. In Phase II, we will optimize the evaporator design, fabricate a 0.5 m x 0.5 m evaporator, demonstrate its steady state and transient performance in a representative pumped loop, and deliver it to NASA JPL for further performance evaluation.","The proposed evaporator will enable reliable two-phase pumped loops for efficient and precision thermal control of critical instruments in remote sensing science satellites and exploration vehicles, including a future mission to Saturn's moon Enceladus and the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

Luna’s revolutionary technology measures the distributed tension and curvature of a tether that connects a rover to its base station and can identify pinch points, snags, or high tension. Previous SBIR programs with NASA JPL have demonstrated the capabilities of a 50m tether to identify a snag location with JPL’s Axel Rover, and proved the feasibility of future miniaturization of the tether’s acquisition system.  During this multiphase effort, Luna is building upon these successes to extend the sensing length to 1000m, to enable NASA to pursue more complex exploration missions, such as navigating a large crater to study features on the crater wall. During Phase I, Luna demonstrated the feasibility of sensing tension up to 800m, and curvature up to 400m, and added a spot scan mode to enable fast update rates over a short section of the tether.  In addition to increasing the sensing length for curvature measurements, during this Phase II Luna will increase the system robustness and deliver a prototype acquisition system, 1000m extended length tether, and a shorter 50m tether for testing at JPL.","The NASA market for self-sensing tethers is focused on missions featuring robotic exploration, especially using the Axel rover. NASA is planning specific missions including Mid-Size Rovers, Astrobiology Field Lab, Network Landers, Europa Explorer, and Titan-Enceladus Explorer to bring back samples from comets, asteroids, and the lunar south polar basin, and Mars.

Consequently, significant propellant mass will be required. While it is technically feasible to generate O2 and CO propellants by electrolysis of CO2 from the Martian atmosphere, it will only work on bodies where there is significant CO2 in the atmosphere, and the mass of the required infrastructure (electrolyzer, batteries, solar panels) is substantial. A recent study showed that a hybrid rocket with multi-start capability trades more favorably than either a CO2 electrolysis system or a bipropellant system where the propellants are generated on Earth. Using a high-performance hybrid propellant combination and being able to restart the hybrid rocket are the keys. In previous and ongoing work, Ultramet has demonstrated that electrically heated open-cell silicon carbide foam can be used as an igniter for both monopropellant and bipropellant rocket engines. Due to its low mass, excellent oxidation resistance, and favorable electrical characteristics, the foam can be heated to 1300°C in just seconds, which enables it to quickly ignite any propellant flowing through it. The Phase I project demonstrated that a foam heater could be turned on and off any number of times and that it was capable of heating oxygen and igniting paraffin. Applied to a portion of the oxidizer stream in a hybrid rocket engine, this will provide multi-start capability. In Phase II, Ultramet will team with Parabilis Space Technologies to design, fabricate, and test a hybrid rocket ignition system suitable for use with O2, NTO, or MON-25 on a Mars ascent vehicle.","This technology will initially be targeted at hybrid rockets, and the near-term application will be hybrid rockets for a Mars sample return mission. More generally, foam-based heaters that are amenable to use at high temperatures in highly oxidizing environments can be used as igniters for virtually any non-hypergolic propellant combination. These include O2/CO, LOX/CH4, LOX/ethanol, and LOX/RP-1 among others. They can also be used to ignite hydrazine, as well as ionic liquid monopropellants such as LMP-103S and the E, Q, and A blends of AF-M315. This makes the technology applicable to engines of virtually any thrust class, from large booster engines to small attitude control engines. Specific missions of interest to NASA include ascent/descent engines for missions to Mars, the Moon, other planetary moons, and asteroids.","This technology can be used for igniting non-hypergolic bipropellants, ionic liquid monopropellants, and hydrazine in main and attitude control engines on commercial and military spacecraft, as well as main and reaction control engines on commercial and military boosters. Other aerospace applications include ignition systems and catalyst preheaters for aeropropulsion turbine engines and air heaters for hypersonic wind tunnels similar to the Aerodynamic and Propulsion Test Unit at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC).

Sliding experiments showed low friction and wear of the superhard-faced composites at both low and high temperatures. The measured wear against sand and dust was so low that it could not be detected. In contrast, all other tested materials experienced rapid abrasive wear. Most importantly, a low-cost method to produce large area fabric reinforced diamond composites for tribological applications has been developed. The primary trust of Phase II will be to optimize the processing technology for producing tribological surfaces and bearings, and to evaluate their performance in extreme environments, such as that encountered in high temperature exploration of Venus. We will continue to collaborate with NASA and industrial partners to optimize and scale the new processing technology, and to fabricate prototype bearings for performance testing at NASA’s test facility. Hence NASA will acquire patented technology and qualified supplier of superhard-faced composite bearings to operate in extreme planetary environments.","In addition to high performance bearings, potential applications include diamond substrates for radiation-resistant electronic equipment, silicon-based circuits and chips.","Since the superhard-faced composites that we are developing and optimizing experience low wear in hot corrosive environments, and are relatively inexpensive to produce, they can be used in reciprocating engines, rotary engines, rock drill bits, high-speed machining, and many other applications.",Simulation & Modeling; Structures; Tribology

As these capabilities are designed and then progressively improved, there is a coupled need for mechanisms to sustain them. There is to date no global decision support system for flood disasters that ingests all the data from existing systems and provides real-time critical information that can guide operational reactions on the ground. Because these capabilities evolve over time, any such interoperable system must incorporate changes and improvements thereof, it must be flexible, and itself robust and able to be maintained into the future. These challenges are addressed in this SBIR where Remote Sensing Solutions collaborates with existing efforts of the Dartmouth Flood Observatory to develop an interoperable one-stop-shop based on open geospatial data standards that unifies information relevant to flood disaster response. Four primary objectives have been defined to achieve this goal (product, i.e. data layer, design; system development; demonstration; commercialization plan). The technical approach to meet the objectives is streamlined into specific work packages, each one including a milestone target to ensure successful project completion.","We plan to keep the proposed system flexible enough to accommodate data from future flood-related missions, such as the post-launch data products of the NASA/CNES SWOT mission, and the water level product planned for ICESat-2 (also ESA?s Sentinel 3). Also for pre-mission projects, in particular to the mission Science Definition Team (SDT) and Science Team (ST), such a DSS system proves very valuable since it provides a global viewing and analysis platform of many available geospatial data layers from major satellite missions as well as models. The proposed DSS will be developed in close collaboration with relevant partners and stakeholders from all kinds of economic sectors. This will ensure maximum impact of a ?one-stop-shop? for flood disaster response that meets the top priority requirements of each community active in flood response, thereby greatly facilitating operations. Also for the NASA Applied Science Disasters Program, the DSS will be a very valuable resource for assisting disaster response.This SBIR project will also help support continuation of the very successful GEO/CEOS Flood Pilot that ends officially in December 2017. In fact, the PI and many others on this team, including the NASA and non-NASA advisors have been active contributors to the Flood Pilot and would like to continue such activities, and such could be easily done under the auspices of this SBIR project.","For commercialization, the team envisages ?paid access? to the DSS to ensure ongoing maintenance, upgrades and sustainability of the DSS. This would allow full free access to scientists, researchers, the development aid sector and government organizations as well as NGOs. The team has identified the following two target customer groups to engage with: (i) Geospatial data and information management companies; Flood modeling vendor companies; (re-) insurance companies; mortgage lenders/banking industry; (ii) Emergency response organizations; humanitarian agencies; development aid organizations.Note that the team has already engaged with most of the above identified end users/customers. See for instance attached Letter of Interest from a potential industry sector. Also, the team collaborates with the UN WFP, the World Bank and FEMA on a regular basis.Potential users and customers include a large variety of actors operating in flood disaster response. The following list of selected development partners for Phase I and II provides an idea of the multitude of organizations that we expect to be using the proposed DSS: FEMA, USGS, NGA, StormCenter Communications Inc., Center for Space Research (CSR), JPL ARIA, World Bank, UN WFP, CEOS, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST)/ ESA, Louisiana Department of Transportation (LA DOT).","Analytical Methods; Command & Control; Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Data Processing; Display; Image Processing; Knowledge Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

The resulting design offers the potential for light-weight and simple design with high efficiency and durability. This effort would be valuable to NASA as it would significantly reduce the known spacecraft technical risks and increase mission capability/durability/efficiency while at the same time increasing the TRL of regenerative solid oxide systems for ISRU application. The technology concept of our highly-efficient regenerative Solid Oxide Stack was demonstrated in Phase I and will be advanced in Phase II.","The primary target application is for an advanced regenerative solid oxide fuel cell/electrolyzer that enables a balanced C-H-O cycle supporting multiple mission critical purposes within a sustainable Martian ISRU system.

Cycle life is limited by migration of dissolved polysulfide species which creates an electrochemical short circuit.  In this NASA SBIR, Navitas Systems proposes to develop an atomically precise and bifunctional membrane separator for lithium sulfur batteries that impedes polysulfide transport.  Bifunctionality will combine pore structure engineered for high capacity and selectivity to polysulfides with metal-like electronic conductivity to support electrochemical regeneration.  Phase I results showed that the proposed separator significantly improves the energy density and cycle life of lithium sulfur batteries. The Phase I proof of concept effort focused on validating the membrane materials property advantages in lab prototype cells.  Phase II will scale up production of separator using high volume roll-to-roll (R2R) coating.  Phase II will demonstrate separator robustness to automated high-speed cell assembly operations and to variation in the porous polymer substrate.  Membrane performance, cycle life, and abuse tolerance advantages will be validated in commercially relevant prototype pouch cells with at least 2Ah capacity.  Phase II technical objectives are to reduce coating thickness to <5 µm, continuously coat at least 20m of separator, demonstrate a 400 Wh/kg lithium sulfur battery cell with 200% improvement in cycle life, and show immunity to thermal runaway under NASA mission-relevant abuse testing protocols..","High energy lithium sulfur batteries can safely provide 500+ Wh/kg and potentially reduce the mass of energy storage systems by up to 50%.  Through improving cycle life, the proposed separator advance will address the key limitation for space applications.  With improved cycle life, lithium sulfur batteries will meet multi-use or cross platform space energy storage applications.  Successfully deployed safe lithium-sulfur batteries would result in significant mass and volume savings and operational flexibility.

NES has demonstrated and is building a 1 kW TAPS for use in remote power applications where reliability for 15+ years is of paramount importance. Moreover, NES is developing the Thermoacoustic Radioisotope Generator (TRG), a 300 W Radioisotope Power System (RPS), under the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program for NASA based on TAPS technology. The novel TAPS technology has no hot moving parts and incorporates well proven, reliable linear motors and alternators in an engine based on the Stirling cycle. NES has designed, optimized, built and tested all sub-systems for reliability, ease of manufacturing and cost reduction over currently available Stirling engines. The TRG is a 300 W tunable power thermoacoustic device which is insensitive to radioisotope heat degradation, capable of 20+ years continuous operation, is inexpensive to manufacture using well established methods, and yields greater than 25% thermal to electrical efficiency all while being designed for a convertor specific power greater than 30 W/kg and anticipated system specific power near 10 W/kg. The 1 kW remote power device served as the foundation for the Linear Acoustic Nuclear Conversion Engine (LANCE), which will satisfy all of the Z1.03 solicitation requirements, as a robust and redundant 2.5 kW tunable power supply, representing the ultimate in remote power devices and the next step in reliable dynamic power conversion for space.","The primary goal of LANCE is to develop a thermal-to-electrical power conversion system that produces 2.5 kW of net electrical output, has >25% efficiency, and durability for a lifetime of greater than 10 years. Due to the significant manufacturing and assemble cost reductions afforded by the TAPS architecture over traditional free piston Stirling systems the TAPS solution could be used as a direct replacement over traditional thermoelectric or other Stirling based systems in future space missions. Future NASA missions would benefit greatly from the cost-reductions afforded by the TAPS system as well as its modularity and relative ease of assembly. Furthermore, the TAPS technology enables architectures that are difficult, or impossible with other systems. Specifically, TAPS can easily be utilized for a combined power and cooling duplex, and some preliminary designs have been created. Such systems would enable a sustained presence in extreme planetary environments such as the surface of Venus.","Nirvana Energy Systems is currently working to commercialize the NASA technology through an exclusive patent license granted for the Alpha-STREAM technology that the TAPS technology is partially based on. The NES TAPS technology could be easily adapted to home use where high efficiencies are possible and the unit would function as a micro-Combined Heating and Power system. In an installation such as this the TAPS unit could be natural gas fed, where to achieve overall high system efficiencies the unit would utilize excess heat to provide heated water for potable needs or for hydroponic heating. Excess electrical energy production would be sent to the grid. Similar to applications for home power generation, other applications include commercial businesses, military uses (vehicles and domesticated areas), and the transportation industry. In particular, these industries desire higher electrical outputs and efficiencies but with long-term reliability and cost of ownership being of critical importance as well. The TAPS architecture would be able to provide all of these as it is a ""set and forget"" power generation system capable of tunable output powers at high efficiencies. Moreover, the reverse cycle of the TAPS system could be used for cooling in many cases, including as a refrigerant free domestic cooling system.",Conversion; Generation

This includes verifying the valve cycle life and valve leakage amounts.  Similar valves designed by WASK Engineering have operated for more than 2x109 cycles while maintaining a leakage rate of less than 1x10-3 sccm of He. The current valve design is configured to operate with cryogenic propellants and support the flow rates requried for a 100 lbf liquid oxygen/liquid methane thruster.  A piezo actuated valve has many benefits for RCS thrusters. The speed with which the valve can adjust its throttle position means that with two such valves the thruster propellant mixture ratio can be rapidly adjusted to preventhardware damage. The valves have the ability to continuously throttle over a range of thrust levels, allowing the thruster to operate from zero to full thrust. The piezo crystals use very little power, reducing the overall power consumption, again reducing weight.","Potential NASA applications include extremely durable, high-performance, low cost RCS systems for manned space flight to support high performance propulsion requirements such as orbit transfer, descent, ascent and pulsing attitude control.  The ability to throttle makes the control very effective, as the impulse bit can be adjusted from large to very small depending on the immediate requirement.  This has the benefit of simplifying the control system due to the very small minimum impulse bit possible.  These valves can also be used as propellant valves for small monopropellant and bipropellant thrusters.  This is especially the case if throttling is desired in the thrusters.","The valve is applicable for propellant flow control to both cryogenic and non-cryogenic thrusters.  We are already in discussions with a potential customer for application of the valve developed in the Phase 1 effort to gaseous RCS thrusters.  The size, availability, reliability, low power consumption, and very high response rate are all features that have helped generate the interest in the valve.  We are also examining the potential of increasing the flow rate through the valve to provide a wider range of applicability to the valve. These applications include the ability to act as a pressure and flow regulator, the ability to eliminate pressure regulators from a system due to the ability of the valve to throttle, and as a valve for cold gas thrusters where the rapid valve response allows the generation of very small impulse bits for precision control applications.",Actuators & Motors; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Pressure & Vacuum Systems

The primary goal is to develop a versatile proof of concept CSSP, capable of pumping liquid or two-phase methane or oxygen at a wide range of speeds (i.e. 1,000-8,000 RPM) and a wide range of differential pressures while maintaining high-reliability and a compact size. The pump will be configurable, to allow multiple pumps to be placed in series for high-pressure multi-stage operation. During Phase I, Air Squared successfully designed, fabricated and tested a prototype CSSP on liquid nitrogen.","For Cryogenic pumping, state of the art (SOA), consists of two vastly different technology options. Centrifugal turbopumps and positive displacement pumps. Turbopumps utilize an impeller-inducer combination that relies on high impeller speeds to create a differential pressure. While the high-speed operation makes turbopumps compact, it also limits bearing life, differential pressure, and they can't handle two-phase flow. Positive displacement pumps can handle larger pressure differentials and don't have issues with two-phase flow. However, they can't achieve speeds over 3,000 RPM without bulky and high-load bearings making them less desirable for aerospace applications.The CSSP offers the best of both options. As a positive displacement pump, it can achieve high-pressures with minimal reduction in flow and pump saturated liquids at low net-positive suction heads. Due to the spinning motion of the pump, various centrifugal loads are eliminated allowing speeds over 8,000 RPM possible and making the design compact and lightweight. Additionally, the spinning motion of the scrolls eliminates the need for a counterbalance common in orbiting scroll designs. This further reduces weight by eliminating counterweights and eases bearing loads. Air Squared believes the proposed CSSP is a perfect fit in support of Methane In-space Propulsion.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  The CSSP delivers improved flow, pressure and two-phase flow capability of cryogenic pumping to achieve NASA�s goal of methane in space propulsion for scalably sized spacecraft. A single or linked CSSP could be integrated into satellites or a spacecraft�s reaction control system to increase fuel flow rates and pressure providing better flexibility and dexterity during docking and landing. RES systems allow for altitude, translation, and rotational control and the CSSP would allow such systems to be integrated on to potentially larger or smaller modules. The CSSP minimizes space and weight needs while significantly improving fuel flow rate and pressure, allowing better engineering optimization for NASA modular spacecraft.The CSSP enables efficient, low or zero boil-off cryogenic systems by circulating cryogenic helium gas from a cryocooler to broad area thermal shields surrounding the tanks. This would eliminate the need for high-efficiency heat exchangers that are required with ambient temperature circulator pumps. The pump would also enable thermodynamic vent systems in which cryo propellants are dropped in pressure and temperature and heat exchanged with liquid pumped in a circulation loop within the tank. The development of a long life, variable speed, and low leakage pump would add flexibility to NASA satellite and surface to space spacecraft.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; Hydrogen has been identified as a potentially game-changing fuel by the aerospace industry, however, the necessary heavy cryogenic fuel tanks and low-pressure pumps have handicapped successful research and development. Integration of CSSP in hydrogen aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles would improve fuel delivery, reduce fuel tank size, and become a critical component of lightweight aircraft. The estimated weight savings of the proposed pump is over 400 pounds per aircraft. The scroll pump would be a significant contributor to increased aircraft endurance and payload. Several aerospace leaders, including Boeing and AeroViromnet, already partner with Air Squared and demonstrate a niche market for the CSSP for next-generation aircraft with both the Department of Defense and commercial research and development.Another commercial application would be a liquid natural gas pump, for LNG rail transport. SOA offers only limited options for positive displacement LNG pumps of which the CSSP two-phase fuel delivery and variable pressure operations could be disruptive. Progress Rail has already contacted Air Squared about using a positive displacement LNG scroll pump for locomotive transportation and has invested in an Air Squared�s orbiting scroll type LNG pump prototype. The greater reliability and flexible scaling of the CSSP holds vast potential in the next generation cryogenic fuel economy.; ; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems"

However, NTP has been plagued with high uncertainties in cost, schedule and safety, particularly launch safety. To reduce programmatic uncertainty, an unambiguous approach to documenting NTP safety prior to, during and after launch needs to be made. Until recently, the multi-physics models and computing power were not available to perform compelling analyses, and testing is prohibitively expensive, and unrevealing in many cases. This proposal directly addresses programmatic uncertainty by providing benchmarked, definitive product capable of documenting the safety of a NTP system during all launch phases. The proposal takes work performed by the SBC under IR&D which has performed detailed hydrocode modeling of a NTP impacting an unyielding surface from heights of 50 and 150 meters. To initiate the effort, it is important to start with simple compaction model, which was accomplished in Phase I with the Taylor impact simulation.  Instead of a single neutronics code, LPS demonstrated viability with three codes to better insure reliable results.  Phase II will extend this work.  It will continue to update the SCCTE-2 NTR design and include any design modifications by NASA contractors.  The NTR model will be updated to include important peripherals suchs as turbooo pump assemblies, thrust vector control hardware, plumbing and a propellant tank.  These are essential items for a more realistic impact scenario.  Further, during Phase I, LPS determined there are a number of materials whose mechanical database is insufficient for unambiguous hydrocode simulations.  LPS will deliver a comprhensive test program plan, costs and schedule to resolve these deficiencies. The technical readiness will be improved so End to End Software elements are implemented and interfaced with existing system concepts.","LPS is already working with NASA nuclear program managers to integrate the tools, methods, and capabilities of this SBIR into its nuclear launch and operations safety effort, including ground testing and handling.  Indeed, this project, while being used primarily for launch safety analyses and documentation for nuclear thermal propulsion, is equally applicable to all nuclear payloads: nuclear thermal propulsion, nuclear electric power systems for in-space and surface operations and also radioisotope power sources.  There are no current commercial entities capable of providing these services.  At the end of Phase II, LPS will be in a singularly unique position to provide these commercially based, multi-physics modeling capabilities for nuclear safety to NASA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. While primarily directed toward nuclear systems, this capability can be applied to other hazardous payloads, whether launched into space or involved in over-the-road transportation.","Because of the pioneering work performed by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, we now know some NTR configurations are feasible with Low Enriched Uranium (LEU). This will dramatically reduce security and development costs, and result in a more affordable system. Because of the LEU approach, commercial companies may be enticed to become involved, because the costs can be more well defined. The PI and other are looking to engage certain commercial space entities about becoming involved. Some entities which would benefit from this work include Lockheed Martin, Boeing Space Systems, and other defense contractors.  The Missile Defense Agency has been contacted regarding the recrudescence of the neutral particle beam system for missile defense, and space nuclear power would provide the system with the requisite power and maneuverability for mission operations.","Analytical Methods; Knowledge Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Quality/Reliability; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Main Engine; Structures"

To control the arms, grippers, and base, Energid's Actin software toolkit will be extended and applied to control the arms in manipulation and acrobatic modes. Momentum management and conservation is integral to the control during acrobatic mode. Included will be dynamic simulation software that, by leveraging Energid's commercial Actin software, will be cross platform, fast, and feature rich. The simulation, modeling both the Astrobee and the arms, will support design validation efforts as well as mission planning and testing. It will seamlessly transition between simulating terrestrial test beds and the fielded Astrobee. The full system will be validated using a custom hardware testbed and granite table operation.","The arm Energid proposes will advance the application of Astrobee by allowing it to perform more tasks in new ways. The simulation software, which includes both arm and base dynamics and sensors will support NASA and other researchers in exploring algorithms and missions before fielding. The value provided through these applications will lead to additional work for Energid from NASA. Energid will provide support for the arms and simulation software's application on upcoming missions both as a prime contractor and as a supporting subcontractor to large NASA prime contractors.","Energid has sold approximately 400 of its own robots to customers in many fields and markets. This contract will enable Energid to extend these sales into new markets, particularly for use with terrestrial quadcopters. In addition, Energid will license the control and simulation software improvements made to its Actin software toolkit. Actin is delivered as libraries and header files that can be compiled into new software. It is used in ground, air, surface, and undersea environments.  This form of Energid's technology has found application in software for manufacturing, entertainment, agriculture, and oil exploration.  Energid will license the new software and provide services to support it.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)

Dubbed the tensegrital wheel, this unique wheel design emulates the behavior of a variable pressure tire without the need for an inflation system. The construction of the tensegrital wheel is such that it absorbs and diffuses ground forces evenly. The stiffness of the tensegrital wheel can be tuned to match the demands of a given terrain that the wheel is to operate on or can be adjusted on-the-fly. These attributes allow for better adaptation to the terrain thus increasing the amount of thrust that can be generated at the wheel/ground interface, and improving a vehicle’s dynamic response and obstacle negotiation. We assert that the tensegrital wheel can be designed to achieve an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and capacity for long-life specifically in the context of planetary exploration. In Phase I of this SBIR we proved the feasibility of the concept through analysis, testing, and demonstrations. In Phase II we will optimize various tensegrtial wheel designs and advanced the maturity and readiness of this system for filight worthiness.","The tensegrital wheel will benefit future NASA planetary exploration missions by enhancing the mobility and controllability of surface exploration rovers. Potential missions of interest include surface missions to Mars and the Moon. The ability of the tensegrital wheel to better conform to the terrain and its inherent capacity to evenly distribute reaction loads through its structure would result in measurable improvements in in-soil traversability, obstacle climbing, stability, and response to dynamic events. The tesnegrital wheel affords significant advantages over existing wheel systems for planetary rovers. While the structural design of existing wheel systems provides compliance approximating that of a pneumatic tire, such compliance is fixed by the design. Because if the high payload-supporting capacity, very low ground pressure, and scalability this wheel design opens up a number of possibilities in planetary vehicle design and mission capabilities.","Tensegrital wheels could be applied in a variety of vehicles and field machinery in mining, design, construction, farming, and utility industries. What makes the tensegrital wheel a promising option is its adjustable compliance, great payload ratio, low-ground pressure, and scalability. Many military vehicles currently use active control of tire air pressure to adjust compliance of the tires and deal with deflation due to punctures. As with planetary rover systems, using the tensegrity wheel for this application negates the need for pumps, pneumatic lines and pneumatic rotary joints. No pneumatic tire means no risk of puncture. In addition, the tensegrital wheel offers a lightweight alternative to unconventional wheel designs such as Michelin?s TWEEL?.Farm and industrial vehicles can find application for the tensegrital wheel as well. A tractor, for instance, might negotiate cross slopes more safely and effectively by selectively adjusting the compliance of the wheels so that the uphill wheels are more compliant than the downhill wheels providing a measure of center-of-gravity control. Likewise the pose of industrial vehicles such as manlifts can be provided with additional control through the use of the tensegrital wheel technology.",Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Structures; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)

While this toolkit was initially supported by NASA, further support from a large-scaleautomotive client and robotics manufacturers has allowed TRACLabs to mature the code-base for itsdeployment in industrial and commercial contexts. Despite this commercialization success, the capabilitiesof CRAFTSMAN motion control have mainly been focused on a small set of robot-independent trajectorygeneration algorithms, and the deployment of the system has been limited to classes of manipulation taskswhere goals can be represented as spatial waypoints for the robot’s end effectors or navigation systems.","It is the goal of this work to refactor CRAFTSMAN into a more general plugin-based control framework that supports techniques for advanced motion planning, reactive control, and automous stance location.

As future NASA robotics missions are expected to rely heavily on dexterous mobile robots such as Valkyrie, these robots will need sophisticated application development and autonomy software in order to function. Such capable systems will assist humans with tasks such habitat construction or geological excavation or will be required to perform autonomous repair tasks on satellites or Deep Space Gateway. The CRAFTSMAN++ toolkit will allow task developers to program these capabilities while also allowing a human teleoperator to monitor and control these robots to ensure mission success.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; TRACLabs is already working with a large-scale automotive customer to integrate CRAFTSMAN into a production cell at one of their factories.  This ""flexible workcell"" was installed in the Fall of 2017 and continues to operate 24/7 without human supervision.  TRACLabs is currently in negotiations to reproduce the developed cell at another location within the same plant, as well as to adapt the software to additional tasks. The customer's ultimate goal is to build the ""factory of the future"" where robots can adapt quickly to part location or shape variation and can work safely with humans without the need for barriers or other expensive safety equipment.While the mentioned customer has chosen TRACLabs to be their primary software developments for this effort, the need for flexible robot software in industrial applications is becoming increasingly obvious. As the demands for robust & capable systems grows, application software will need to rely less on tools based on precomputed motions, and more on sensor-driven, reactive techniques that can reliably perform complex assembly tasks. Our software will greatly facilitate this goal.

Such architectures can provide increased processing bandwidth and power efficiency for onboard processing applications. However, these advantages come at the cost of increased hardware and software complexity and decreased fault tolerance in the case of commercial technology. As software development is a major cost driver for missions, this increased complexity has the potential to significantly increase cost for future missions. In addition, maintaining mission assurance and fault tolerance is critical.  To address these risks, Troxel Aerospace Industries, Inc. (Troxel Aerospace) proposes to continue develop and commercialize a robust middleware management technology for spacecraft heterogeneous multicore processing systems.  The middleware technology will enable a fault tolerant computing environment that is portable to different processors and is largely transparent to mission applications executing upon the middleware to provide a standardized, resource-aware, fault tolerant interface for configuration management and heterogeneous resource allocation.  This Phase II will include developing the remainder of the middleware, executing a representative application using it across two or three different processor architectures, undertaking a heavy-ion radiation test campaign to quantify its effectiveness in a relevant mission environment, and continuing the commercialization activities begun in Phase I.","The technology under development addresses NASA�s key avionics goals including improved reliability and fault tolerance, increased autonomy, reduced size, weight and power (SWaP), and commonality across spaceflight and ground processing systems put forth in the NASA Crosscutting Technology Roadmap. The technology also enables long-duration crewed missions, space-based observatories, and solar system exploration will require highly reliable, fault-tolerant systems. Communication delays, the challenging orbital dynamics of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), and extreme science missions require increased autonomy for on-board decision infrastructures. Future robotic missions will involve greater complexity and reactivity, which will require increased reliance on autonomy (i.e. advanced onboard processing). Deep-space missions that target active, dynamic, or time-varying phenomena will need robots that can adaptively adjust their configurations and behavior to changing circumstances, and robustly handle uncertainty.  Robotic missions to NEAs will require the decision-making and monitoring processes�currently performed by ground control�to be performed by onboard autonomous systems.  Advanced avionics technologies and approaches are needed to support these challenging missions and are enabled by Troxel Aerospace�s Robust Multicore Middleware.","All non-NASA government and commercial space customers will directly benefit from the technology by obtaining increased onboard processing capability at reduced budget and SWaP cost for such applications as autonomous operations, improved mission processing, and downlink bandwith management.  These features will are enticing to a variety of spacecraft markets including telecommunications, commercial imagery, launch vehicles, ISS re-service vehicles and exo-planetary commercial ventures (e.g. asteroid mining).  The small satellite market will be of great interest given their early adoption of modern multicore technology and desperate need to improve system fault tolerance.  Also, non-space markets that require robust fault tolerance on high-performance multicore processors will also be served by the middleware including: radiation test facilities (e.g. CERN), medical radiation therapy facilities, and other critical performance markets where people�s lives or expensive equipment is at risk such as aircraft, automobile, public transportation, and advanced manufacturing where the same processors targeted by the proposed effort (e.g. ARM-based processors and GPU co-processors) are already deployed.

Leading-edge applications will benefit from the ability to implement high speed interconnect protocols between host processors and system slaves, such as sensors, actuators, power managers, imagers and transceivers.  The development of a Radiation Hardened Double Data Rate (DDR3) embedded memory controller macro is proposed for insertion into digital integrated circuits suitable for scalable single and multi-core processors, special purpose logic functions and scalable memory blocks on a space-qualified, radiation hardened integrated circuit digital fabric.

The Structured ASIC solves the dilemma of balancing performance, cost, risk and time to deployment against alternative solutions.  Scalable, high performance control systems can support a wide range of applications when integrated circuit flexibility is available.  The ability to right-size integrated circuits while adding functional blocks, such as high speed DDR3 memory, while maintaining performance at low costs enables NASA to use this technology across a wide range of programs and applications.

Thus, the thruster is not significantly more massive than a standalone state-of-the-art chemical or electric thruster, but capable of either thrust mode and selectable as mission needs arise. This has several benefits, including the optimization of trajectories using both chemical and electric thrust manuevers as well as a significantly increased mission design space for a single propulsion unit. The propulsion system is capable of both high impulse per unit volume and high thrust per unit volume as the total impulse per unit volume is 1500 N-s/U in the chemical thrust mode and 2750 N-s/U in the electric thrust mode, where either type of manuever could be selected on-the-fly. Operation and high performance in both modes has previously been demonstrated at the single emitter level. The specific objectives for this study are to design and build a cubesat sized multi-emitter thruster and test in both chemical and electrospray modes of operation. Two thrusters will be built and separate chemical and electric thrusters tested in parallel. Then, back-to-back operation of a single thruster will be demonstrated and indirect and direct performance measurements will be acquired. Additionally, the development of the multi-mode monopropellant will be furthered through material compatibility tests and hazard classification. Finally, system level items including PPU and and feed system components will be researched and selected and/or designed.","Multi-mode propulsion fulfills NASA technology needs as outlined in the In-Space Propulsion Technology Roadmap, monopropellant microthrusters and electrospray thrusters, as well as fulfilling needs highlighted by the National Research Council, specifically the need for both chemical and non-chemical propulsion that fulfills the needs for high mobility micro-satellites and extremely fine pointing and positioning for certain astrophysics missions. Research has shown the benefits of multi-mode micropropulsion for NASA missions, including, more efficient small satellite formation flight, optimized attitude control, enhanced transfer rate and useful mass for Jovian missions, more favorable conditions for lunar impact, launch mass savings, and payload mass advantage to GEO. Additionally, the flexibility of the multi-mode propulsion platform allows for a common unit to be used for many different types of missions, eventually reducing both risk and development time for many types of science payload missions.","Multi-mode micropropulsion has potential to meet Air Force needs for fractionated, composable, survivable, autonomous systems, i.e., satellites that can be assembled, tested, and launched within days of operational requirement. Specifically, the large mission design space resulting from ability to select and complete chemical or electric maneuvers at will significantly enhances the capabilities of these 'plug-and-play' satellites. It has potential to impact the exploding small/CubeSat market, an estimated market value of $7.4B, with a predicted 360% increase in launches over the next 5 yrs, and future plans for competing space-based internet constellations. The large mission design space enabled by multi-mode propulsion could be beneficial to this market in that a single, off-the-shelf system is capable of many different types of missions. An entirely new propulsion system would not have to be developed for each mission individually, reducing costs associated with development, testing, and risk. Additionally, the multi-mode capability has been shown to drastically increase the mission capabilities of swarms or constellations of small satellites.",Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Spacecraft Main Engine

While classic PPT technology is mature, it has historically been limited by its propellant load to precision pointing and small delta-V applications. A recent thruster advancement by CUA, Monofilament Vaporization Propulsion (MVP), adapted extrusion 3D printing technology to feed polymer propellant fiber to a resistojet thrust chamber. FPPT leverages this advancement by feeding PTFE fiber to its discharge region, enabling class-leading PPT propellant throughput and variable exposed fuel area. An innovative, highly parallel ceramic capacitor bank dramatically lowers system specific mass. FPPT is inherently safe; its non-pressurized, non-toxic, inert propellant and construction materials minimize range safety concerns. The Phase I effort accumulated more than 582,000 pulses, with thrust-stand measured Ibits from 0.057 – 0.241 mN-s at 960 – 2400 s specific impulse, representing a dramatic enhancement from state-of-art PPT technology. A Phase II 1U FPPT thruster will provide 2200 – 4900 N-s total impulse, enabling 0.4 – 1.0 km/s delta-V for a 5 kg CubeSat.  A 1U design variation with 590 g propellant enables as much as ~10,000 N-s and 2 km/s for a 5 kg CubeSat.  Advancing the technology to a 2U form factor increases propellant mass to 1.4 kg and delta-V to 10.7 km/s for an 8 kg CubeSat. CUA anticipates delivering to NASA a life-tested flight-like > 2,000 N-s 1U integrated system by the end of Phase II including the advanced thruster head with igniter system, PTFE fiber feed system, power processing unit, and control electronics.","Historically, pulsed plasma systems have targeted small delta-V applications such as ACS. With the demonstrated high performance of CUA's FPPT (Isp up to 2400 seconds) and its innovative propellant feed and storage system, FPPT exceeds the goals of the Z8.01 topic and outperforms previous state of the art PPT systems, as well as newer technologies. With an anticipated > 2,000 N-s total impulse from a 1U system, large orbit transfers and even inclination changes of tens of degrees are now available to smaller satellites. The intrinsic safety of FPPT and its inert, unpressurized PTFE propellant position it as a prime candidate for secondary payload missions where costs and logistics are dominated by range safety concerns. The solid propellant has no handling, storage, or operational restrictions. The ease of handling and storage for the solid propellant can extend operation to planetary missions with no additional monitoring or controls. FPPT system unit costs are anticipated to be significantly below competing CubeSat propulsion systems.","Commercial interest in very small satellites continues to grow. In the 1-50 kg satellite sector, launches have shifted from a fairly balanced distribution between civil, government, commercial, and defense (2009-2016) to a distribution dominated by commercial interests. Moving forward, it is more important than ever that these satellites have access to propulsion systems to extend their asset time on orbit. The proposed thruster offers CubeSats and other small satellites a significant propulsion capability with high impulse per unit volume. The FPPT thruster will provide a compact, light-weight, non-hazardous propulsion technology solution that will be made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in DOD, industry, and universities for CubeSat and small-satellite missions. FPPT will require no safety equipment for storage, transportation, integration, and testing, and place no demanding requirements on the launch provider, making it an ideal low-cost solution for industry, research, and academic small-satellite propulsion needs.","Ablative Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine"

The low inertia of CubeSats combined with vibrational disturbances and resolution limitations of state-of-the-art ACS presently limit body-pointing and position control accuracy. Busek’s electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder spacecraft recently demonstrated precision control at nm scales; this work extends that success to CubeSat platforms. Passively fed electrospray thrusters are highly compact, including fully integrated propellant supplies, and are capable of ~100nN thrust control at 10’s of nN noise. Thrust can be throttled over >30x, to a scalable maximum of 10’s of uN.  These traits, combined with >900s Isp enable these systems to replace traditional reaction wheel ACS; improving pointing error from arcsecs to 10’s of milliarcsec.

Task 2 will identify and address impulse limiting mechanisms. Task 3 will develop and validate solutions to known mechanical risks and incorporate evolved requirements into a low-mass engineering-model thruster module. Task 4 will focus on power processing development, targeting a control architecture which maximizes the precision control capabilities of the technology and serves multiple thruster heads. These efforts will converge in Task 5 where engineering model thruster performance will be rigorously evaluated over a complete life demonstration.","NASA's 2015 technology roadmap recognizes the importance of electrospray propulsion to attitude control, formation flight and positioning of small spacecraft. Specific applications benefiting from precision pointing include astronomical missions, planetary (including earth) observations, laser communications and space situational awareness. The greatly improved body pointing afforded by the proposed technology would present designers with previously unobtainable levels of stability and resolution; permitting both lower cost/complexity realization of existing needs and enabling new objectives in these fields. Applications benefiting from highly precise position control include formation flights and missions requiring disturbance free flight. This includes drag-compensation enabling enhanced mission durations at low orbit altitudes below 350km. The proposed work would allow small spacecraft, CubeSats and larger, to benefit from precision control in a manner akin to the NASA Disturbance Reduction System (DRS), featuring Busek thrusters, aboard the LISA Pathfinder mission. Developing a highly featured PPU and controller would also enable other DRS sub-components, such as GSFC contributed control algorithms, to be applied over a wider NASA mission portfolio.  Moreover, through replacing wheels or expanding wheel de-saturation capacity in deep space missions, the proposed work would decrease spacecraft size/complexity and enable new missions.","Compact propulsion systems that are scalable in both thrust and deltaV without loss of performance are an enabling technology for CubeSat missions and therefore have numerous commercial applications.  Potential non-NASA customers include, international partners (such as ESA), the DoD and commercial EO missions. The modular nature of the proposed technology would enable customized applications that simultaneously meet customer needs in precision pointing and disturbance compensation; therefore, maximizing the commercial applicability of the technology. The virtual elimination of vibrational jitter while superseding reaction wheel precision presents a clear competitive advantage. The proposed system would be applicable to a myriad of CubeSat sizes from ~3U to >25kg; the market size is therefore large and includes rapidly growing platforms. Commercial applications may include optical communication alignment for high bandwidth up/downlinks or precision pointing during EO missions in low orbits. De-orbiting applications are particularly relevant to new LEO EO and telecommunication initiatives. International consensus is forming around the need for orbital debris management, which poses risks to functioning space assets. The proposed system could enable precision attitude control and a de-orbit means from a single integrated system; thus reducing the burden of integrating a de-orbit system.","Attitude Determination & Control; Command & Control; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

The Vector-R is a 2-stage pressure-fed, LOX/subcooled propylene commercial small launch vehicle, designed to place up to 60 kg in low earth orbit. Electrically-driven micropumps drive a small portion of each propellant over a novel 3D-printed heat exchanger at the engine to pressurize the tanks. Excess flow can be diverted to the engine as needed.","This approach reduces system mass, complexity and acquisition cost as well as operational costs. It eliminates the need for all high-pressure tanks and associated components. It can be used on any pressure-fed stage, for launch vehicle and in-space application when using high vapor pressure propellants such as LOX/methane or LOX/propane. As such, it is an enabler for missions targeted to use in-situ propellants since the need for a separate pressurant like helium is either greatly reduced or eliminated.","By leveraging Vector’s ongoing commercially-funded Vector-R micro-launcher development, it is possible to reach TRL 6-ready system during Phase II and transition to the Vector-R operations (TRL-9) soon after.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; The technology offers the means of drastically reducing the mass, complexity and cost of pressure-fed propulsion stages employing high vapor pressure propellants like LOX, methane, propylene and propane. The reductions in costs apply to both acquisition and operational costs of propulsive stages since the proposed system is simpler and lighter.   Applications include small launch vehicle stages where turbo-pumps are inefficient and cost-prohibitive. For Vector, the immediate application of the technology which will benefit NASA is the Vector-R launch vehicle. This vehicle is designed to provide dedicated launch services to nanosats up to 60 kg, with planned operations starting in July 2018. Candidate small spacecraft which could benefit from dedicated launch services or reduced launch costs provided by the technology include numerous CubeSats and nanosats in development at NASA or funded by NASA, such as NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative and Educational Launch of Nanosatellites.   Longer-term potential applications include future missions to Mars and other bodies which use pressure-fed systems, whether directly or in conjunction with pump-fed engines. For Mars ascent, this technology is particularly attractive when using in-situ propellants since it eliminates the need for a pressurant like helium. The application of this technology for Mars missions is likely to be years away.; ; POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; With the Vector-R micro-launcher, Vector is positioning itself to provide responsive, dedicated launch to the micro- and nanosat market expected to burgeon in the next few years. Candidate small spacecraft which could benefit from dedicated services or reduced launch costs provided by the technology include commercial entities operating constellations, such Planets (formerly known as Planet Labs) and Google's Terra Bella (formerly known as Skybox Imaging), as well as numerous other CubeSats and nanosats development efforts funded NSF, the Air Force, ORS and SMDC. Aggregators such as Spaceflight Industries would also benefit of the availability of dedicated, responsive launch for their numerous customers, particularly those targeting specific orbits or mission timelines; ; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster"

To address this need, Valley Tech Systems is proposing a SBIR Phase II development of a new solid propulsion Reaction Control System (RCS) that leverages over 12 years and $12M of parallel MDA and USAF controllable solid propulsion missile interceptor and strategic deterrent propulsion technology investments. This new technology will replace older, heavier and less preforming Cold Gas ACS products providing NASA and future launch system providers with increased capability with improved affordability. Our solid RCS is applicable to both a future commercial booster flyout Attitude Control System (ACS) applications and future Post Boost Propulsion System (PBPS) payload delta-v and ACS providing increased satellite orbital insertion accuracies. The Phase II program will mature the new solid RCS technology to a TRL-6 ready for insertion into follow-on commercial launch system integration and flight testing. The result is a new affordable solid RCS that fills an identified critical technical gap for future affordable access to space.","The new Small Satellite Launch Vehicle technology RCS has numerous direct applications including reaction control of launch booster and post boost payload control for small, medium and large satellite applications. In addition, the technology is indirectly applicable to future NASA applications such as: Mars lunar lander propulsion, Mars Ascent Vehicle Reaction Control System (MAV RCS), Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIAD) gas generation, and Towed Glider Air-Launch System (TGALS) applications. Additionally, controllable solid thruster technology is indirectly applicable to future controlled gas generation application for power generation, long duration highly accurate satellite pointing/station keeping and liquid tank pressurization.","The new Small Satellite Launch Vehicle technology is leveraging parallel DoD development efforts that is indirectly being applied to future MDA missile interceptor propulsion Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) and booster ACS applications that yield ship board compatible capability with legacy liquid propulsion system like performance and impulse flexibility. In addition, the USAF is considering in-directly applying the technology to future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Post Boost Propulsion and booster Roll Control System applications, taking advantage of inherent solid propellant affordability, safety, storability and compatibility with parallel Navy nuclear deterrent applications.",Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices

(ASTS) is pleased to propose to continue the development of an additive manufacturing (AM) approach for fabricating bimetallic combustion chambers.  Our chamber design, which is applicable to future NASA small launch vehicles, exploits the combined capabilities of selective laser melting (SLM) and magnetic pulse welding (MPW), in order to reduce manufacturing lead time and cost and to improve quality through ease of inspection.  The chamber will use a two-piece GRCop-84 liner that is inserted and MP welded into a one-piece Inconel 625 structural jacket.  The MPW step will be used to permanently join the two halves of the liner at the throat and the liner itself to the jacket in a structurally sound, watertight manner.  Our structural jacket design includes integral propellant manifolds, which eliminates the time and expense associated with machining or casting separate components and welding them in place.","The benefits of such a design are substantial.  First, it is well understood that for complicated components like a modern combustion chamber, an AM manufacturing approach can drastically reduce cost (by 50% or more) and lead time (weeks instead of months).  Second, our particular design overcomes weaknesses of other additive designs by enabling easy inspection of the printed parts that otherwise would have to undergo CT scanning or X-ray inspection, which has proven to be exceptionally difficult for complex internal geometries like regenerative cooling channels and propellant manifolds.  Third, our basic material and manufacturing approach is scalable to booster class combustion chambers at a rate controlled solely by scaling of the build volumes available in commercial SLM machines (which is occurring rapidly).  In fact, commercial MPW systems are already being used in the automotive industry that can instantaneously weld parts of several meters in length","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words)  An excellent potential NASA application for this technology is the Exploration Upper Stage Engine (EUSE), a high performance (461-s Isp) LOX/hydrogen upper stage engine that will replace the venerable RL10.  Like that predecessor, we fully expect the EUSE to use a closed expander cycle, since it combines exceptional performance with benign turbine environments.  Since that cycle is completely reliant upon increasing the enthalpy of the liquid hydrogen to power the turbopump, the main combustion chamber (MCC) lies at the very heart of success for the EUSE.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters, approximately 150 words); ; One truly commercial opportunity has come to our attention, which we are pursuing with vigor.  Specifically, Virgin Orbit is a commercial ""new space"" entrant that is developing a small two-stage launch vehicle that is sure to benefit from our technology.  Specifically, their second stage engine is a pump-fed, LOX/RP-1 engine that provides 5,000-lbf of vacuum thrust.  To maximize our opportunity to insert this technology, the chamber layout developed under this contract is intended to act as a drop-in replacement for that engine.; ; Atmospheric Propulsion; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Launch Engine/Booster; Metallics; Processing Methods; Spacecraft Main Engine; Surface Propulsion"

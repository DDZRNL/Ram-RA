03-2 A1.01-7655,,Crew Systems Technologies for Improved Airspace Safety and Security,Crew Cerebral Oxygen Monitor,,,,Kurt J. Linden,klinden@spirecorp.com,"One Patriots Park, Bedford, MA 01730-2396",(781)275-6000,,,,,,,"This Phase II SBIR proposal is aimed at developing a non-invasive, optical method for monitoring crew member state of awareness in operational environments.  All active devices used in this monitoring system will consist of commercially available components.  Continuous monitoring of the mental state of personnel engaged in critical activities could provide a means of protection against human performance lapses resulting from unforeseen circumstances.  If a deterioration of the state of awareness of an individual can be detected before that individual's performance is affected, serious accidents or lapses in operator performance could be avoided.  A computer-controlled four-wavelength breadboard cerebral oxygen monitor was designed, fabricated, and demonstrated during Phase I.  Using phantoms with controlled blood-oxygenation levels, high sensitivity and motion artifact rejection by proper algorithm use was demonstrated.  Based on these successful Phase I results, Phase II will miniaturize the system size to a wearable format, and optimize the system performance.  The new cerebral oxygen monitor performance will be evaluated, and more refined algorithms to eliminate motion artifacts will be developed.   A portable, prototype version of this crew cerebral oxygen monitor will be designed, fabricated, evaluated, and delivered to NASA at the completion of the program.","The benefits of the proposed technology are expected to be of importance to the government, industry, transportation and medical sectors of the economy.  For example, transportation crew members are often subject to stress, increasing the possibility of operator mistakes or oversight.  It is important to monitor crew state of awareness so that accidents or lapses in operator performance can be avoided.  The proposed crew cerebral oxygen monitor could be used by truck drivers, airline pilots, train operators, ship captains and respective crew members.  Similar applications exist in other public and private sector industries where staff performance is critical.","NASA applications specifically revolve around real-time, non-invasive monitoring of crew performance and state of mental awareness.  This is of major importance to mission safety and performance.  Brain activity measurements, as determined by direct measurement of cerebral blood oxygenation, are expected to directly monitor crew health, stress level, state of duress, and general performance.  The proposed crew cerebral oxygen monitor holds the potential for providing a completely non-invasive, optical method for achieving reliable, low-cost, monitoring of crew health, providing data that supplements current methods of obtaining related crew health data."
03-2 A1.01-8753,,Crew Systems Technologies for Improved Airspace Safety and Security,Design and Preliminary Evaluation of the r-Gamma Display Concept,,,,Robert  Shaw,fciassoc@aol.com,"1 1/2 South Central Avenue, Fairborn, OH 45324-4716",(937)253-4110,,,,,,,"The objective of this proposed Phase II SBIR effort is to continue Phase I efforts to develop and assess the feasibility of an innovative new flight instrument proposed to replace the traditional Turn Coordinator (or Turn-and-Slip Indicator) currently found in most general aviation (GA) aircraft. The primary innovation is the inclusion of climb-dive information and gyroscopic heading, in addition to the turn-rate information now available, in one low-cost display. In essence, this new ""r-Gamma"" display concept will ""fuse"" flight information on one display that the pilot must now gather and correlate from among five separate indicators whenever the aircraft experiences loss of the Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Heading Indicator (HI) due to vacuum system or gauge failure. The innovative technology that makes this concept feasible and affordable, with a projected cost similar to that of today's Turn Coordinator, is derived from a technique recently developed and flight tested by our firm under an SBIR contract that involved tracking the flightpath of a small USAF sensor vehicle. We firmly believe this concept has the potential to improve significantly the safety of emergency ""partial-panel"" flight operations in GA aircraft.","The principal commercial application of the r-Gamma system is to serve as an improved substitute for the Turn Coordinator currently found in virtually all GA aircraft.  The r-Gamma instrument will provide substantial additional functionality and greatly improved safety for GA aircraft, at price comparable to that of the Turn Coordinator and substantially below that of available alternatives.  There are roughly 200,000 GA aircraft registered in the U.S. alone.  Nearly 70% of those are light single-engine aircraft, probably equipped with conventional Turn Coordinators or equivalent.  Virtually all these, plus additional international customers, will be potential candidates for the r-Gamma system.","Potential NASA applications for the r-Gamma concept are unknown, but this technology could conceivably be applied to any application in which a low-cost solution is required for the estimation of vehicle flightpath in atmospheric environments.  The r-Gamma technology developed under this effort may also be applied to cost-reduction efforts associated with the Synthetic Vision System envisioned by the Aviation Safety Program."

03-2 A1.02-8319,,Propulsion and Airframe Failure Data and Accident Mitigation,Aircraft Based Imaging Probe for the Study of Icing Environments,,,,William D Bachalo,wbachalo@aol.com,"150 Iowa Street, Suite 202, Sunnyvale, CA 94086-6184",(408)737-2364,,,,,,,"Icing environments are of great concern in commercial and military aviation. An aircraft-based, imaging probe is being proposed for the reliable and accurate measurement of liquid water content (LWC) and droplet size distributions in environments variously referred to as freezing rain, freezing drizzle, supercooled drizzle drops, and supercooled large drops (SLD). The innovative aspect of the proposed probe is the use of multiple laser beams (of differing wavelengths) to create high quality shadows of individual particles (droplets and ice crystals) on a 2-d CCD array. Conventional aircraft-based probes such as the OAP suffer from measurement uncertainties arising from the detection of droplets that are out-of-focus. The use of multiple intersecting laser beams will also minimize the background noise created by other particles that may be present along the laser beam path but outside of the measurement volume. Finally, the incorporation of a means for differentiating between ice-crystals and droplets, while counting and measuring both, allows computation of water content in both liquid and solid phases. These innovations, and the other features of the probe to be discussed later, directly address the need for aircraft-based icing monitoring systems that NASA has identified in topic A1.02 of the 2003 SBIR solicitation. The Phase I study has clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the probe. A prototype system will be developed in Phase II.","We have already been approached by NCAR, the US Air Force, UC Santa Cruz, Boeing, and Environment Canada for an imaging probe to meet their current applications. Besides icing cloud characterization, there are a wide ranges of applications for a particle imaging instrument. The obsolescence of the PMS probes has left a market opportunity for new probes based on this advanced technology. There are significant applications requiring an imaging probe for process evaluation and control. For example, in spray drying, the usual light scattering methods fail because the drops are not transparent or homogeneous. In such cases, an imaging system is the best method to use since it is not affected by the peculiarities of the droplet material. Another area deals with research in fire suppression systems used in commercial buildings. A system is needed to characterize sprays from sprinklers and to help develop these systems. No system exists for these applications whereas the number of spray drying processes including food processing, drug manufacturing, and other industrial processes is enormous. One of the complaints about the PDI method is that it cannot cover the entire drop size range in many sprays and that the larger nonspherical drops can produce significant measurement error. The integration of a second method, namely the imaging method, will expand the areas of application of this important diagnostic.","The goal of producing a probe for measuring icing clouds and other cloud drop size distributions is of immediate interest to NASA and other agencies involved in cloud physics and icing research. For example, the NASA Glenn Research Center's IRT tunnel will require at least one probe, and perhaps a couple more for mounting on aircraft. NASA Langley and NASA Ames and Research Centers may also be interested in this probe."

Once proven in the helicopter environment, this life- use estimation system will be of use to a wide variety of transmission systems.  The transmission-life estimating system will include three separate algorithms: an in-flight service monitoring algorithm, a pre-flight and post-flight transmission analysis algorithm, and a component-life tallying algorithm.  The in-flight service monitor will treat the transmission as a whole. The transmission analysis algorithm will determine the transmission's operating parameters from those of its components.  It also will determine the life and reliability of the individual components.  The component-life algorithm will accumulate life and reliability tables.  The Phase I effort developed the algorithms.  In the Phase II effort, the life-use monitor algorithm will be placed in its appropriate hardware and flown in a commercial helicopter to provide an improvement in that aircraft's safety.   Maintenance record comparisons will be made between the predicted maintenance intervals and the present maintenance pattern for the aircraft.  Any increase in flight safety will be documented.  The deliverable product of the Phase II effort will be the on-board life-use monitor.","The cost-effective, reliable use of expensive aerospace and land-based power-transmission systems can be extended with more accurate knowledge of the remaining component and system fatigue lives.  By improving the in-service life estimation associated with these devices, longer reliable service lives can be obtained.  The high costs associated with surprise failures and unscheduled emergency maintenance procedures can be reduced substantially with the use of an in-service life estimator such as the one proposed herein.","The work is in support of NASA's long-range goals.  It impacts every aspect of mechanical drive systems operation and development.  The successful completion of this project can improve aviation safety, reliability, and mitigation of failures.  It will affect cost-effective design and manufacturing for new production engines and can reduce life cycle and maintenance costs."

Upon investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the explosion of the center wing tank (CWT) resulted most likely from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture.  The growing concern of aircraft fuel tank safety has taken an added dimension in the post 9/11 world where both commercial and military aircrafts are vulnerable to terrorist attacks utilizing MANPADS (MAN-Portable Air Defense Systems), explosives in shoe/socks, and small arms fire.  Fuel tanks also need protection from explosions caused by ballistic impact, lightning, and other sources of ignition.  In Phase I,  InnoSense LLC has demonstrated the feasibility of an all-optical oxygen sensor capable of detecting oxygen at 40,000 feet elevation down to the ambient level.  This Phase II proposal discusses how InnoSense LLC would develop a prototype and perform field testing. The project team possesses seventy person-years of optical sensor related hardware and software expertise.  InnoSense has attracted $300,000 in Phase III follow-on funding for further engineering.  Innosense will deliver the prototype to NASA, complete with software, manuals, and schematics.","The upgrading of fuel tanks aboard commercial, freight, military, and corporate jets to avoid potential explosion from fuel vapor will require oxygen sensor.  The current world market totals roughly 40,000 aircraft in service today growing to 60,000 aircraft by 2020.  Other potential applications include monitoring storage tanks containing volatile chemicals (such as hydrogen gas) that can make explosive mixture with oxygen.","The oxygen sensor can be used across all NASA enterprises where measurements in air are needed.  Innovations in the project will minimize calibration needs and reduce crew time during space exploration missions. The sensor platform is amenable to constructing devices for biomedical, materials processing, and environmental applications in space as well as on the surface of the moon and mars.  The sensing device will find applications in lunar outposts and in the International Space Station for monitoring the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) or for combustion studies under microgravity."

While the effective aircraft dynamic properties involved in these events have been extensively studied and understood, similar scrutiny has not been paid to the many aspects of the primary manual control system that converts the pilot control inputs to motions of the control surfaces.  It has often been tacitly assumed that the adoption of fly-by-wire (FBW) systems has eliminated the primary manual control link as an important player in LOC situations. Consequently, the impact of static and dynamic control system effects that distort ""ideal"" pilot to surface relationships, the near absence of manipulator tactile cues for some FBW systems, as well as the total elimination in FBW systems of some favorable cues present in traditional hydro-mechanical systems have not received detailed attention.  The purpose of the Smart-Cue developments proposed herein are to redress this neglect, to develop and, ultimately, to validate remedial manual control systems.","The same improvements to modern manual flight control systems will be available for commercial and military flight control systems. The continuing record of unfavorable pilot-vehicle coupling provides evidence of the need for improvements such as this. The patentable Smart-Cue concept based on dynamic distortion applies to any powered manual control system, including ground vehicle manual control systems. Power steering is a mature application, which works in part because direct links provide dynamic distortion cues, but new concepts in ground vehicle control are being developed that can benefit from this work as well.","Improved aviation safety is a major objective of NASA. This work will contribute towards this goal in two ways. First, improvements to modern manual flight control systems will be developed that will significantly reduce the likelihood of unfavorable pilot-vehicle interactions. These improvements will be available to NASA for their fleet of aircraft and for new NASA vehicles entering flight test. Second, this work will validate an important but largely unrecognized cause of decreased flight safety ? the lack of pilot cues that tell the pilot when the flight control system is acting in a deficient manner."

The magnesium diboride superconductor can be cooled to 20 K by the liquid hydrogen fuel.   The lighter weight coils, especially in the rotor, will enable a lighter weight support structure so the motor weight will be reduced even more for the same horsepower motor.  For this NASA SBIR Phase II our objective is to design, construct, test, and assembly MgB2 rotor coil packs to replace the copper rotor coil packs for the cryogenic motor test bed being built for NASA","Manufacturers of large electrical systems desire to increase the efficiency, and decrease the size of their systems in order to reduce costs. Presently manufacturers' of transformers, motors, generators, fault current limiters, transmission cables, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems are pursuing superconductor wires to achieve these objectives.  To make major cost improvements with superconducting systems, the barriers have been the higher cost of cooling at liquid helium temperature (4K) for traditional metallic superconductors and the high wire cost for ceramic high temperature superconductors at 20-30 K temperatures.  Low cost MgB2 superconductor wires operating at 20-25K can lower the upfront and ongoing operational costs of superconducting systems.","Besides motors for large aircraft, magnesium diboride superconductors can benefit NASA applications for many applications were light weight power components are required such as transformers, inductors, power conditioning.

The goals of this strategy include extending human presence in the solar system culminating in the exploration of Mars.  To accomplish this goal, affordable, new propulsion technologies must be developed.  A key component to this goal will be the development of reusable launch vehicles that use single stage to orbit (SSTO) or two stage to orbit (TSTO) propulsion systems.  These vehicles generate high heat loads and require additional cooling capacity from the fuel, which can get very hot in the process.  Unfortunately when hydrocarbon fuels are heated, carbonaceous deposits (coke) can form in the heat exchanger, reducing heat transfer and potentially inhibiting fuel flow.  If vehicles are reused, then coke accumulation eventually will become a serious problem.  However, if the coke could be removed periodically between missions, then the dangers associated with coke accumulation could be avoided.  In this Phase I project, TDA developed a process to remove these deposits. The process is safe, inexpensive, and is conducted at low temperature and at ambient pressure.","In addition to NASA applications, our process could have several important commercial uses.  The process can be applied to any situation where oxidation at low temperatures is necessary.  For example ozone can be used to clean hydrocarbons from semiconductors, magnetic disks, medical devices, flight hardware, etc.  High temperature processes would damage these components, however at the moderate temperatures required with ozone, these components would not be harmed.  Although ozone has been used, the goal of our project will be to optimize treatment conditions and If our project is successful, significant improvements in cleaning methods could be achieved.","The ability to clean carbon deposits effectively will be critical to the development of reusable, high speed aircraft that must utilize the heat sink capacity of fuel to meet high heat loads generated at high speed.  We have shown that under these conditions coke deposition can be expected and under high heat flux conditions, very thin layers of carbon cause significant increases in the metal wall temperature, possibly reaching temperatures where the material may fail.  Therefore, identifying an effective procedure to remove coke between missions represents enabling technology for the continued development of reusable high speed aircraft."

An innovative Runge-Kutta temporal update was developed to advance all grid levels independently. The feasibility and accuracy of the MRES technology was demonstrated by predicting noise sources and acoustic waves generated by vortex shedding. The Phase I results indicate that the proposed technology will provide up to two orders-of-magnitude reductions in CPU time over existing techniques.

Such applications include combustion instabilities, chemical and biological plume dispersion, missile plume signatures, turbo-machinery, micro-fluidic systems, cavitations, biomedical, electronic cooling, and many others.

In order to provide a more uniform research platform for en route air traffic management research, NASA has recently developed the FACET software package. While FACET incorporates most of the features required for conducting research, it is sometimes necessary to extend its capabilities. However, this can demand a significant programming investment.  The Phase I SBIR project developed the prototype version of scriptable software that allows simpler access to FACET functionality. This software is termed CARAT# (Configurable Airspace Research and Analysis Tool ? Scriptable). The first version of CARAT# is built upon a commercial software platform, while a second version employs a freely available, scriptable environment as its foundation. The use of CARAT# was illustrated by formulating four research problems during the Phase I research. By making the capabilities of FACET accessible to a larger population of researchers, CARAT# can help accelerate the pace of air traffic management research.   The complete version of the CARAT# software will be developed during the Phase II work. Additional research problems will also be formulated. The software will be commercialized to the ATM research community towards the end of Phase II research.","Software developed under the present SBIR project can be used for rapid prototyping of next-generation en route air traffic management  algorithms. This capability can help accelerate the research in the air traffic management area. Modified versions of the software can be used for investigating command and control architectures for multiple UAVs, spacecraft formations and groups of under water vehicles.",NASA researchers working on advanced ATM concepts such as the operation of UAVs in the NAS and wind optimal trajectory computations can accelerate their research using the proposed software environment.

These analyses require many thousands of flights (a flight schedule) that are each accurately defined for every stage of the flight (a flight plan).  Current methods of generating these huge input datasets are costly and time-intensive. The largely manual nature of the current process and lack of existing automation tools leaves great potential for significant errors in the data sets.  We propose to develop a powerful automated system for future demand generation. This tool will be able to input a variety of existing FAA and NASA flight data sets, provide the user with extensive options on defining the future demand data set, and output new flight data sets in formats compatible with major research simulation and analysis tools.  This capability will provide NASA and FAA research programs with significantly better analysis conclusions through the new ability to perform extensive sensitivity studies on new concepts to ensure they are robust to alternate potential future demand scenarios.  This is crucial to ensuring the decision to proceed with a multi-million dollar Decision Support Tool development is robust to alternate future demand possibilities.","The FAA or other international air traffic service providers and transportation consultants can use our product to create future demand for their airport and airspace demand, capacity, noise and emission analysis to support future airport and airspace planning and design efforts. Commercial airlines can combine their internal flight schedules with the future flight demand generated from our product to support flight schedule, terminal, airport gate, and fleet planning and optimization.

These characteristics, in turn, are central to a variety of Air Traffic Management (ATM) decisions that in turn affect delays and efficiency in the National Airspace System (NAS).  There is presently poor knowledge about the airport characteristics at each airport and even less information available about how those characteristics are expected to change in the future.  This lack of knowledge about airports results in inefficient local and national traffic management decisions.  Metron Aviation will develop and test a set of models that generate information about airport configuration and related airport characteristics.  This information, which is not currently available or is of poor quality, will improve traffic management decisions, and automation to support those decisions, both at the airports and on a national scale. This work addresses existing gaps in air traffic management automation technologies.  The proposed technology development promise immediate improvements to the NAS.  Rather than requiring a new tool or system to be deployed, the information generated by this work could be absorbed into existing systems and information networks to transparently improve traffic management on a local and national scale.","Non-NASA applications can be grouped into Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) applications and non-Government applications.  Automation that is capable of recognizing current airport characteristics and predicting what those characteristics will be in the future would likely be deployed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at a large number (e.g., 30-50) of airports.  A variety of TFM decision support systems make assumptions about the airport characteristics studied in this SBIR.  Availability of accurate current information and predictions could transparently improve those systems.  NAS users, especially air carriers, are interested in much of the information the proposed work would generate.

NASA is responsible for continuing to advance air traffic management automation and, therefore, this work is directly relevant to NASA's technology need.  The proposed technology promises immediate improvements to the NAS.  Rather than requiring a new tool to be deployed, the results of this work can be used by existing systems to transparently improve traffic management on a local and national scale.  Existing SMS prediction algorithms that use airport configuration information will be refined or replaced as part of Phase 2 while NASA can use the technology as part of advanced surface automation research.  The configuration recognition capability developed in Phase 2 can be used to provide necessary truth data for post-analysis of SMS performance.

HOELDS uniquely combines multiple high-power laser diode bars with holographic optical elements, efficient thermal management and innovative focusing optics to achieve a 600 W, 100-micron focused spot for DMD materials processing.  The 7-kilogram, 0.1 cubic meter HOELDS system will be ten times as energy efficient as current 1000 kilogram, 20 cubic meter DMD systems, making in-space DMD processing possible for the first time. HOELDS can process aluminum, which is extremely difficult for state-of-the art DMD systems. In Phase I, POC developed a preliminary HOELDS system, theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and component specifications leading to a proof-of-concept prototype. Melting of lead-tin solder with this prototype was demonstrated at NASA Marshall Space Center. The Phase II effort will optimize the system design, optimize fabrication of the holographic optical elements, and scale up the system into a compact high-power HOELDS system prototype capable of DMD.  The prototype system will be performance tested for in-space DMD, and will be space qualified.","Potential non-NASA applications for HOELDS technology include U.S. Army rapid miniature part production and part repair on the battlefield, on-the-spot metal repair and rebuilding on U.S. Navy ships at sea.  All research labs, government or private,  have a use for rapid prototyping capability, and a portable, efficient, inexpensive system like HOELDS will be an attractive technology.  Likewise, any manufacturer that needs rapid prototyping for models, testing, or replacement parts would want this type of system.  Any aircraft company or shipping company could use the crack- and leak-repair capabilities of HOELDS.","HOELDS NASA applications include rapid fabrication of parts on the ground as well as in space. The HOELDS system can be incorporated by NASA into existing rapid prototyping systems to reduce the size, weight, and power consumption of existing systems. Its portability makes HOELDS far more useful to NASA sites with several laboratories than a currently available DMD system. DMD technology could shorten time-to-market considerably and accomplish repairs by adding the same part material where needed without causing thermal stress or microcracking.

Even for larger aircraft the emerging paradigm of control involves an array of actuators and distributed sensing and actuation. In addition to enhanced performance these control architectures can provide greater redundancy to confront actuator failures. In Phase I, various aspects of the model definition, control parameterization, model reduction, control design and simulation for verification were illustrated for a benchmark problem. In addition, a computational architecture leveraging commonly available tools to the scientists/engineers was defined. The proposed toolbox in conjunction with commonly used general purpose software will provide designers the ability to seamlessly test control design for aerodynamic applications by integrating and automating several key steps in design cycle. These tools will find commercial applications not only in the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle industry but other land, sea and air vehicles as well.","Design of air, land and sea vehicles involving aerodynamic and fluid flow has always been of interest to NASA. The proposed computational tools will help integrate the aerodynamic, structural and control features leading to vehicles capable of greater performance by enabling evaluation of these varied aspects at an early stage. With these tools specification, modeling, control design and simulation can help optimize the design process of aerial vehicle systems. This will enhance the designer's ability to bring recent advances in sensor/actuator technology and control design to engineering practice. The open architecture of the control toolbox and integration will well known tools helps easy extension of the toolbox to other important applications.","With the continuing development of small scale, inexpensive, locally ""intelligent"" embedded actuators and ""distributed"" sensing, it is increasingly becoming possible to achieve truly distributed control of engineering systems. This ability to ""distribute"" control authority throughout the system enables the possibility of sophisticated control of distributed systems, such as those involving aerodynamic flow. Engineers/Scientists require computational tools to help analyze and design such systems. Although, the primary application is tailored towards small and micro air vehicles, these tools can be adapted and will find continuing use in industry including design of sea, air and land vehicles."

Existing off-the-shelf high-temperature strain sensors, including free filament electrical strain gages and optical fiber based strain sensors, currently do not have the necessary performance characteristics to tackle the next generation of C/C and SiC composite material testing programs. Free filament electrical strain gages cannot be used reliably over 1800 F (1000 C) and conventional optical fiber strain sensors with the appropriate protective metal coatings can operate reliably only up to close to the melting point of the silica (2000 F/1100 C). To meet the growing needs for strain sensors that can withstand future high temperature testing regimes, Lambda Instruments, Inc. proposes to develop sapphire optical fiber sensors. The 3600 F (1987 C) melting temperature of optical quality sapphire fibers, their low profile geometry, and the inherent immunity of optical fiber sensors to electromagnetic interference make sapphire fiber-based sensors particularly well suited for the proposed application.","Revenues for fiber optic sensors in 2008 is expected to reach $350 million.  A large part of this market demand will come from the combustion engine and turbomachinery industry which is already the leading consumer of sensors on the worldwide market.  Even though fiber optic sensors are uniquely capable making measurements under harsh environmental conditions, they still need to achieve large volumes, low unit prices, and long operational lifetimes before industries are willing to put them into widespread use.  The proposed Phase II program will be a large step in validating the commercial viability of fiber sensors for harsh environments.","The primary NASA application for the proposed high temperature sapphire optical fiber strain gages is for structural performance monitoring of emerging C/SiC and C/C composite components that must be characterized up to 3000 F. Other potential NASA applications based on the proposed sapphire optical fiber sensor technology include strain, temperature, and pressure sensors for performance monitoring of ramjet/scramjets during research and operation as well as for continuous structural health monitoring of the next generation space vehicles to maintain performance and safety standards throughout all phases of the mission."

The development of relevant analytical and   simulation-based technologies for the prediction and control for fail-safe   adaptivity under adverse and upset conditions is an important step in advancing   flight safety goals. Impaired aircraft operate much closer to bifurcation points   than a fully functional vehicle.

For example, intelligent systems have been employed to improve safety by adaptively compensating for unexpected failures or damage. Despite many successful demonstrations of autonomous and intelligent control laws in simulations and flight tests, the difficulty associated with the verification, validation, and testing of adaptive and nondeterministic systems poses a significant barrier to their use in safety-critical systems.  The proposed Phase II research addresses this challenge through the development of innovative V\&V algorithms and easy-to-use software tools that will provide intelligent, automated, and interactive test plan generation and execution.  The tool will integrate state-of-the-art analysis and numerical methods to automatically generate test vector sets, execute high-fidelity simulations or monitor pilot-in-the-loop simulations, analyze simulation results, and adapt/modify future test vectors based on observations to date. The result will be a significant reduction in cost associated with system testing while simultaneously offering a significant increase in the probability that system problems are uncovered early in the development process.

Traditional ballutes, however, have provided little or no trajectory control. For new platform functionality, high drag must be accompanied by some degree of control; also, incorporating thermal protection into the design provides additional weight savings. Ballutes are typically designed to create a low ballistic coefficient, reducing heating rates. However, a low ballistic coefficient also makes them inherently susceptible to insertion trajectory errors, atmospheric density variations, and winds. The use of a variable drag design allows for in-flight adjustment of ballistic coefficient. This significantly lowers downrange dispersions, resulting in a higher reliability recovery system. The specific innovation proposed is the design of a forward-attached, variable drag ballute for atmospheric entry. To demonstrate dispersion control in a forward-mounted ballute, Andrews proposes two flight tests of a subscale, pressure-supported, symmetric ballute that modulates drag by internal pressure control. The experiments are designed to demonstrate the ability to actively vary drag and prove transonic stability while avoiding an aeroheating environment requiring specialized thermal materials.","Ballutes can provide additional capability for near-earth orbit commercial space utilization. They allow development of recoverable capsules to support zero-g pharmaceutical, chemical, and materials research independent of Shuttle or other NASA capabilities.","The successful completion of the variable drag ballute transonic flight test in Phase II will significantly reduce the perceived technical risks associated with ballute development for both NASA and commercial markets. For example, a variable drag ballute will provide a lightweight, reliable deceleration system for cargo return from the International Space Station. It will increase ISS science utilization by increasing payload recovery capability. Variable drag ballutes will also be used to recover other spacecraft and as a method for planetary aerocapture and probe entry."

In this approach the user dissolves or mixes a sample to be tested for proteins into a sample buffer and injects this into a plastic card consisting of microfluidic channels and electrodes.  The card is inserted into a compact ""reader"" (small enough for space flight) that, within four hours, electronically reports the abundance of each protein detected.  In Phase II research SHOT will (1) establish fabrication parameters for the card and manufacture prototypes, (2) build a breadboard reader and (3) test the Microfluidic Analytical Separator using mixed protein solutions. The innovation is useful in detecting specific protein ratio changes in blood or plasma, in extracts of experimental organisms subjected to varying environmental conditions, and in the medium-resolution high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical agents.","The immediate ""terrestrial"" marketplace is sectored into users in remote sites away from analytical laboratories, educational uses, and high-throughput screening applications in which high resolution is not critical.  Eventually some customers may find the proteomics ""card"" useful in the examination of human plasma for the presence or absence of particular proteins in potentially pathological states, which may open the clinical diagnostics market, which is very large. SHOT's production and sales plans target all of these markets, and SHOT received $70,000 from the State of Indiana to aid in developing the innovation for these markets.","NASA will be an important customer of the innovation. First, the proteomics ""card"" is useful in the examination of human plasma for normal or pathological levels of some 200 serum proteins to monitor crew health during deep space flights expected in NASA's exploration vision.  Second, flight opportunities for molecular biology experiments are scarce, as is the opportunity to return biological samples from space in suitable conditions for chemical analysis.  The proposed Analytical Separator will provide electronic data that can be telemetered (real time). The proposed format is disposable, and the reader requires minimal space, power and crew time."

It should be a cw source with an output in the 10-100 mW range.  Most of the applications either require that the wavelength be near 1064 nm or can use that wavelength.  To meet many of the applications, the laser should have a short-term frequency drift of <1 MHz/min and a long-term frequency stability of +/-50 MHz. The more demanding applications require long term stability of +/-1 MHz.  Some commercial lasers meet the less stringent performance requirements, but to our knowledge, Lightwave Electronics is the only domestic laser vendor that has built any space-qualified units.  None of the commercial lasers meet the +/-1 MHz long term stability requirement.   At this time no domestic laser manufacturers, including Lightwave Electronics, appear to be interested in supplying a laser that meets the +/-50 MHz long term stability requirement in a space-qualified version.

PolInSAR holds the promise of being able to provide unique data that can be of great value to the earth science community.  By observing scattering volumes such as vegetation canopies, ice sheets, and dry soils using this new SAR technique, one can obtain and decompose scattering from within that volume.  In traditional SAR imaging, all scattering that arises from within a three-dimensional resolution cell of the volume is collapsed into a single pixel value due to the layover effect.  PolInSAR provides a method of separating the various scattering center locations based on their polarimetric properties.  PolInSAR techniques, therefore, can address many issues of interest to the vegetation and environmental community, providing measurements of foliage structure and density, and potentially contribute directly to our understanding of the carbon cycle budget.","Vexcel intends to develop, implement and test algorithms for using and exploiting PolInSAR data.  Many of these algorithms will deal with the ""non-ideal"" nature of PolInSAR data and involve calibration and compensation for non-ideal aspects of the data sources.

The approach quantifies the maximum attainable loading for given particle size, and the subsequent tradeoff with impacts on combustion efficiency due to incomplete solid phase burnout of larger particles, and conversely the degree of pre-oxidation of smaller particles. The method also allows the physical properties of the gel to be optimized. This improves the competitiveness of gelled bipropellants with equivalent liquids, while incorporating the safety and handling advantages of gels. ERGC Corporation has worked to address this solicitation objective in cooperation with subcontractor Northrop Grumman Space and Technology (NGST) Propulsion Systems, the leader in gel propellant technology.  The Phase II program will continue experimental refinement and property testing of gel formulations (including freeze/thaw cycling to ensure properties are maintained under projected mission conditions), employ combustion modeling to determine those formulations expected to provide the best actual performance, and conduct engine tests to validate the performance of the most promising candidates.","DoD applications which would benefit directly from this project (i.e., applications which could use aluminum-loaded gels because emissions signature is not an issue) include ATACMS or MLRS.  DoD applications that would benefit indirectly from this project (i.e., applications which could not use aluminum loaded gels because of their high emissions signature, but would benefit from the advancement of the state-of-the-art in gelled propellant development) include the Joint Common Missile program and the Army Miniature Multirole Precision Guided Missile program.","If successful, this project will provide NASA with:  1) Specific bipropellants with maximized combustion efficiency, the safety and controllability advantages of gels, and the ability to retain their properties after being subjected to freeze/thaw conditions.  Such bipropellants will be useful for most NASA propulsion applications including earth-orbit spacecraft, deep-space applications, Mars ascent vehicle applications, and lunar landing applications. 2) A methodology for determination of maximum performance enhancement expected with nanoparticulate loading; and 3) Tools and methodology that could be applied for different ingredients."

Niobium alloys offer a good combination of temperature capability, density, and cost, while the silicide coating has been successful in providing moderate oxidation resistance and use temperature. However, for many current applications the silicide coating is now proving to be the limiting factor in achieving the required chamber performance and/or lifetime, and the chamber manufacturing cost is excessive. NASA is seeking advanced bipropellant propulsion systems for Earth science spacecraft and space exploration vehicles, while DoD is seeking economical and high-performance bipropellant thrusters for liquid divert and attitude control systems in kinetic energy kill vehicles for ballistic missile defense (a high-volume application). These goals cannot be achieved using standard silicided C103 chambers. In this project, Ultramet proposes to develop and demonstrate a combustion chamber with substantially improved manufacturability, cost, and performance. In Phase I, Ultramet successfully demonstrated both improved chamber manufacturing and a more robust and higher performance oxidation-resistant coating as a replacement for the silicide. This was accomplished through a unique manufacturing process involving low temperature spray deposition of C103 on removable plastic mandrels produced by rapid prototyping. Thin vapor-deposited platinum coatings were shown to substantially improve oxidation resistance relative to the standard silicide coating. In Phase II, Ultramet will expand upon the Phase I results by performing a comprehensive optimization of the combustion chamber processing including mandrel development, cold-spray material/process optimization, and oxidation-resistant coating optimization. Performance will then be demonstrated through hot-fire testing.","The proposed processing, including the rapid prototyping approach for removable mandrel fabrication, low-temperature spray formation of niobium alloys, and the coupling of a thin, oxidation-resistant platinum coating with a niobium alloy combustion chamber, may well offer the best combination of manufacturability, cost, and performance for commercial and government satellite propulsion systems, and ballistic missile defense kinetic energy weapons.","A need clearly exists to bridge the gap between low-performance/low temperature silicided niobium liquid rocket combustion chambers and high-performance/ultrahigh temperature (and high cost) iridium/rhenium chambers. NASA Earth science satellites, the space shuttle orbiter reaction control system vernier engines, and vehicles under development for the news solar system exploration initiative all stand to benefit from the proposed development."

On the Moon, similar chemistry is applied with emphasis on oxygen production.   Most lunar LOx processes only reduce FeO, which is generally present at just 10 to 15 percent in soils. All of the soil must be heated to reduce the contained FeO, resulting in substantial heat transfer issues. Thermal power requirements per unit of oxygen recovered are reduced by an order of magnitude and hydrogen losses are minimized if only a small mass of high-grade iron oxide concentrate, such as that produced by MAPS, is subjected to hydrogen reduction.  MAPS is significant because it can be co-developed for Mars and Moon applications. The process would be commissioned first for oxygen production on the Moon. Modular enhancements for manufacture of additional products would be implemented on the Moon and then on Mars, thereby reducing risks and costs.",MAPS extraction technology has potential terrestrial applications for treatment of soils contaminated with heavy metals and radionuclides.

Schedules must be generated that allow for maximum contingency planning to prevent continual replanning. 3) Space based, moon based, or Mars based space ports will be very complex.  Current systems for diagnosis that generate a single good/bad indication from each sensor individually are inadequate because they do not detect subtle changes that are indicative of latent faults, and because of the time and manual effort required to analyze and determine the root cause of a problem."

The UMR will allow NASA and its contractor community to use a license-free online database to store 3D geometry, procedures, animation, functional specifications and simulation assembly templates. The UMR will be delivered with the following three critical template simulation applications: 1) simulation template and applications for crew medical training in health and safety on long duration missions for ISS and Constellation/CEV; 2) simulation template and applications for the design of human-robotic systems and work practices to support long duration surface facilities on the Moon or Mars; and 3) simulation template and applications for rapidly developed, low cost just-in-time virtual training for in-flight ISS and future Constellation/CEV crews.","This platform has been engaged in a project for the teaching of safety practices to children with Autism in a controlled study funded by the National Institutes of Health at Emory University in Atlanta.

The proposed project SBIR Phase II project will develop aerogel insulation materials for composite cryotanks and TPS.  Introduction of aerogel materials to reusable launch vehicles will result in significant reductions in the weight and volume of cryogenic insulation and high temperature Thermal Protection Systems.  Aspen Aerogels' materials typically demonstrate 2-4x improvement in thermal conductivity over traditional insulation materials.  When specifically engineered to work with current integrated insulation systems, a marked reduction in thickness and overall weight will be realized.  Therefore, with team partner Northrop Grumman Corporation, Aspen Aerogels proposes to develop durable and lightweight aerogel insulation for current spacecraft such as the shuttle and future reusable launch vehicles.  During the proposed effort we will develop and characterize fiber reinforced aerogel composites for use as cryogenic and high temperature insulation for reusable launce vehicles.  We will also optimize the organic modified silica aerogels developed during the Phase I effort as an approach for improving their strength at cryogenic temperatures.  A low-cost, environmentally benign manufacturing process will be used.","The resulting insulation system from this program will also have far reaching effects in both military and commercial applications.  Similar to the insulating tiles for the space shuttle, the product could offer a replacement to the expensive insulating tile array used in the exhaust washed regions of advanced military aircraft.  The potential also exist for insulating weapons, fuel tanks, electronics, and landing gear bays of military aircraft.  Finally, the product will have a commercial impact in areas such as: airliner fuselages, thermal insulation for ovens, insulation for hot exhaust ducts, automotive firewall insulation, appliance insulation, and boilers and incinerators.","The material developed in this phase II efforts could have a variety of applications in the aerospace industry, and within NASA specifically.  Aerogels are the most efficient thermal insulation known, and NASA has several applications that would benefit from the low density and low thermal conductivity of aerogels.  Among these are replacements for the present blankets and high temperature re-usable tiles on the space shuttle.  Aerogels could also be applied to NASA's integrated cryogenic fuel tanks, spacesuit applications, and internal insulation applications on re-usable spacecraft"

This system uses a thermal radiator, a solar PV array, and a vapor compression refrigeration device.  Such a system significantly reduces total system mass as compared to an all radiator cooling architecture.  Since the start of initial prototype testing in the mid 1990s, several refrigeration systems have been proposed, studied, built, and tested.  The basic goal of each system has been to achieve the highest possible efficiency at the optimal system lift.  Most notably, a two-stage refrigeration system and an expander turbine for a single-stage system were developed.  Both sought to eliminate or recover the energy loss associated with irreversible expansion at the throttling valve, but both fell short of efficiency targets.  Then, Paragon proposed a novel refrigeration architecture that was successfully demonstrated during the Phase I period.  This system can achieve, in theory, near Carnot efficiency limits and does so in a practical and achievable way.  Not only can this technology provide significantly improved performance (reduced weight) for NASA's Lunar habitat cooling application, but it has excellent potential as a commercial product.","The target commercial users are those companies that currently use two-stage refrigeration technology for high-lift, high-power industrial and commercial low temperature applications, especially those applications located in a warm ambient.  A few specific examples include: grocery stores operating freezers, transport refrigeration trailers, and potentially Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) and other gas liquefaction plants.  Seeking out these customers will be done with the assistance of the two-stage compressor manufacturers, who are also likely to be the long-term licensee of this technology.","The target NASA application is the Lunar base primary cooling system.   Lunar base scientific and food freezer refrigeration is also a potential target market.  With further development, this technology can be used in similar microgravity applications.  Modeling and analysis show that the Batch Cycle technology will reduce the mass of the Lunar base cooling system by 14%, or 500 kg."

Through both Phase I and internal R&D efforts, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and glutaraldehyde-crosslinked chitosan (GAC) hybrid silica aerogels were developed and evaluated. The hydrophobic aerogel beads have excellent compression strength, resisting thermal cycling and mechanical loads without breaking or settling.  Investigations of the thermal performance of hybrid aerogel beads by nitrogen boil-off tests and the mechanical strength by compression tests have shown that carbon-opacified PMMA beads of diameter below 1 mm outperform perlite to the greatest extent.  The Phase II work will continue with PMMA systems to optimize the formula and to determine the processing conditions required for controlling bead size distribution and achieving the desired thermal and mechanical performance characteristics.  A scale-up of the process is planned to achieve pilot volumes (30-50 liters/hour).  We will also demonstrate reproducibility in final bead performance through study of raw material variability (lot-to-lot) and process settings (batch-to-batch).","For non-NASA applications, the largest volume market segment identified to date is for LNG tanker hull insulation.  The proposed solution will allow an increase in usable vessel space.  These cargo transport ships will be able to use less than one third the volume for the same thermal performance of the current material, perlite.  The novel insulation can also be used for protecting superconductive magnets or oil well underwater pipelines.  Aspen's hybrid aerogels can offer thermal management solutions for handling or transportation of cryogens, supporting cryogenic equipment manufacturers and suppliers.",": Cost-effective solutions to insulation problems are fundamental to the energy-intensive field of cryogenics as well as space travel.  Liquid hydrogen storage capacity at major Government user locations totals 5,575,000 gallons.  Approximately 100,000 gallons are lost to vaporization each time the LH2 flows from the pad storage tank to the Shuttle external tank.  Ormosil beads have been proposed for insulating cryogenic umbilical connections for new commercial launch platforms, retrofitting perlite-insulated storage dewars, and insulating miles-long cryogen transfer lines.  NASA can also use the resilient bead insulation for space launch vehicle propellant tanks, Space Shuttle upgrades, interplanetary propulsion and life support equipment."

However, heat leak into the cryogenic tank causes the stored air to expand and vent, thus limiting the storage life of a charged system.  We propose to develop a storage system for supercritical air packs that provides cryogenic cooling that will enable long-term storage of charged, supercritical air packs with zero venting. In Phase I we proved feasibility through design trade-off and optimization analyses that led to a conceptual design and operational description of a supercritical air storage system.  The innovative, mechanical cryocooling system provides flexible coupling and quick disconnection, as well as high reliability and efficient, low-power operation.  The system can be used to charge the tanks with supercritical air without the use of expendable cryogens. In Phase II we will build and demonstrate a prototype storage system for supercritical air self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs).  Critical components will be designed and tested individually, then integrated to produce a complete cooling system.  We will couple the Phase II prototype with a supercritical air pack and demonstrate long-term storage with zero venting.","By enabling long-term storage of fully charged SCBAs, our cryogenic cooling system will enable the use of supercritical air SCBA for a variety of terrestrial applications. Homeland security will particularly benefit. Supercritical air makes an ideal breathing air supply for SCBAs:  large quantities can be stored at low pressure in a lightweight system, it operates independently of orientation, the quantity is easily gauged, and the system can provide body cooling.  The commercial market for these systems includes firefighters, first responders, search-and-rescue personnel, and Level A HAZMAT teams.  Supercritical air will be ideal for high-rise and subway firefighting and rescue operations.","NASA personnel use cryogenic air supplies for rocket propellant handling and emergency rescue from the shuttle launch pad.  Supercritical air systems are lightweight, compact, and provide cooling, but the cryogenic tanks need to be frequently recharged.  The cryogenic cooling system developed in Phase II will enable storage with zero venting and allow personnel to rapidly disconnect the tanks.  All quick disconnects are warm for high seal reliability.

Surveying applications also abound in the commercial/private sector, where the system could be mounted to robots and used in operations such as search and rescue (e.g. in collapsed structures), crime scene searches, and terrain or cavern mapping.  Police and military personnel would also find a robot-mounted version of the system extremely useful when scouting areas where dangerous individuals may be hiding.  In these applications, the simultaneous collection of all of the video data ensures that the system would see anyone who attempts to disable it before the system can actually be disabled.","The NASA applications of the proposed imaging system are numerous.  This system can be utilized in any situation where human operators are remotely operating equipment.  This includes the operation of remote controlled robots and the maneuvering of spacecraft during docking operations.  Other applications for the imaging system will be in planetary exploration, where the proposed system will be compact and rugged enough to be carried by rovers during surveying missions.  The system will enable operators or image processing algorithms to quickly locate objects or locations of interest without utilizing a rotating camera mount."

The SmartTopo software system is designed to be portable and robust so that it can be used by NASA in a variety of general and embedded applications. It will be used in robotic inspection of spacecraft on-orbit, making re-entry safer for manned spacecraft. It will also improve the safety of air travel by producing a new type of aircraft altimeter which will tell the pilot the true position of the aircraft above the ground.  A vehicle (aircraft, spacecraft, satellite, planetary rover or submersible) is sent forth with an internal digital map of the topography of an area to explore. As exploration proceeds sensors (video cameras for example) on the explorer will collect data as always, but now the SmartTopo software will process the data and update the original digital map data in real time, resulting in a higher resolution topographic model of the surface that it has surveyed.  RIS has developed and demonstrated the key elements of this technology during Phase I.","The largest commercial marker for this technology will be UAV manufacturers, because of its potential to both improve safety of flight as well as its ability to rapidly created detailed terrain models for surveyed areas.  RIS has been working with numerous UAV manufacturers including General Atomics, AAI, BAI, Titan Systems, and Geneva Aero), many of whom license other RIS software products.  Adopting SmartTopo will be a natural extension of the excellent business relationships that we have in place.  RIS has already received strong interest from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, ADUSD CDR Thomas Moore, who is keenly interested in seeing this technology applied to submersible vehicles.","Robotic exploration vehicles will use this technology to navigate planets and asteroids for which high resolution topographic data may be unavailable.  SmartTopo will allow these vehicles to navigate these place where GPS may be unavailable.  Future generations of Space Planes, the successors to the Space Shuttle will use SmartTopo to inspect heat shield surfaces prior to re-entry to ensure surface integrity.  These craft will also use SmartTopo as a back up to RADAR altimeter technology during landing phase.  These applications will fuel commercial space adoption of the SmartCam3D technology."

AUTOCONNECT not only provides mechanical fastening between modules (irrespective of precise alignments and orientations), but also automatically configures electrical connections among modules. Mechanical attachment occurs due to docking and physical contact between modules with sufficient initial momenta.  The mass properties of the assembly are determined on orbit and the entire assembly functions as a spacecraft unit.  In Phase I we simulated spacecraft assembly in two dimensions using instrumented hexagonal modules  supported on air bearings with yaw control provided by a reaction wheel on each module.  We demonstrated the feasibility of attachment via AUTOCONNECT, power and data transfer across the interface, and angular orientation control of the assembly.  In Phase II, we propose to simulate orbital assembly of a spacecraft configuration as an AUTOCONNECTed assembly of multiple instrumented modules, where each module functions as a spacecraft subsystem or payload, and demonstrate command and control of the entire assembly.  Additionally, we will address the system level design issues for AUTOCONNECT-equipped spacecraft modules and the concept of operations for their on-orbit assembly.","Military applications of AUTOCONNECT include on-orbit assembly of spacecraft from subsystems needed for a particular mission, creation of new spacecraft configurations, or reconfiguration of existing spacecraft. Other embodiments of AUTOCONNECT will enable rapid ground assembly of spacecraft for quick launch, responsive space missions envisioned by the Air Force.  Non-space military applications of AUTOCONNECT include soldiers' clothing and ground vehicles, where sensors, communications equipment, instruments, etc, can be quickly attached as needed for the battlefield environment. AUTOCONNECT allows assembly of systems without connectors and cables, e.g., computer and home electronic systems, ""smart"" walls in buildings, where sensors/monitors can be attached anywhere.","The proposed technology will enable NASA to build large systems in space using smaller, modular subsystems, refurbish spacecraft in orbit with new technology subsystems/payloads, and service/repair existing subsystems. This modular, on-orbit assembly approach is especially suited for low-cost Lunar and Mars missions and for NASA's vision of fleets of formation flying spacecraft on distributed science missions.  Reduction in cost is achieved by manufacturing large quantities of identical modules with standardized AUTOCONNECT interfaces. Our approach also allows the selection of desired modules to assemble a customized spacecraft using AUTOCONNECT, and on-orbit operations using the advanced control algorithms we propose to develop."

Distributed development teams are becoming the norm for today?s software projects. These distributed teams are faced with the challenge of keeping software projects on track and keeping all involved developers using a consistent and efficient process. Workflow tools have been used for several years to support activities of distributed organizations such as the International Space Station Program. Workflow tools are efficient at automating very constrained and tightly controlled processes such as Change Requests processes. A Software Development Process, though, requires a more informal type of process automation allowing the project manager more control rather than enforcing tight rules through the workflow engine. Issues to be addressed during this project include researching the effects of multiple factors involved in the successful insertion of this technology within NASA organizations. Engine characteristics required to give flexibility to the software development team will be researched. Multiple processes will be captured within the workflow tool to evaluate different needs of process participants, such as Project Management, Requirements, Design, Implementation, and Testing.","A software development assistant workflow tool has commercial applications to all parties interested in software development. This tool can be applied to a broad range of areas, as any project management effort is (or should be) using a process centric approach. Over the past few years, there has been a strong trend to outsource part of the software development effort to foreign countries development teams. Difficulties arising from the widely distributed nature of the development effort have been noticed and projects failures have been reported. Using the SDA will mitigate a number of risks associated with this type of effort. The numerous companies currently outsourcing as well as companies which will outsource in the future are potential customers of our product.","The proposed project can directly be used by software development organizations within NASA as well as outside NASA. It will directly benefit the entire range of NASA Strategic Enterprises, as they all require a wide use of safe and efficient software. This will be achieved by advancing NASA's Software Engineering practices, through process improvement, support in software metrics capture and usage, infusion of software engineering research and technology, and enhancing engineering knowledge and skills.

A second objective is to develop an innovative method of control for deployable aerocapture decelerators employing shape-morphing lift modulation.  Aerocapture is strongly enhancing for planetary exploration because the decelerator mass is less than the fuel mass needed for the same delta-V, and therefore results in a higher payload fraction in orbit.  Inflatable drag devices are a promising type of aerocapture decelerator because (1) they are lighter than conventional fixed-geometry aeroshells, and (2) they can be much larger than the interior of a launch fairing and thus enable heavier spacecraft.  This aerocapture technology also applies to supersonic decelerators for Entry, Descent and Landing Systems (EDLS) and to other systems requiring supersonic deceleration and stabilization.  Trajectory control by shape-morphing lift modulation also enhances EDLS as part of precision guided landing capability.

Two proposed NASA missions will require anticoincidence shielding for gamma-ray spectrometers: the Mars Lander and a Space Science Vision Mission expected to visit Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Shielding improves the performance of gamma-ray spectrometers by reducing the effect of charged particle interactions which can not be distinguished from true gamma-ray interactions by the spectrometer. Active shields produce a blanking signal when a charged particle is detected, so that the signal from the spectrometer can be ignored during the spectrometer's charged-particle interaction. While it is well know that this technique produces significant improvement in gamma-ray spectrometer performance, the technology to implement it is lacking. The attributes of mercuric iodide make it an excellent candidate for anticoincidence shielding detectors. Because of its detection characteristics, light weight, small size, low cost, robustness, and ease of application to non-planar geometries, this material can replace the costly, heavy, and bulky scintillator/photomultiplier tube (PMT) systems currently in use. The application of this new material for space-based astrophysical observations provides excellent background suppression with improved mass and volume characteristics.","High-energy physics and medical imaging may also benefit from this detector development. Because of the small volume and flexible shape of the proposed mercuric iodide detectors, they have a potential application as coincidence or anticoincidence detectors for charged particles in complex high-energy physics detectors, where detector volume near the emission point is often extremely limited. By placing the material onto a curved surface, detectors may be placed in spaces previously unused because planar detectors do not fit. The same polycrystalline mercuric iodide detector technology combined with thin-film-transistor (TFT) or CMOS readouts can be used for x-ray imaging.  Medical imaging x-ray systems have a natural geometry of detectors located on a hemispherical plane; curved detector surfaces may eliminate some artifacts and lead to improved efficiency due to improved detector packing fraction.","Space-based gamma-ray spectrometers will benefit from the proposed polycrystalline mercuric iodide active anticoincidence shield. Gamma-ray spectroscopy is a widely used tool in planetary science and astrophysics, providing valuable information on such diverse topics as planetary composition and the nature of gamma-ray bursts. Both the proposed Mars Lander and a proposed Space Science Vision Mission for visiting Titan will require anticoincidence shielding for their gamma-ray spectrometers. The developed detector technology will have applications in many other future NASA missions as an anticoincidence shield as well as an x-ray imager when combined with thin-film-transistor (TFT) or CMOS readouts."

JEM developed an S-Band (2.0-2.3 GHz) antenna array design appropriate for the stratospheric balloon application through requirements definition, modeling, and performance predictions. The critical technology for this array is an electrically-controlled Variable Delay Line (VDL), used to provide true time-delay for beamsteering.  VDLs were designed, built and tested, and shown to have excellent performance. The VDLs were tested over 2.4 million cycles without degradation, indicating good life, especially for the balloon application.  A 4-port linear beamformer was built, and used to validate the beamformer concept. The objective of the proposed 24-month Phase II effort is to develop, prototype, and demonstrate a flight-qualifiable FlexScan phased array that achieves the bandwidth, antenna gain, and scan range required for a balloon-borne TDRSS data link in S-band, while meeting environmental requirements. Upon completion of Phase II, the FlexScan array will be ready to commercialize for the balloon-borne application, with other NASA and non-NASA commercial applications soon to follow.","NASA robotic and manned vehicles all require communications, and data rates are rising, increasing the need for high-gain links. Many also benefit from radar?often not an option due to the limitations of current gimbaled dishes and phased arrays. To achieve its goal of solar system exploration, NASA needs an alternative to these antennas. The FlexScan array will provide this alternative in a low-cost, low-power, low-complexity, lightweight, high-gain, steerable-beam antenna. The Phase II effort is focused on stratospheric balloon TDRSS communications, but this technology can readily be extended to meet the need of many of NASA's vehicle and explorer programs.","FlexScan antennas are useful for virtually any application where a single high-gain beam is needed and the required scanning rate is not too rapid. The low cost of these antennas, their simplicity, and their excellent electromagnetic performance makes these antennas very attractive. The U.S. Army has a great interest in Satellite Communications On-the-Move (SOTM), which requires a light, agile, low-cost and robust steerable-beam antenna.

In particular they must be able to withstand flexing at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77K) without developing pinhole gas leaks. To meet this requirement, it was proposed that a multiple layer laminate of thin PET films would be better than an equivalent thickness single layer of the same film.  In the Phase I work, some of the laminating variables were studied. Through this effort, significant improvements in the material for Titan aerobot use were realized. The cold temperature flex durability against pinhole failure was increase by 70% due to changes in the weave counts of the fabric. Tests also demonstrated that a 50% reduction could be made in the adhesive weight used to laminate the films without sacrificing bond or flex durability.  This Phase II proposal is for continued development of the Titan aerobot envelope material based on the results of Phase I.

These include increased efficiency, reduced vibration and reductions in overall system mass and power consumption.  For the small coolers required, pulse tube and Stirling coolers offer the best opportunities.  At present, the efficiency of these coolers is limited by the effectiveness of low-temperature-stage regenerators.  Below about 60 K, two factors play key roles in reducing the effectiveness of regenerators.  One is that the heat capacity of most materials falls rapidly with decreasing temperature, thereby, severely limiting the number of useful materials to a few in common use.  A second factor is that these commonly used materials are only available in powder form, a form known to raise reliability issues.  In this effort, we will address both factors.  We will use newly developed materials with high heat capacities at temperatures below 60 K, higher than that of commonly used materials.  Further, we will develop a novel low-temperature regenerator matrix that will address both the aspect of high-efficiency and regenerator durability.  Both the void fraction and the ratio of surface area to solid fraction of the regenerator matrix will be varied to achieve high efficiency.",There are a number of commercial applications which require cryocoolers that will benefit from high efficiency low-temperature regenerators. A partial list includes: - Superconducting electronics - Superconducting magnets for MRI systems - Superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage - SQUID magnetometers for heart and brain studies - HTS filters for the communication industry - Liquefaction of industrial gases - Cryopumps for semiconductor manufacturing,"NASA is considering missions to the outer planets carrying significant amounts of propellant for braking maneuvers and orbital insertion upon arrival at their destinations. Cryogenicly stored propellants offer the highest specific impulse of any chemical system. Zero boil-off (ZBO) propellant storage can directly impact these long-term exploration missions. It minimizes the launch mass such missions require. For ZBO missions high efficiency cryocoolers capable of providing cooling at 20K are required.

We also investigated and experimented with the fluid jet polishing to be used by this instrument, setting the stage for further experiments and ultimate usage in Phase II.  The metrology accuracy goals, supported by previous measurements, are 1 nanometer rms for full aperture figure, and 0.1 nm rms for mid-frequency and micro-roughness.  The full-aperture and mid-frequency metrology approaches are based on previous successful SBIR projects, while the micro-roughness metrology is an improvement on standard Total Integrated Scatter measurements developed under Phase I.

NASA's next generation specifications demand high precision optical surfaces with practically zero edge exclusion in order to maximize image contrast and resolution.  Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is a sub-aperture process demonstrated to be effective for fine figure control and polishing of a variety of optical glasses and crystals.   The relatively small size and high removal rate of the MRF tool could allow efficient correction of  ""print-through"" patterns (or other mid-spatial frequency errors) often observed after conventional polishing.  MRF, however, can suffer from edge effects, because the MRF polishing spot changes as it moves over the edge of the part.  Current control algorithms assume the spot remains constant, resulting in edge errors on the order of half of the spot size in width. In Phase I, we identified a promising method of counteracting edge effects. In Phase II, we will develop, test, and refine three software- and process-based solutions, and apply them to polishing an optic of relevance to NASA's needs.","In addition to many ground-based, large, segmented telescopes (including the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) umbrella project which also includes the CELT, GMST, and VLOT programs), successful completion of this work could benefit other industries that require large, high precision, optical surfaces.

The long wavelength Far Infrared/Submillimeter (FIR/SMM) instruments of Space Technology 9, the SAFIR Observatory, the Space InfraRed Interferometric Telescope (SPIRIT), and the Submillimeter Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure (SPECS) missions require the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio to resolve the emissions of protogalactic objects and galaxies.  The development of 10-25 meter diameter cryogenic optics for the 20-800 microns bandwidth, with an areal density <5 kg/m2, and a surface figure specification of lambda/14 at 20 microns is required.  There is a premium for wavelengths >100 microns to achieve mirror temperatures <10K.  In fact, at 200 microns wavelength, the point source sensitivity is more dependent on temperature than on aperture size!  During the Phase II project Schafer proposes to design, build and test a 0.5-m diameter actively cooled SLMSTM Far Infrared Submillimeter Prototype (FISP) mirror suitable for NASA FIR/SMM missions, thus maturing SLMSTM cryogenic mirror technology to TRL 5-6.  Active cooling of SLMSTM mirrors to 4K is an enabling technology for future FIR/SMM instruments.","The Potential Applications for SLMSTM technology falls into two thrust areas of interest by NASA and Commercial Businesses:  cryogenic optics and EUV/Visible Ambient Optics.  The respective missions of interest are (for cryogenic) SAFIR, SPIRIT, SPECS, TPF interferometer and (for ambient) DMP, SCOPE, MTRAP, SUVO, NHST and TPF coronagraph.  It is noteworthy that all missions could be potentially satisfied by a single mirror technology using 2-meter scale segments.  With appropriate funding, SLMSTM could be this technology.  DoD has similar mirror requirements for infrared/visible imaging, surveillance and reconnaissance missions thus NASA and DoD collaboration to mature SLMSTM technology would be desirable.","The 0.5-meter cryogenic SLMSTM Far Infrared Submillimeter Prototype (FISP) mirror is traceable to the 1.2-2 meter diameter segments required for a 10-meter deployable telescope.  The larger segments would be demonstrated on a non-SBIR funded Option program and would mature the technology to TRL 6.  Such an approach is analogous to the maturation for the 50 cm Small Beryllium Mirror Demonstrator and 1.2-meter Advanced Mirror System Demonstrator for the James Webb Space Telescope.  The long wavelength Far Infrared/Submillimeter (FIR/SMM) instruments of Space Technology 9, SAFIR, SPIRIT, SPECS and Terrestrial Planet Finder missions could take direct advantage of this proposed maturation program."

A single device will provide identification and quantification of multiple compounds (e.g., biogenically important CH4, NOx, NH3, H2O, and many more).","The tremendous size and cost reductions realized by our device will open markets for FTS systems. Current commercial systems are table-top sized, require on-board computers, and cost in excess of $40k. We propose a sensor that could fit it ones palm and enjoy the economy of scale for large volume production. In one embodiment, such a device could serve as a dedicated, in-situ, detector for a multitude of target species. Possible implementations could be automotive exhaust, industrial waste monitoring, agricultural quality control, fuel analysis, plastics sorting for recycling, and general manufacturing control. Furthermore, the robust nature permits placement in hostile and otherwise inaccessible environments.","Deployable on a variety of platforms, a single FTS sensor could identify multiple chemical species.  This sensor can be configured to either have an onboard light source, such as the superluminescent diode (SLD) array, or utilize the sun as a light source and solar concentrators to collect the light into the waveguide interferometer.

SSVDTMs have already been demonstrated for highly demanding high frequency applications. Thermionic SSVDTMs, in which vacuum transport is by thermionically emitted electrons, are especially promising due to their intrinsic internal high temperature operation and radiation hardness.

In particular, SSVDTM electronics were successfully experimentally demonstrated fully operational at 500C. In addition, radiation insensitive SSVDTM electronics were also successfully experimentally demonstrated during Phase I of this SBIR project.  Small scale extreme temperature, radiation insensitive SSVDTM integrated circuits (ICs) will be developed during Phase II of this SBIR project.

This Phase II product development and validation is mainly proposed to fulfill the issues related to the material obsolescence and the technology gap, and to present next generation product concepts from the new class of binder material chemistries that are dielectrically engineered with required secondary emission properties.  Thus, this timely proposal can fulfill the need of the multifunctional binder based products that have a required thermal shock, thermal cycling performance and potential to improve the affordability.  The proposed efforts will generate needed validation data to generate the confidence in the developed products and will carry out needed optimization of the proposed products.  It will also provide needed input to Phase III opportunities to the mission officials from JIMO, ISS and to the various officials of DoD and NRO on the issues, where the next generation materials can make a significant difference.","The DoD, NRO and commercial industry are planning several satellites for the broad band communication activities.  The FAA and NASA are also envisioning commercial space based radars for air traffic control. Such platform structures are expected to be, if not as large as ISS, but at least sizable - where the charge accumulation can be an over riding concerns.  These planned candidate fleet designs of such integrated space systems may require putting assets in the mid-earth orbits for over all optimization and minimization of mission costs.  Such mission and fleet designs can be possible only if the material technologies are made available that have the needed space environment stability built into them for the required reliability and durability along with the charge dissipation abilities.

The use of envisioned products based on the binder system developed in Phase I can enhance NASA's ability to carry out the high power space science and the exploration missions in the planetary orbits and the several sun earth connection study mission orbits and for the missions planned for the vision moon, mars and beyond, where the severe electrons and protons are present as one of the main degrading species. The stable dielectrically engineered binder system is a central requirement to any NASA space program. For ISS the structure is grounded to the negative of the solar array and hence is about 140 volts below plasma potential. The discharge across the discontinuities caused by the micro-meteoroids can generate electromagnetic interference and even sputtering of the underlying metallic layer. The rub-primed binder that fills the micro-porosity resulted from the anodized aluminum at the surface can help with prevention of electromagnetic interference. This has potential to simplify the grounding schemes and minimize the costs associated with the same.

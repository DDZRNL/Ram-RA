Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques are integral to this effort. In particular, NDE techniques are used to a) detect and characterize damage to aircraft and b) validate models of materials through iterative testing. The costs associated with the acquisition of major aircraft require a long usage period in order to obtain a good return on investment. The commercial and military aircraft fleets are inspected and maintained to produce a long operational life. However, many of the NDE techniques are slow, tedious, and costly.   Interestingly, the technologies used to inspect aircraft to detect flaws are quite sophisticated, but tools for keeping track of these flaws, their location, and evolution over time are haphazard and inspection-specific, so they are not easily generalized to inspections in general.We propose to leverage our machine vision technology to help automate portions of the inspection process to greatly reduce the time and cost associated with the inspection task.   In this approach, machine vision is used to localize the sensor scan information gathered during inspection so that it can be viewed and manipulated in the context of a 3D CAD model of the inspected object.   This then helps support the prediction of flaw propagation and structure life. The system allows maintainers to accurately collect information about flaws and accurately integrate them into CAD models. The models can then be leveraged in finite element analysis tools to help predict flaw and material behavior.","The proposed technology is initially being developed to support the non-destructive inspection of large aerospace structures, such as aircraft and spacecraft. The technology will allow maintainers to more rapidly complete inspections of large surfaces and record the data for historical perspective and future use. The system will help identify the specific location of where flaws exist on the test object and integrate the flaw data into the 3D CAD model so that the flaw data can be used within finite element analysis programs to predict flaw propagation and material life. The system will be applied to aid in the prediction of how aircraft and spacecraft components age and can be applied to testing of failed aircraft components to help identify root causes of crashes.","The proposed technology can also be applied to use in the commercial and military aviation markets. The average age of military aircraft is actually older than the average age of commercial aircraft and is therefore an ideal target for the proposed system. Therefore, we will leverage our existing contacts in the DoD to find potential end users for the technology.Commercial airlines also have a requirement to inspect aircraft. Therefore, we will also target commercial airlines as a potential application space.",Structural Modeling and Tools

The underlying mechan-isms of Type I Hot Corrosion and Type II Hot Corrosion are increasingly well-understood.  Modern turbine engine designs that seek to achieve better fuel efficiency in part by increasing turbine inlet temperatures are strong candidates for nickel-based superalloy turbine disk materials.  As disk temperatures approach 700C, designers must consider the likelihood and effects of Type II corrosion.  Type II corrosion is typically characterized by localized corrosion pitting caused by melting of sulfur-containing salts.  Type II hot corrosion pits have been shown to decrease the fatigue resistance of superalloys due to initiation of fatigue cracks at hot corrosion pits.  However, the rigorous analytical models and tools needed by turbine engine designers to predict Type II corrosion effects are not currently available.The overall objective of this research program will be to develop DARWIN-HC  a probabilistic Type II hot corrosion, fatigue cracking, and fatigue life prediction software tool for nickel-based superalloy turbine disks.The Phase I research was based on data provided by both NASA and the research team. The key Phase I innovations included enhanced probabilistic models that are explicitly parameterized by the relevant environmental and material variables.  The models are a significant step towards modeling the spatial and temporal evolutions of corrosion pits  setting the stage for the development of fatigue life prediction capability.Whereas the existing DARWIN software contains probabilistic models of hard alpha anomalies in titanium disk materials, DARWIN-HC will feature the probabilistic models of defect distributions due to Type II hot corrosion, which can lead to fatigue crack initiation.  In Phase II, the team will create a functional DARWIN-HC prototype software application for evaluation by NASA and industry.","NASA aeronautics defined eight challenge problems for which the Aircraft Aging and Durability (AAD) Project can deliver specific research products to address aeronautics community needs. While the re-search challenges address different aircraft components and specific aging-related issues, the research results will improve the ability to detect, predict, and manage aging hazards.  One of these eight challenge problems is ""Durability of Engine Superalloy Disks"".  The research focus is the durability of new disk alloys at higher operating temperatures to enable improved engine efficiency.  To improve durability of these new superalloy disks, the issues of microstructural instability, hot corrosion, and fatigue durability must be addressed.  Goals include establishment of a long-term database and derivation of analytic models to predict the degradation of new alloys due to microstructural instability and corrosion.  The proposed research effort directly addresses these important challenges.","The initial Non-NASA commercialization strategy is straightforward and significantly bolstered by the strength of the research team, the numerous industry contacts, and the existing DARWIN software infrastructure and support.  The commercial product output of the proposed SBIR effort will be DARWIN-HC --- an extension of an existing FAA-sponsored software tool that predicts the probability of fracture of titanium aircraft turbine rotor disks to model and predict the effects of Type II hot corrosion.  DARWIN is rapidly gaining acceptance in the aerospace community and DARWIN-HC will further expand the applicability and reach of the DARWIN product line.  The most direct commercialization route is via collaboration with the major airframers.  Fortunately, Barron Associates has strong, existing working relationships with these companies.  As parallel research advances at the major aerospace companies, BAI will pursue commercialization and collaboration opportunities.  Although it is difficult to predict the rate of advancement of the ongoing research activities upon which future commercialization may depend, even a relatively small market can play a significant role in our growth as a company.",Aircraft Engines

The vortices produced when atmospheric waves ""break"" can have diameters of 900-1200ft and tangential velocities of 70-85 ft/sec. CAT is dangerous to aircraft, recently demonstrated by United flight 967 from Washington-Dulles to Los Angeles on July 21, 2010, which encountered severe turbulence and landed in Denver with over 30 injured passengers, 21 requiring a hospital visit. Many other turbulence incidents have caused injuries or deaths to passengers and crew. Another recently-highlighted hazard is the inadequacy of current airspeed sensors on commercial aircraft. Federal investigators have reported that on at least a dozen recent flights by U.S. jetliners, malfunctioning equipment made it impossible for pilots to know how fast they were flying. A similar issue is believed to have played a role in the June 2009 crash of Air France 447 that killed all 228 people aboard. Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) proposes the Molecular Air Data and Clear Air Turbulence (MADCAT) system which will be capable of providing not only a look-ahead capability to predict clear air turbulence but also a full air data solution (airspeed, angle of attack, angle of sideslip, pressure and temperature). The technology has already been demonstrated in-flight, confirming its ability to measure these air-data parameters. In addition, ground units based upon the same core technology have demonstrated the ability to detect atmospheric turbulence. MAC's direct-detection UV LIDAR technology uses molecular backscatter and does not require airborne particles and/or vapor to be suspended in the air, as other proposed solutions based on radar and LIDAR do. This Phase 2 project will result in a laboratory test model of MADCAT and a plan for subsequent airborne testing.","MADCAT will allow NASA aircraft the benefit of having a clear-air turbulence warning system and an optical air data system in one package, suitable for general use by NASA aircraft as well as for flight research concerning clear-air turbulence and scientific studies of atmospheric processes.  Ground-based research uses include measuring wind speed and direction along with air temperature and density while also detecting and characterizing turbulence; this could find use in large wind tunnels and near airports.","Clear-air turbulence represents a significant hazard and passenger-comfort issue, and the proposed MADCAT system will be very useful for commercial aircraft not only as a turbulence-warning solution, but also as an air data system that is more reliable than current speed-sensing technologies.  Information on winds near aircraft, if downlinked and compiled, will be of significant value to weather forecasters, especially from aircraft flying over areas (oceans, etc.) where balloon radiosonde releases and other wind measurements are sparse or non-existent; the National Weather Service lists the lack of more comprehensive wind-profile data as a major unmet data need for accurate, longer-range forecasts.  Turbulence detection with wind speed and direction data will find ground-based uses for wind farms (to detect approaching turbulence, gusts and direction changes, allowing corrective action) and for the military (in artillery and other munitions delivery and in the airdrop of supplies).","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Optical"

Recently, Barron Associates, Inc. (BAI) has developed a system for unmanned aerial vehicles that autonomously executes recovery strategies to rapidly restore nominal flight. During Phase I, BAI sought to extend this system to manned vehicles by developing a joint human-automated (H/A) system. The goal of this system is to assist the crew during the recovery process by conveying information about recovery procedures in an intuitive and unobtrusive manner. BAI developed crew-specific extensions to the automated system both at the architecture and interface level. The architecture defines what information is delivered to the crew. The interface defines how this information is presented to the crew. Metrics were defined to measure the quality of the recovery and crew experience. Phase I pilot-in-the-loop experiments have shown there is the potential for significant performance gains and workload reduction if the joint H/A recovery system is used to guide the pilot through the recovery process. Phase I experiments were limited in scope. During Phase II, BAI would like to build upon these results by demonstrating that gains become even more pronounced in a realistic cockpit environment. This will require migrating to a higher-quality simulator and more accurately simulating the duties of the crew. The team will target ATPs (Airline Transport Pilots) during Phase II and expand the subject population so that the benefit of the system can be explicitly quantified. While integration into the cockpit is the ultimate goal for this system, BAI believes that the joint H/A recovery system can be of immediate use as a training aid. As part of the experimental build-up, BAI would also like to show that the use of the joint H/A recovery system during training translates into improved pilot recoveries when the system is not active.","One of the overarching goals of the NASA's Aviation Safety Program is to improve aircraft safety for current and future aircraft. As loss of control accounts for a significant percentage of the fatal accident rate, developing systems that improve the response to upset conditions in flight are critical to achieving this goal. Joint H/A upset recovery research sits as the junction of two integral components of the Aviation Safety Program: Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control research and Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck research. The former seeks to ""arrive at a set of validated multidisciplinary integrated aircraft control design tools and techniques for enabling safe flight in the presence of adverse conditions (e.g. faults, damage and/or upsets)."" The latter seeks to ""establish transformative integrated display concepts, decision support functions, on-board/off-board information management, high-integrity external hazard detection, and effective mechanisms for human-automation interaction that enable safer flight deck systems for NextGen."" The current research seeks to not only transform state-of-the-art automated methods for upset recovery into a powerful decision aid system but to extend human-automation interaction to create a system capable of exploiting H/A collaboration.","The immediate application for the proposed technology is in the civilian aerospace sector to improve aviation safety and security. However, the technology will readily extend to military aviation and space exploration. The increasing prevalence of remotely-piloted UAVs for military and homeland security applications, their consideration for terrestrial science missions and planetary exploration in the near-to-mid term, and the likely ubiquitous commercial roles of these vehicles in the longer-term, provide numerous opportunities for the transition of the proposed SBIR technologies. Application potential is not limited to the aerospace industry, but is extensible to all systems where a human operator can be assisted by an automated agent.Another application is the use of the joint H/A recovery system as a training aid. The low revenues in the regional airline industry have led to hiring practices that bring in unseasoned pilots with minimal flight experience and training. During Phase II, the authors will have gathered initial data on the utility of training with the joint H/A recovery system in both a desktop simulator as well as higher-fidelity fixed-base simulator. Armed with positive results, the authors can aggressively market this system to regional carriers as a low-cost training solution.","Attitude Determination and Control; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems"

The combination of these complementary technologies promises to revolutionize aircraft systems and operations safety in the decades ahead.  However, the task of safely integrating these technologies is becoming increasingly difficult as their level of complexity, degree of automation, and demands from their operational environment grow. The Next Generation Air Transport System (NextGen), while providing significant benefits in terms of increased capacity and safety, will exacerbate this situation due to the large numbers of new and existing systems that will be required to interoperate.The multidisciplinary nature of these systems is a significant factor that makes analyzing their safety characteristics extremely difficult. While many development tools exist to conduct deep analyses within individual disciplines, there is a lack of tools available for deep analysis of complex multidisciplinary designs. The proposed research seeks to create a new class of development tool that will allow designers of complex systems-of-systems to explore the dynamic interactions between system components to uncover systemic vulnerabilities, precursory conditions, and likely outcomes.The Phase I project generated an initial implementation of the software package Idea, an Integrated Design and Analysis Environment that could be used to model complex interdependencies between flight deck operations, flight deck controls and display, and the underlying physical components of the aircraft. The proposed Phase II effort will mature this software and expand its capabilities, resulting in a flexible, standards-compliant tool that is ready for beta testing and subsequent commercialization. It will focus on enhancements that support cross-disciplinary modeling and analysis of safety-critical human-automation systems.","Initial applications of the proposed technology are envisioned to be within NASA's Aviation Safety Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck program. The software has direct application in the design and analysis of flight deck systems and of distributed systems that intersect with flight deck operations. The tool's features are motivated by the particular combination of challenges encountered in flight deck design (complex, safety critical, multidisciplinary, mixed human and automation systems, etc.), and this same combination arises in many other contexts related to aircraft and spacecraft operations. Moreover, the software is highly customizable and can be modified to support a wide variety of engineering disciplines. The software can therefore be of significant benefit to a wide variety of systems engineering projects, especially those that involve  integration of multiple subsystems for which safety analyses are difficult to conduct manually, including projects associated with the NextGen Air Transport System.","As the tool is intended to initially support design of commercial flight deck systems, the closest non-NASA commercial application will be in the design of military flight deck systems and related components. Other directly related applications include UAV, UGV, and UUV operator interfaces and supporting systems. Because of the tool's flexibility and general applicability to large-scale systems engineering projects, there is an essentially unlimited number of potential applications outside the government. The best candidates are those that involve complex system-of-systems designs. Examples include the automotive industry, the health care and medical device industries, the telecommunications industry, and large portions of the information technology sector. Many of these have already begun to adopt model-based design and other system engineering technologies that are consistent with the use of this tool.",Human-Computer Interfaces; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

Traditionally, to suppress adverse aeroservoelastic interaction, notch and/or roll off filters are used in the primary flight control system architecture. This solution has pitfalls; rigid body performance is degraded due to resulting phase penalty and it is not robust to off nominal behavior. In Phase I, an approach was developed that is entitled, Modal Isolation and Damping for Adaptive Aeroservoelastic Suppression (MIDAAS). This adaptive technique determines an optimal blend of multiple outputs that effectively isolates a problematic lightly damped mode and simultaneously determines an optimal blend of multiple inputs to suppress the problematic mode via feedback. Adverse effects on aircraft rigid body performance are minimized, resulting in virtually no phase penalty. MIDAAS was validated against aeroservoelastic F/A-18C aircraft models with varying stores configurations and demonstrated very successful performance. In the proposed Phase II program, a robust real-time adaptive aeroservoelastic suppression solution will be developed with a buildup approach that includes further MIDAAS enhancements, extensive validation studies utilizing a high-fidelity CFD-based aeroelastic model of the NASA X-53 aircraft, and extensive validation studies utilizing real-time pilot in the loop simulation capability.","NASA is a research leader in the areas of aeroelasticity, flight dynamics, control, and flight testing. The proposed work here naturally follows from and compliments these areas with a specific focus on adaptive suppression of adverse aeroservoelastic phenomena. This program also fits the needs of the NASA Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) project by supplying a robust adaptive solution to controlling adverse conditions in the presence of off nominal system variations. Safe flight is further ensured by the comprehensive validation approach that includes real-time piloted simulations. NASA aeronautics centers (DFRC, LaRC, ARC) have the most potential benefit but the program may also be beneficial to NASA space programs (i.e., suppression of high frequency resonance in spacecraft and rocket systems). The proposed program will lead to a commercial software and hardware simulation product targeted at aeroservoelastic aircraft systems providing a valuable asset for many NASA programs.","Performance degradation due to adverse aeroservoelastic effects is ubiquitous and hence the core methodology can be applied in a variety of areas. Other aerospace applications include rotorcraft systems, rocket booster and spacecraft structural mode detection and control. Outside of aerospace, other areas of application include automotive (for engine and vehicle dynamic monitoring and control), industrial manufacturing (for rejection of machine noise and structural vibrations), infrastructure (for monitoring buildings, bridges, etc., for changes in stiffness and damping and subsequent active suppression of adverse dynamics), and alternative energy (aeroservoelastic suppression for wind turbine technology). Beyond industry there are potential post applications within the US military. Aeroelastic analysis and testing will benefit from the proposed program at military facilities such as the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, the Air Armament Center at Eglin AFB and the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division at China Lake.","Controls-Structures Interaction (CSI); Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Sensor Webs/Distributed Sensors; Simulation Modeling Environment; Structural Modeling and Tools"

Flight evaluations of various adaptive controllers conducted by NASA and others have shown great promise. In some cases unfavorable pilot-vehicle interactions including pilot-induced oscillations have occurred. Susceptibility to such interactions is more likely when the pilot interacts with a highly nonlinear vehicle that may no longer have predictable response characteristics. To alleviate these unfavorable interactions, Systems Technology, Inc. proposes the Smart Adaptive Flight Effective Cue or SAFE-Cue. This innovative system provides force feedback to the pilot via an active control inceptor with corresponding command path gain adjustments. The SAFE-Cue alerts the pilot that the adaptive control system is active, provides guidance via force feedback cues, and attenuates commands, thus ensuring pilot-vehicle system stability and performance in the presence of damage or failures. Phase 2 will build upon a successful Phase 1 demonstration wherein SAFE-Cue configurations eliminated pilot-vehicle system oscillation tendencies allowing the evaluation pilots to focus on the task rather than maintaining control. In this proposed program, a prototype SAFE-Cue will be developed and evaluated with exemplar adaptive controllers using the Calspan Learjet In-Flight Simulator.","The SAFE-Cue directly addresses a concern of the Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control topic under NASA's Aviation Safety Program to prevent pilot-vehicle system loss of control in the presence of an active adaptive control system. A successful Phase 2 will produce a prototype SAFE-Cue system that will alert the pilot regarding flight control system adaptations due to failures/damage and constrain the pilot via active inceptor force feedback and command path gain attenuation as a means to mitigate loss-of-control. While the SAFE-Cue system is designed to work with adaptive systems, the concept is general and has application to any flight control system.  The interest in preventing loss-of-control is based on a very real problem that has caused loss of life and property throughout the history of flight. This system can be applied to NASA fixed wing and rotorcraft to provide an enhanced level of safety to NASA's flight test activities.","Following the successful completion of a Phase 2 in-flight evaluation program, a prototype SAFE-Cue system will be ready to transition into a commercially viable product. For other government agencies, specifically the Department of Defense, the SAFE-Cue system will have high-value due to its potential to reduce loss-of-control accidents in the more extreme military operational environment. This includes the F-35 (all three variants), V-22 tilt-rotor, C-17 military airlifter, and the CH-53K helicopter. The F-35 and the forthcoming CH-53K both feature active pilot inceptors and are thus SAFE-Cue ready with this important technology piece in place. Regarding commercial aviation, the system will be particularly applicable to aircraft with modern FBW flight control systems.  Initially, it will be targeted for use in the commercial aircraft fleet where it can add a significantly increased level of safety at a reasonable incremental cost.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems"

Unfortunately, inaccurate or false readings from these sensors can lead to improper decision-making resulting in serious and sometimes fatal consequences. The research performed in Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced data analysis techniques to identify anomalies in Pitot tubes resulting from blockage such as icing, moisture, or foreign objects.  The core technology used in this project is referred to as ""noise analysis"" since it relates a sensor's response time to the dynamic component (noise) found in the signal of these same sensors.   This analysis technique has used existing electrical signals of Pitot tube sensors that result from measured processes during in-flight conditions and/or induced signals in pre-flight conditions to detect anomalies in the sensor readings.AMS has routinely used this technology to determine the health of pressure transmitters in nuclear power plants. The application of this technology for the detection of aircraft anomalies is innovative in that instead of determining the health of process monitoring at a steady state condition, this technology will be used to quickly inform the pilot when an air speed indication becomes faulty under any flight condition as well as during pre-flight preparation.","Although the general target for the end product of this research is in the commercial and private aircraft sectors, NASA and other governmental/military facilities would greatly benefit from this technology.  As all aircraft rely on the accurate and reliable performance of Pitot/static systems, improving the detection of inaccurate indications would increase the safety of aircraft passengers and crew, reduce the potential for accidents, and will lead to other advances in aviation technology.","The intended end product of a Phase I and Phase II project is the development of hardware and/or software that can be used for the detection of Pitot tube anomalies resulting from blockages either during in-flight or pre-flight conditions. This end product, which will be commercialized by AMS in a Phase III project with non-federal funding, will have wide applications in the commercial, private, and military aircraft industries.  Furthermore, it is envisioned that this new technology would be used not only for new aircraft, but also for existing aircraft with only minor modifications.","Attitude Determination and Control; Data Acquisition and End-to-End-Management; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Pilot Support Systems; Portable Data Acquisition or Analysis Tools"

Ridgetop developed a MIL-STD-1553 bus monitor and a MIL-STD-1553 bus controller that simulates the aircraft data bus, reads the environmental (i.e., altitude) and operational (i.e., response of system) data of a system and determines if a fault is manifesting; and if true determines the root cause and symptoms of the fault. Once an anomaly is detected, the Model-based Avionic Prognostic Reasoner (MAPR) solves a user-outlined state-space model, symbolically, using a Gauss-Newton optimization method and the information from the MIL-STD-1553 bus. This algorithm outputs a list of best fitting parameters to match the command to the actual performance. Rules are programmed in, based on results from principal component analysis . The rules determine both fault mode and the severity of that fault. The rules can distinguish between two failure modes: Mechanical jam and MOSFET failure, and healthy.The real-time processing will allow for critical evolutions in flight safety and provides a game-changing approach to condition-based maintenance. Once  deployed, flight safety can be improved by allowing the on-board flight computers to read from the MAPR and update their control envelope based on its evaluations, reducing damage propagation and increasing operational safety. In Phase 2, we will develop a functioning ground-based prototype of the technology to show the efficacy of the method. A ground-based version of the tool is the best candidate for development to ease adoption by testing in a low-risk environment; this tool will be demonstrated at the end of Phase 2. The MAPR concept is also applicable to any system with a state-space representation but at this point it has been developed with EMAs in mind.

To address this problem, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Joint Planning and Development Office are developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will enable critical advances to the current management of the National Airspace (NAS). The technologies that comprise NextGen offer the possibility of compelling new systems of systems that, if properly designed, will not only enhance the capabilities of the NAS but also improve its safety. At the same time, these fundamental changes bring with them implications for safety and security. In order to address these concerns, new techniques for the certification of software systems will be required to ensure that certification cost will not limit the safety innovations offered by NextGen advances. In Phase I, Barron Associates investigated the integration of ADS-B and TCAS as a representative NextGen system of systems and investigated the application of the system safety case to the system.In the proposed Phase II research, Barron Associates will develop a new collision-avoidance system and conduct an empirical study of the system safety case compared to DO-178B compliance as a certification approach. Throughout the development of the new collision-avoidance system, evidence in support of DO-178B compliance as well as in support of the safety case will be gathered. Using the data from this evidence collection together with the data collected during development, the team will answer key research questions that center on the use of the system safety case as an alternative means for airworthiness certification.","Barron Associates anticipates a number of opportunities to apply this SBIR-developed technology to NASA programs.  With NASA's ongoing efforts for the development of the NextGen airspace, and their continued progress in both manned and unmanned space exploration, there is renewed emphasis on increased levels of safety, reliability, and affordability for these new and emerging systems and concepts.  To address hardware component failures and faults, control and flight operational systems for advanced platforms will need to be intelligent, adaptable, reconfigurable, and often nondeterministic in their behavior in order to provide the required levels of safety and reliability. Current certification approaches have served well in the past but may not scale adequately for envisioned future systems. Our proposed empirical study of the system safety case as an alternative means for certification will lay the groundwork for its acceptance as a viable path to certification.Additionally, Barron Associates' proposed demonstration of a modular collision-avoidance system based on ADS-B presents an opportunity to use NextGen emerging technology to develop a collision-avoidance system that is accurate, safe, and future-proof. As surveillance technologies advance, cost-effective upgrades to the collision-avoidance system will be possible, allowing those advances to improve the performance of the overall system, enabling further separation reductions without additional nuisance warnings.","Barron Associates envisions significant near- and far-term uses for the proposed use of the system safety case for certification. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, requires the delivery of an assurance argument --- a synonym for the safety case --- with any new direct-injection drug pumps.  The increase in the amound of software present in unmanned systems make traditional certification approaches both challenging and expensive; the results of the empirical study will inform future decision making regarding how certification should be pursued.  Beyond air vehicles, other classes of unmanned systems, including ground and underwater vehicles will also benefit from the technology.Finally, the nuclear industry depends upon software for the control of its power plants and propulsion systems. Techniques like the system safety case, which directly argue software safety, may bring benefit as compared to prescriptive approaches, which only claim software quality.The proposed new, modular collision-avoidance system also has applications beyond those envisioned for NASA. In addition to its applications for civil air transport, the modularity of the system make it suitable for Department of Defense use in sense-and-avoid applications: ADS-B could be replaced by an active surveillance capability, such as one that relied on an on-board radar.",Pilot Support Systems

This materials development software package (MDSAM) can be used to optimize properties (high strength and low thermal conductivity) for both the virgin material as well as the char that forms during the operating conditions. It will provide atomistic-level information on char evolution and the degradation of thermo-mechanical properties. The proposed MDSAM will consist of the following two modules: (i) an experimentally validated, atomistic-level simulation engine capable of predicting the role of interfacial structure on the resin-to-carbon process and (ii) atomistically-informed continuum-level thermo-mechanical performance analyzer for composite ablative materials subjected to transient pyrolytic conditions. The underlying methodology and the software package will be transitioned to NASA scientists working on ablative materials development. In addition to developing a computational software package, we will address open, unsolved problems in the literature to support NASA's ablative materials development requirements. In the course of developing this methodology, we will produce significant scientific results on pyrolysis and materials properties that will be important to NASA.","Ablative material development requires fundamental understanding of the molecular processes involved during the pyrolysis reaction and char evolution under transient conditions to accurately predict the effective insulation properties. The proposed software package is primarily focused towards providing this fundamental understanding to assist NASA with advanced materials development capabilities for the ablative materials to be used in the next generation space vehicles. The composite ablative material system studied in this project is derived from phenolic resins and fillers such as carbon fibers, in which NASA has strong interests. However, the software package will have the ability to study a wide range of existing ablative materials and design novel ablative materials. Furthermore, the developed methodology can be applied towards studying reaction mechanisms in high temperature combustion processes. These methodologies can probe reactions at high temperature and high pressure environments that are not easily accessible to experiments.","Light weight materials such as reinforced plastics are rapidly replacing the traditional structural materials such as metals, woods etc. However, in many instances, these materials are flammable and they require modifications to decrease their flammability through addition of flame-retardant components. Environment regulations have restricted the use of halogenated flame-retardant additives, initiating a search for alternative flame-retardant additives. Carbon nanotubes have shown that they can simultaneously improve both the physical and flammability properties of the polymer nanocomposite. Our multiscale software package will explain the underlying physical mechanisms and accurately predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of the protective char layer. Thus it will directly help in development of the next generation commercial fireproofing materials.

The system provides energy-dense, low volume hydrocarbon fuel conditioning based on the hydrolysis reaction of triethylaluminum (TEA) with water.  TEA is an organometallic liquid that reacts exothermically with water and burns readily in air.  In Phase 1, we demonstrated the hydrolysis of TEA in JP fuel within an integrated mixing/injection apparatus to heat and vaporize the liquid hydrocarbon fuel prior to injection in a regeneratively cooled scramjet, as well as auto-ignition of the mixture at elevated TEA concentrations.  In Phase 2 we propose to more completely characterize the performance capability of the Phase 1 system using several hydrocarbon fuels to gather data for the design and fabrication of a palletized system.  Testing of the palletized system in a direct connect scramjet rig will then be conducted to demonstrate engine ignition capability and to compare the system to other ignition systems under consideration for scramjet vehicles.   Packaging in candidate flight vehicles will be carried out using 3D solid modeling to provide gravimetric and volumetric information and to provide designs for practical integrated, safe storage and dispense arrangements.","A TEA based scramjet cold start system is expected to have significant mass and volume savings compared to traditional scramjet cold start techniques such as silane and ethylene when compared on an equivalence ratio basis.  These mass and volume savings translate directly into additional capability and can alleviate some of the system packaging requirements of future hypersonic vehicle systems.  In addition, the potential low Mach capability of a TEA based system helps extend the utility of scramjet engines proposed for turbine-based combined cycle hypersonic vehicles to lower Mach numbers, providing flexibility in selecting high-speed turbines capable of generating the required Mach number for scramjet takeover.  NASA is interested in these types of vehicles as potential solutions for cheaper, reusable, more effective access to space.","The key advantage of a TEA based system over currently used single-function engine start techniques is that it provides multi-faceted benefits such as intense energy release, readily ignitable ethane gas, atomization of the fuel through effervescence, and pyrophoricity for ignition.  As such, it likely has utility to assist in the high altitude re-light of turbojets with minimal modifications.  If developed for such an approach, the TEA based system would be capable of providing engine start functionality for both the turbojet and scramjet in a turbine-based combined-cycle vehicle, significantly reducing overall system complexity.  Companies such as Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne that develop both turbojets and scramjets would find such a capable and simplifying system to be of great benefit in meeting the system requirements of a combined-cycle hypersonic vehicle.

This tool can be applied to rapidly identify parameters, such as modal damping and frequency from test data measured at pre-flutter flight/wind tunnel conditions, then subsequently to assess the flutter boundary of aircraft/wind tunnel model in real time. In this PVE Toolbox, several system identification techniques are employed to consistently estimate the damping/frequency of the physical modes, followed by the implementation of Zimmerman-Weissenburger flutter margin, damping trends extrapolation, linear parameter varying modeling combined with mu-analysis, and thin plate interpolation method for flutter boundary prediction.  Seamlessly integration of the PVE Toolbox into IADS (a real-time flight test data acquisition software system) will significantly improve the on-line flutter prediction capability of the PVE Toolbox.  This robust, production-ready, and flight test demonstrated PVE Toolbox will provide flight/wind tunnel test engineers an on-line flutter prediction capability in the control room for decision-making during flight/wind tunnel flutter tests.","Comprehensive flutter prediction software is still non-existing; leading to cautious and expensive flight/wind tunnel flutter test programs. ZONA envisions that the proposed Phase II research effort will result in a commercial product, called the PVE Toolbox. The PVE Toolbox will be a crucial technology for the flight flutter test of the next generation aircraft such as the NASA Hybrid Wind Body Configuration and Quiet Supersonic Transport.","The potential non-NASA customers for this tool include the R & D arms of USAF, Navy, Army, and the defense industry complex.

An optimization of the DBD plasma actuators should be achieved using efficient, comprehensive, physically-based DBD simulation tool for different operation conditions. We propose to develop a DBD plasma actuator simulation tool for a wide range of ambient gas pressures. The proposed tool will treat DBD using either kinetic, fluid or hybrid model, depending on the DBD operational condition. The proposed tool will be validated by comparison with the experimental and numerical data on the DBD investigations.","The primary NASA applications of the proposed DBD simulation tool are active flow control concepts for both subsonic and hypersonic flights. Predictable active flow separation control, achieved using the proposed tool, will benefit many NASA Projects, such as Subsonic Fixed Wing Project, Subsonic Rotary Wing Project and Hypersonic Project. In addition to the flow separation application, DBD simulation tool can be used for a number of NASA problems, associated with gas discharges at different pressures.

This nonlinear aeroelastic solver is generated by interacting a nonlinear structural Reduced Order Model (ROM) with a Neural-Network-based (NN-based) aerodynamic ROM and a gust ROM to provide the incremental aeroelastic forces and moments of a classical flight dynamics model. In this way, the flight dynamics model is kept with minimum changes so that this integrated flight dynamics simulation remains in the frame work of a 6-degrees-of-freedom simulation environment.  The nonlinear structural ROM employs an ELSTEP/FAT procedure that operates on a commercial nonlinear finite element software to construct the nonlinear stiffness matrices.  The NN-based and gust aerodynamic ROM is generated using a system identification technique operating on a CFD code to evaluate the weights and biases in a two-layer feed-forward NN system.  The end product is called FuNL-DFS that can simulate the key aeroelastic coupling mechanism between nonlinear structural dynamics and nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics with classical rigid body dynamics and can be used for control law development, maneuvering flight simulation, flight loads prediction and handling quality assessment. The FuNL-DFS system will be validated with the flight test data of the Predator B Aircraft.","NASA has been working for many years towards achieving a software package that accurately predicts the interaction between flight dynamics and nonlinear aeroelastic effects in closed-loop flight dynamic simulation. NASA's current and next generation aircraft design concepts such as the N+1 Conventional, N+2 Hybrid Wing Body, and N+3 Generation are more flexible, more slender and/or more sizable where there may be insufficient frequency separation between the rigid body dynamics and the relatively low frequency elastic modes. The flight control law based on the rigid model may result in an unacceptable stability or an undesirable response characteristic due to control input or turbulence.

In practice, the interactions between technical disciplines are often not fully explored analytically, and the analysis in one discipline often uses a simplified representation of other disciplines as an input or boundary condition. For example, the fluid forces in an engine generate static and dynamic rotor deflection, but the forces themselves are dependent on the rotor position and its orbit. This practice ignores the interaction between the physical phenomena where the outcome of each analysis can be heavily dependent on the inputs (i.e., changes in flow due to deflection, changes in deflection due to fluid forces). Such a rigid design process also lacks the flexibility to employ multiple levels of fidelity in the analysis of each of the components. The goals for this project are to develop and validate an innovative design environment that has the flexibility to simultaneously analyze multiple disciplines, multiple components, with multiple levels of model fidelity.  Development and demonstration of such a system will provide substantially superior capabilities to current design tools.","By providing an integrated framework for turbomachinery analysis, the work in this project will reduce the time and complexity of the multiphysics analyses (job setup, solution control, pre- and post-processing).

With our discrete geometry toolkit, shape modifications will be achieved via an elegant and intuitive ""plug-and-play"" approach, providing engineers with a wide variety of options for shape parameterization, shape deformation, and geometric constraint imposition. Our geometry toolkit will be composed of independent modules and will be easily integrated into existing or future analysis and design environments.

A key contributor to this fact is the inherent cost associated with installation and maintenance of these control systems, since many system designs require the replacement of a helicopter's rotor blades, rotor hub components, or both.  The proposed work addresses this deficiency through the development of an on-blade full-span camber control system that reaps many of the known benefits of advanced rotor control in a retrofit design approach that has the potential to achieve production status due to its lower risks and costs compared to previous system concepts.  The design leverages past work in the use of smart-material actuated bistable tabs for rotor blade tracking, with a newer integral actuation concept that will lead toward a more robust and flightworthy design.","An adaptive ability to alter the spanwise loading of rotor blades could be used to optimize rotorcraft aeromechanics and identify improved operational profiles, maximizing the utility and cost-effectiveness of future helicopters incorporating this technology.  Full development of this novel adaptive blade capability would support key aeromechanics aspects of the Subsonic Rotary Wing Project of the Fundamental Aeronautics Program, in particular active on-blade control for performance improvement and noise and vibration alleviation. Follow-on work would also enhance current analysis methods, which are presently unable to capture complex active-rotor response and thus are a barrier to selection of optimal active control approaches.","Retrofit blade controls of the type explored here can both enhance the performance and reduce the acoustic emissions and blade-induced vibrations of suitably equipped rotorcraft over baseline vehicles.  Since this capability could be achieved using technology that does not require the re-blading of an existing helicopter, a significant commercial product improvement program for a variety of aircraft would be possible.  Military operators would also realize improved mission capability and reduced aircraft downtime with these anticipated improvements.  However, this actuation technology can also serve as a starting point for development of an evolved active control system that integrates the trailing edge active control devices into the blade structure, offering an alternative implementation path with potential advantages in robustness and reduced drag penalty.","Airframe; Controls-Structures Interaction (CSI); Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Multifunctional/Smart Materials; Pilot Support Systems"

Rotorcraft drive trains must withstand enormous pressure while operating continuously in extreme temperature and vibration environments. Captive components, such as planetary and spiral bevel gears, see enormous strain but are not accessible to fixed instrumentation such as a piezoelectric transducer. Thus, it is difficult to directly monitor components that are most susceptible to damage. Ridgetop has developed an embedded data acquisition module that overcomes these limitations. This innovation is a self-contained data processing unit within a specialized fixture that installs directly inside the hubs of rotating gear parts. From this location, it and detects and transmits high fidelity prognostic data to a fixed transceiver. The sensor is based on MEMS technology and uses innovative circuit designs to capture high bandwidth data and transmit it wirelessly from inside an operational helicopter transmission. In Phase 2, Ridgetop will build the module and acquisition system, and demonstrate it at the NASA Glenn Rotorcraft transmission testbed. We will provide evidence that the innovation gives superior fidelity by making side-by-side comparisons with current fixed-sensor setup. Ridgetop will tie in data collection with prognostics and advanced diagnostic approaches, make enhancements, and show an improvement in failure detection horizon times. We will also develop a data interface between the wireless sensor port and a standard HUMS communication bus.

The work involves closely coupling aerothermal and structural analyses for the first stage vane of a high pressure turbine (HPT).  These vanes are actively cooled, typically using film cooling.  Ceramic materials have different structural and thermal properties than conventional metals used for the first stage HPT vane.  Vane configurations which satisfy CMC structural strength and life constraints, while maintaining vane aerodynamic efficiency and increasing mainstream gas temperature for improved engine performance will be identified. The proposed work will examine modifications to vane internal and external configurations to achieve the desired objectives.  Thermal and pressure stresses are equally important, and both will be analyzed.  Three dimensional fluid and heat transfer analyses will be used to determine vane aerodynamic performance and heat load distributions.","The proposed work advances the goals of the NASA Aeronautics program.  The proposed work furthers the adoption of materials which can be used to increase turbine inlet temperatures.  This is beneficial for a wide rang of gas turbine engine applications.  The primary benefit of increased turbine inlet temperature is in the reduction of SFC. Reducing fuel consumption reduces CO2 emissions, and for every pound of fuel saved nearly three pounds of CO2 are not produced in the combustion process.  Using the higher temperature capabilities of CMC materials to reduce vane cooling can be used to reduce combustor outlet temperature without decreasing rotor inlet temperature.  Just slightly reducing the combustor outlet temperature significantly reduces NOx.  Since the rotor inlet temperature is not reduced, there is no negative impact on fuel consumption.The higher temperature capability of CMC materials has a beneficial impact on gas turbine engines for a wide range of applications.  Small gas turbines, for rotary wing applications, have relatively high SFC, and are likely to experience the greatest reduction in SFC for a given increase in gas temperature.  Commercial transport aircraft consume large amounts of fuel.  Even a slight improvement in SFC for these aircraft saves significant amounts of fuel and emissions.  Supersonic aircraft have very high fuel-to-payload ratios.  For these aircraft a small reduction in fuel burn gives a large payload improvement.","Improvements in SFC for commercial transport aircraft through the application of CMC components would be used by the complete range of gas turbine engines used in military applications.  Using CMC components in ground power gas turbines can significantly reduce CO2 emissions.  Current combined cycles and future clean coal cycles use gas turbine components, and operate as base load plants.  Their continuous operation at maximum power consumes very large quantities of fuel. Even a small improvement in fuel rate, (kg/kW), significantly reduces emissions.  Any reduction in the fuel consumption yields substantial cost savings.The combined cycle gas turbine overall pressure ratio is only about half that of an aircraft gas turbine.  Consequently, pressure loads are lower. Hence, ground power gas turbines might adopt CMC components in the near future.  Recuperated turbines, such as those marketed by Solar Turbines Inc., have high cycle efficiencies, but low overall pressure ratios(less than 20).  However, they require a large heat exchanger, which causes the capital cost to be greater than the cost of a simple cycle gas turbine for ground power applications.  The efficiency of recuperated turbines improves markedly with a rise in gas temperatures.N&R Engineering intends to provide design and analysis services for the evaluation of CMC components in gas turbine engines.  In addition, N&R Engineering would provide these services to operators of these engines.",Aircraft Engines; Ceramics; Composites; Structural Modeling and Tools

The Airspace Super Density Operations (ASDO) RFA seeks to develop efficient terminal area operations. It is expected that multiple ASDO concepts will be interacting with one another in a complex non-deterministic manner. Therefore, the overall terminal system performance may not be a straightforward combination of individual performance indices. It is also crucial that the overall system performance be robust to wind and operational uncertainties. The proposed research effort seeks to develop a fast-time, stochastic analysis tool based on queuing theory that can be used to evaluate the interaction and combined performance of multiple ASDO concepts. The utility of the approach was demonstrated under Phase I research. Phase II research seeks to achieve the following: (i) make enhancements to the modeling and simulation aspects of the approach, (ii) accelerate the stochastic simulation execution time using high-performance computing solutions, (iii) create software plug-ins for existing NASA research tools, (iv) conduct studies of NextGen terminal area concepts using the queuing simulation, and (v) develop a conflict free scheduling algorithm based on the queuing simulation.","The primary application of the queuing model developed in the course of this research is to serve as a stochastic analysis tool to evaluate proposed NextGen concepts in the terminal area. The proposed queuing model provides a transformation between the terminal area routes, procedures and runway configurations, to the traffic flow efficiency. This model can be used in rapid prototyping tools that design terminal area routes and procedures, to evaluate the efficiency of the designed route. The queuing model and the associated simulation framework can be used to evaluate the performance of various sequencing, scheduling, pairing, and merging & spacing algorithms being developed under NASA's Airspace Super Density Operations (ASDO) program. During Phase II research a plug-in will be developed for the STASS software that is currently being used by the ASDO group. Interfaces will also be identified to other NASA software tools such as TRAC and CTAS.","The proposed queuing model shows potential for the following non-NASA applications:1. The Phase II research effort proposes to develop queuing model based sequencing, scheduling and merging & spacing algorithms. Such algorithms can be a part of a decision support automation used by air-traffic controllers in the terminal area and metroplexes.  2. The fast-time stochastic queuing simulation framework developed using high-performance computing framework can provide near real-time forecasts of the state of the terminal area taking into account wind and weather uncertainties. Such a forecast capability can be vital to Traffic Flow Management (TFM) decision-making algorithms under adverse weather conditions. 3. This model can be used by the Airline Operations Center (AOC) to make decisions on canceling, re-routing or re-scheduling flights in response to an adverse weather event.",Operations Concepts and Requirements; Simulation Modeling Environment; Testing Requirements and Architectures

The advent of AFPs in 2006 has generated many more potentially exchangeable resources that would be valued sufficiently differently by their owners to make a trade desirable. We believe that NAS users and the FAA would embrace such a marketplace and that it would enable users to collectively reduce their operating costs resulting from NAS congestion.Both FAA and NASA research has highlighted the need for efficient and equitable allocation of NAS resources and increased operational flexibility. Market-based mechanisms have been suggested for transferring system-imposed delay from more critical to less critical flights. No such capability is available to NAS users today. In this SBIR, we will show how the advent of AFPs changes the forces at work in a slot-trading marketplace, making its functions much more valuable to flight operators.","The proposed SBIR directly benefits NASA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Air Traffic Management Airspace Project, whose primary goal is to develop integrated solutions for a safe, efficient and high-capacity airspace system. Efficient airspace allocation requires early research in market-based mechanisms for design of the next-generation air transportation system.","The proposed marketplace has application in commercial ATM both in the U.S. and abroad. In the U.S. ATM market, any resource broker attempting to establish a slot market will require the tools and procedures output by Phases 2 and 3 of this SBIR to act as a central processor and tracker of ATM-induced flight controls. At the same time, U.S. air carriers will require tools with which to monitor and manage their flight schedules and make informed, effective decisions for exchanging resources. Estimates of costs due to delays range from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars per year. The opportunity to save even a fraction of these costs creates significant motivation for airline participation. It is reasonable to assume that the number of carriers willing to participate in this system will be comparable to the number signed up as active members of the collaborative decision making (CDM) program.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

Viable applications include military missions, law enforcement, border patrol, weather data collection, telecommunications, land use imaging, and cargo transport. NASA and other organizations have invested heavily in this unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research. UAVs can be flown in the National Airspace System (NAS) today, but only with special permission from the FAA  a process that often takes 60 to 90 days. Moreover, permission is often contingent on heavy restrictions, such as accompanying the UAV with a manned chase plane, thereby nullifying the cost savings of a UAV. Full fruition of UAV technology will require incorporation of UAVs into mainstream air traffic management (ATM) practices, including traffic flow management flow control programs and possible creation of special use airspace (SUA). In this SBIR, we propose a UAV-to-traffic flow management (AIM-UAS) interface. This allows traffic managers to anticipate and track UAVs. In turn, this allows UAV operators to understand their impact on commercial air traffic and their involvement in traffic management activities.","This SBIR benefits NASA in three ways. (1) It furthers one of the main goals of NASA's Strategic Airspace Usage project, the increase of capacity and the enhancement of throughput in the national airspace system via development of long-term operational concepts for collaborative traffic management. (2) This SBIR preserves the integrity and applicability of NASA research and development of UAV technology by helping to overcome a primary obstacle to integration of UAVs into today's national airspace system. In particular, this research will encourage policy makers to accept the viability of UAVs. (3)  NASA decision support tools developed for ATM, such as CTAS, TMA, FAST, and SMS will benefit from recommendations for how to account for UAV traffic into their logic.","The FAA will benefit from this innovative research in several ways. (1) They will have a greater understanding of how they can grapple with changing traffic demand patterns and NAS user needs stemming from remote operation of vehicles. (2) The FAA will have access to a tool and operational paradigm for data exchange between UAV operators and FAA traffic managers. (3)  The FAA will partially achieve one of the NextGen programmatic goals, equitable access to NAS resources for all NAS users. (4) This research will help the FAA set UAV operation policies by providing insight into and feasibility of UAV integration into the NAS. (5) Our proposed tool could be integrated with the FAA's special use airspace system (SAMS), due to strong relation between UAVs and special use airspace.Several other government agencies share responsibility for UAV integration, such as DOT, DoD, DHS, US Forest Service, and Coast Guard.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Pilot Support Systems"

The goal of this research is to develop a Lidar Wind Profiler (LWP) that uses multiple near-parallel lidar beams to track the motion of atmospheric aerosol structures and extract multi-component wind data. In Phase I, the measurement requirements were analyzed and used to develop a numerical model of the performance of a prototype system. In addition, an eye safety analysis was conducted and a conceptual design of the LWP prototype was developed. Studies were conducted with a breadboard in order to demonstrate improvements in spatial and temporal resolution of the system and to obtain more data to further refine the system requirement and algorithm. In Phase II, the LWP design will be finalized and a high power laser design will be combined with narrow pulse-width generation technology as well as an Optical Parametric Oscillator in order to generate a wavelength of 1550. The algorithm will be optimized and extended to measurements in all three dimensions using a multi-beam lidar system. Techniques to extract atmospheric turbulence and detect aircraft wake vortices will be developed. A software package will be developed that will include the following: a front-end GUI for displaying the data and for interfacing with the operator; a real-time data-processing module; a data acquisition module; a data storage and retrieval module.  At the end of Phase II, the LWP prototype will be field tested and evaluated using validation data from ultrasonic anemometers.","A remote wind profiler for measuring winds, turbulence, cloud ceiling and aircraft wake vortex location and intensity can become an integral part of the multi-agency NextGen Aeroportal system, in order to increase throughput in airports and to detect aircraft external hazards.

The reliance on voice communication in ATC operations presents challenges to the researcher who is trying to obtain data and conduct detailed analyses of ATC operations. During the Phase I effort, we designed and developed a prototype system to perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) of ATC clearances. We demonstrated the feasibility of recognizing ATC clearances from speech audio data and associating the clearance data with the flight that is the subject of the clearance. In the Phase II effort, we will create a complete prototype of the ATC speech recognition, processing and analysis capability in SODAA. In addition, we will integrate ATC speech recognition capabilities into a real-time application in the Surface Management System (SMS).","Potential applications for the research results beyond Phase II include use by NASA for continued research of ATC operations and by the FAA.  These applications include both off-line analysis applications and real-time applications. NASA and other aviation community researchers can use this data to analyze ATC operations and to measure workload associated with ATC communication. Analysis of conformance to clearances can also be assessed and analyzed. In real-time application, NASA can use the speech recognition of ATC clearances to improve the performance of the Surface Management System at the NASA NTX facility.","The capability to perform automatic speech recognition of ATC clearances can provide commercial benefit to airlines in their efforts monitor airport operations and drive efficiencies into their operation. Mosaic ATM provides the surface management application that is being used operationally by UPS airline in Louisville, Kentucky.

Aeronautical applications require the use of high quality microphones with a large dynamic range, sometimes in large arrays.  These arrays are expensive.  The advent of lower cost microphones that meet the users' specifications would dramatically improve the ability of engineers seeking to quantify the acoustic impact of either their designs or their facilities (e.g., airports) and to make data driven decisions to improve any adverse situation. In our Phase-I SBIR, we showed the technical feasibility of a commercially viable, piezoelectric micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones capable of withstanding adverse conditions found in ground testing of the acoustics of aeronautical systems.

This proposal describes a novel type of schlieren system that would increase efficiency, capability, and productivity for ground test facilities. The concept and the availability of state-of-the-art components make the system more portable, easier to align, and more versatile than existing systems. A major drawback of current schlieren systems, and one that has restricted their widespread commercial use, is that they require exact alignment between a pair of widely separated mirrors or grids, which takes time and limits portability, and costs are prohibitive for most such applications. This problem is partially relaxed by focusing schlieren methods. The proposed concept incorporates features of existing schlieren systems while removing the primary limitations. All of the elements that require precise alignment are contained within a camera body and can be relatively inexpensive. Very large fields of view are made possible. This is advantageous in wind tunnel facilities, since experiments are frequently installed only to be torn down shortly afterwards.","Applications exist in all forms of research and development associated with flow fields where schlieren viewing could be useful, including aero-optics, flow control, drag, boundary layer transition, and flow separation.

Advanced COATING technology is crucial to enabling technological developmental of high performance RF antennas.  The production of a conductive and highly reflective thermal control COATING that matches the CTE of the polymer membrane is at the center of this development program.  In addition, in Phase I, the piezoelectric polymeric membrane had a significant deformation at the application of the electrical potential - this manifested the need for stress balancing the coating.

When we demonstrate the capability to produce the ACE type of deformable membrane RF antennas, then we are on the way to the even more important application of building large area visible adaptive membrane mirrors.","This program will provide a light-weight, low volume solution for large area membrane commercial RF antennas (i.e. telecommunications).

In order to steer wideband beams, photonic beamforming techniques must be invoked so that efficient elemental vector summation in the receiving mode or in the transmit mode is independent of frequency. Crystal Research, Inc. proposes to develop a multi-band photonic antenna based on a high-speed optical true-time-delay beamformer, capable of simultaneously steering multiple independent RF beams in less than 300 ns.  Such a high steering speed is 3 orders of magnitude faster than any other existing optical beamformers.  Unlike other approaches, the proposed technology uses a single controlling device per operation band, which eliminates the need for massive optical switches, laser diodes and fiber Bragg gratings. More importantly, only one beamformer is needed for all antenna elements. Advantages of the proposed multi-badn photonic phased array anttena includes wideband multibeam operation, high-speed steering, microwave delay compatible, small size, light weight, low power consumption, and immune to electro-magnetic interfere.  The Phase II technical goal is to extend the Phase I results into a fully functional prototype of a multi-band photonic phased array antenna, which will be delivered to NASA.","Multi-band photonic phased array antennas can be used for NASA (1) high-data rate communication and (2) remote sensing applications. Potential communications applications include: lunar and planetary exploration, landers, probes, Lunar Relay Satellites, lunar rovers, lunar habitats, lunar surface EVA, suborbital vehicles, sounding rockets, balloons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's), TDRSS communication, and expendable launch vehicles (ELV's). Potential remote sensing applications include: radiometers, passive radar interferometer platforms, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platforms for planetary science.","The proposed program is an important step towards the commercialization of multi-band phased array antenna for military and civilian use.  There is a significant civilian market for low cost phased array antennas, particularly for mobile satellite communications applications. There is a clear market pull for versatile arrays for both military electronics and the commercial broadband wireless and satellite communications arena.",Highly-Reconfigurable; Laser; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics; RF

As hardware performance improves, technology trends have shifted functionality from the gate level up to software, as demonstrated by the emergence of software defined radio. Traditionally, these platforms rely on FPGAs and DSPs, but such architectures bring with them significant software development challenges. Application demands for radiation mitigation and fault tolerance exacerbate programmability issues. Low-power general purpose processors offer improved programmability, but cannot meet performance requirements. Our solution, Resilient, provides a sweet spot with its manycore-based software defined radio. Resilient is a software defined radio for space based on rad-hard multi-core digital processing. Resilient has a number of key characteristics and capabilities. Firstly, it is based on the Maestro rad-hard multicore processor. Maestro will provide about 100 times the throughput of the current state of the art in rad-hard general purpose processors. Secondly, Resilient is a highly flexible radio, providing uninterrupted real time multimode operation, over-the-air reconfiguration and adaptability, and STRS compliance. It can also serve as a highly programmable research stage prototyping device for new waveforms and other communications technologies. Finally, Resilient can also support non-communications codes on its high performance multicore processor, co-located with the communications workload, reducing the SWaP of the overall system by aggregating processing jobs to a single board computer.","Resilient is Maxentric's radiation hardened multicore-based software defined radio. Resilient will improve the flexibility of NASA communications hardware while reducing SWaP. Maxentric is targeting NASA software radio programs such as CoNNeCT (Communication Navigation and Networking Reconfigurable Testbed), as well as space applications where flexible rad-hard computing would provide significant value such as multimode rover communications and data processing. Satellite communication is another target NASA application for Resilient. Also, Resilient can serve as a flexible research platform for NASA communications labs and research projects because of its ability to provide a fully programmable network stack from the physical layer up to the application.","The applicability of Resilient is not limited to NASA markets. Military SATCOM is a primary target DoD market for Resilient. Satellite-based surveillance applications also stand to benefit from Resilient not just for communications but also to support data and image processing workloads. Aggregating communications and non-communications tasks on a single hardware component reduces SWaP and the complexity of the overall system. Commercial communications applications also are pushing for more programmability. Examples include basestations, femtocells, automotive wireless devices, and smart phones.

Our competitive advantage will be due to our technology to easily design pipelined/superscalar/VLIW processors that are binary code compatible with a given ISA that has a formal definition of its semantics, and to automatically formally verify both safety and liveness of those processors. Furthermore, we will be able to provide our customers with a retargetable tool to automatically generate a symbolic simulator and formal property checker from the formal definitions of the instruction semantics of the given ISA, possibly extended with new instructions, allowing the users to formally verify properties of the executables for the new processors---we are developing this tool in a current NASA SBIR Phase 2 project.After the completion of Phase 2, the immediate customers will be the over 40 member companies of Power.org, an organization whose purpose is to develop, enable, and promote PowerPC architecture technology.

We plan to achieve this by using the concept of internal discrete amplification mechanism in the InP material system that gave state of the art performance parameters in the 1000 to 1600nm wavelength range and the developed device design as part of the Phase I program that shows higher detection efficiency and lower jitter performance. The primary accomplishments from the Phase II effort would be the development of ultra low noise (low jitter), high detection efficiency, very high gain and high speed near-infrared photodetectors and arrays sensitive in the 1000 nm to1600 nm spectral region. The technology of internal discrete amplification enables the combination of high speed, very high gain and ultra low noise because the internal discrete amplification nullifies the effect of impact ionization coefficients and prevents the edge break down, with high detection efficiency and high speed of operation.

To surmount the present obstacles to higher photon counting rate -- as well as the complexity of back-end circuitry required -- in using conventional single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), we will leverage initial success in monolithically integrating ""negative feedback"" elements with state-of-the-art SPADs to beneficially modify the device avalanche dynamics. This approach can achieve extremely consistent passive quenching, and appropriate implementations can lead to rather small avalanches (e.g., ~10^4  10^5 carriers), for which reduced carrier trapping provides lower afterpulsing that will no longer limit the photon counting rate. When correctly implemented, this ""negative feedback"" avalanche diode (NFAD) design is also extremely simple to operate: with just a fixed dc bias voltage, the NFAD will autonomously execute the entire arm, avalanche, quench, and re-arm cycle and generate an output pulse every time an avalanche event is induced. During Phase 1 of this program, we characterized 5 different discrete NFAD designs to identify specific pixel-level design opportunities for reducing afterpulsing and timing jitter. We also fabricated and characterized wafer-level test structures  that show excellent feedback element yield and uniformity sufficient for large-format NFAD arrays.  These proofs-of-feasibility from Phase 1  position us to demonstrate space-qualifiable large pixel-count 128 x 128 NFAD arrays during a Phase 2 effort.  This effort will also include the development of appropriate test platforms for NFAD array packaging and characterization.","There are two primary NASA applications for the negative feedback avalanche diode (NFADs) arrays to be developed during this proposed SBIR program. First, free space optical (laser) communications over interplanetary distances epitomizes photon-starved applications, and viable spacecraft receiver technologies should have high-performance single photon detection to enable coding schemes such as pulse position modulation while imposing minimal size, weight, and power requirements. The need for simultaneous pointing and tracking is a driver for array-based detector solutions. Second, active remote sensing optical instruments require higher performance photon detectors to improve the performance of existing direct detection lidar systems used to perform atmospheric measurements (e.g., aerosol backscattering) and surface mapping (e.g., ice sheets and forest canopy density).","There are a number of potential non-NASA commercial applications that will benefit from the development of NFAD arrays. Range-finding and ladar applications present many commercial opportunities (e.g., terrain/vegetation mapping, flood/landslide risk mapping, civil engineering projects, etc.) in which the availability of single photon sensitivity could be a disruptive improvement over existing optical remote sensing technologies. Just as NASA is pursuing free space optical links, commercial FSO systems will be able to leverage capabilities realized from the development of NFAD arrays for photon-starved free space links, particularly in cases for which pointing and tracking are required, such as in satellite communications. As with NASA remote sensing applications, there are commercial applications for NFADs in various types of lidar systems for measuring atmospheric properties such as wind and weather patterns, air pollution, and general trace gas analysis. Finally, high-performance photon counting capability in the near- and shortwave-infrared is desirable for the detection of low light output fluorescence, photoluminescence and photoemission processes, particularly for biomedical applications.",Laser; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Perception/Sensing; Photonics; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials

Given the extreme nature of acoustic environments near the plume, data sufficient to characterize the noise source region have been difficult to acquire. Without these data, structures may be designed to handle insufficient or excessive vibroacoustic loads, resulting in either an overbuilt structure (and extra weight), or an under-designed vibration isolation system that could result in damaged cargos. Current energy-based acoustic probe designs have limited frequency bandwidth due to physical limitations. A new set of probe designs is proposed that incorporate both a new physical probe design but also a more advanced signal processing methodology that will significantly increase the usable frequency bandwidth of the probes while reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs of the probes. The probe system will also include the design of a complete data acquisition system capable of recording data under the harsh conditions present in typical rocket motor test firings.","The initial target market for the energy-based probe and data analysis tool is a core community of potential users interested in near-field rocket noise.  The primary users are NASA facilities: Stennis Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, and Kennedy Space Center, who all perform rocket (static or lift-off) noise measurements for community noise, on vehicle loads, and/or support structure loads assessments.  Our proposed system will provide a better understanding of the acoustic near-field with acoustical energy-based measures as opposed to simple pressure and intensity measures.  This tool will provide a superior technical advantage over other measurements based on the ability of acoustical energy-based probes to characterize rocket noise.  Once this capability is demonstrated and proved during Phase II, we fully expect energy-based measurement to be the most accurate method to characterize near-field rocket noise and as such, that NASA will require it for their noise measurement programs.","Like NASA, the Air Force Space Division (AFSD) and the Aerospace Corporation perform noise measurements for community noise, on vehicle loads, and/or support structure loads assessments in support of military satellite programs, as do large rocket engine manufacturers including ATK Launch Systems (Morton-Thiokol) and UTC's Rocketdyne.

The Phase II system will use two-hand motion tracking, multi-finger gesture recognition, and vibrotactile feedback to create an intuitive human-computer interface that mirrors familiar desktop data entry modalities. The program will deliver demonstration hardware and software compatible with laboratory, field, and on-orbit testing of crewmember performance in relevant data entry tasks.   The prototype will include functional EVA gloves with integrated motion sensing and vibrotactile transducers that couple to existing NASA suits via a quick-connect fitting.  We will produce right and left hand gloves, lower arm suit sections, and a specialized two-port acrylic glove box to enable human subject evaluations in a realistic pressurized environment.  Initial trials at Barron Associates will permit refinement of design concepts, followed by more extensive usability, comfort, and durability testing at NASA.","Minutes during EVA operations, whether in an orbital or planetary setting, are among the most challenging, and expensive, spent by humans.  In these task-saturated, dynamic environments, it is essential that data entry interfaces to computing and networking resources are flexible, easy to use, and efficient.  To this end, the GECO system strives to replicate the familiar capabilities of standard desktop interfaces using the gloves on the crewmember's hands as controls.  The technology promises to open the door to an expansive set of information system-enabled applications, including surface navigation, document editing, communications, and telerobotic control.  Our vision for the tactile data entry system extends, well beyond Phase II, to integration into next-generation NASA EVA suit designs. We intend to make a compelling case for this new technology by demonstrating the benefits of the proposed system for increasing performance and user satisfaction.","In addition to future NASA support, Barron Associates will aggressively pursue private-sector application of technology derived from the tactile data entry system.  The enhanced data processing, communications, navigation, and situational awareness capabilities enabled by the GECO system also have the potential to be critical enablers for non-NASA missions.  Of particular interest are applications involving individuals or small units operating in hazardous, information-rich environments.  Examples include deep sea construction/repair, firefighting, explosive ordinance disposal, hazardous material handling, and military aviation.",Data Input/Output Devices; Human-Computer Interfaces; Human-Robotic Interfaces; Suits

InnoSense LLC (ISL) demonstrated enhanced structural and insulation properties in Phase I to establish NASA use potential. In particular, ISL demonstrated a 30% increase in thermal shielding properties over baseline polyurethane foams. These foams were easily formed into a variety of shapes resisting high impact loads without damage. The coated foams were extremely hydrophobic showing excellent resistance to moisture. These materials insulated liquid nitrogen temperatures with one inch of insulation thickness. Upon fine tuning the foam formulations in Phase II, cryogenic insulation performance will be tested at liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen temperatures. ISL has teamed with a large NASA prime contractor for computer modeling and performance validation during Phase II. For assuring success, ISL has committed $100K of co-funding during Phase II, and secured  $300K as Phase III Follow-on funding from a commercialization partner. A technical and business team is now in place for successful execution of the project.  At project end, we expect to achieve a TRL Level of at least 6 from 3 in the beginning.","Current NASA spacecrafts are fueled by liquid hydrogen and oxygen. To complete NASA missions cost-effectively, it is necessary to conserve these fuels by limiting cryogenic fuel boil-off. Current insulations absorb water while at the launch pad, thus increasing the overall liftoff load by up to 1000 lbs. NASA would greatly benefit from an advanced cryogenic insulation system that would reduce fuel boil-off and atmospheric water absorption. Such insulation would reduce liftoff weight by not only limiting water uptake, but also by reducing the necessary insulation thickness to maintain liquid fuel. Applications for such a material would include rocket fuel systems, terrestrial launch pad fuel transport lines, and orbital depot systems. This insulation could also be expanded for use in advance technology research including superconductors and advanced energy systems. Currently ground and launch operations account for 45  60% of total costs. The outcome of this project will greatly reduce these costs.","Efficient and affordable insulation is very attractive for a wide range of consumer applications ranging from pipeline insulation to advanced technology research. Currently aerogel-lined fabrics are used for extreme temperature insulation in clothing and other building materials. ISL's technology introduces a lightweight, inexpensive, and moldable foam insulation that can be customized to a variety of shapes and flexibilities. The immediate market for the foam lies in the Aerospace industry. ISL's foam technology has the potential to insulate advanced aircraft fuel tanks while providing a flame-resistant layer.

In its current configuration the LMM accommodates a Contained Bubble Experiment, and it has no substage illuminator and limited epi-illumination.  There is a need for future use of the LMM in more versatile fluids and biological experiments.  A modular observation platform consisting of an electronics module and the first two of an eventual suite of experiment modules is proposed.  A life science experiment module that allows investigators to load up to two different fluids and combine them in a hollow glass slide under the LMM objective lenses has been designed and built.  It is suitable for the imaging, enumeration and evaluation of biological cells in suspension or attached to the glass surface of the hollow slide for on-orbit, real-time image cytometry.  Fluids can be changed to initiate a process, fix biological samples or retrieve suspended cells.The colloid science experiment module will be designed for conduct of certain microparticle and nanoparticle experiments for investigation of the colloid self-assembly (CSA) phenomenon, among others.  The colloid science module is being developed in response to the high level of interest in such a facility.  It includes a hollow glass slide and heating elements for the creation of a thermal gradient from one end of the slide to the other.  The life science and colloid science experiment modules mount atop the electronics module in the position on the LMM where the stage would be.

Techshot is one of a few companies functioning as a regular Implementation Partner in the latter program, and opportunities exist to serve customers using the LMM Dynamic Stage.  There are two potential business models for doing this: Utilize hardware via NASA that has already been delivered to NASA by Techshot, or to custom-build space qualified derivatives of the hardware.  The NASA Human Research Program (HRP) is expected to be a significant customer, given that on-orbit blood analysis opportunities are expected to be scarce.  As these opportunities develop there will be a need for placement of the Observation Platforms in investigators' laboratories.

Upcoming NASA missions such as MMS involve complex high Earth orbits making the use of GPS difficult, though NASA has developed GPS receivers capable of performing in these environments.  Space GPS simulation needs are typically seen as a niche market, and the resulting solutions, which are often simply adaptations of terrestrial products, can be sub-optimal and at best handle simple, low dynamic LEO missions.  Further, space simulation solutions are frequently inflexible and cannot be modified by the end-user.  Given the broad but unique needs of HWIL testing involving RF systems, Emergent proposes to develop the Multi-purpose Radio Signal Generation (MRSiG) system to address these needs, which are essential to early risk mitigation.  The MRSiG system will provide for easy mission specific customization and generation of multiple waveforms used in ground testing applications and will return the expertise to simulate these complex environments to NASA. MRSiG will accomplish this difficult task by harnessing the latest in open Software Defined Radio (SDR) technologies. Simulation complexity for RF signal generation is moved into software, enabling the emulation of many RF waveforms/protocols including, but not limited to GPS, 802.11, S-Band, WiMAX, etc.","MRSiG will be able to replace many of the expensive, highly specialized RF signal generators with cheaper generic boxes that can be customized as the technologies are updated.  MRSiG boxes can be utilized throughout the entire RF hardware development cycle, from the breadboard to the flight stages.  Their relatively low cost point will allow more simulators in the labs, and less resource contention for developing projects.  The portability of the MRSiG allows testing outside the lab, including environmental test chambers and during spacecraft integration.  In particular, MRSiG could be utilized as a GPS simulator, replacing the Spirent GPS signal generators currently in use.  As the Constellation program continues to ramp up, these boxes could be utilized to simulate anything from lunar ground communication, ground-lunar relay communication, and even lunar to Earth communications.  MRSiG could potentially be instrumental in performing formation flying or rendezvous and docking simulations if RF data is exchanged.","GOES-R is the first unclassified mission that will use GPS at HEO.  If the GPS tracking proves successful in that orbit, this opens a whole new regime for GPS tracking, and the current commercial GPS simulators on the market can not adequately address these orbits.  The potential applications outside of NASA mirror those inside, but on a much larger scale.  Laboratories and universities would have ready access to a low-cost simulation capability that can be customized for their needs.  For example, GPS simulation equipment currently tagged at $250,000 could be replaced with MRSiG and a SDR receiver for less than 1/10 the price, opening the door to smaller institutions while encouraging development and innovation.  Similar arguments can be made for the modeling of spacecraft communications systems, TDRSS modeling, or most wireless communication systems.","Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Operations Concepts and Requirements; RF; Simulation Modeling Environment; Testing Facilities"

ODTBX will be further refined  by enhancements to detector and source models, including addition of new pulsars as their properties are better determined (including low flux sources).  Time transfer and barycenter correction effects will be added.  XNAV measurement types will include additional absolute range measurement types and range rate measurements.

The team will work with NRL, JHU/APL, and NASA GSFC, focusing on sources and detectors to develop improved models, and assessing timing accuracy.  This work will further validate the utility of XNAV for NASA, and develop and test relevant new technology to provide a rapid path to full flight software development should opportunity arise.","XNAV is a game changing technology for NASA, enabling new missions, providing navigation autonomy and redundancy and offering a path to reduce the scheduling demands on DSN, a valuable NASA asset.  There are several promising NASA applications for XNAV where the improvements in navigational accuracy will either enable new missions, or reduce their costs, including missions to the outer planets, and non-planetary missions to deep space.  Missions to Mars and the moon can take advantage of the autonomous navigation capabilities of XNAV, providing redundancy and reducing the need for regular DSN contacts, lessening the burden on this over-taxed system,  XNAV can supplement DSN and enhance DSN navigation performance by making complementary measurements and can provide higher redundancy for manned missions.  It can provide a common, universally available, independent time reference with accuracy comparable to an atomic clock as well, for any mission, from Earth orbit to deep space.","The primary non-NASA XNAV applications would be to provide primary or secondary navigation services for DoD missions. For MEO, GEO, HEO, and even cis-lunar missions, where GPS has limited availability, XNAV can provide primary autonomous navigation capability. In addition, XNAV could provide an essential backup navigation capability for missions that normally rely on GPS, but have a need for continuity of operations in the event of loss or denial of GPS. These applications were being actively studied through DARPA's first XNAV program in 2004-06, and key Microcosm team members had strong ties to that program.","Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Guidance, Navigation, and Control"

The software developed in this project leverages current computing technology to implement advanced Visual Odometry (VO) methods that will accurately track much faster rover movements. Our fully Bayesian approach to VO will utilizes information from the images than previous methods are capable of using. Our Bayesian VO does not explicitly select features to track. Instead it implicitly determines what can be learned from each image pixel and weights the information accordingly. This means that our approach can work with images that have no distinct corners, which can be a significant advantage with low contrast images from permanently shadowed areas. We have shown that the error characteristics of the visual processing are complementary to the error characteristics of a low-cost IMU. Therefore, the combination of the two can provide highly accurate navigation.","Visual Odometry (VO) has played a key role in Mars exploration with the Spirit and Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs). However, limitations in onboard computing power severely limit the speed of movement that can be tracked by MERS VO, requiring an order of magnitude reduction in forward progress in area where VO was required. The software developed in this project will leverage current computing technology to implement advanced VO methods that will accurately track much faster rover movements. This will greatly increase exploration productivity. This improvement will become even more significant when exploring the more distant planetary bodies. This project will also investigate whether combining vision with a low-cost, lightweight, low-power Micro-ElectroMechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) can produce acceptable accuracy for lunar and planetary exploration. If so, this will facilitate the design of lower-cost, light-weight rovers, which will make it feasible to launch a team of rovers for wide area exploration.","There will be many potential terrestrial applications for a Bayesian VO system. Although GPS-IMU systems can work well in open outdoor settings, GPS is degraded or unavailable in indoor settings or in outdoor areas with significant tree cover. A navigation system combining a GPS and an IMU with Bayesian VO could provide continuous operation in all environments. The success of this project should lay the groundwork for low-cost, low-power, light-weight integrated navigation systems for robots and autonomous vehicles operating in a wide range of environments.One potential market for this technology is the Department of Defense (DoD). Congress has given DoD a mandate that by 2020 30% of ground vehicles should be robotic. An accurate, low-cost VO system should allow many of these vehicles to be semi-autonomous, enabling only supervisory control for many missions.",Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Intelligence; Perception/Sensing

The theta-D filter and the cost based filter, CBF, were developed and used in various orbit determination scenarios.  The scenarios were application to low Earth orbit, range only, and range and range rate estimation.  The modified state observer was also developed to estimate uncertainty in the dynamic model besides estimation of orbital states.  Phase I research showed that there is a problem with the linear-like form that is used by many nonlinear filters such as the State Dependant Riccati Equation filter (SDRE filter), and the theta-D and CBF.  A study of the observability led to important discoveries about the lack of observabilty in some formulations.  Detailed study of the working of the proposed nonlinear filters in terms of observability and their application to more precise orbit determination and model uncertainty estimation will be undertaken in Phase II. Also learned from Phase I, IST-Rolla will focus more on how and where these nonlinear filters can help NASA.  There will be three main applications studied during Phase II:  interplanetary orbit determination, space debris tracking, and interplanetary landing spacecraft tracking.  These applications were chosen because of their relevance to current NASA missions and the nonlinearity of the measurements involved should show the need for the nonlinear filters. Furthermore, working algorithms and software will be given to NASA to test on ongoing applications.","The algorithms provided by IST-Rolla, the theta-D, CBF and neural network estimator, will be set up so that the end user can provide the current estimate and the measurements, then the filter will adjust to those measurements and provide an estimate. This will be packaged into a C code, and an attempt will be made to create a filtering toolbox for MATLAB as well. These steps will allow the end user to apply and adapt these filters and with the analysis provided by IST-Rolla in Phase I and Phase II, the user will know exactly what to expect from the algorithms. The accuracy and efficiency will be a valuable asset to NASA's repertoire of orbit determination technologies.","Most of the applications for NASA apply here as well.

First, we use parameter continuation methods to assist in computation of trajectories in complicated dynamical situations.  Numerical parameter continuation methods have been used extensively to compute a menagerie of structures in dynamical systems including fixed points, periodic orbits, simple bifurcations and invariant manifolds.  Perhaps more important for the current work, such methods have already proven their worth in flight dynamics problems, especially those having to do with the complicated dynamics near libration points.  Second, we propose to use Continuous Mechanics and Optimal Control (CMOC).   Algorithms based the CMOC formalism promises to support optimal trajectory design using both discrete and continuous control.  Third, we propose to use advanced filtering techniques and representations of probability density functions to appropriately compute and manage the uncertainty in the trajectories. While advanced methods for understanding and leveraging the underlying dynamics are clearly necessary for effective mission design, planning, and analysis, we contend that they do not suffice.  In particular, they do not, in and of themselves, address the issue of uncertainty.Herein we discuss methods that balance the accuracy of the uncertainty representation against computational tractability.","There are several current state-of-the-art software packages that are clear and direct transition paths for the proposed work.  In particular, there are the GPS-Enhanced Onboard Navigation Software (GEONS), the GPS-Inferred Positioning System and Orbit Analysis Software (GIPSY), and the General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT).  Of the various packages, GMAT is the most directly applicable and will be the focus of the Phase I effort.  Accordingly, these algorithms will find applicability in any pre-flight mission design, planning, and analysis activities that utilize the aforementioned software packages.  One domain of particular note in space craft missions is the neighborhood of libration points, where the underlying dynamics are rather complicated and the dynamics effect on uncertainty is important.  Another domain that we see of prime importance is that of spacecraft formation flying where, again, the dynamics and the uncertainty play a key role.","The satellite market is large and growing.  For example, analysis firm Forecast International is projecting worldwide deliveries of about 262 geostationary   or   medium-Earth orbit commercial   communications satellites by 2019.   This implies a strong market for the technology described in this proposal.  In particular,  as  space becomes  more crowded with commercial and  government spacecraft, and space debris, the robust calculation of trajectories along with accurate estimates of uncertainty can only become more important.The global space and satellite market is expected to reach $158 Billion by 2010.  This market involves numerous government agencies and permeates many parts of both the U.S. Military and commercial entities.  In particular, large players in this market include Boeing, TerreStar, and Northrop Grumman.

The solution centers on inclusion of a navigation layer as part of the communications architecture and on the maintenance and propagation of navigation states, time and associated uncertainties onboard each platform with filtering capabilities enabling updates based on any available measurements.  Such measurements include: direct state and uncertainty updates via ground communication, radiometric- and lasercom-based range and range rate data from communication with ground stations and other spacecraft, time transfer from ground stations and other spacecraft, X-ray pulsar-based navigation and time measurements (XNAV), and others as they become available. This would be game-changing for spacecraft autonomy enabling platforms to operate using onboard state information rather than relying almost entirely on ground based tracking and activity scheduling.  Additionally, architectures that include long-range intersatellite communication (e.g. relay spacecraft) can provide favorable geometries for significantly improved 3D precision navigation solar-system-wide.","The proposed navigation and timing architecture simulation capability will provide a tool to support performance evaluation of SCaN architecture concepts in addition to enabling mission planning for human exploration, robotic and infrastructure missions integrating into a future SCaN architecture.

In contrast to conventional methods that utilize either unreliable magnetic field sensors or extensive ground-based real-time tracking and control units that are expensive, large and power-consuming to operate, our innovative design focuses on identifying the gravitational vector onboard in real-time to bound sensor drift errors to achieve high degree of accuracy. The objective is achieved by a unique design that combines a dual-arc low-cost accelerometer array with three-axis rate gyros and GPS. Advanced filtering techniques such as the Unscented Kalman Filter are proposed to estimate sensor bias and drift effects. High vibration effects are estimated and eliminated by subtracting the imposed loading from the accelerometer measurements to provide a highly robust system in the presence of highly dynamical and vibrational conditions. Testing of the prototype system includes shaker table laboratory and hardware-in-the-loop tests along with an optional relevant vehicle platform test with support from NASA.","The successful completion of the proposed work will lead to improvements in the safe operations of commercial and general aviation (GA) aircraft and address the goals of the NASA Space Communication and Navigation Office. The proposed technologies with an emphasis on real-time attitude estimation through the use of a coupled accelerometer array and GPS unit will be directly applicable to Reusable Launch Vehicles, low cost attitude determination on low dynamics sub-orbital carriers, inertial measurement estimation in non-GPS friendly environments and space-based range applications. It will lead to benefits in the form of improved reliability, accuracy, and sustainability of safety-critical aerospace systems.","The potential commercial use of the developed technologies is extensive.

These devices have primarily been rectangular coaxial transmission lines, although rectangular waveguide and other structures have also been demonstrated. Intricate devices have been demonstrated with insertion loss 5 to 10 times lower than traditional planar circuits; isolation better than 60dB for lines that share separating walls; multiple levels of densely-packed coaxial circuits; and low-parasitic attachment to active devices and traditional circuit boards. In this Phase II project, Nuvotronics will optimize and fabricate high density low-loss millimeter backplane circuits to package and interconnect components of future NASA millimeter wave (MMW) radars. The significance of the innovation primarily lies in three areas: reduction of system size, weight and loss in MMW radars. The PolyStrata technology is a batch manufacturing process, providing economies of scale and cost reduction for higher volumes, in addition to flexibility in design for various frequencies of interest.","Our primary goal in this project is to provide NASA with robust space-capable MMW interconnection technology that is lower cost, lower weight, and has improved performance over current technology. The initial application is MMW radars for advanced cloud and precipitation measurements and for Mars landing sensors. Candidate NASA missions are future landers for the Mars Exploration Program and the Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACE) Mission. Reducing size and weight of radar instruments will allow more mission capability on each platform, increasing NASA return on investment in these missions. Instrument constraints on size and weight in NASA unmanned aerial vehicles could also benefit from the PolyStrata RF backplane technology as well as future NASA communication systems.","We anticipate high volume product opportunities within the DOD and non-Government commercial markets. Within DOD, applications in communications and radar systems exist for advanced microwave components. For military communications, the benefits are higher bandwidth, multipoint links, and low payload weight for planes, missiles, and tanks.

Each receiver requires I and Q ADCs (analog-to-digital converters) for signal digitizing at 1GHz before further processing in the cross-correlators. Power consumption as well as instrument volume and weight are critical in space born instruments. During Phase I, Pacific Microchip Corp. designed the block diagrams and circuits of a monolithic array consisting of sixteen 2-bit ADCs. A serializer is integrated to reduce the number of outputs from 32 to 1. This reduces the power consumption per ADC and resolves the problem of wiring congestion in the interface with cross-correlators. For further power reduction, a novel metastability programming feature is integrated into the ADC latches. The clock distribution is fundamentally simplified as well. The 2-wire serial I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface allows all 1200 ADCs of the GeoSTAR instrument to be calibrated and optimized. Phase I work provided a complete definition and in silico validation of the monolithic ADC array with serial output. Phase II of the project will produce a fieldable product. In order to facilitate the commercialization efforts in Phase III, a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) Silicon-on-Isolator (SOI) technology will be used for fabrication.","The extra-low power ADC arrays with serial outputs featuring power optimization capability depending on the required BER, high quantization frequencies, and convenient control through a two wire interface can be used in radiometer and interferometer instruments such as GeoSTAR. These instruments apply passive and active microwave technologies that are under development by NASA in its mission to provide inexpensive data for many different fields including science, agriculture, geology, weather forecast, climatology, and civil aviation. The potential application of the ADC arrays in space-based wireless communication systems promises to lower the cost of exploration data delivery to users.","The unique characteristics of the proposed ADC array make it ideal for parallel digitizing applications that require power efficiency at high quantization rate. Oversampling can be used when more than 2-bit resolution is required. Such ADCs are critical components in multichannel wireless communication systems. Advanced ADC arrays are also required for neural implants, image sensors and sensor networks. The ADC array will be implemented using commercial 45nm SOI CMOS technology offering low device cost and extremely power efficient operation. The proposed Pacific Microchip Corp.

In addition, the proposed band-pass filters are light weight, as they employ no heavy substrates.  The proposed 2  5 mm thickness (mostly the mounting frame) allows insertion into tight spaces and standard filter wheels.  The thin, light weight, vacuum compatible design can be incorporated into almost any detector setup.

We propose to develop a highly efficient, lightweight Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigeration (AMRR) system that can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at temperatures in the range of 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K.  The AMRR system uses a vibration-free, reversible cryogenic circulator and Micromachined Active Magnetic Regenerators (MAMRs) to achieve a large cooling capacity and very high thermal efficiency.  The MAMRs use an innovative flow channel configuration and novel micromachining technologies to achieve very high thermal and flow performance.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach by demonstrating critical fabrication methods for the micromachined regenerator and its thermal and flow performance through detailed analysis.  In Phase II we will build and demonstrate a full-scale micromachined regenerator for a prototype AMRR system that can provide 70 mW of cooling near 2 K.  In Phase III we will demonstrate the operation of an AMRR system incorporating the MAMRs and Creare's innovative reversible cryogenic circulator.","The proposed AMRR system will enable NASA to carry out future science missions that use cryogenic infrared, gamma ray, and X-ray detectors.  Potential missions include the International X-Ray Observatory (IXO) and the Single Aperture Far-Infrared observatory (SAFIR).  These detectors need to operate at temperatures in the range of 4 K to below 1 K to reduce the thermal emission of the detectors themselves and to achieve high sensitivity and resolution.  The vibration-free, lightweight AMRR can provide efficient cooling for these missions at the required temperature ranges.  The fabrication technologies developed for the magnetic regenerator can also be applied to the fabrication of advanced regenerators for mechanical cryocoolers.","The military applications for the proposed magnetic cooler include cooling systems on space-based surveillance, missile detection, and missile tracking systems.  Scientific applications include cooling systems for material microanalysis using X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometers, cryogenic particle detectors, and biomolecule mass spectrometry using superconducting tunnel junction detectors.",Cooling

Phase 1 efforts successfully addressed the feasibility of measuring CO to a precision of 10 parts-per-billion or better over a range of tropospheric temperatures, pressures, and humidity. Phase 2 will extend the technology to simultaneous measurement of both carbon monoxide and methane.

The instrument will be very compact and low-power, designed for long-term operation with minimal attention and maintenance.  The instrument is expected to find use in validation of remote sensing data obtained in planned NASA missions (e.g. ASCENDS and GEO-CAPE).Longer term NASA applications could include adaptation of the instrument for measurements in planetary atmospheres, via use of space-qualified electronics and further ruggedization of the mechanical and thermal design.

They are key drivers of the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other nutrients, and account for 50% of global photosynthesis.   Phytoplankton growth is the fundamental component of the 'ocean biological pump'  one of the two primary mechanisms that cause the ocean to be a significant sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Since different taxa occupy different ecological niches, identifying the major influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton groups is necessary to understand ecosystem function and the role of the oceans in global climate.   Scientists employ various satellite sensors to measure the amount and distribution of chlorophyll a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean, but satellites only detect near-surface properties and therefore cannot adequately resolve the water column biomass and composition of phytoplankton species.  Small and robust sea-based instrumentation (the innovation of this work) provides this information, as well as valuable independent verification of the spaced-based data (""sea truth"" data).  The objective of this program is to develop a small, inexpensive, submersible, robust microflow cytometer (uFC) for quantitative detection of phytoplankton, to be initially deployed on the NSF Center for Coastal Margin Observation & Prediction coastal ocean observatories (Oregon).  The device will be designed for long-endurance autonomous operation.  The proposed design has low power requirements, reduces or eliminates consumables, prevents of fouling, and reduces sensitivity to the environment.  Our Phase 2 technical objectives are to (1) fabricate a complete uFC with all the subsystems necessary for extended autonomous operational deployment; (2) test our uFC on a coastal station operated by CMOP/OHSU. (3) Deploy our mFC on a submarine glider operated by CMOP/OHSU (4) Collect data at-sea, along the coast of Oregon/Washington.","Scientists employ satellite-based sensors to measure the amount and distribution of chlorophyll a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean.  For example NASA's Aqua satellite is monitoring red-light fluorescence emitted by phytoplankton.  Red-light fluorescence reveals insights about the physiology of marine plants and the efficiency of photosynthesis, as changes in fluorescence emission reflect the amount of light and nutrients available for growth.  The instruments onboard these satellites must be calibrated, and the algorithms applied to the collected raw data need to be validated.  Therefore it is important to have sea-based instrumentations to provide an independent verification and confirm the validity of the data collected using spaced-based platforms.  These validation instruments are typically deployed on buoys in coastal zones and research vessels out in the open ocean.  Current sensors for at-sea applications are expensive, physically large, and have considerable consumable needs.  Our proposed low-cost sensor will allow for more extensive deployment of units and allow for more extensive verification and calibration of satellite data, thus enhancing NASA's Earth science research capabilities.  It will be extremely robust and capable of operating in an autonomous or semi-autonomous basis for extended periods.  In addition, should there be a mission to Europa, this technology may be of use on such a mission under that moon's ice field.","The goal of this program is to fabricate a small, submersible, robust, microflow cytometer uFC for quantitative detection of phytoplankton.  In situ detection of phytoplankton is a niche market directed at climate and environmental research.  This market is growing.  There are more than 200 underwater gliders currently deployed for scientific research.  Our uFC will ultimately be a common option on these underwater platforms.  In order to achieve significant penetration of this market, the equipment price needs to be reasonable and its operation/deployment simple.  We are well positioned to meet these requirements. There are significantly larger research markets for our uFC.  For example NOAA has deployed ARGO, a global array of 3,000 free-drifting profiling floats that measure the temperature and salinity of the upper 2000 m of the ocean. These buoys could be equipped with our uFC.  Additional units could be deployed onboard seagoing cargo ships to monitor the open ocean.The Navy has interest in better methods of detecting phytoplankton blooms, as they can interfere with submarine navigation or detection, and they are also interested in water quality issues associated with coastal assets.  There are major commercial developments to pursue the use algae as a biofuel source.  This emerging industry will need a means to monitor algae growth, which could be served by a variant of our uFC.  There are also proposed water standards that call for algae monitoring.",Biomass Production and Storage; Optical; Photonics

As outlined in the National Research Council's report on Scientific Context for Exploration of the Moon, the principal goals of such missions would require detection of water and other volatiles present in the regolith, elemental analysis of the regolith, and establishment of geochronology and bombardment history. LIBS would provide information on elemental composition, and other fiber-coupled instruments could ultimately be incorporated into the same platform, depending on the requirements of the mission. Possibilities include Raman spectroscopy, which would provide more sophisticated analysis of organics and other molecules and potentially Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF), for higher sensitivity detection. In this scenario, the high-powered LIBS laser doubles as a sort of sample preparation tool; firing a burst of ""cleaning shots"" exposes fresh sample (including volatiles that may have been lost from the outer surface layer). The DIHeDRAL instrument architecture could also be applied to robotic Mars missions. The focus in this case would likely be on astrobiology as opposed to resource characterization, involving Raman detection and analysis of organics trapped in Mars polar ice.","The successful integration of a LIBS instrument into a drill string or downhole probe would have several significant commercial applications. In the pit mining and quarrying industry, a downhole LIBS probe could be used for rapid rock and ore characterization using existing blast holes. This would allow more streamlined planning of operations and would result in less misclassified material. In defense and homeland security, a version of DIHeDRAL could be used for detection of buried explosives, such as land mines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and unexploded ordnance (UXO).",Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Optical

Currently, cold gas thrusters operate using 'bang bang' valves that require significant power and relatively coarse thrust control.  The proposed valve design requires negligible power due to its piezo-based actuator, and its flow resolution promises to enhance greatly the controllability of cold gas thrusters, enabling their use in higher-precision formation flying missions. Precision metering of gaseous constituents for chemical propulsion and miniature ion and Hall thrusters. Improvement to the extant fluid-regulating microvalve for liquid propulsion applications. Propellant valves for colloid thrusters on LISA mission",Potential Non-NASA commercial applications for the proposed technology include the following: Precision metering of gases for chemical/process/pharmaceutical/semiconductor industries.   Replacement of arrayed and independently valved sonic chokes with a single valve.,Electromagnetic Thrusters; Electrostatic Thrusters; Feed System Components; Micro Thrusters

Compared to other reported approaches, the proposed architecture will reduce power consumption by a factor of one hundred, to a level of a few hundred milliwatts. This estimate is supported by direct measurements obtained from prototype modules that were demonstrated in Phase I research.In the Phase II project we will scale up this innovative circuit DMs that Boston Micromachines Corporation (BMC) developed for NASA in support of the Terrestrial Planet Finding program. At the same time, we will reduce the driver's size in two successive stages of integration. In the first stage, we will implement a hybrid packaging approach in which a 993-actuator DM, HV amplifier, multiplexer components, and power supplies will all be co-located on a common multi-layered circuit board. With this driver we will demonstrate both low power consumption (~300mW) and high precision (~10pm). In the second stage of integration, we will design, fabricate, and test a High Voltage Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (HV-ASIC) version of the multiplexing architecture using a commercial foundry. We will combine a number of these 256 channel HV-ASIC modules into a driver for a 3063 actuator DM that is currently being developed by BMC to support NASA's coronography goals.","Multiplexed drive electronics introduce a few very important and enabling advantages for NASA commercial applications in planned space-based telescopes and coronagraphs.  The key commercial advantages to the systems to be produced in this work are: 1) their hundredfold improvement in power efficiency is a critical enabler for space-based operation; 2) their design is specifically suited to drive tip-tilt-piston MEMS DMs already developed by BMC for NASA, and is to our knowledge uniquely capable of achieving the 10pm precision required for the visible nulling coronagraph;  and 3) the cost to produce the drivers proposed will be less than that of existing drivers for MEMS DMs in use by NASA, despite its substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art in compactness, power management, and precision.These compelling features, along with highly successful Phase I results, promise to make the proposed hardware commercially attractive to NASA for various space-based applications. BMC's track record of success with DM sales to NASA and to dozens of astronomical and space science institutions around the world bodes well for the ultimate commercial viability of the Phase II research outcomes.","Small stroke, high precision deformable mirrors and associated drive electronics have a few commercial applications. The decrease in size, power and cost affect many of the vertical markets to which we currently supply our products.

Decreasing the size and weight of the electronics reduces payload, a high priority of satellite programs. These programs are funded by Department of Defense administrations with classified agendas.Unmanned Aerial Systems:In unmanned aerial systems, adaptive optics can enable improved battlefield performance.

Fabrication process enhancements developed in the Phase I effort to increase device yield by significantly reducing the defect density in polysilicon films and reduce wafer bow by modifying thin film deposition processes, will be integrated in to the DM fabrication process to produce a device with 100% actuator yield and an unpowered peak-to-valley surface figure error of <500nm - well within the dynamic range of the DM actuators. This large array of mirror segments with tip-tilt-piston degrees of freedom and λ/100 optical quality would constitute a significant technological advance and would become an enabling component for the high contrast visible nulling coronagraph instruments planned for exoplanet imaging missions.","The primary application for small stroke, high precision deformable mirrors is that of space-based imaging and in specific, exo-planet research. As telescopes and coronagraphs are constructed, they will require control of light using adaptive optics over a larger aperture. By expanding the size of DM devices, instruments such as PECO, ACCESS, EPIC, DaVinci, and FKSI will be able to shape more light using less hardware and less stages. Given the current constraints on fabrication technology, it is necessary to develop new methods of manufacture to accommodate for larger arrays which also require more channels for control. The desire for this type of enhanced technology within the astronomy community has been detailed in a report issued from the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, an influential consortium which is a voice in the United States of the industry at-large.","There are a range of Government agencies and commercial markets that can take advantage of small stroke, high precision deformable mirrors. One application is for large, ground-based telescopes. By expanding the size of DM devices, these observatories will be able to shape more light using less hardware and less stages.

By creating larger, higher-precision arrays, not only is it possible to send more data at faster rates, but the distance between communication points can be extended due to enhanced error correction capabilities. A third application is for correction of quasi-static aberrations in primary optics in surveillance satellites due to manufacturing and thermal variations. Adding to its advantages of high-resolution capability, the light weight nature of BMC MEMS DM technology allows the payload to be reduced, a high priority of military satellite projects. A final application is that of laser pulse-shaping for material characterization and laser marking and machining. By creating larger arrays, control of the pulsed beams can be enhanced. In addition, the larger arrays will allow users to take advantage of larger beam diameters.

Indeed these processes are labor, schedule, risk and cost drivers for our exceptional, high performance variety of silicon carbide material. Although we have made significant strides in improving our baseline CVC SiCTM manufacturing processes, the product is still substantially higher priced than the goals of the NASA project.  In Phase I, we created and demonstrated a manufacturing process for the new ceramic matrix composite honeycomb panel silicon carbide (HoneySiC or H-SiC) which nearly eliminates the machining and lightweighting process steps for mirrors and opto-mechanical structures. The new material achieves lightweighting of 92% relative to bulk material and net production cost on the order of $38K per square meter (unpolished), less than half of NASA's goal of $100K per square meter. Web thickness, core geometries (pocket depth, pocket size), and mirror shape are easily tailored since H-SiC starts as a molded precursor material. The Phase II project will start at Technology Readiness Level 3 (TRL 3, experimental critical function and characteristic proof of concept) and end at TRL 5 (breadboard in a relevant environment).","The great observatories of the future require a mirror technology that is lightweight, dimensionally stable, high performance, and above all else, cost effective.  Molded HoneySiCTM hexagonal panels in sizes of 1-3 meters point-to-point will allow construction of extremely large aperture UV and IR telescopes, at prices for from $38-100K per square-meter, a factor of 40 to 100 times less than present day technology.

Due to the non-contact, stand-off nature of this technology, this system can measure optics and provide nearly real-time feedback to figuring/polishing instruments without removing the part from the spindle or other optical grinding or polishing setup. For advanced levels of integration and test, the proposed large-volume metrology technology would allow fast, non-contact measurement of mirror rigid body alignment and prescription (i.e., radius, conic, aperture), with no special targets or references on the optic. This would allow these mirror parameters to be measured with respect to other optics, instruments, or mechanical- and spacecraft-related structures.","Potential post-Phase III NASA applications for this innovation include improved performance and lower cost optical telescope assembly and instrument development.

For JDEM, telescope mirror fabrication and integration capabilities would be greatly enhanced. The scanner would measure the prescription and coarse figure of the large (~2m) mirror during fabrication and, after fabrication, characterize its final prescription and alignment to the telescope metering structure, with little or no custom fiducialization. The mechanical alignment of the JDEM instrument/camera would meet tighter specifications. For IXO, this improved scanner would be able to measure the super-thin, lightweight, off-axis x-ray segments in a non-contact fashion, eliminating the risk of damage and allowing measurement without distorting the segments.","The post-Phase III SBIR, non-NASA commercial applications are numerous and multi-discipline.

In addition, this improved scanner has implications for greatly improving metrology in support of the aircraft and ship-building industry.

During Phase I, we were able to show feasibility that the Optimax VIBE finishing process was able to reduce the effects of mid-spatial frequency (MSF) errors on flat sub-aperture polished surfaces without negatively affecting the surface figure.  With future funding, we anticipate advances this process will result in a cost-effective way to produce ultra-low MSF error curved surfaces for both NASA and non-NASA applications.","VIBE technology to reduce and/or eliminate mid-spatial frequency errors has potential to be used for optics in many applications. Specifically those applications that are susceptible to small angle scatter sometimes referred to as flare. The International X-Ray Observatory (IXO), consisting of 361 grazing incidence nested, azimuthally segmented shell mirrors, is susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors. These thin (0.4mm) mirrors are produced through a thermal slumping technique where a thin glass substrate replicates the shape of a mandrel (fused quartz or stainless steel). The current budgeted error for the IXO mandrels is 1.4nm rms over the 2 20mm spatial frequency range. In addition, exo-planet imaging systems require minimal scattering due to mid-spatial frequency errors on their primary and secondary mirrors. An example is the specification for the Jovian planet finder optical system was less than 1nm rms in the 4 50cycles/aperture range.","Non-NASA commercial applications include high energy laser systems, EUV optics (lithography), imaging systems and X-ray synchrotrons. High energy laser applications, such as Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are susceptible to mid-spatial frequency errors. The MSF errors are a source of damaging intensity, specifically in the region of 120μm  33mm. In EUV lithography, flare is a significant problem. Flare is directly associated with mid-spatial frequency error. The mid-spatial frequency errors cause light to scatter into small angles and reduce image contrast. The specific mid-spatial frequency region of interest to the EUV lithography community is between 1μm  2mm. The mid-spatial frequency error scales as 1/(lambda)^2, which causes an increasingly significant problem as the lithography industry heads toward shorter and shorter wavelength systems.",Ceramics; Optical; Optical & Photonic Materials; Photonics

During the long lunar day, the thermal management system must remove the waste heat from the electronics and batteries keep them within the acceptable temperature limit. Since the heater power availability is restricted, a variable thermal link is therefore required to limit the amount of heat that is removed from the electronics and radiated to space during the long lunar night. Conventional Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) can provide the required variable thermal conductance, but they consume electrical power to shut down the heat transfer.  Our innovation adds a Thermal Control Valve (TCV) to the LHP, allowing it to passively shut off without consuming any electrical power.  This is important since there is a severe penalty for electrical power consumption: supplying 1 W in a photovoltaic system requires roughly 5 kg of extra equipment.  The TCV used in the LHP has been previously selected for thermal control in the pumped loop on the Mars Science Laboratory. The Phase I project was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of integrating the TCV in a LHP. The Phase II project will fabricate and test a LHP with a TCV at representative conditions, bringing the technology to TRL 6.  The testing will include full characterization of the TCV under various LHP operation modes.  Analysis and testing of different LHP condenser layouts will also be performed, as well as freeze/thaw analysis.",One application for the TCV controlled LHP is thermal management for Lunar Landers and Rovers.  An example is the Warm Electronics Box (WEB) and batteries for the NASA Anchor Node Mission for the International Lunar Network (ILN).  The ILN could be powered by either solar or a radioisotope power system. The WEB and batteries face the same thermal challenges that require a variable thermal link to allow heat removal during daytime and heat preservation during nighttime.  The integration of a TCV eliminates the electrical power consumption required to shut down a conventional LHP.  Every 1 W of electricity saved translates to a mass saving of roughly 5kg for a solar powered system.  Current Mars rover designs use a mechanically pumped single-phase fluid loop for thermal management.  The proposed TCV controlled LHP could replace the mechanically pumped loop system with a complete passive system.,"TCV controlled LHPs can also be used in commercial and military satellites where the radiator sink conditions change, and there is a need to maintain the electronics within a narrow temperature band.  The variable thermal link passively maintains the electronics temperature during cold sink conditions, such as during an eclipse.  ACT produces LHPs for these satellites, and plans to use the technology developed in this program in its commercial product line.  A second application is cooling of commercial and military aircraft components, specifically for UAVs.  While operating at high altitudes during daytime, the LHP can reject the thermal load to the aircraft skin or forced convection sink.  At cold night, the LHP passively shuts down, limiting the heat loss and maintaining the electronics temperature.",Cooling

Currently used high-fidelity modeling and simulation tools at NASA are computationally prohibitive and not fully compatible with integrated analysis of spacecrafts. We propose to develop and demonstrate an innovative Model Order Reduction (MOR) software to automatically generate nonlinear reduced thermal models for spacecraft analysis. The underlying principle of our approach is to project the original full models onto a characteristic, low-dimensional subspace, yielding reduced models with markedly low computational orders. During Phase 1, key technology elements were developed and proof-of-concept was successfully demonstrated. A MOR engine encapsulating carefully selected nonlinear MOR algorithms, a reduced model solver and a verification module along with facile data exchange interfaces, were developed in an integrated software environment. By way of whole-satellite (LISA) case studies, critical evidence was established that reduced thermal models enable unprecedented speedup (10500X) and accuracy (<0.3%) for spacecraft analysis and design. In Phase 2, MOR engines will be optimized for enhanced computational performance. Robust constituent linear algorithms and domain-wise projection spaces will be developed to improve simulation stability and accuracy. New MOR capabilities to address variable-dependent models and parameterized MOR to accommodate design perturbations will be investigated. Our MOR software will be extensively verified and demonstrated for complex spacecraft thermal analysis. An application programming interface (API) will be developed in close collaboration with leading NASA vendors (C&R Technologies) to facilitate technology insertion and transition.","The proposed Model Order Reduction software will deliver NASA engineers a valuable tool to (1) perform rapid and computationally affordable thermal analysis for better understanding of design spaces, (2) develop advanced, reliable thermal control strategies for spacecrafts and instruments, and (3) properly arrange test procedures for rational use of instruments and facilities. The success in the proposed research will markedly shrink the development cycles of spacecrafts at reduced cost.","Among the non-NASA applications, the developed software will find use in various engineering sectors, including semiconductor industry, combustion, power and aerodynamics industry, chemical plants, biomedical companies, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and microfluidics manufacturers among others. The product would directly contribute to these vital areas by providing a powerful tool to generate fast reduced order models, which can be extensively used to (1) analyze the industrial processes for fault diagnostics and optimized design, leading to reduced turnaround time to market; and (2) develop advanced controller strategies for on-line process monitoring and control.",Control Instrumentation; Cooling; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Development Environments; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

The innovation consists of a high temperature alkali metal variable conductance heat pipe (VCHP) integrated with a two-phase heat collection / transport package  from the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) stack to the Stirling convertor heater head.   The thermal management system collects the heat from the GPHS modules, and delivers heat as required to the Stirling system.  Any excess heat is removed by the VCHP.  Excess  heat must be removed when the Stirling system is shut down, or in the early stages of a mission powered by a short-life radioisotope.  In Phase I, it was demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the VCHP allows the Stirling convertor to: stop during transit to Venus, pre-cool the system before re-entry, work on Venus and execute brief stoppages on Venus. The reservoir is exposed to the environment temperature during the mission and this is a key for the HTTMS to work passively. The other component of the system, the two-phase heat transport package (HTP), minimizes the temperature drop between the multi-GPHS stack and the heater head. In Phase II, a full scale HTTMS will be designed and a representative multi-segment of the full scale HTTMS will be build and tested in relevant environment.  This multi-segment contains two or three parallel/redundant heat paths from the simulated GPHS stack to the heater head simulator, in addition to the backup cooling system (VCHP). The full-scale multi-segment HTTMS will be integrated and tested with the corresponding full scale multi-segment of the Intermediate Temperature Thermal Management System (ITTMS) of the Venus Lander.","The immediate application for this proposal is thermal management for a long-lived Venus lander that is cooled with a Stirling system integrated with a large number of GPHS modules.  The thermal management system will efficiently collect the heat from the GPHS modules and deliver it to the Stirling engine.  In addition, the thermal management system will allow the Stirling convertors and cooling to be shut off during the transit to Venus, saving heater head life.  More generally, the systems developed on this program are applicable to all NASA missions with high powered radioisotope systems that require a large number of GPHS modules.  In particular, the system will allow the use of alternative isotopes with a shorter half-life than Pu-238.  The excess heat is passively rejected.In addition, the heat collection system is useful for smaller systems that use the less efficient Am-241 based GPHS modules, because they require a larger number of modules than the systems with the standard GPHS modules.  Backup cooling is also an important feature that is needed in almost all missions (and ground testing) that use GPHS modules. Beside the Venus mission applications, Beside the Venus mission applications, the developed system is applicable to deep space missions powered by alternate radioisotopes, as well as missions to other high temperature locations in the Solar System.","One potential commercial application based on a current product line at ACT is pressure-controlled isothermal furnace liners.  An isothermal furnace liner is an annular alkali metal heat pipe.  Replacing the current heat pipe with a pressure controlled VCHP will allow much tighter temperature control.A second commercial application is alkali metal VCHPs in fuel cell reformers.  In a fuel cell reformer, diesel fuel and air pass through a series of high temperature reactors to generate hydrogen.   The operating temperature of the reactors must be closely controlled to maintain their chemical equilibrium.  A typical system must maintain inlet and outlet temperatures within ±30oC despite a turndown ratio of 5:1 in reactant flow rate.  The current scheme uses a bypass valve, which has several drawbacks: it requires active control, requires power, and has a large pressure drop.  ACT believes that alkali metal VCHP heat exchangers can replace the current heat exchanger and control system with a passive system that automatically maintains the output stream from the heat exchanger at a constant temperature.",Cooling

The proposed IMM technology is based on ELO (epitaxial lift-off) and consists of Indium (In) and Phosphorous (P) solar cell active materials, which are designed to improve the radiation resistance properties of the triple junction solar cell while maintaining a high efficiency. Because of the intrinsic radiation hardness of InP materials, this material system is of great interest for building solar cells suitable for deployment in very demanding radiation environments, such as medium earth orbit and missions to the outer planets.  Due to high launch costs, weight reduction is a key driver for the development of new space solar cell technologies.  Our recently developed epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process will also be applied to this new structure, which will enable the fabrication of the IMM structure without the substrate.  Cells with excellent end-of-life (EOL) performance require less area to meet specific mission power requirements.   The target efficiency of the proposed IMM cell at the beginning of life (BOL) is greater than 30% at AMO 1-sun.  The EOL target of the IMM cell is a degradation of less than 10% in efficiency.","Radiation resistant solar cells are attractive for usage in high radiation environments such as medium earth orbit and missions to outer planets.  Due to high launch costs, weight reduction is key driver for the development of new space solar cell technologies.  Improved intrinsic cell radiation resistance may enable substantial weight reduction through the reduction or elimination of the heavy cover glass materials as required on conventional GaAs-based cells.  High efficiency and high EOL performance is of great interest for satellite power systems since less area would be required to obtain the desired electrical power.",The IMM cells developed for this program could be modified for use in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems to provide terrestrial solar power.  Using an InGaP/InGaAsP/InGaAs design rather than the conventional InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs design is expected to increase the efficiency of the resulting cell because the use of the quaternary InGaAsP subcell rather than the GaAs subcell allows the use of a set of bandgaps that better match the solar spectrum.   The technology described in this work is a green technology in that the GaAs substrate on which the solar cell is grown is reused multiple times via the ELO process and is ultimately recycled.,Photovoltaic Conversion; Semi-Conductors/Solid State Device Materials

The high specific power (>700 W/kg) and high efficiency of EMPT will enable a wide range of deep space missions such as Neptune, Pluto and Oort Cloud orbital insertion. Additionally, a solar electric EMPT system would dramatically increase the capability and reduce the travel time of an asteroid or Martian moon sample and return mission due to the variable-power, low-mass propulsion system. The EMPT employs a Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF) to produce large plasma currents inside a conical thruster creating a plasmoid that is magnetically isolated from the thruster walls. The intensified gradient magnetic field from the plasmoid together with the large plasma currents result in an enormous body force that expels the plasmoid at high velocity. The EMPT is a pulsed device, nominally operating at 1 kWe with 0.5-1 Joule discharges at 1-2 kHz. Presented is a full description of the relevant plasma physics as well as the thruster and PPU design. The Phase I EMPT demonstrated the multi-pulse formation and ejection of plasmoids at 0.1-3 Joules and 500-6,000 s Isp on both Xenon and Argon. Additionally, it demonstrated zero erosion or life limiting phenomena. The focus of the proposal is the experimental validation of an integrated thruster and PPU operating in a steady-state mode.

The high specific impulse operation of the EMPT will have applications for large earth observing science missions as a replacement for high-mass (<100 W/kg) station keeping thrusters when coupled with ultra-light solar arrays. Additionally, as more (and less massive) power is available for interplanetary science missions, such as advanced radioisotope power (REP) systems and NASA ultra-flex solar panels (SEP), electric propulsion can find even larger roles. A low mass, 1 kW REP propulsion system would enable a host of deep space Neptune, Pluto, and Oort Cloud orbiter missions.

The single, all-composite structure will include linerless, high-pressure propellant tank(s), composite bosses, flanges, longitudinal and circumferential stringers with integral shelves, holding mechanisms, and attach features to support all of the spacecraft equipment and replace the separate, mission-critical primary support structure, tanks, struts, straps, braces, clamps, and brackets traditionally required to hold subsystem parts in place.  The new structure has nearly 0 CTE over a temperature range from cryogenic to over 100 C.  Phase I will determine requirements, create a preliminary UCPS design relevant to a potential SMD mission, and test material compatibility with various in-space propellants.  Phase II will build two UCPS structures employing test masses for spacecraft components, and complete qualification and burst testing on one of them (including 0-g testing).","The proposed UCPS would be applicable for numerous NASA spacecraft applications, to reduce the mass and cost of SMD spacecraft, in particular. These tanks could compose the primary structural element in a spacecraft bus, at the same time serving their primary purpose of propellant storage. The tanks allow much higher pressure chemical propulsion systems, in excess of 2,000 psi, for less tank mass than traditional systems operating at much lower pressures, providing a lighter weight and lower volume solution. These tanks will be applicable for both high pressure liquid and gaseous propellants for chemical and electric propulsion systems.","The UCPS can be implemented in other government spacecraft as well as any commercial spacecraft employing propulsion systems, offering the unique combination of high pressure, low volume, lightweight tanks, and primary spacecraft structural support. Further potential applications include other launch vehicles, and additional space systems that desire weight and cost reduction. These tanks can also serve in other industries.

The fundamental idea behind this concept was to design a hot-walled refractory material (ceramic and/or metallic) in the form of a thin coating or liner and have that supported by a low density structure such as graphite or various carbon-carbon composites, offering an attractive lightweight design option.  This coated or lined low density structure combines the compatibility and hermetic seal of the ceramic and/or metallic hot-walled material with a lightweight, high strength to weight ratio support material such as graphite or carbon-carbon composites.  The advantage of this particular concept can be observed by both the weight and cost savings compared to, for example, current solid monolithic refractory propulsion components.  Lightweight structures are desirable for space transportation vehicle systems in order to reduce launch costs, increase mission flexibility, increase mission efficiency and add robustness with respect to the ability to add weight or additional materials to the mission with minimum sacrifice in performance.  This general concept is applicable to thrust vector controls, combustion chambers, nozzles and thrusters.  One study has shown that replacing a solid monolithic rhenium pintle and seat with a rhenium lined graphite version can offer both weight and cost savings as high as 80 - 90%.","The results of this refractory coated or lined low density structures study will be applicable to all four of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Programs research thrust.  Specifically, the fundamental technology and design tools developed in this Phase I effort can be expanding for design and analysis techniques/procedures for various high temperature material components such as rocket nozzles, leading edges, hypersonic airframes and ramjet engines.","MR&D's core business is design and thermal-structural analysis of high temperature composite and refractory materials.  The fundamental technology and design tools developed in this SBIR program will allow us to expand our client base and offer more capabilities to our existing customers.  Additionally, the technology developed here will be translated to other commercial and government applications to expand the market for refractory coatings/liners on lightweight support structures in rocket nozzles, leading edges, hypersonic airframes and ramjet engines.  The results of this refractory coated or lined low density structures study will additionally have broad ranging applications in civil aerospace, governmental aerospace companies, as well as aircraft jet engine manufactures and power generation equipment manufacturing companies.

In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of this game-changing technology.  Through chemical analysis, we determined that Mg can be combusted with CO2 condensed in-situ from the Martian atmosphere to yield Isp ~240 s.  We then successfully demonstrated a low fidelity Mg-CO2 rocket in the laboratory, achieving combustion for 43s before voluntary termination.  We also analyzed the use of H2O and H2O2 as oxidizers, and Al as a propellant.  H2O exists at the Martian poles and below the surface, while both Mg and Al can be acquired in-situ from the Martian regolith.  We determined that the ideal vacuum Isp of a 10 bar Mg-H20 rocket would be as high as ~340 s, while the Isp of a Al-steam rocket would be ~380 s, and hydrogen peroxide could yield higher density Isp and operational benefits.  In Phase II we plan to develop and test an integrated high performance laboratory model system.  We will first fully characterize multiple propellant oxidizer combinations in a linear combustor.  Then we will design, build, and test an integrated system including both a rocket and a propellant management system.  Comprehensive test results would feed back into the design, culminating in an advanced system sized for prospective near-term applications.","This energetic, non-toxic, storable propellant technology can be used in-space, and to explore Mars, Phobos, the Moon, and NEOs.The target application is Martian Payload Ascent Vehicle (PAV) propulsion.  This application benefits from  near, mid, and far-term ISRU opportunities.  In the near-term; the metal can be carried to Mars while the CO2 can be compressed from the atmosphere.  In the mid-term, H20 can be extracted from the sub-surface or polar caps.  In the far term, Mg and Al could be extracted from the soil using electrolysis.  Alternately, spent Al or Mg spacecraft structures could be processed into fuel.   Similar possibilities exist on the Moon and Phobos, both of which are believed to contain large reservoirs of water ice.  Once on orbit, Mg based rockets or Hall thrusters could propel the samples back Earth.  This non-toxic engine technology could also supplant MMH/NTO for in-space applications such as satellite propulsion and manned service modules.","Mg and Al bipropellant rockets are high performance, non-toxic alternatives to hydrazine and MMH bipropellants.  Government and commercial satellites would use metal bipropellant thrusters for on-orbit operations including orbit-raising, station-keeping, and repositioning.  Metal bipropellants could also be used in upper stages and as apogee engines.  In a multi-mode in-space propulsion system, a Mg-water rocket could provide high thrust while a Mg Hall thruster could provide low thrust at high Isp.  This system would be both fuel efficient and responsive. Atmospheric applications of Mg-water combustion technology could include HALE aircraft.  Naval applications include: a water breathing, high speed rocket propelled torpedo: a low speed , long range, unmanned undersea vehicles; long duration sensor power.  Other commercial applications include very dense and green chemical hydrogen sources for fuel cell applications.

Flexseal TVC control is planned for the first stage while hydrazine thrusters will be used for spin stabilization of the second stage. This approach is heavy and results in a spinning sample container in orbit, which is difficult to recover. Wickman Spacecraft & Propulsion Company (WSPC) proposes innovative hot gas thrusters for steering that use the gases from the solid rocket combustion chambers. This approach is lighter, improves orbit insertion accuracy and provides a non-spinning orbiting container to increase mission success probability. The MAV valves must handle metalized gases at 3,093 C.  During Phase I, WSPC demonstrated a hot gas valve operating above 3,093 C with the same propellant to be used in MAV.  Valves from all other companies must operate at 2,760 C or below with little metal in the exhaust gas.  During Phase II, WSPC will demonstrate a MAV first stage thruster and multiple MAV first stage thrusters operating from a single solid rocket motor using MAV solid propellant.  This final demonstration test will simulate a typical MAV first stage TVC duty cycle.","The primary NASA product is a hot gas thruster TVC system for planetary ascent vehicles that provide (1) higher mission reliability, (2) easier docking and rendezvous for returning samples to earth, (3) lower weight for higher payloads, (4) higher orbit insertion accuracy and (5) higher thrust vector angles. The technology can also be used for manned capsule escape systems with thrust management and thrust vector control. This would enable astronauts in a capsule to control the abort trajectory and land in a safe area.  It could also be used for real time thrust control for solid rocket motors on planetary landers.  Another application is thrust management of solid rocket boosters on small launch vehicles.","WSPC will produce hot gas TVC systems for Star and similar motors used to boost satellites into higher orbits. These motors currently do not have any TVC capability. With WSPC's new TVC systems, satellites would be boosted into more accurate orbits without spinning the satellite. Since the satellite is not spinning, it would not have to waste precious fuel de-spinning before beginning operation in orbit. This gives satellites a longer life in orbit before running out of station keeping fuel.WSPC will produce a variable throat nozzle for tactical missiles for thrust management. These nozzles will be cheaper, lighter and require less electrical power than conventional pintle nozzles. The requirement for less power will lighten the missile and permit more range or a larger warhead for a fixed range. WSPC will also market nozzles for ejector seats and small aircraft parachute deployment systems, which use solid rocket motors.","Ablatives; Attitude Determination and Control; Chemical; Composites; Feed System Components; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Metallics"

Phase I work saw the design and fabrication of a new type of dropsonde with a novel form factor and the associated launcher.  The system was installed in a representative UAV nose.  System components were successfully tested. Phase II will involve finalizing the launcher and dropsonde designs, developing the associated control and data handling system, building and testing the integrated system, and finally conducting test flights on a UAV.   The ultimate result of the project will be a dropsonde system that can be fitted to many NASA UAVs, including small UAVs, and enable them to gather in-situ atmospheric profiles and surface measurements using dropsondes. The Phase II entry TRL is 5; the expected exit TRL is 8.","Several areas of NASA research will be able to make use of dropsonde-equipped UAVs.  One prominent area that will benefit is hurricane research: dropsondes would bring a new dimension to the data gathered by UAVs flying into hurricanes, making their measurements more comparable to those of manned aircraft.  A second area is wildland firefighting operations: dropsondes would allow the UAV to return local meteorological profiles that could be used to improve the point weather forecasts developed by fire meteorologists.  Atmospheric and polar research are two more generic areas of research which will benefit from a dropsonde system for UAVs.","Other agencies engaged in the use of UAVs for atmospheric research or operational meteorology measurements (e.g., NOAA and the Department of Defense) would be able to use this dropsonde system on their UAVs.

Three or four wheels are usually used with three of them aligned along orthogonal axes. The degree to which pointing stability is achieved depends on the stability of the wheels' angular momentum vectors while spinning, which can be affected by static and dynamic unbalance contributions and other wheel construction issues. With the smaller satellites, requiring smaller wheels, the stability of the wheels will be even more challenging as the uncertainty of construction is likely to remain the same. To stabilize the smaller reaction wheels we propose to integrate a Sensor Chip containing MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers with each reaction wheel. This allows direct measurement of the wheel motions for fine-tuning its operation. The improved wheel then becomes a means for improving IMU sensor stability for precision pointing and slewing from object to object.","MSSA's MEMS IMU Sensor Chip enables modular and programmable guidance & navigation systems with significantly reduced mass and cost for low-cost small spacecraft, microsatellites and nanosatellites.

A potentially disruptive technology, small satellites are being eyed as platforms for the rapid demonstration of new technologies and important science missions. Currently, small satellite platforms struggle to balance the three critical tasks of collecting enough power, acquiring data and downlinking that data to ground stations in a way that maximizes mission return. For these small platforms, which usually do not benefit from steer-able solar arrays or gimbaled antennas and instruments, optimally balancing these three tasks strongly depends on the satellite's attitude control agility. Spacecraft agility has to do with rapid retargeting, fast transient settling and low jitter pointing control. Dr. Bong Wie, renowned spacecraft attitude control expert and Professor of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University, stated that ultimately the ""measure of an agile satellite attitude control system is its ability to collect the maximum data from an area on the Earth that is rich in data-collection opportunities"". A logical corollary following from this statement would be that to maximize satellite data-collection, system designers should look to increase the satellite's agility. Furthermore, in addition to data-collection, the other two critical tasks of power collection and data downlink are also maximized as agility is increased.Honeybee Robotics proposes to develop a low cost, high torque and low jitter satellite attitude control actuator derived from its Tiny Operationally Responsive CMG (TORC) design. This derivative product would combine two TORC units into a single scissored-pair configuration with SPA compatible interface. The result, a flight-certified TORC-SP, would be an actuator with the simple control interface of a reaction wheel that offers 1-2 orders of magnitude more torque per unit mass at drastically less power than a reaction wheel.","Small satellites which are low cost and can be delivered in months (as opposed to years), are being eyed as platforms for rapid demonstration of new technologies (e.g., new propulsion, communications, power collection and MEMS technologies) and even important science missions (e.g., earth and space climate observation, biological sciences). From NASA's recently launched PharmaSat sub-10 kg free-flying nanosatellite, which has just successfully completed an experiment that could help scientists better understand how effectively drugs work in space, to potential future missions like the Reef Ecosystem Spectro-Photometric Observatory (CRESPO), a ~100 kg microsatellite that will use a hyperspectral imager (HSI) to monitor the condition of more than 50% of the Earth's coral reefs over a 2-year period, NASA is counting on these small satellites to deliver.","At MILSPACE 2009 Karyn Hayes-Ryan, Associate Chief Operating Officer of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) offered that CubeSats might be the next transforming innovation in space development primarily because they offer a means for rapidly maturing new technologies to ultimately be used by larger NRO intelligence gathering satellites. The vision of CubeSats as technology demonstration platforms will only be realized when their data downlink capability matches their data acquisition capability. At the moment, CubeSat communications are extremely limited. To boost communications, they need more power and they need to focus and aim that power in the form of directed transmissions. Beyond the ""CubeSat as a test and demonstration platform"" model, the information developed under the proposed study would inform Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission planners considering the use of small agile satellites in the 3 to 50 kg range.

A basic requirement is that samples be returned in pristine, uncontaminated condition, necessitating development of a canister system capable of maintaining cleanliness and seal integrity through a variety of environments. Further development of the Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), is proposed after a successful Phase 1 program. Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister incorporates features for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples  seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful Apollo indium knife edge seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent against contamination, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process. The container body can be configured to accommodate a variety of samples including rock cores, rock fragments, regolith, dust, and frozen soil. Atmospheric samples can also be preserved. The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions. The prototype developed in Phase 1 demonstrated a leakage rate of less than 1e-6 cc-atm/s, meeting the primary science requirement.","Potential missions to targets throughout the solar system have been identified that would utilize the SPRC sample return canister, particularly missions to Mars and the Moon. Mars Sample Return is the most visible mission requiring an SPRC device. Even one funded mission would justify the continued development of the SPRC through the SBIR program. Significant savings would be realized through the repeated use of a standardized approach developed under this program.  The SPRC could also find use for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) prospecting. ISRU requires that samples be acquired and analyzed for their volatile content to determine mining locations.","Additional science applications (through NASA or other government organizations such as the NSF) include terrestrial investigations requiring the securing of pristine samples, particularly those containing volatiles of interest - Arctic and Antarctic ice, untouched water reservoirs, volcanic samples etc. While containers are available commercially that can be filled and sealed by a human operator, these environments are not always accessible to humans and a robotic-compatible container would fill a currently empty niche.Non-NASA applications could include gathering samples in hostile environments such as nuclear or hazardous waste sites.

The flexibility afforded from a rover or lander arm to target outcroppings, and the relatively higher TRL of surface coring tools (vs. deeper subsurface drills), make surface coring, especially with an arm-deployed coring tool, a particularly attractive option for near term planetary exploration. During Phase I, a preliminary coring tool design was developed that weighs less than 5 kg and meets all of the current MSR requirements. Breadboard testing also demonstrated the feasibility of arm-deployed and stabilized coring. The objectives of Phase II are to further develop, demonstrate and characterize a TRL 5/6 MSR-compatible coring tool. The rotary-percussive coring tool will weigh less than 5 kg, be arm-deployed and stabilized, include a passive linear feed device, require less than 50 N weight-on-bit, produce and capture 1 cm diameter by 5 cm long cores, accommodate active bit change-out and passive bit release, and positively retain cores in core tubes when removed from the bit. The coring tool will be fully demonstrated and characterized at ambient and Mars conditions.","Future robotic astrobiology and geology missions such as Mars Sample Return, Astrobiology Field Laboratory and other Mid-Range Rover missions will benefit greatly from the ability to produce and capture rock and regolith cores using an arm-deployed, arm-stabilized, compact, low mass, low power device. Such a coring drill could also be deployed during lunar sortie missions by astronauts (operating as a hand-held coring drill) since it is desirable to bring small cores back to Earth as opposed to large rocks. From a science standpoint, core samples have a distinct advantage over collected drill cuttings in that the stratigraphy and morphology of the sample is preserved. This facilitates detection of localized organics and fossil biosignatures, as well as analysis of geochemistry and mineralogy. The need for a flight-ready surface coring tool has been evident in various NASA program reviews, mission concepts, and mission baselines.","Rotary-percussive core drilling has many terrestrial applications in industry and in the research and development fields. Core samples are integral to the study of a wide range of fields, from geological classification to ocean drilling and surveying. Potential applications of the proposed coring technology include sidewall coring and subsampling for the petroleum industry, as well as in the study of earthquake mechanics or terrestrial biology (specifically coring in the Arctic and Antarctic.) Automation of the rotary-percussive coring process would also benefit these industries and fields, saving time and money and enabling the engineering and science goals of the various applications to be realized with reduced schedule and budget risk.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Manipulation; Perception/Sensing; Teleoperation; Tools

Fundamentally, all electric motors basically work on the same electromagnetic principle: a tangential electromagnetic force attracts the rotor to the stator.  Just when the rotor field is closest to the stator field and the electromagnetic attraction is greatest, the power is interrupted and another set of magnetic poles repeats the cycle.  Furthermore, the two magnetically attracted elements never make contact, which would otherwise offer the highest force of attraction.  The proposed novel motor design, successfully demonstrated at TRL 4 in Phase 1, operates and behaves entirely differently from all other known electric motor designs and is capable of producing incredibly high, direct drive torques at low rotational speeds.  Its operational performance is similar to that of a stepper motor with a 1000:1 gearhead attached, but the similarity ends there.  The motor is configured such that its length to diameter aspect ratio is opposite that of traditional motors as it has a relatively large diameter and short axial length; this offers all new packaging opportunities.  The design also allows for a single, large diameter bearing pair to be used for the motor's output shaft which renders it stiff enough to directly mount the driven elements.  The need for additional bearing supports and bearing mounting structure is thus eliminated.  By the end of Phase 2, the system will be designed,  developed and tested at TRL 6 with Mars environmental conditions.","For NASA, the proposed innovation is an enabling technology for planetary exploratory missions and a number of possible applications are envisioned for the motor, some examples are: Robotic arm joints, Rover wheel steering and drive actuators, Core drill sample Break-off actuators, Antenna Mast and Solar array deployment and Launch locks.","The proposed motor will have a number of commercial applications in areas where slow speed and high output torques or forces are needed.  For example, the motor could be used in applications where pneumatic or hydraulic actuators are required for high output forces.  More specifically, commercial applications for the motor are anticipated in: winches, lifts, positioning equipment, structural deployment, presses and door openers/ lifts.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Manipulation; Mobility; Tools

Rendezvous of a vehicle with a sample canister in order to return the canister to Earth requires a variety of complex mathematical processing on a changing data set, coupled with the need to safely and effectively handle a large range of off-nominal conditions and spacecraft faults. Light speed delay isolates the spacecraft from real-time operator intervention, while inertial and situational uncertainties demand reactivity not required of typical spacecraft sequencing systems. These mission features call for a new class of sequence capability: Reactive Rendezvous and Docking Sequencer (RRDS).RRDS  melds the rule-based reactivity needed for rendezvous and docking with sequence characteristics common to more traditional missions. Rules watch for conditions in order to react to the current situation, allowing a wide range of complex activities and safety-related responses to be concisely represented without complex procedural programming. Responsibility for commanding elements aboard the spacecraft is divided among sequenced state machines called managers, coordinated together by a flight director which the ground commands.Underlying flight software for navigation, thruster allocation, inertial checking, attitude estimation and control, contact detection, docking mechanisms, and the like receive direction from the managers. This mediated control causes the system to reactively operate in modes with proper ordering of activities. Reactive operations are represented explicitly by states and transitions defining the managers, and do not require use of explicitly timed activities.Phase II of this SBIR will produce a Class B version of the underlaying VML 2.2 flight software capable of executing the RRDS state machines. It will also produce Class C versions of the associated VML compiler and Offline VM execution system for deployment onto flight projects.","RRDS may be applied to a variety of commercial missions reactively operating spacecraft in complex scenarios, like deep space missions retrieving samples from a variety of planetary bodies, comets, asteroids, or moons. RRDS could also be used on uncrewed cargo flights to a space station or assembly site.Executable state machines provided by VML 2.2 allow many kinds of autonomy to be created, outside of the  RRDS realm. These include: reactive fault protection which is cheaper to develop and more transparent in operation than a flight software implementation  autonomy for self-directed orbital missions requiring limited operational interaction with controllers, reducing personnel costs  autonomy for self-directed comet / asteroid sampling missions requiring limited operational interaction with controllers, reducing DSN time and personnel costs  on-board replanning to compensate for degraded and failed systems in a high radiation, remote environment like Europa orbit  autonomy for landed vehicles and rovers, reducing the risk to the mission and simplifying mission operations  target-of-opportunity science collection in earth-orbiting or deep space environments, allowing detected events to result in further detailed observations (e.g. detected volcanic activity leading to taking a raster of images)  expert systems for guiding remote experiments in real-time based on observed environmental conditions","VML 2.2 allows autonomy to be created for commercial low earth orbiting observation missions that would permit targets of opportunity for observations to be identified and acted upon. Autonomy in this regime could also simplify spacecraft operations by allowing onboard systems to make more decisions, and reduce the need for off-shift operations personnel. Many of the NASA commercial applications listed above also have potential terrestrial applications. VML 2.2 autonomy capabilities could be applied to autonomous vehicle control, manufacturing process controllers, airborne systems, and remote science stations with limited contact time. The state-machine approach has an advantage over autocoded systems in that the embedded software is not unique for every flight software load, reducing risk and enhancing system insight.","Aerobrake; Attitude Determination and Control; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Expert Systems; Guidance, Navigation, and Control; Human-Computer Interfaces; Human-Robotic Interfaces; Manned-Maneuvering Units; On-Board Computing and Data Management; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Software Development Environments; Teleoperation"

Our proposed device will be offered in a robust miniature 5x7mm industry standard surface mount package (0.24 grams only). We have engaged in the Phase I study to further refine the approach with more confidence which concludes that the proposed solution would also offer compelling features such as scalable (wide) frequency range (100KHz to 250MHz), and dual output logic compatibility (CMOS & LVDS). The compelling features of our device features include drastically improved reliability and quicker availability. The overall design of the RPXO includes a radiation hardened SiGe ASIC that operates over the extreme temperature range of -230C to +150C and holds all the necessary functions of a crystal driver circuit, synthesizer, and output buffers. The ASIC uniquely provides dual output logic compatibility (CMOS and LVDS). All aspects of radiation hardness such as TID, ELDERS and SEU have been researched and addressed in the phase 1 study. The SiGe ASIC is integrated with a high reliability and radiation hardened crystal resonator in a highly compliant yet robust miniature package.","The proposed RPXO is intended for very demanding and high radiation missions such as Europa EJSM (JEO & JGO), Mars Sample Return, Titan, missions to comets, Juno, space station, and GPM. The compelling features and performance of the proposed RPXO makes it highly suitable for most scientific and commercial space missions that require high speed data transfer link. This device could operate during take-off, interplanetary travel, orbit entry as well as landing of the probe. RPXO can be used in processor modules, DSP, servo control, receivers, transmitters, & sensors, auxiliary memory modules, where clock signal stability (temperature, shock, vibration, etc.) and integrity (signal to noise, phase noise and phase jitter) is critical.","We have already received requirements for commercial space applications of RPXO (which we can not respond to yet) and that has further exposed the potential value of our proposition to our customers who manufacture the various instruments for NASA and other first tier space payload contractors. Sensors, controllers and communication modules are the examples of such usage. There are a number of applications for our proposed RPXO in avionics and jet engine controllers as well as other military driven system application. The jet engine market segment is a new and growing one which intends to eliminate complex, heavy and unreliable wire harnesses in the present aircrafts.

In scientific computing, the focus is on the partial differential equations (PDEs) that arise from computational fluid dynamics (CFD), climate modeling, astrophysics, and structural and heat analysis that cannot be solved analytically. Certain problem formulations lead to sparse matrices, in which the majority of matrix elements are zero. Special attention is required when computing on sparse matrices in order to avoid using unrealistic amounts of memory or produce ill-performing software. Such topics have been the subject of considerable research and the limits of CPU-based performance have been reached.Recently, the graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as an attractive platform for high performance computing. The modern GPU boasts over 1 TFLOPS performance and as much as 6 GB onboard memory, but harnessing the power can be challenging. A library-based approach is common for HPC, with most applications using several libraries to offload well-known tasks. EM Photonics maintains a library of GPU-accelerated dense linear algebra solvers that has over 5000 users. In this project we will extend this library to include a wide range of sparse solvers, including many that have direct relevance to NASA projects.","Sparse computations arise in finite element and finite volume methods (FEM, FVM) common in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) space, an area where NASA has many important efforts especially related to space missions and weather prediction. For example, the CFD code Overflow is widely used by NASA when designing launch and re-reentry vehicles and is used to study the air loads on the NASA space shuttles. The INS3D code is used by the space directorate to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for steady-state and time varying flow, which has been used to study the gravitational effects of blood flow in the human brain. NASA also has a vested interest in CFD-based weather prediction models. For example, the NASA Finite Volume General Circulation Model (fvGCM) and Parallel Ocean Program (POP) codes are large-scale climate prediction models important for analyzing weather effects such as global warming and hurricane predictions.","Sparse solvers have applications in the entire FVM and FEM space that further expands the applicability of our project to a large number of fields involved with modeling and simulation. For instance, the models used by circuit simulation, heat transfer, and structural mechanics can all be represented by very large sparse matrices. Accelerated sparse solvers will allow engineers to more quickly turn around designs with increased detail and accuracy. Large sparse matrices commonly arise in other fields involving statistics and optimization where a large amount number of elements have various interactions. For example, electrical power systems, traffic flow optimization, economics, search index rankings, and the modeling of chemical processes are just a small sample of fields where the interaction of a large number coupled elements are represented through sparse matrices. Accelerated sparse solvers and decompositions will allow scientists to rapidly study larger problems in less time.",Computer System Architectures; Expert Systems; Simulation Modeling Environment; Software Development Environments; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

An intriguing aspect of the infrastructure is the integration of performance measurement, unit testing, and refactoring tools with the many other features of an IDE, which will allow developers to get immediate feedback about the overall application and reduce their development cycle time.  Our goal is to promote modern software engineering methodology to a broad spectrum of Fortran users.The infrastructure will facilitate refactoring newly developed and legacy codes correctly and accurately for single and multi-processor applications. Major benefits to refactoring include creating robust codes that are more easily ported to different hardware and software platforms, promoting extensibility, facilitating better collaboration, and encouraging best software engineering practices. For example, refactoring code to remove common blocks allows porting to multi-core architectures with increased thread safety.By packaging pFUnit (Fortran Unit Test Tool) into the Eclipse, combining with improved versions of Photran IDE and the Parallel Tools Platform plugins, the proposed integration we will be able to quickly contribute to the Fortran developer community, whose feedback we hope to use to guide our product development.","While process study missions (e.g. CALIPSO/CloudSat) are critical to improve underlying climate model physics, future mission observations (e.g. CLARREO) are critical to determine the impact of those climate model improvements on the accuracy of predicting future climate change.  Since the proposed tools will make it easier for NASA scientists to develop and optimize climate modeling codes, the proposed project in a sense supports all climate-related current and future missions to ensure that studies address serious accuracy issues in climate change observation and prediction. Beyond mission-related research, the proposed project has applications for all modeling efforts supported by NASA High-End Computing and the Modeling, Analysis and Prediction programs.One of our specific early adopter targets is a coupled atmosphere-ocean model called modelE developed at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). Other potential NASA applications from GISS are four mesoscale dynamics models including the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble.

The proposed capability significantly enhances TEAMS Designer and runtime modules' suitability for deployment on board as well as on the ground for NASA's vehicles for mission information exchange and planning between the command module, mission control and ground operations.","In addition to NASA, several other large military systems where automated real-time condition assessment, mission assessment and successful mission planning is critical for operations such as other Space Command ground segments, Ground Vehicles, the Navy shipboard platforms, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) fleet, and ballistic missile defense systems, as well as commercial industries such as semiconductor fabrication, industrial automation transportation, power generation and distribution, are potential applications.",Architectures and Networks; Autonomous Control and Monitoring; Autonomous Reasoning/Artificial Intelligence; Computer System Architectures; Expert Systems; Highly-Reconfigurable; Human-Computer Interfaces; Operations Concepts and Requirements

In the past few years, multiple projects in the ISHM domain as well as the operations domain (Procedure V&V) have started to leverage the power of model checking through the use of the Finite State Machines (FSM) formalism. These models have been typically developed manually by subject matters experts in the different spacecraft systems and subsystems. This is a significant hindrance to the widespread use of models for any targeted application. The envisioned suite of tools would allow non experts to derive the appropriate SysML models for their intended use. In addition to providing a generic library of space systems models, methods to customize these models to the specific target system, our proposal will also design tools that enable the automatic or semi automatic extraction of appropriate information from different source, thus significantly accelerating the development and the usage of such models.","A toolset for accelerated development of executable models of spacecraft systems has multiple applications in the NASA community, the DoD environment, as well as in the commercial arena. The envisioned toolset can be applied to any complex system that needs to use model-based techniques for design or validation. Desktop based tool support for such system is currently missing. In the short term, the tool can be used for NASA projects such as the Orion, the Small Pressurized Rover, and Lunar Habitat test bed . The tool should allow these projects to significantly reduce the need for prototyping activities and associated costly simulation. In the longer term, the tool can be directly applicable to all components of the Constellation program and any software intensive system supporting the new exploration vision.","The toolset for executable models development that can be customized to different systems will be useful within DoD organizations in which software intensive product lines are common. For example, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Domain is enjoying a period of significant expansion. UAVs have progressed from target drones to reusable weapon systems. Their software systems have become complex and extremely diversified. Domain specific executable SysML models could reduce development risks by enabling many alternative operational concepts and designs to be evaluated before significant effort is expended developing poor designs. In the commercial arena, adopting the same type of approach for software intensive system can be used in a broad range of areas, such as airplane, power plant SCADA systems, and vertical business applications such as Human Resources applications. This type of technology can be adapted to these different domains and provide benefits similar to those provided to NASA.",Computer System Architectures; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Simulation Modeling Environment; Training Concepts and Architectures

PM/IDE will enable novice modelers to review and understand models more expediently, so they can learn modeling techniques more efficiently.  PM/IDE also will enable experienced modelers to review the models of others more quickly, so they can share modeling techniques and best practices.  Interactive graphical displays will enable modelers to describe planning domain models under construction and the plans they can generate to domain experts in order to facilitate more efficient knowledge elicitation and model review.  Without PM/IDE, ANML modeling will remain a tedious and difficult task that can be carried out only by the small number of people who have the necessary specialized skills and patience. This, in turn, will severely limit the use of ANML-based automated planning systems.During Phase I, we characterized the planning domain modeling task to identify the types of analyses and decisions that modelers carry out and the kinds of information they review and assess.  Based on this understanding of the task, we designed and prototyped PM/IDE capabilities and user-system interactions that help people develop ANML models.  During Phase 2, we propose to develop a TRL 7 version of PM/IDE. Our design approach draws upon our experience using a top-down, decision-centered software requirements and design process to develop data visualization and decision support systems.","The proposed research effort will result in an operational IDE that NASA personnel can use to develop high-quality, large-scale ANML models more quickly and easily.  After Phase II, Stottler Henke will market the IDE to NASA contractors and will enhance the IDE to support additional NASA and NASA contractor requirements.  The technology developed during the project will also enable Stottler Henke to develop planning domain models for other modeling languages used by NASA, its partner space agencies, and its contractors.  The technology will also enhance the domain modeling capabilities of Stottler Henke's AuroraTM intelligent scheduling tool suite, which  is used by NASA, NASA contractors, and major aerospace manufacturers.","The resulting technology will also serve as an important new part of Stottler Henke's intelligent sensing and control solution offerings to the Department of Defense that support military operations, simulation, and training.

It will be thorough in its ability to model a range of environments, from terrestrial to lunar, and through its ability to provide accurate sensor and truth data for analysis.  It will include simulation of communication latency and bandwidth restrictions.  Sensors will be modeled through a powerful plugin interface that supports tying stimulation of new sensor modalities to terrain and objects.  The effort will include the development of robot, sensor, and environment models tailored to the simulation of field-study vehicles, and it will emphasize mimicking the network interfaces used by NASA.  The proxy simulation will be able to model multiple and disparate robots simultaneously.

The tool Energid proposes will reduce cost and improve schedule in many efforts and is expected to be widely used by NASA.  In addition to the direct tool for proxy simulation, the underlying capability will be developed as a C++ software toolkit.  This toolkit will benefit NASA in ways other than just proxy simulation.  It will also support verification and validation and stand-alone simulation to test hardware improvements, control algorithms, and interface software.

To design wide-temperature, radiation-hardened (rad-hard) electronics and predict the characteristics and reliability in these extreme environments, advanced models and simulation tools are required at multiple levels. Analog and mixed-signal circuits for space exploration have not been adequately addressed to date. The proposed project aims to design, develop, validate, and demonstrate novel Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) analog/mixed-signal, RF and digital integrated circuits (ICs) aimed for application in NASA relevant extreme environments. In Phase 1, CFDRC, in collaboration with Georgia Tech, accomplished the following: (1) enhanced and demonstrated CFDRC's unique physics-based mixed-mode simulation tools (NanoTCAD coupled with Cadence Spectre) for predicting transient radiation response of benchmark analog circuits based on silicon-germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS technology; (2) leveraged experimental radiation/temperature data collected under the NASA Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) SiGe project to validate new low-T device physics models in NanoTCAD and understand associated physical phenomena; and (3) developed preliminary RHBD concepts for single-event hardening, including the novel inverse-mode cascode (IMC) SiGe HBT. In Phase 2, we will demonstrate and validate the improved physics-based models for temperature range from -230oC to +130oC, and apply them to evaluate and develop RHBD designs over the expected operating range. New RHBD devices employed in analog, RF and digital circuits will be fabricated in prototype chips and tested over a wide temperature range and in a radiation environment, and delivered as a component library for NASA use.","Prediction of electrical performance and radiation tolerance of electronic components in extreme environments (wide temperature range, radiation) are crucial for designing reliable electronics for all NASA robotic exploration missions, such as planned Europa Jupiter System Mission, Titan Saturn System Mission, Venus In-Situ Explorer, sample return from Comet, Asteroids, and continued lunar and Mars exploration missions. Since electronic parts are getting smaller with technology evolution, the radiation/temperature effects are becoming more severe  the lifetime and reliability are quickly becoming critical issues  the physics-based capability to predict the behavior of electronic circuits increases confidence and reduces mission risk. Radiation-hardened and wide-temperature analog, mixed-signal, RF and digital circuits are essential for all the avionic systems used in the NASA exploration projects. The optimized, wide-temperature RHBD designs from this SBIR will add to the pre-existing NASA ""component library"". The wide-temperature, physics-based mixed-mode tools will help NASA to design rad-hard low-temperature electronics with better understanding and control of design margins, and will enable designers to better evaluate the wide-temperature performance and radiation response at an early design stage and set requirements for hardening and testing, thereby reducing the amount of testing time and cost.","Various critical analog, mixed-signal, RF and digital circuits are used in all space-based platforms, including  DoD space systems (communication, surveillance, ballistic missiles, missile defense), and commercial satellites. Since modern electronics technologies and components are becoming increasingly sensitive to extreme environments, the mission lifetime and reliability are becoming increasingly critical, and the capability to predict their behavior  dramatically increases confidence and reduces risk. The new RHBD designs and circuit/cell libraries, as well as the physics-based computer aided design (CAD) tools, can also be applied to cryogenic electronics for high-sensitivity, low-noise analog and mixed-signal applications, such as metrology, infrared (IR) imagers, sensors (radiation, optical, X-ray), radiometrology, precision instruments, radio and optical astronomy, infrared and photon detectors, and other high-end equipment.  For all such devices and systems, predictive and accurate modeling and design tools reduce the amount of required radiation/temperature testing, thus decreasing their cost, and time to market or field application.",Radiation-Hard/Resistant Electronics; Simulation Modeling Environment

The regulator is stable under all load conditions without an external compensation capacitor, thereby reducing the mass/volume of the power management system and increasing reliability. The MESFET-based LDO component has very competitive figures of merit (dropout voltage, transient response, power supply rejection) compared to existing components. During Phase 1 we confirmed that the components were unconditionally stable without an external compensation capacitor over the temperature range -196C to +150C and for radiation doses up to 1 Mrad(Si). We shall build on the Phase 1 design effort to demonstrate two fully integrated LDO regulators rated up to 1A with dropout voltages of less than 50 mV. One part will be fabricated using a qualified rad-hard SOI CMOS foundry in collaboration with Honeywell, one of our commercialization partners. The other component will be fabricated using the low-cost/high-volume foundry available from IBM. Both parts will have a nominal output voltage of 1.8V with 1% accuracy. Other designs will target user adjustable voltages in the range 1.2-2V. The feasibility of using the MESFET technology for low voltage applications (e.g. 0.8V) will be explored. All parts will be tested over the temperature range -150C to +150C and after irradiation exposure to a TID of 1 Mrad from a Co-60 source. The enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) of the components will be studied using a low dose rate Cs-137 source. The characteristics of all the components will be documented, and parts made available to NASA and potential customers as deliverables from the Phase 2 activity. We shall work with our commercialization partners to have the LDO regulator design adopted as a licensed 'IP block' and to develop low cost versions for the wider consumer electronics market.",The MESFET-based linear regulator technology has the potential for widespread NASA applications in power management systems exposed to extreme environments. The high radiation tolerance we have demonstrated is attractive for orbital earth science studies as well as lunar and interplanetary missions. Our technology may even be suitable for spacecraft exposed to high radiation environments such as the Europa Jupiter System Mission. Missions to the outer reaches of the solar system that depend on a radiothermal generator are exposed to on-board radiation from the RTG and require the high level of radiation tolerance we expect from the final MESFET regulator component. We expect the MESFET technology to be relatively immune to single event effects and therefore suitable for solar observatories and lunar sensors exposed to solar flares. The MESFET technology can operate over the -196C,"Low dropout regulators are ubiquitous in commercial consumer electronics and automotive systems. A non-hardened version of the regulator we are proposing to develop will be inexpensive to manufacture using high volume commercial CMOS foundries. Our business models show that such a component can be manufactured at a cost per die that is competitive with existing products but without the need for an external compensation capacitor thereby reducing the overall costs and part count of the power management system. If this is confirmed our regulator component has the potential for widespread commercial adoption. We are working with our commercialization partners at On Semiconductor and Honeywell to develop these non-NASA applications. As well as a standalone product, we are developing the low dropout linear regulator as a scalable design that can be included in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) as a licensed 'IP block'.

The material system is based on Ultramet's proven oxide-iridium/rhenium architecture, which has been successfully hot-fire tested with stoichiometric oxygen/hydrogen for hours. Instead of rhenium, however, the structural material will be a niobium or tantalum alloy that has excellent yield strength at both ambient and elevated temperature. Phase I demonstrated alloys with yield strength-to-weight ratios more than three times that of rhenium, which will significantly reduce chamber weight. The starting materials are also two orders of magnitude less expensive than rhenium and are less expensive than the C103 niobium alloy commonly used in low-performance engines. Phase II will focus on the design, fabrication, and hot-fire testing of a small (5-25 lbf thrust class) chamber with LOX/CH4, and will culminate in the design and fabrication of a 100-lbf chamber that can be mated and tested with an existing LOX/CH4 injector. Throughout the project, Ultramet will work closely with Aerojet, which will perform the hot-fire testing.","For cryogenic LOX/CH4 engines in the 5- to 100-lbf thrust class, potential NASA applications include reaction control systems for lunar or Martian ascent/descent vehicles, lunar or Martian sample return vehicles, and main engines for interplanetary spacecraft and spacecraft being placed into geostationary orbit.

Additionally, these turbopump and thrust chamber assemblies may be batch fabricated in a cost-effective manner and modularly stacked, thereby covering a wide range of NASA exploration applications, including nano-sat launch, lunar ascent / descent(precursors, rovers, cargo, man-rated vehicles, etc.), planetary missions (payload ascent vehicles for payload and orbiting sample placement into orbit, sample return, etc.), and Near-Earth-Object (NEO) missions (sample return).","Non-NASA applications for high-performance micro-rocket engines enabled by the proposed pump technology are likely to include commercial / military launch vehicles for low-cost and on-demand access to space for a variety of micro / small satellite payloads, upper stage propulsion for orbit insertion of commercial satellites, apogee kick motors for orbit circularization of commercial satellites, etc. Additionally, the pump itself is expected to have non-aerospace applications in industrial cryogenic pumping applications, and as a replacement for small-scale, high-pressure liquid pumps.",Feed System Components; Fluid Storage and Handling; Micro Thrusters

The Phase 1 effort exceeded expectations, with the device demonstrating reliable ignition of both hydrogen and propane fuels, and achieving in excess of 1 million impact cycles (40,000 start cycles) during fatigue testing without measureable degradation.  Several spin-off concepts were also identified that provide additional options for improving spark ignition system design.  For Phase 2, IES proposes an accelerated, 18 month effort to refine design concepts and analysis tools, and then develop specific ignition system designs for two customer applications, with the intention of having these ignition systems demonstrated in engine ground testing during Phase 2 and ready to start flight qualification immediately following the Phase 2 effort.  Both customers (United Launch Alliance and Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne) have expressed interest and commitment in participating in the Phase 2 activity, making engines and facilities available for development testing, and integrating any resulting viable products into their flight engines.  The ULA application is a new gaseous bipropellant H2/O2 attitude control thruster, for which the piezoelectric igniter is ideal as a simple, direct ignition source.  The PWR application is for an evolved RL-10 study currently underway, for which the piezoelectric system might be scaled up or used as a pilot igniter for a torch, or make use of another spin-off concept that was identified during the Phase 1 effort.  The timing of this Phase 2 effort coincides perfectly with near term needs of both these customers, as well as for other small engine applications in work to replace catalytic hydrazine engines with bi-propellant engines that will require a simple and reliable ignition source.","Two specific commercial customers that regularly provide services for NASA have identified strong interest in this technology, with intent to implement the technology if Phase II development is successful.  One application is a new gaseous H2/O2 attitude control and settling thruster currently under development by United Launch Alliance (ULA) for Atlas upper stage.  The second application is a new ignition system for the Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) evolved RL-10 engine.  Both ULA and PWR have stated their interest and intention to provide facility access and test opportunities concurrent with any Phase II effort.  A third potential application is for ignition of any bi-propellant thrusters to be installed on the CRYOTE (Cryogenic Orbital Testbed) currently of interest to NASA and ULA.  This testbed might use either the ULA thrusters mentioned above, or another engine identified by NASA.  Numerous other NASA applications for very simple spark igniters are inevitable as small catalytic monopropellant (hydrazine) thrusters are replaced by cleaner bipropellant thrusters for satellite and upper stage attitude control purposes.","Aside from the ULA and PWR applications mentioned above (both of which also provide non-NASA services to commercial satellite operations and military customers such as Air Force), other potential commercial aerospace and industrial applications include gas turbine igniters for aircraft or ground power applications, furnace combustor ignition, flare stack ignition systems for hydrogen or methane, etc.",Ceramics; Combustion; Fluid Storage and Handling; Fundamental Propulsion Physics; Manned-Maneuvering Units; Micro Thrusters

Vintage propulsion systems frequently use highly toxic propellants such as MMH.  The toxicity of these propellants increases not only the risk of the missions but also the expense, due to special handling required during the entire lifetime of the propellant.  Replacing toxic propellants with strong-performing, non-toxic formulations will significantly reduce the cost of propulsion systems.  The Phase I project demonstrated the feasibility of developing several ionic liquid formulations that essentially equaled MMH in performance while offering low volatility and low toxicity.  The Phase II work will continue the synthesis strategy to refine the formulations, conduct more extensive material property testing, conduct ignition delay tests, and demonstrate the fuels in a small-scale thruster.  The collective result of these tasks will be the development and demonstration of new, safer fuels for propulsion applications.","Because of their good performance and low toxicity, these storable fuels will be suitable for a number of NASA propulsion applications.  These new fuels could be used in reaction control systems for NASA's in-space science missions, lunar missions, satellites, or any future manned flights.","The applications for these ionic liquid fuels in the military and civilian sectors exceed even the abundant NASA applications.

Dynamic seals are used throughout the turbopump in high-performance, pump-fed, liquid rocket engines for a variety of purposes.  The most common applications are in the lift-off seal (LOS), inter-propellant seal (IPS), and balance piston seals  high-pressure orifice (HPO), low-pressure orifice (LPO), and inner diameter impeller shroud seal (eye seal).  The system solution for conventional seals represents a compromise between the turbopump mechanical design, primarily flowpath, and secondary flowpath design that results in increased leakage, increased seal wear, and reduced balance piston load capacity that reduces performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  The magnetically actuated seal eliminates this compromise and provides significant improvement in performance, throttle-ability, thrust-to-weight, reliability, and operability.  Phase 1 resulted in a significant advancement of the technology by demonstrating a magnetically actuated face seal in both ambient and cryogenic conditions, characterizing the seal and actuator performance, and quantifying the performance improvements for the turbopump and engine.  Phase 2 will advance the technology from TRL 3 to 5.  The technology is applicable to booster engines, in-space engines, and ascent/descent engines.","The anticipated benefits from this technology include reduced seal leakage (for improved efficiency, and reduced turbine inlet temperature, which improves reliability), reduced seal wear (which increases life and reliability), reduced or eliminated purge (which improves operability and reduces weight), eliminates primary and secondary seal drains and associated plumbing and valves (which improves reliability and reduces weight), and improves design point and off-design balance piston performance (which increases the throttle range).  This technology is directly applicable to booster engines, in-space engines, and ascent/descent engine for NASA applications including booster and upper stage engines planned for HLLV.","The resulting technology is directly applicable to address the seal wear issue in the commercial pump industry, dynamic seals in FTT's family of small UAV turbofan engines as well as for active clearance control systems in large aero engines and industrial gas turbine engines.

The UCDS Process addresses this issue by using a rigorous physics-based analytical framework to decompose the complex flow field inside a chemical propulsion device, such as a liquid or solid rocket, in a way that allows rapid simulation of the dynamic behavior.  Using UCDS it is possible to generate high fidelity predictions of the time evolution, amplitude and waveform of a pressure oscillation, along with any changes to the mean properties due to non-linear effects.  Furthermore, it has been shown that the modal Alpha (linear growth rate) is a key physical parameter that defines the dynamic behavior of a rocket and provides a reliable measure of combustion stability margin.By monitoring how the array of modal Alphas change with design or operational features, the effects on engine combustion stability can be predicted.  This insight provides the means to eliminate instability without resorting to expensive cut-and-try iterative developmental testing.  GTL proposes to use this design guideline and the UCDSTM Process to create a clean-sheet design for a new liquid rocket that is inherently stable and compare it to an existing engine.","As a physics-based tool, the UCDS Process is applicable to practically any chemical propulsion systems, including liquid rocket engines, solid rocket motors, turbojets and scramjets.  With UCDS, it is possible to either fix an existing engine that has oscillations or design new engines that are inherently stable.  This will greatly reduce development costs by eliminating the need to rely on expensive cut-and-try testing.  Additionally, UCDS provides the means to explain the dynamic behavior of engine.  This added insight and reduced development risk may lead to great advances in engine performance and capability.","The UCDS Process is equally applicable to NASA and non-NASA chemical propulsion systems, since UCDS is not restricted by propellant type or engine size.  Therefore UCDS can support DoD propulsion development efforts from small storable propellant thrusters to large cryogenic engines to complex tactical interceptor solid rocket motors and many others.  Additionally, UCDS could play a critical role in the commercialization of space by reducing the cost and risk of commercial rocket development.",Chemical; Fundamental Propulsion Physics; Monopropellants; Simulation Modeling Environment

Using actual space suits in training or experimentation is problematic due to the expense, bulk, weight, and difficulty in donning/doffing.  The goal of this project was to demonstrate a novel method for simulating space suit joint torques, which are non-linear and vary with angular position.  We designed a knee joint simulator using McKibben actuators with active control (also known as artificial muscles), which are cylindrical pneumatic actuators constructed of flexible rubber with an inextensible weave that causes the cylinder to contract longitudinally when pressurized.  A commercial knee brace was used as an exoskeleton to mount the actuators.  One actuator was mounted anterior to the knee to provide resistance to flexion, and a second actuator was mounted posterior to the knee to provide resistance to extension.  The active controller read angle input from a potentiometer mounted to the brace and output the appropriate pressures for each actuator to provide the needed torque.  The knee joint was installed on MIT's Robotic Space Suit Tester (RSST), a full-sized anthropometric robot equipped with torque and angle sensors on each of the joints.  Results from testing indicated that the torque vs. angle relationship achieved using the actively controlled spacesuit joint simulator was qualitatively similar to the non-linear trend observed in prior testing of the EMU on the RSST. We conclude that the use of these actuators potentially results in higher fidelity than passive actuation.","The primary customer for this device will be NASA. The timing of this Phase 2 effort is important to facilitate planned microgravity and lunar and martian surface EVA research and training in support of NASA's current vision for future exploration missions. Development of surface operations activities on the moon or Mars will benefit from the support of human testing and training; e.g. what is the metabolic cost of performing specific tasks in partial gravity while wearing a space suit?  Additionally, experimentation in support of development of the future moon/Mars EVA space suit will require human testing; our adjustable space suit simulator joint torques will allow for characterization of various suit configurations in order to optimize the future suit design.  We anticipate that EVA S3 systems will be used to support training and simulation activities at multiple centers including JSC, GRC, and ARC, and that this market will require initial production of 10 to 15 systems.","Joint torque devices such as those developed during this program are useful in medical technologies as orthopedic devices: either restricting motion in order to prevent injury, or providing resistance to motion in order to improve muscle function or promote bone growth.  For example, a controlled resistance suit could be used as an exercise device (e.g. performing squats with a controlled resistance suit rather than with weights) or individual components of the EVA S3 design could be used separately for rehabilitation of specific joints.  Alternately the control scheme can be changed to provide performance augmentation to the wearer.  To support these various markets, the EVA S3 technology is adjustable to accommodate individuals of different heights and weights, is rugged, portable, has low power requirements and is compatible with under water operations.",Suits

The overarching goal of this project is to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool that unobtrusively integrates all available behavioral measures collected during a mission to provide a dashboard of behavioral health indicators. These indicators will be placed within the context of quantitatively-tracked mission stressors to provide meaningful feedback allowing behavioral issues to be detected and mitigated at an early stage. The result of this project will be a system prototype that can be deployed in space analog environments (e.g., Mars 520 study, Antarctica) for validation testing and ultimately deployed in long-duration space exploration missions. The critical need for an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool has been identified as a priority outlined in the BHP Integrated Research Plan (July 2009) gap BMED3. Phase II will achieve: (1) an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitor software interface; (2) a data integration system; (3) a trend and change detection algorithm; and (4) a countermeasure selection aid. The Technology Readiness Level at the end of Phase II will be TRL 6.","The Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool will meet the specific requirements of long duration exploration missions and provide feedback to astronauts, Op Psy Personnel and Flight Surgeons about behavioral health status as well as aid in the selection of countermeasures. It will be designed to be unobtrusive and require minimal crew time or effort to train and utilize. The resulting product will be primarily relevant to NASA's Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) research gaps (as of July 2009): BMED 3 (What are the optimal methods to detect and assess decrements in behavioral health during exploration missions?) but will also be relevant to gaps BMED1, BMED2, BMED6, BMED7, and BMED8. When validated, the Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool will be deployed in long-duration space exploration missions to support crew behavioral health efforts during training, mission and return to Earth.","The Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool can be adapted to meet an articulated need to track behavioral health in occupations associated with high stress, high workload and high danger factor such as military applications and law enforcement. A tool that enables the systematic and efficient tracking of individual behavioral health status in these occupational settings can provide a means to detect and address behavioral disorders and mental conditions at an early stage. Taking military operations as an example, there is evidence that behavioral disorders and mental conditions such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injury have a high prevalence among soldiers. There is a present market opportunity to deliver an Individualized Behavioral Health Monitoring Tool to track changes in behavioral health status in soldiers during training, deployment, and post-deployment.

This tool will be used throughout the design lifecycle, and will provide inputs to engineers and program managers to help them identify and avoid potential human factors problems early in the design process.  It also will provide detailed guidance regarding human factors evaluations, and it will store data and provide feedback on the results of these evaluations.  H-FAST will improve the engineering design process by providing engineers with easy access to detailed human factors methods, relevant research, and subject matter expert contact information.  This will empower engineers to create more usable systems, thus reducing the number of design iterations and resulting in higher-quality products.","H-FAST will provide a tool to support the engineering design process at NASA JSC.  As such, it will be populated with human factors requirements and guidelines related to the design of systems for space exploration.  The design patterns and methods will be chosen to support particular design issues related to NASA JSC missions.  H-FAST will also provide a modular framework that can be customized to a variety of NASA engineering projects.  By including relevant requirements, guidelines, methods, and design patterns, NASA project managers will be able to customize H-FAST for their particular application.  We expect that H-FAST can be used to support space vehicle design projects; ground systems, such as mission control center designs; and flight deck design projects at NASA Ames and Langley.Human-inthe-loop research conducted at any NASA facility will provide relevant input to H-FAST.  The technical reports and white papers will populate the library of H-FAST, and provide all NASA engineering H-FAST users with access to relevant human factors research results. H-FAST will provide a customizable tool to support a diverse range of engineering design projects with human performance implications.  Examples include ergonomic design of large complex systems, human-computer interface design, control design, display layout.","Department of Defense Applications:  We anticipate that H-FAST will provide a useful, nearly directly-usable tool for other agencies involved in large scale system acquisition.  A key example is the Department of Defense (DoD).  They, like NASA, are concerned with identifying and verifying human performance requirements in complex systems.  They too would benefit from a tool that improves the design process by giving engineers tools and guidance to perform preliminary human factors assessments.  For DoD customers, it would be necessary to include more Military Standard (MIL-STD) guidelines, project-specific requirements, and verification methods, to identify relevant design patterns for military applications, and to link to military-relevant research sources (e.g., Army Research Laboratory, Office of Naval Research).  However, the basic framework provided by H-FAST would be readily usable by DoD customers.Entrepreneur Center Application: Another possible non-NASA commercial application of H-FAST would be as a market validation tool for an Entrepreneur/Business Incubation Center.

Compared to current and prospective alternatives (including microchannels), the reactor will be much smaller and lighter, more energy and resource efficient, and more durable. In the spacecraft cabin atmosphere revitalization system (ARS), the utilization of CO2 to produce life support consumables, such as O2 and H2O, via Sabatier process as part of the CO2 Reduction Assembly (CRA) is an important function for both low-earth orbit and long-term manned space explorations, and also has application for lunar/Martian ISRU concepts.  The maturation of this technology will significantly reduce launch weight requirements and the need of re-supply from Earth.  Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) proposes to build on Phase 1 proof of concept success to develop, demonstrate, and deliver an integrated MicrolithREG-based ground test Sabatier reactor Development Unit (SDU) for CO2 reduction, with collaborative support from a systems integrator. The SDU will convert CO2 and H2 to methane and water, achieving close-to-equilibrium CO2 conversions at high throughputs and at low operating temperatures (≤350oC). Major systems integrator participation will help guide the program.  TRL is now 4 and will be advanced to 5.","CO2 Reduction System/Methanation: Precision Combustion's Sabatier reactor will create oxygen in cabin closed-loop atmosphere revitalization systems (ARS) and Lunar/Martian ISRU concepts that are key for sustained space missions. The technology will provide an ultra-compact, high efficiency catalytic CO2 methanation reactor for converting cabin air or lunar/Mars-sourced CO2 with H2 to methane and water vapor, the latter for use with an electrolyzer to generate O2 for spacecraft cabin ARS and mobile EVA applications.  The methane can be used as fuel, e.g. for surface operations or return thrust, or for other chemicals manufacture in advanced ISRU applications.  Technology variants of the Microlith reactor may emerge for other ISRU manufacturing.  The technology's minimized size and maximized efficiency and durability will significantly reduce launch weight for long missions, and offers high value added for NASA","The technology offers a potential breakthrough that can also be integrated with process intensification techniques.  Targeted non-NASA applications for a Microlith chemicals reactor include methanation reactors to be used in conjunction with solid oxide or molten carbonate fuel cells for power production, improved Haber process operations for producing ammonia for fertilizer or ammunition, and the general case of selectivity-sensitive chemicals manufacturing where temperature control and the unique Microlith geometry may offer advantages (including production of formaldehyde and methanol, and biogas conversion).  Some of these processes currently require very large capital investments in large plants, allowing potential for a small, effective and selective reactor to find targeted applications of value.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning

We propose to subcontract Hamilton-Sundstrand Human Space Systems (H-S) to share unique state-of-the-art technologies that provide the best path to meeting program objectives.  GES will share their data and expertise with high balanced pressure electrolyzers and H-S will contribute their data and expertise in high differential pressure electrolyzer systems. Based on the high pressure anode design concept developed in Phase I, GES will further develop the electrolyzer cell and stack design.  In parallel, H-S will develop the key subsystem and control components for a brassboard balance of plant.  The program will culminate in the fabrication, assembly, and demonstration of a brassboard high oxygen pressure generation system.","NASA is charged with returning humans to the moon in a permanently occupied lunar station. This mission will require astronauts to conduct extravehicular activities while en route to the moon, and while on the lunar surface. To operate in these environments, the astronauts need an on-site source of pressurized oxygen to refill empty tanks. A very-high-pressure PEM water electrolyzer is proposed that can produce a minimum of 3,600 psi oxygen and hydrogen without the need for high-pressure pumps and/or compressors. A very-high-pressure water electrolyzer will permit smaller launch volumes, saving space aboard the Orion crew exploration vehicle. The electrolyzer might also be useful for the production of hydrogen and oxygen for space vehicle propulsion, enabling missions to Mars. Other electrolyzers of similar designs may be used to produce oxygen and hydrogen for energy storage purposes in regenerative fuel cells on the lunar and Martian surfaces. Other electrolyzers may be used for generation of oxygen on the lunar surface without a net consumption of water through in situ resource utilization (ISRU). By making all of these electrolyzers compatible with one another, if not identical, it may be possible for NASA to save significant development resources while improving astronaut life support safety margins by increasing redundancy.",Quiet and compact oxygen generators may be useful for Navy SEAL missions.  Such electrolyzers as closed-loop regenerative fuel cells are potential battery substitutes for applications that require high energy density.  Several agencies of the U.S. Government and several private businesses are engaged in development of long-endurance aircraft and airships.  The high-pressure electrolyzer developed under this proposed program may be applicable to these vehicles.  Large-scale power storage via regenerative fuel cells may have terrestrial applications in telecommunications and other industries that require uninterruptible power supplies.,Composites; Energy Storage; In-situ Resource Utilization; Metallics; Microgravity; Portable Life Support; Suits

The HEHO-PMWC system incorporates novel methods to compress the trash, recover water, and remove the resultant plastic tiles. This system requires access to power, data, and cooling interfaces. The system is suitable for recovering water and compacting all trash sources on the ISS. The system has also been designed to recover water from brine solutions produced by primary wastewater processing systems. The HEHO-PMWC works by heating and compressing trash simultaneously to first remove water and then to melt plastic in the trash. The melted plastic encapsulates the trash into a 16 inch square tile, approximately ½ inch thick. The square tile is easier to store than a round tile and is a more effective radiation shield.  Variables such as transport vehicle availability, ISS mass, power and space availability, and ISS cooling capabilities were considered. The resulting HEHO-PWMC system, proposed here, was sized to process 3-4 kg of trash per batch while operating three times per day.","The primary NASA application of this technology is for any long-duration human spaceflight mission, including microgravity and planetary surface operations. Besides the primary benefits of the HEHO-PMWC, which include waste volume reduction and water recovery, secondary benefits include additional health benefits from completely encapsulating the final compacted waste product, ultimately deterring microbial elements from entering the breathable airstream, and the plastic tile byproduct, which is high in polyethylene, can be used as an effective radiation barrier. The conceptual design for the Phase II was designed for implementation on the ISS, but the design can be easily modified for various waste model loads and mission architectures.","The HEHO-PWMC will be a valuable system for commercial space vehicles and modules. A system that reduces waste volume, recovers water, and creates a useful byproduct can be a boon for commercial aerospace companies trying to reduce overall mission costs. The benefits of HEHO-PMWC are immediately known for LEO destination providers such as Bigelow Aerospace. With inflatables, no inherent radiation shielding is present on the outside diameter of the module; so radiation shielding (i.e., water) must be added post-inflation. The HEHO-PMWC would reduce the amount of water that must be launched by producing radiation tiles from trash. The PMWC could produce enough tiles to shield the entire module in less than a year. The recovered water could also function as a radiation barrier. The HEHO-PMWC would provide an effective and efficient waste management system, provide necessary radiation shielding products, assist in maintaining a clean environment, and minimize launch costs.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Inflatable; Radiation Shielding Materials; Waste Processing and Reclamation

The Phase II effort will build upon the successful Phase I feasibility demonstration and identify rate-limiting factors for contaminant oxidation identified in the best Phase I AOCs.  A new series of combinatorial catalysts will be prepared with the goal to systematically improve catalyst performance.  Improvements will focus on contaminant and reaction byproduct adsorption, mass transfer resistances, and reaction rate limitations associated with noble metal concentration, dispersion, and support interaction.  A second-generation combinatorial library with 102 AOCs will be prepared based on this analysis.  Oxidation activity will then be compared using a difficult to oxidize ersatz solution containing contaminants known to occur in the current U.S. water processor aboard the ISS.  These tests will select the best AOC based upon analysis of oxidation kinetics.  This AOC will undergo long-term testing to verify performance.  Scale-up activities will follow, resulting in a full-scale, deliverable prototype.  The advanced AOC will lower water processor ESM and provide multiple commercial opportunities.","The NASA application for this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future, long duration exploration objectives beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) were efficient water recovery will play a critical role in reducing ECLSS logistics. The ability to mineralize organic contaminants present in effluents from current and future primary water processors at low temperature and pressure is an extremely valuable technology.  Reduction in power usage, improvement in safety and reliability, and lower maintenance requirements are highly valued characteristics of this technology that will lower ESM for current and future water reclamation processes used aboard spacecraft and within lunar and planetary habitats.","Commercialization of this technology has many opportunities in environmental remediation, semiconductor production, and pharmaceutical industries as well as consumer products.  AOCs that oxidize organic contaminants at low temperatures can be used to clean-up wastewater or groundwater, or for the production of ultra-pure water.  AOCs are extremely attractive for in situ environmental clean-up using a pump and treat system, where energy usage must be minimized.  Current ultra-pure water production systems are limited to specific oxidation technologies and will be challenged by more stringent requirements in the next generation semiconductor fabrication facility.  Low temperature non-specific oxidation processes will help meet these water quality standards in a cost-effective manner.",Waste Processing and Reclamation

In order to attain these goals, we will use three sets of preconcentrators, columns, and detectors in parallel, each with the appropriate selectivity for a given class of gases.  Light gases will use a packed column, and polar and non-polar gases with their respective stationary phases. The prototype micro-GC/FID will comprise preconcentrators with fast injection valves, microcolumns to separate different gas analytes, an air sampling pump, a water-hydrolysis hydrogen generator to provide enough oxygen and hydrogen for a micro-flame ionization detector, thermal management, controls and circuit board to drive the system.","If we are successful through Phase II, we will demonstrate that the Cbana microGCs can detect a broad range of contaminants in spacecraft air without needing externally supplied reagents.   The devices will increase the number of contaminants that can be detected now and lower the need for unstable reagents or calibration mixtures.   Further, the microGC's will be small enough and light enough, and be energy efficient enough to be included in Extravehicular Mobility Units.","The microGCs have a wealth of potential commercial opportunities.  Examples include: indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring and remediation, industrial pollution containment and elimination, narcotics detection, cargo monitoring, explosives detection, and lung cancer screening.

Experiments with microbial samples commonly found in space water environment were undertaken to demonstrate component functionality and to establish proof-of-concept of the proposed technology. In Phase 2, efforts will focus along two lines. First, component design optimization will be carried out with fabrication enhancements and extended testing and characterization for technology validation. Second, an integrated microfluidic cartridge and instrumentation capable of automated operation (sample processing and detection) will be developed. The prototype instrument will be demonstrated in both terrestrial and hypogravity environments (in collaboration with NASA researchers/facilities).

The QCL will be specially designed and fabricated for minimum power consumption. In Phase 1 the QCL was incorporated into the WMS platform and tested on a breadboard level. The breadboard sensor demonstrated the necessary dynamic range and easily surpassed the required minimum sensitivity. A Phase II prototype design was made based on the Phase I results for which dynamic range, sensitivity, SWaP, and operation with a high degree of reliability, minimal maintenance, and self-calibration under varying humidity and ambient pressures are primary design features. The sensor prototype will be tested in a relevant environment with controlled burns at a NASA test facility.

The objective of this Phase II project is to continue the engineering development of heat and flame-resistant crew clothing (FRECLOTM) to satisfy NASA needs.  FRECLO consists of InnoSense LLC (ISL) proprietary phosphorus-containing flame-retardant (FR) formulations permanently treated on synthetic, natural or blended fabrics as well as on the readymade garments. Phase I demonstrated the NASA use potential. Upon exposure to flame, FRECLO fabrics formed a carbonaceous char layer preventing further fire or heat-induced damage to the fabric. ISL's FR treatments are devoid of halogens, making the process environmentally-friendly and eliminating toxic byproducts during combustion. In Phase II, ISL will: (1) Optimize and scale-up FRECLO treatments, (2) Fine-tune FR formulations and application methods for performance optimization, (3) Perform rigorous evaluation of the treated fabrics, and (4) Evaluate off-gassing and biocompatibility of the treated fabrics. ISL has committed $100K as Phase II co-funding and has secured $300K as Phase III follow-on funding commitment from an industrial partner for successful technology transition.  Large NASA prime contractors have strongly endorsed the FR materials.","NASA's vision for the future focuses on missions beyond the Earth's orbit to Mars and throughout the Solar System. This vision will involve long duration, manned missions for which durable, easily customizable, and non-toxic FR clothing will be very important. While inherently-nonflammable fabrics are available in the marketplace, they do not offer the desired breathability, comfort, safety, ease of customization, and wardrobe flexibility to satisfy everyday needs of NASA astronauts. NASA's Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) division is actively searching for new technologies to produce crew clothing to meet the following requirements: (1) Sufficient comfort and breathability for everyday use in all types of clothing pieces, and (2) Ease of customization to permit creation of clothing with various colors, textures and weights for individual preferences of the crew, and (3) Resistance to multiple cycles of machine washing and drying, which may be required for long-duration missions. The FR treatments being optimized in this project aim to satisfy these needs. FR-treated fabrics also have potential applications in upholstery, bedding, and other textiles requiring low flammability for use in space habitats and exploratory vehicles.","Flammability is a severe limitation for electronics, transportation vehicles, buildings, furniture and clothing articles. ISL's phosphorus-based FR materials can be incorporated into fabrics used in apparel, protective clothing, curtains, drapes, upholstery, bedding, carpets, tents and transportation gear (seat and wall coverings, belts, etc) for NASA and the industrial/commercial sectors. FR garments are used by firefighters, electrical workers, especially foundry workers, and military personnel. Uniforms for firefighters and high-risk military crew commonly utilize Nomex or other high performance fibers. The ability to provide the military with cost-effective alternatives would be significant. Because currently, these materials are only utilized for soldiers engaged in specialized missions at a high risk of catastrophic fire injury. ISL's FRECLO technology would meet this need.

The target application was to provide heat rejection for the ascent module of the Altair lunar lander vehicle during the lunar ascent mission phase. However, in order to provide heat rejection for the ascent module during the rest of the mission, it is desirable to keep the ascent module integrated with the fluid loop in the rest of the Altair vehicle. Therefore, we propose an Integrated Sublimator Driven Coldplate (ISDC) that can function as both a standard flow-through cold plate and a Sublimator Driven Coldplate. The ISDC builds on the original SDC concept by adding coolant layers so that it can be integrated with the pumped fluid loop on the rest of the vehicle. This approach provides mass savings by (1) combining multiple pieces of hardware into a single piece of hardware and (2) providing additional fault tolerance without the need for redundant hardware.","This SBIR could directly impact the current program of record, primarily the Altair Lunar Lander; in particular the ascent module. However, other NASA applications could benefit from this research program as well. For example, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle may see similar benefits as those described above for Altair. Instead of an ascent module and descent module on Altair, Orion has a crew module and a service module. Just like the Altair ascent module separates from the descent module before lifting off of the lunar surface, the Orion crew module separates from the service module before re-entering Earth's atmosphere. Alternatively, if Orion evolves into an ISS lifeboat, the vehicles primary mission would be a return to Earth profile in which the Orion stages from the ISS.  Because of the analogous arrangement of these modules, Orion may see similar mass and reliability benefits from an ISDC due to combining multiple functions into one piece of hardware and/or strategic location of various components between the two modules and the associated ""gear ratios"" for launch propellant.  Due to the benefits for short duration missions, this SBIR could directly impact the upper stages of small, medium, and heavy launch vehicles as well as boost stages for high altitude orbits.  In addition, many of the planned technology demonstration missions will require simple, safe, and reliable platforms in which the ISDC would assist in reducing the weight and complexity.","In addition to NASA space vehicles, commercial space vehicles may benefit from this technology as well. Paragon has been working with a number of commercial space companies to design their thermal control systems. Due to the nature of the vehicles and their concept of operations, coldplates and sublimators almost always end up being included in these systems along with a pumped fluid loop. The same mass and reliability improvements discussed previously may potentially be applied to these commercial space vehicles as well.",Cooling; Reuseable

Many of the processes for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) produce water, along with a variety of acid gases and other water soluble contaminants.  Paragon proposes to develop membrane technology to separate water vapor from contaminants in the ISRU systems.   The water vapor can then be processed using Paragon's demonstrated Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) technology to produce pure gaseous oxygen for life support and/or propulsion.  The membrane and SOE subsystem has no moving parts, require no regeneration or resupply of subcomponents over component life time, rely on only single phase physics, and work independent of gravity.In Phase 1, Paragon demonstrated the potential of the membrane technology for use in the treatment of contaminated gas streams.  Preliminary results indicate that the membrane is capable of generating a purified water vapor stream by extracting it from a second stream contaminated with hydrogen chloride gas as produced in lunar ISRU systems. In Phase 2, Paragon will perform the following: (1) Confirm lunar & Martian contaminants; (2) Predict performance and derive operating conditions / interface requirements of membrane and SOE units in ISRU systems via system analyses; (3) Experimentally verify impermeability of membrane to contaminants; (4) Demonstrate membrane performance does not hinder SOE performance through integrated testing; (5) Develop / test full scale membrane unit that meets ISRU requirements; and (6) Deliver additional membrane unit to NASA.  At the end of the Phase 2 effort, Paragon aims to show that the membrane is impermeable to ISRU contaminants and integrates well with SOE.   The technology will be advanced to a TRL of near 4 by designing / building a full scale unit that demonstrates water extraction at requirements specific to ISRU oxygen production systems.","The proposed technology development can be applied to ISRU oxygen production systems on both the Moon and Mars.  The membrane will remove acid contaminants from a moist stream received directly from a lunar regolith hydrogen reduction reactor or Martian water ice.  This contaminant-free water stream can then be delivered directly to a high temperature solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) unit to produce pure, dry oxygen for life support consumables or surface exploration / Earth return propellant.  The membrane technology can also be applied to processes where water needs to be separated from methane. Specific NASA examples include down stream of Sabatier reactors used in air revitalization systems, and lunar regolith methane reduction systems.  In all, the water is separated and sent to an electrolyzer to recycle hydrogen and produce oxygen as a consumable.  Finally, the membrane technology can be applied in bio-waste processing to separate water vapor from a contaminated stream as a step in the overall clean up process.SOE is currently being developed as a technology for air revitalization systems, enabling 100% oxygen regeneration from human metabolic byproducts alone. As SOE can electrolyze CO2 as well as H2O, SOE can also potentially be used in other lunar regolith reduction systems that use carbon monoxide or methane as the reducing agent.","The non-NASA applications and spin off of this technology development are significant.  This technology is part of Paragon's recent efforts to develop a space flight air revitalization system for commercial spacecraft.  That work is partially funded through a Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) Space Act Agreement with NASA.  It provides a no-moving-part water removal system that can address the spacecraft water accumulation problem without using complex condensing heat exchangers or mass- and crew- intensive desiccant.  More directly related, terrestrial based applications of Solid Oxide Electrolysis (and its other function as a solid oxide fuel cell) also are threatened by contaminants such as sulfuric acid.  The membrane and SOE units developed under this contact may be used in carbon sequestration and oxygen reclamation systems installed in petroleum refining plants.",Air Revitalization and Conditioning; In-situ Resource Utilization

The instruments will also prove useful for in situ surface analysis.  The first instrument (Instrument #1), based on fast extractive sampling, will record measurements of several important gas-phase constituents in regolith processing facilities with extraordinarily high sensitivity, accuracy and specificity in real time.  This instrument will integrate directly into NASA's hydrogen and carbothermal reduction test facilities at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The measurement quantities of interest include the concentrations of HF, HCl, H2S, O2, H2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, and H2O isotopes (H2HO or HDO and H218O).  The second instrument (Instrument #2) will provide measurements of H2O concentrations and gas temperature directly in the high temperature reactive flow and prior to hydrolysis. The third instrument (Instrument #3) will provide accurate quantification of the aforementioned gases in a compact, low-power form factor suitable for integration into the Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) project.  This analyzer will be used to study both thermal desorption and hydrogen reduction of extraplanetary regolith.","Future NASA extraplanetary exploration missions will require in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies to manufacture fuels, life support gases, and minerals.  One of key NASA technologies involves the processing of extraplanetary regolith to produce H2O and O2.  This oxygen can then be used as a propellant or for habitation.  NASA requires several diagnostics to assess the validity and viability of ISRU technologies.  Foremost, the final oxygen product must be analyzed to determine the trace contaminant levels.  This analysis will provide information regarding the regolith composition, sorbent efficacy, and sorbent aging.  Additionally, in-situ measurements of gas composition and temperature in the hot reactor or downstream of the sorbent bed are required to monitor the efficiency and dynamics of reduction process.  Finally, NASA is targeting robotic lunar mission that include the Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen and Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) project.  This project necessitates the deployment of a lightweight, low-power gas analyzer.  The proposed miniature Phase II prototype can complement existing technology to provide additional and verifying data.  In addition to NASA's regolith processing monitoring needs, several other NASA programs can benefit from the technologies developed in this SBIR program, including the Hypersonic Airbreathing Propulsion Branch, the NASA Astrobiology Program, and the NASA Astronaut Health Monitoring Program.","Besides its application to NASA, laser-based gas analyzers also have significant commercial application.  Through several strategic partnerships, LGR is developing a suite of analytical instrumentation to measure trace gases for industrial process control, energy exploration, and military applications.  The proposed work is essential in making these instruments more compact, rugged, and cost competitive, and will thus enlarge the potential market size significantly.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Optical

Unlike state-of-the-art carbothermal reactors that use concentrated solar energy and/or laser energy to heat the regolith, the ACE Reactor uses an innovative method to electrically heat the regolith to temperatures over 1800ºC within a thermally insulted environment, either with or without a crucible. Commercial high-temperature heating elements made from molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) are designed to only operate in oxidizing atmospheres where a protective layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) will form. In Phase 1, the ACE reactor used MoSi2 heating elements with a protective coating to allow them to operate in any type of environment (oxidizing, reducing, or vacuum). The ACE Reactor concept eliminates the problems encountered with traditional carbothermal hot-wall reactors and offers significant advantages over current carbothermal reactor approaches. By eliminating the need for a concentrated solar energy system, the ACE reactor offers a significantly lowers system mass and removes the need to keep optical surfaces clean. In addition to efficiently producing oxygen, the ACE reactor separates the processed regolith into metallic iron and a silicate glass that can be formed into structural components or shielding materials.","The purpose of ISRU is to harness and utilize resources at the site of exploration to create products and services which can enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration. In particular, the ability to make propellants, life support consumables, fuel cell reagents, and radiation shielding can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. The ACE Reactor will meet this need by efficiently producing oxygen, metallic iron and glass from regolith. The oxygen produced could satisfy the needs of EVA, life support, and propulsion applications including orbital propellant depots. The metallic iron or silicate glass could be poured into molds to make building components, radiation shielding materials, or spare parts.","The development of ACE reactor is clearly focused on supporting the needs of the NASA human exploration program. However, there are several commercial companies making significant progress towards spaceflight, including Bigelow Aerospace, Scaled Composites, and Space-X. There are significant cost/propulsive savings associated with obtaining oxygen from local regolith versus bringing it from Earth, and systems have been proposed to use lunar oxygen to resupply vehicles anywhere from LEO down to the lunar surface. As commercial flight systems mature, the ACE reactor could provide an economical source of oxygen. In addition, the innovative electric resistance heaters developed for the ACE reactor could have a significant commercial market as the first high-temperature heating elements that can operate in oxidizing, reducing, and/or vacuum environments.",In-situ Resource Utilization

In the LOWR, solar thermal concentrators are used to heat steam directly to 600 C, after which the steam is mixed with a small amount of oxygen and injected into a reactor which is being fed with waste materials via a lock hopper. At the high temperatures, the oxygenated steam will react with all organic materials to produce a gas mixture largely composed of hydrogen, CO and carbon dioxide. After removing the remaining steam from the product stream via condensation, the gases are dusulfurized and then fed to a catalytic reactor where they can be combined with hydrogen to produce methane, methanol, or other fuels.  Both the necessary hydrogen and oxygen for the process can be produced by electrolysis of part of the water content of the waste material, which is extracted from the wastes directly by the reformer itself. With effective recycling of the steam, no consumables are lost in the process. All products are liquids or gases, making the system highly reliable and subject to automation. In the proposed Phase 2 program, Pioneer Astronautics will build a full-scale end-to-end LOWR system capable of turning 10 kg of waste per day into methane and oxygen.","The LOWR can be a key component of the lunar exploration program by allowing available power sources to enable production of oxygen and fuel on a sufficient scale to significantly reduce Lunar base logistic requirements. Depending upon the rocket propulsion and transportation system employed, the fuel produced by the LOWR from recycled waste can comprise between 50% and 100% of a fuel required to operate a lunar ascent vehicle used to transport crew from the Lunar surface to orbit. The oxygen produced can also comprise a substantial fraction of all oxidizer required by a lunar ascent vehicle system, thereby minizizing further the propellant mass that needs to be transported at great expense from Earth, or alternatively, greatly reducing the mass and power requirements of a system designed to extract oxygen from lunar regolith.  Therefore, the ability to produce fuel and oxygen in quantity on the lunar surface can have a major role in reducing total program costs. The LOWR is not limited to Lunar applications. It can be used on the Martian surface, or on any long duration piloted spacecraft, including the International Space Station or any deep space crewed vehicle used for example on human missions to Near Earth asteroids or Mars. In such latter applications it offers great advantages as a means of transforming crew wastes into useful propellants that can be used to enable station keeping, mid-course corrections, or other deep space maneuvers.","The Lunar Organic Waste Recycler can also be a valuable tool wherever organic wastes or other low cost biomass are available for conversion to synthesis gas. Corn stover, for example, is currently available commercially in large quantities for $40/tonne. If converted into synthesis gas, each tonne of corn stover can provide enough carbon monoxide and to make about 700 kg of methanol, which at current spot market prices would sell for about $200. Methanol is currently used as a major commodity in the chemical industry and could be used a motor vehicle fuel in flex fuel cars. The LOWR could similarly be used to transform other crop and forestry residues, as well as urban paper, plastic, and metabolic wastes into synthesis gas for production of methane or liquid hydrocarbon fuels via Fischer Tropsch processes. Thus LOWR technology could become the basis for highly profitable industries which make a significant contribution towards the vital national goal of freeing the nation from its dependence on foreign oil.The LOWR can be built on a modest scale making it readily transportable by truck, ship, or airplane. This makes it ideal for use in remote locations such as military outposts or third world villages which need to obtain fuel without ready access to ordinary commercial suppliers. Methane from remotely operated LOWR-derived units could be used to generate power in on site gas turbines, for motor vehicle fuel, or for cooking or other purposes",Biochemical Conversion; Chemical; Earth-Supplied Resource Utilization; In-situ Resource Utilization; Renewable Energy; Waste Processing and Reclamation

The radiation species of greatest interest are light ions (particularly protons), heavy ions (such as iron-56) and neutrons. International Scientific Technologies, Inc., in conjunction with the College of William and Mary, in its Phase I program developed lightweight, multi-layered, polymeric shielding against GCR and SEP.  The Phase II objectives include analysis and design of single and multi-layered nanocomposite polymeric radiation shields using OLTARIS modeling protocols to supplement the empirical results of Phase I, fabrication of nanocomposite films and multi-layered structures, acquisition of families of test data to determine key parameters of single and multi-layered structures tailored to stopping GCR and SEP, optimization of prototype multi-layered polymeric shields using statistical design and OLTARIS modeling for a range of manned and unmanned NASA applications prior to commercialization in Phase III.  The anticipated result of the Phase I and Phase II programs is the development of multi-layered shields with an outer layer of hydrogenous polymeric material for significant dose reduction of incident GCR ions and inner layers of polymeric composites containing additives chosen to moderate and absorb neutrons resulting from fragmentation of incoming heavy ions and to absorb short wavelength electromagnetic radiation resulting from the slowing of the GCR particles and capture of neutrons.  The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the beginning of Phase II is 4. At the end of Phase II, the TRL will be 5.","The proposed multilayered multifunctional high performance polymers, films, coatings and additives will find application in NASA missions in protecting astronauts and sensitive optical, electronic, thermal and acoustic components from space hazards, including radiation, dust and thermal transients, while, at the same time, providing lightweight structures for planetary rovers and habitats.  It is expected that these multi-layered systems will provide a high-performance-to-weight radiation shield that can be used within human habitats, spacecraft and protective apparel.  Other missions supported by NASA could also make use of the multifunctional materials for the International Space Station or in other orbiting vehicles involving long-duration small dose exposure.","Lightweight multifunctional radiation shielding will find application in the commercial (e.g., hospitals and nuclear power plants) and defense (e.g., nuclear-powered ships and surveillance satellites) sectors.  The shields will provide protection for homeland security first responders employed by law enforcement agencies, fire departments and hospitals.  It is also expected that the shielding can be fabricated into temporary shelters used by defense personnel and considered for use in the protection of individuals in case of  nuclear or radiological events.

The design approach holds the promise of a much simpler expandable structure that is both lightweight and compactable (low delivery volume) and yet capable of extending into an expansive volume.  FSC research supports the utilization of a new class of deployable, space-based structures that utilize an advanced folding methodology as the primary engineering and assembly method combined with the use of both single and multi-laminate sheet materials.  The proprietary patterning algorithms create tessellations for planar sheets that articulate dynamically on the edges of the tessellation allowing for uniform deployment across the entire sheet.  Previous to the development of these algorithms, there was no general system for generating doubly periodic folded structures.  Based on results from a previous NASA SBIR project, FSC will apply its proprietary folding techniques and software to the broad topic of expandable habitat structures.  The Phase I project has resulted in a design concept for the expandable bladder section of the proposed lunar habitat that also integrates the flooring into a single deployable structure.","The innovative folding method will make possible a technical break-through in tessellated architectures for expandable structures for planetary habitat applications.  The new technology offers diverse capacity to design, manufacture, and self-assemble doubly periodically folded sheet material into structures that are lighter and more compactable than provided by current engineering practices.  Some space-based applications include solar arrays, parabolic reflectors, sun and radiation shielding and extendable masts and booms.  In addition to inflatable architectures, other strategies (including solar heating/radiation, elastic memory, and mechanical force) can be employed for self-activating and sustaining the unfolding process.","Material folding lends itself to a number of applications from very sophisticated (aerospace) to the ordinary such as packaging materials.  Kraft paper cores based on the folding techniques could yield a superior product to corrugated cardboard.  Multi-layer blocks made from recyclable materials could replace Styrofoam for use in space filling and shock absorbing.  For aerospace using aluminum or composite materials, the folded structures could improve upon the existing honeycomb cores, which are used throughout the airplane in the floors, luggage compartments, and wings.  For the transportation industry, aluminum or steel folded tessellations in flat laminated panels could be used for high strength but lightweight truck beds.  Folded materials could be specifically designed for automobile floors to give a resilient strength to the frame while also serving to dampen the overall vibrations of the automobile.  The lightweight strength and energy absorbing properties are also suited for bumpers, hoods, and crash protecting car doors.  On highways, new crash barriers may be possible because of their low cost and high-energy absorption.",Composites; Erectable; Inflatable; Kinematic-Deployable; Radiation Shielding Materials

These structures will provide a rigid, durable habitat that will reduce the risk of mechanical failure due to crew or environmentally induced damage compared with inflatable structures that are more susceptible to punctures and damage from micrometeoroid impacts. Veritex is a composite material consisting of common reinforcement fibers, such as e-glass, carbon, Kevlar(R), or high-strain capable fabrics, and one of CRG's shape memory polymers (SMP). Veritex materials will return to a memorized shape when raised above a specific activation temperature. This unique feature enables the use of Veritex(TM) as a primary lunar structure for its predictability and repeatability, which will offer quick, self-deploying lunar habitat that can return to a rigid enclosure after the deployment process. The development of expanding composite habitats will offer increased packing efficiency compared with fully rigid structures that lack expandable characteristics and waste valuable cargo space.

Notable features such as low weight, large inflated operational volume, and small pre-deployment volume offer significant advantages over traditional rigid metallic and composite habitat structures. Conventional designs suffer from indeterminacy of load sharing between meridional and circumferential members as well as the internally rigid metal support structure. The designs must functionally index the meridional and circumferential members to one another to minimize sensitivity to manufacturing, handling and operational trauma, all the while maintaining their independent load carrying roles. This design process results in oversized members to account for load uncertainties and substantially increases the handling, manufacturing, and integration risks.  The unique Ultra High Performance Vessel (UHPV) technology provides the solution to the design and manufacture of robust inflatable structures with exceptional accuracy and dimensional stability. UHPV technology provides high shell load containment architecture with fully determinate load pathways that can be modeled mathematically. The lightweight, low cost inflatable fabric structure, consisting of barrier film layers, carrier cloth containment layers, and pressure restraint tendons can be designed and fabricated to provide an accurate geometry without the need for an internal skeletal frame. Eliminating the need for a rigid internal load-bearing frame allows the collapsed inflatable to be packaged in the smallest possible volume. To bring this innovative inflatable design to use for surface habitats, airlocks and myriad other space environment and containment applications, a verification and validation plan using both testing and predictive analytical models is proposed to conclusively demonstrate that the fully load-determinate UHPV can meet all structural design requirements thereby allowing for decreased mass and risk.","The potential post NASA applications are lunar/ Martian surface system habitats, airlocks and other crewed vessels, deployable antenna reflectors and radiators, solar collectors, solar sails, payload fairings, water storage tanks, cryogenic propellant tanks, greenhouse enclosures, debris shields, radiation shields, re-entry vehicles, large telescopes, propellant depots, rover vehicles, orbital debris removal systems, emergency escape vehicle (ISS), and Martian air ships.","The potential Non-NASA commercial applications are air bags, high altitude air ships, aerostats, compressed air energy storage. underwater habitat, underwater emergency escape system (submarine), portable storage tanks for oil transport, remote fuel depot stations, remote water storage tanks for forest fire control, cargo lift balloons, large, deep space antenna reflector for ground stations, antenna radome, emergency shelters, and troop shelters with integrated ballistic protection.",Airlocks/Environmental Interfaces; Composites; Computational Materials; Inflatable; Propellant Storage; Simulation Modeling Environment; Structural Modeling and Tools; Testing Facilities; Testing Requirements and Architectures

The objective of this SBIR project is to develop advanced high microcrack-resistant composite cryotanks.  In Phase I we successfully demonstrated the synthesis of functionalized graphene sheet (FGS) nanofillers in large scale, which exhibited significantly increased resin strength and toughness at both room and low temperatures, and reduced coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).  The further investigation of nanocomposite formulation and composite processing can result in FGS-polymer nanocomposite based carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with significantly enhanced microcrack resistance at cryogenic temperatures in ways it has never done before.  The new nanocomposite based CFRP composite materials also provide additional advantages in forming an impermeable barrier to gas and liquid molecules ideal for fuel tanks.

Many of the new out-of-autoclave prepreg systems can be used to manufacture high quality composites initially but the lay-up time for producing quality parts is limited by the short shelf-life at ambient conditions.  The resin advancement, due to long lay-up times, commonly causes variations in fiber volume and higher void content in the cured structures.  Also, current out-of-autoclave prepreg systems do not provide the same level of performance, especially damage tolerance, as many current autoclave cured prepreg systems.  It is the objective of this work to develop a matrix and prepreg system for out-of-autoclave processing that possesses a year plus shelf-life while also providing an excellent balance of composite properties and damage tolerance.  As an additional functionality, the out-of-autoclave prepreg system will be developed to have inherent skin-core self adhesive characteristics so that film adhesives may not be required for designs with honeycomb structures.  It is expected that the TRL will be 6 at the end of this Phase 2 program.","The successful completion of this research program will enable the development of high quality large composite structures that are produced out-of-autoclave and require long lay-up times.

There are many cost advantages that will result from this specific technology for producing high performance composites including no autoclave capital equipment or consumables, no freezer storage (year plus shelf-life at ambient temperature), more damage tolerant structures (less repairs), and the possibility of no film adhesives required for honeycomb structures (lower weight and cost).

The proposed technology developed at Integrated Micro Sensors Inc is based on laser-assisted fabrication of Micro Column Arrays (MCA) on the surface of the two materials prior to bonding. There are several advantages of the MCA technology in the drastic improvement of any bond: (i) mechanical strength increases due to interlocking of the adhesive or brazing material between micro columns, (ii) the bond strength increases due to the increase of the specific surface area by more than an order of magnitude, (iii) stability increases due to the inherent elasticity of the micro cones during a deformation, (iv) increase in the bond durability because of the repeated bend contours of the surface preventing hydrothermal failure, (v) wettability of the material surface significantly improves due to the highly developed surface morphology at the micro and submicron level and changes in local chemistry as a result of surface oxidation. Based on the feasibility proven in the Phase I project, this Phase II project will focus on implementation of the proposed technology for newest materials developed up to date and scaling of the proposed technology to large area and complex shape FRP composite structural joints. The investigation of the approach based on using the bond interface electrical properties for joint health monitoring initiated in the Phase I project, will be further developed into viable transducer device concepts.","Aerospace applications require novel and reliable material systems and structures to meet the increasing requirements of innovative designs. Lightweight composite materials have a high potential for applications in the areas of increased payload, reduced costs, and better survivability. Subsonic, supersonic, and especially hypersonic thrusts pose an extraordinary challenge for structures and materials. The airframe and engine require lightweight, materials and structural configurations that can withstand the extreme environment of the flight. One of the very important issues in the aerospace industry is bonding of dissimilar materials, since high bond resistance to high and rapid thermal and mechanical loads is required. Composite materials have very different coefficients of thermal expansion. In addition, structural properties and thermal conductivities are different too, which actually adds to the problem.  Aerothermic heating, and high mechanical loads caused by ultra-high speeds, is one area of intensive research targeted by the current project.","The MCA technology is efficient, highly reproducible, environmentally safe, and can be applied virtually to any solid state material. In addition, the MCA technology is highly scalable to large areas and minimum processing times, as the MCA fabrication efficiency is proportional only to the average laser power. Lasers with average powers up to 5 kW are currently commercially available. In addition, precise CNC systems are currently available for providing the MCA fabrication process on curved and complex shape parts. As a result the MCA application range will expand to any area where reliable bonding between to materials is required.

Robust and productive smallrobots enable mining rich and accessible deposits of ice and othervolatiles buried near craters at the lunar poles, delivering resources toproduce propellant, and thus making space exploration sustainable. Lightweight excavators bridge the gap between prospecting and full-scaleISRU.A lightweight robot is proposed that excavates and delivers regolith withproduction so superior to the state of the art as to enable realisticlunar and planetary applications.  Demonstration of light weight will beachieved by operating a low mass robot in Earth gravity reduced 5/6 byoffloading.The significance of the proposed innovation is an approach that not onlyperforms the required tasks but is low in mass (30 kg to 150 kg).  Massconstraints make productive excavation challenging.  However, innovativedesigns incorporating transverse bucket-wheels, high payload compositedump beds, and high-speed driving are game changers, enabling regolithoperations in low gravity.  Phase 1 experimental results show that payloadratio and driving speed govern productivity of small robots.Phase 2 will elevate TRLs from 3 at the beginning to an estimated 4 or 5at end of contract.","Astrobotic Technology intends to develop the lightweight robotic excavator into several flight missions, selling its services to NASA on a per-task basis or proposing the excavator for NASA-operated missions.  The initial mission will demonstrate delivery to a precursor ISRU processing plant and characterize the forces and time required to remove the dry overburden that protects polar volatiles in periodically illuminated regions.  This is a crucial step in gathering the data required to determine whether propellant production from polar volatiles will be cost effective.  Because solar power is available for this location at certain times of the year, a commercial approach is feasible -- no isotopes are required.  Assuming propellant production from polar volatiles is economically justified, then Astrobotic excavators will be integral to the process. The excavator also will support scientific missions, because its precision control over digging depth will make it the first choice for revealing the regolith stratigraphy at investigative sites.","Any space-faring nation seeking to explore and settle the Moon will at least double the productivity of its lunar missions if they purchase the propellant needed to refuel their landers for return to Earth from ISRU plants on the Moon.  The excavator is key to early ISRU because its solar power makes it suitable for exploiting the volatiles that are believed to exist in easily accessible locations outside crater floors.Polar volatiles eventually will be exported to Earth orbit where multiple commercial markets will be served.  Low Earth orbit spacecraft, especially government and private space stations, can use them for orbit reboost.  Commercial communications and remote sensing satellites can be delivered to low orbit, then be lofted to high orbits via reusable transfer vehicles fueled by lunar propellants.  By eliminating the mass of the upper stages now employed to reach geosynchronous and other high orbits, these satellites can become heavier and more productive, or they can be launched on smaller and less expensive boosters.Small excavation robotics have commercialization opportunities in earthworking equipment.  In terrestrial construction, small excavation machines are specialized for work in tight spaces, but even the smallest are still on-board human operated.  Further minimization of machines can be achieved via teleoperation and autonomy, with the added benefit of enabling work in dangerous confined environments without risking the operator's life.",Composites; In-situ Resource Utilization; Manipulation; Mobility; Teleoperation

The tool could serve as a starting platform for excavation software for Mars or asteroids.  The tool will provide engineers with the ability to quickly examine ""What if?"" scenarios within a trade space by specifying a surface system architecture (e.g. lander or rover based, digging for ice or building burms) and receiving reliable data and graphs evaluating that architecture's performance in terms relevant metrics, such as total energy used or total duration. The proposed software aims to be (a) user friendly, (b) relevant to NASA excavation priorities (xPRP: digging icy regolith for ISRU or LSS: outpost preparation), and (c) accurate for lunar excavation (equations verified by testing in relevant environment and scaled for gravity).","The software developed under this SBIR effort is specifically intended to facilitate system and architecture trades related to excavation activities on the lunar surface (either dry compacted regolith or icy-soil). At transportation costs of $50K-$100K per kilogram to the surface of the Moon, it is economically imperative that lunar excavation and ISRU tasks be accomplished as efficiently as possible.Doing so requires not just minimizing the mass of individual systems, such as an ISRU reactor or a rover, but maximizing the efficiency of the overall architecture.  This is no mean feat, and will require many trade studies as different architectures are devised to make use of the landed resources available.  This software will speed the process, enabling quicker turnaround on trade studies and providing the best information available for decision making.","Honeybee has witnessed the interest of major international mining concerns in introducing robotics to industrial surface mines.  The issues of maintaining trained and trusted personnel in increasingly remote and sometimes conflict-prone locations makes autonomous, semi-autonomous, and teleoperated mining equipment very attractive.  In some cases, applying robotics to the mine is as simple as automating a formerly manual procedure.  In other cases, the issues are more complex and require careful consideration of multiple alternative architectures.  It is actually rather similar to the challenge of selecting appropriate excavation architecture for the Moon, with the added wrinkle of interfacing with legacy logistics and processing architecture.With appropriate modifications, this software could provide a means to facilitate trade studies for commercial mining concerns increasing the use of robotics in the mine.  This software will be especially well-suited to high-investment, high-payoff automation projects that introduce a completely new architecture as opposed to simply automating the existing equipment.",In-situ Resource Utilization; Integrated Robotic Concepts and Systems; Operations Concepts and Requirements; Software Tools for Distributed Analysis and Simulation

Very good progress was demonstrated by the two approaches investigated:  1) Construct a carbon-based composite, higher bubble point membrane; 2) convert a polymer-based water removal membrane to a conductive  membrane (both approaches to meet the CWRM primary requirements of conductivity, water permeation, and ""no gas leakage"").  In Phase I, coating the carbon with conductive/hydrophilic materials was very effective, resulting in CWRM's that met the conductivity and water permeation requirements and reduced gas permeation by 99.8%.   A multilayer variation achieved ""no gas permeation"" at 40 psig.

This improved membrane can increase the performance and especially the durability of static vapor feed electrolyzers.  Static vapor feed electrolyzers greatly simplify electrolyzer systems as they eliminate the need for water/gas phase separation, which is particularly challenging in a zero gravity environment.  Maintaining water in the vapor phase greatly reduces membrane swelling which should increase durability.  Finally, by keeping water in the vapor phase the MEA is not exposed to ion and other contaminants that are carried by a liquid water stream, further increasing durability and simplifying the system by reducing the need for ultra-pure water.  The primary goal of this Phase II program then is to demonstrate the enhanced performance and durability of a static vapor feed electrolyzer utilizing an improved water management membrane.","Lunar and space stations, satellites, high altitude aircraft.Terrestrial water electrolyzers typically utilize an abundance of recirculated water to the electrolyzer, usually on the anode (oxygen) side, where it serves reactant, coolant, and as the ""carrier"" phase wherein the product oxygen is carried from the anode by the pumped water.  Subsequent to leaving the electrolyzer the phases are separated by gravity in a receiving tank.  In near-zero or low-gravity environments, this separation is difficult to achieve.  Doing so results in additional system complexity and compromised process efficiency.  As part of a regenerative fuel cell system, NASA has a need for highly-efficiency, but robust technologies capable of storing energy in the form of stored hydrogen and oxygen.  The Static Water Vapor Feed (SWVF) Electrolyzer is an elegant solution to overcome and simplify the above problems.

The ability of a vapor-fed electrolyzer to operate on tap water would make this technology even more attractive for these applications.In a similar fashion to water permeation through an ionomeric membrane, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol can permeate membranes.  Thus the static vapor feed technology may be useful in alcohol-air batteries such as those used for portable power.

DSM's piezoelectric actuators offer advantages over traditional alternative actuator technology.  However, in order to use piezoceramic actuators in cryogenic fluid handling applications, proof of operational reliability and improvements in thermal neutral response are required.  During the Phase I, DSM experienced great successes and found multiple compelling reasons to continue into Phase II. Particular successes include: gaining access to a new piezoceramic material with superior cryogenic performance, demonstrating a flight-like vibration test survivability level for a small actuator sample set, and, development of a novel composite actuator with excellent neutral thermal response. The outcome of the Phase I yields multiple compelling reasons to continue into Phase 2.  The potential for application of this actuator technology to cryogenic fluid valves is substantial with interested NASA advisors at NASA JSC, MSFC, and GRC.","DSM has received interest from NASA regarding piezoelectric actuators for cryogenic applications and for others that do not require low temperature capability. Many non-cryogenic uses require a wider temperature range than laboratory environment, so some of the proposed work related to CTE characterization and improved protective coating would be useful for these purposes, as well. Many inquiries are related to the regulation of fluid flow or pressure. Thruster valves used in highly miniaturized satellites have received significant attention. Flow and pressure control of cryogenic propellants such as LOX for propulsion is also an area of interest. A scientist at GRC has begun investigating whether this technology will be suitable for regulation of flow for a fuel cell application. As the technology is more fully developed, it will be practical to pursue applications requiring more force. Interest has been expressed in an actuator for a 2 inch cryo-isolation valve that will require over 150 pounds of output force. There are many cryo and non-cryo valve applications that can potentially be addressed by this technology.","The most direct applications outside NASA are other aerospace projects that require actuators to operate valves for cryogenic fluid handling. ESA and major US defense contractors have previously tested systems that used piezoelectric actuators from DSM. It is reasonable to assume that once the technology reaches a readiness level that is acceptable for NASA, other aerospace entities will have similar interest in using it for their programs. The US Air Force has expressed interest in very low temperature, high force piezoelectric actuators for use in their low Earth orbit simulation chambers at Arnold Engineering Development Center. More broadly, some commercial applications related to materials evaluation and inspection need positioning at very low temperature and could benefit from this research.",Biomedical and Life Support; Composites; Feed System Components; Fluid Storage and Handling; Instrumentation; Kinematic-Deployable; Laser; Micro Thrusters; Photonics; Propellant Storage

The proposed Phase II SBIR program is aimed at developing new cryogenic insulations for passive thermal control, resulting in zero boil-off storage of cryogens.  The passive thermal control will serve to limit the heat leak into the cryogenic storage system.  The proposed technology is expected to increase reliability, increase cryogenic system performance, and is capable of being made flight qualified for the flight systems and to meet Exploration Systems mission requirements.   We will continue to use the technical approaches that have shown tremendous potential during the successful Phase I effort.  Our key approach will be based on the development, fabrication, and characterization of organic-inorganic hybrid nanocomposite microfoams.  In the Phase I program, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of fabrication of these new foams with significantly improved morphology and thermo-mechanical properties.  The proposed approach will utilize environmentally friendly blowing agents.   The closed cell structure of these novel foams will prevent the occurrence of cryopumping.  The proposed effort will further enhance and optimize the novel microfoams, scale up the optimized materials, and culminate in the fabrication of prototype materials to demonstrate the readiness and maturity of our techniques.","The ability of the proposed hybrid microfoams to remain flexible and resilient at cryogenic temperatures makes them an ideal choice for lightweight insulation in space applications.  Some examples of NASA applications include cryogenic insulation of storage tanks, vessels, pumps, and transfer lines on major rocket propulsion systems.  Our materials will provide NASA with robust cryogenic solutions and, therefore, will significantly decrease space mission failures.","The innovative technology proposed in this program will provide excellent thermal and electrical insulation capabilities.  The technology is ideal for numerous applications.  For instance, it can be used in military or commercial aircraft, and in the hulls of ships.  In addition, these novel microfoams can be used as laminates for circuit boards or in other electronics.  In automobiles, the foam can be used for the firewall behind the engine or in brake pads, trim, molded plastic parts, and other care elements.  They also can be used in a variety of construction applications or in recreational equipment.  Other attributes of these materials are their excellent chemical resistance, low outgassing, superior radiation resistance, and excellent wear performance.  In addition, the novel cellular material is an ideal core material for composite structures in aircraft industry such as luggage bins, galleys and lower wall panels.  We anticipate that parts made from these materials will be excellent replacements for metals, ceramics, and other engineering polymers.",Composites; Fluid Storage and Handling; Organics/Bio-Materials; Propellant Storage; Thermal Insulating Materials

This tool is based on coupling the relevant physics models to the LeMANS code for hypersonic flows and to the MOPAR code for material response, both developed by the University of Michigan. In Phase I of this project, we developed an efficient, high-fidelity 3-D radiation transfer equation (RTE) solver based on the Modified Differential Approximation (MDA). The MDA method was shown to be accurate over at least three orders of magnitude variation in medium optical thickness, typical in entry hypersonic flows. The coupled LeMANS-radiation code was demonstrated for Stardust and IRV2 configurations, while the coupled LeMANS-MOPAR code was validated for the Passive Nosetip Technology (PANT) experiment [1], successfully establishing feasibility. In Phase II, the primary focus is to advance the flow and ablation modeling capabilities of the LeMANS/MOPAR codes by including innovative models for: (1) Non-equilibrium surface thermochemistry; (2) Non-equilibrium pyrolysis chemistry; and (3) Non-gray, non-equilibrium radiation. All models will be implemented in a modular manner with particular attention paid to their coupling interfaces to facilitate easy coupling to a computational aerothermodynamics code of interest to NASA such as DPLR. The tool will be validated and applied to ablation-cooled re-entry flow problems relevant to NASA such as the Stardust capsule.","Future NASA missions will be more demanding and will require better performing ablative TPS than currently available. The proposed SBIR project will result in a computational tool with unique, comprehensive, and accurate predictive capabilities for ablative TPS performance in hypersonic, non-equilibrium atmospheric entry flows.

The tool can also be used to aid in the design and development of next-generation planetary vehicles (such as the Crew Exploration Vehicle, Mars Aerocapture and Mars Sample Return spacecraft) and components of future hypersonic vehicles.

The nonlinear aeroelastic solver solves the aeroelastic equation of motion to add the incremental aeroelastic forces to the right hand side of the 6 degree-of-freedom equation in the flight dynamic model to account for the dynamic aeroelastic effects in the flight dynamic simulation. The generalized aerodynamic forces involved in the nonlinear aeroelastic solvers are provided by three nonlinear aerodynamic Reduced Order Models (ROMs); namely the modal, gust and control surface ROMs, that are derived from the Navier-Stokes (N-S) solver of FUN3D. The nonlinear modal ROM is constructed by a neural network model and the nonlinear gust and control surface ROMs are in the form of the first and second order Volterra Kernels. A wrapper around FUN3D, called OVERFUN, will be enhanced to drive FUN3D for generating the training data that leads to the three ROMs. OVERFUN also can directly drive FUN3D to perform a full order aeroelastic analysis including trim, flutter, gust and maneuver loads analyses whose solutions can be used to verify the accuracy of these three ROMs. The NL-DFS system will be validated with the flight test data of F/A-18 Active Aeroelastic Wing.","A flight dynamics simulation capability with an add-on nonlinear aeroelastic solver using N-S solver generated ROMs is still not available within NASA. NASA has been working for many years towards achieving a software package that would accurately predict the interaction between flight dynamics considering structural flexibility in closed-loop with flight control laws. NASA is currently working on several N+3 advanced aircraft design concepts such as Truss-Braced Wing, Blended Wing-Body and Supersonic Business Jet. These advanced aircraft design concepts will be more flexible, more slender, and/or sizable where there may be insufficient frequency separation between the rigid body dynamics and the relatively low frequency elastic modes. The flight control law based on the rigid model may result in an unacceptable stability or an undesirable response characteristic due to control input or turbulence. The NL-DFS system will allow these advanced aircraft design concepts to be tested in a cost-effective manner; while increasing performance and confidence in the control law designs.","The maneuver and gust loads on transport aircraft usually are two of the critical design loads that dominate the structural design. To avoid the weight penalty by reducing the dynamic loads, modern commercial aircraft usually are equipped with a maneuver and gust load alleviation control system using the aileron and spoiler to provide the control authority. To suppress the body-freedom flutter and limit cycle oscillation problems, several military aircraft are equipped with a flutter suppression control system. To verify the performance of these control systems, it usually requires an enormous amount of wind-tunnel testing and flight testing to tune the control laws. The proposed NL-DFS system can be used as a virtual flight test environment in which control law testing can be performed; thereby reducing the number of wind tunnel and flight tests.","Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

Physics-based, reduced-order models (ROMs) will be developed and demonstrated with data from CFD models of the X-56, an experimental aircraft that NASA and the U. S. Air Force are using to test systems for flutter suppression and gust-load alleviation.  Extended range and low fuel consumption through lightweight materials and large wing spans (high lift-to-drag ratios) are the drivers in next-generation aircraft like the X-56, but these attributes create challenges in maintaining flight safety, ride quality, and long-term structural durability.  The development of flight controllers that can actively manage aeroservoelastic effects (body-freedom flutter, control reversal, gust loading) without compromising safety and aerodynamic performance is a key objective of both the X-56 Program and the proposed project.  Through the proposed technology, nonlinear, aeroservoelastic ROMs can be coupled to other components of a flight simulator (six-degrees-of-freedom flight mechanics models and control software) to improve the fidelity of simulations that support controller design for a wide range of operating conditions.","The proposed technology and its development using the X-56 as a demonstration platform targets key aspects of the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Strategic Thrust 3A (Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles Subsonic Transport).  The commercial product to be developed is an engineering tool for modeling aeroservoelastic dynamics in flexible air vehicles.  The software will use data generated by high-fidelity aeroservoelastic CFD models to construct efficient ROMs for all phases of the development process from early concept trade studies to flight testing and aircraft certification.  Flexible, lightweight vehicles are an emerging market, promising reduced take-off weight, greater range, and lower fuel costs.  The ultra-efficient designs present safety challenges (flutter, divergence, control reversal, gust loading, structural failure, fatigue), requiring innovative flight control systems to effectively manage aeroservoelastic instabilities.  The proposed technology will enable the design and testing of new controllers for highly flexible aircraft through accurate, low-dimensional aeroservoelastic models capable of real-time predictions.","The proposed project will focus on the experimental X-56 program with much broader potential applications relating to flutter prediction and suppression, gust load prediction and alleviation, and active/adaptive aero-structural control.  The modeling technology is an enabler for next-generation fighter aircraft operating over subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight regimes, commercial launch vehicles, and rotorcraft, all requiring advanced flight control for complex aeroservoelastic environments.  Simpler, currently available models based on inviscid flow and panel methods become insufficient with more complex vehicle geometries, higher speeds, and the presence of complex coupling like shock-boundary layer interactions.  CFD-based ROMs can be game changers in these applications.  The modeling technology is capable of predicting not only six-degrees-of-freedom forces and moments for aeromechanics analyses but also spatially distributed loads, providing close coupling between the disciplines of aerodynamics, aeroservoelasticity, flight control, and structural dynamics during the development of fixed-wing aircraft, launch vehicles, and rotorcraft.","Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

Technologies to realize future propulsion noise reduction will require detailed experimental characterization and diagnosis of the acoustic mechanisms and sources within an engine system or component. ATA Engineering, Inc. (ATA) proposes an SBIR project to further develop and validate methods for obtaining phased array acoustic data from complex distributed noise sources using continuously moving, or continuous-scan (CS) microphones in conjunction with state-of-the-art phase-referencing techniques. The benefits of the CS method include (1) effectively infinite spatial resolution, as the sound field cross-spectrum may be described between any two locations along the scan trajectory, (2) preservation of phase data for improved source and propagation modeling, including beamforming (BF) and acoustical holography (AH), (3) significant reduction of test data acquisition time (potentially two to ten times faster) per operational point, and consequently either (4) reduced test operational cost, or (5) the opportunity to screen more design concepts within a given budget. The Phase II effort will use subscale aeroacoustic testing to validate the novel continuous-scan beamforming (CSBF) measurement techniques with the aim of eventual implementation in NASA acoustic wind tunnel and free-jet testing facilities. ATA will also formalize a CS software toolkit for data processing and visualization and design a full-scale array concept for a candidate NASA wind tunnel facility.","ATA believes that significant benefits could be achieved through implementing the CS acoustic measurement technology in NASA wind tunnel and free-jet facilities. The resulting capability would support noise reduction goals set forth in the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate's (ARMD's) Strategic Implementation Plan (SIP). In particular, Strategic Thrust 3: Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles establishes noise improvement margins (relative to the FAA Stage 4 noise limit) of −32 dB, −42 dB, and −52 dB, for N+1, N+2, and N+3 future aircraft technology generations, respectively. ATA's technology will support progress toward all four NASA long-term research themes under the Subsonic Transport portion of the strategic thrust (3A): Ultra-efficient airframes, Ultra-efficient propulsion, Ultra-efficient vehicle system integration, and Modeling, simulation, and test capability research. In the coming decades, progress towards these objectives will be accomplished through research conducted in NASA and commercial experimental facilities. Examples of aeroacoustic measurement facilities that could readily adapt the technology include the   9' x 15' Low Speed Wind Tunnel (LSWT), Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL), and 14' x 22' Subsonic Wind Tunnel.","Community noise exposure continues to be a significant issue near airports, confining growth and impacting quality of life and health of those affected. To counteract growing exposure, ever more stringent noise standards are expected to be implemented by regulatory agencies in the certification of aircraft. These standards are predicated on the discovery of new technologies aimed at reducing aircraft and engine noise. Further noise performance improvements will likely be asymptotic, with incremental improvements resulting in only modest noise reduction. Thus, innovative measurement technologies to better identify and diagnose noise sources within the aircraft and engine are necessary, particularly for the subscale-size test articles and low-SNR environments of wind tunnel testing. ATA believes there is a significant market opportunity for the enhanced CS toolset through adoption at engine manufacturers, airframers, and international aviation authorities. Beyond aviation, CS tools and methods will be applicable to wind turbine, automotive, and industrial noise.","Acoustic/Vibration; Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Simulation & Modeling"

Fundamental of the proposed technique is to measure particle charge under an electric field. Through extensive experimental and theoretical investigation on soot emissions from IC engines over the past four decades, it has been well-known that engine soot particles are usually charged. Counting particle charge at specific mass could lead to the determination of both total particle count and mass. Currently commercially available electrometric measurements on charged particles suffer from rapid signal drift, which limits its applications on soot emission measurements. In our proposed design, an amplitude modulation scheme is included to eliminate the background signal drift and also improve detection sensitivity. The proposed soot mass distribution monitor will be approximately 50 pounds in weight and consume approximately 300W electrical power. It will also be capable of being remotely controlled and operating under vacuum condition. Total cost of the proposed device could be less than $30,000.","The primary NASA need for this technology is to measure soot particle mass distribution from aircraft engine exhaust. At present, particle mass distribution is calculated from particle size distribution, which is measured by the Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS) and Scanning Mobility particle Sizer (SMPS) techniques. Both techniques provide information on particle count at each electrical mobility diameter. To calculate particle mass distribution, an assumption of particle density becomes necessary. Since engine soot particles are intrinsically fractal aggregates, their densities are complex function of particle size and compositions. Obtaining the particle density information requires sophisticated measurement instrumentation. The proposed soot mass distribution monitor will directly measure particle mass distribution, from which total particle count and mass could be determined. In the past, NASA has funded a number of field measurement programs such as EXCAVATE, APEX, UNA-UNA, and AAFEX that focus on the measurement of black carbon emissions from civilian aircraft engines.","We expect that the soot particle mass monitor developed under this program will significantly benefit the scientific community interested in characterizing soot particle mass from a variety of internal combustion engines. The ability of one instrument to measure particle charge at specific mass will enable continuous measurements of particle mass distribution that can be directly used to determine total particle count and mass. In combination with an electrical aerosol charger, either with a radioactive source like 85Kr or non-radioactive source like corona discharge, this instrument will provide a direct measurement on particle count and mass simultaneously for any particles or aerosols. This measurement technique could be applied to ambient aerosol monitoring, PM emission detection, and particle manufacture process.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Electromagnetic; Prototyping"

The result is that an arc plasma can be produced, with a Lorentz force that creates a plasma disc (similar concept to a cyclotron). The thought behind this concept is that the thermal actuator authority provided by the plasma arc is coupled with an induced swirl component into a boundary-layer flow, which will enhance mixing and allow flows to remain attached across strong adverse pressure gradients. Effectively, the proposed actuator would function like vortex generators that one can actively enable or disable on command.  This subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of devices to address a notoriously difficult problem in active flow control.  The new capabilities in aerodynamic performance enabled by this innovative actuation approach will be demonstrated in both ground and flight tests.  CU Aerospace will design, fabricate, and deliver a flight-ready demonstration plasma actuator to NASA at the end of the Phase II program.","CU Aerospace and UIUC anticipate several important benefits from the cyclotronic plasma actuator over other technologies.  When compared to traditional dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators, the cyclotronic plasma actuator may add more energy into the plasma to improve actuator authority and improve effectiveness for low-speed and high-speed flows.  This technology may also alleviate turbulent separation through 3D mixing mechanisms, similar to passive vortex generators.  This mixing mechanism may also improve operational efficiency, or reduce proposed actuator power requirements, as compared to existing technologies.  The proposed innovation also provides more benefit than passive devices as control authority can be provided on-demand and it does not produce undesirable parasitic drag during high-speed cruise. Finally, the actuator has no moving parts and does not require the heavy infrastructures and mechanical complexities associated with high-pressure air storage required for most blowing approaches to active flow control.","The cyclotronic plasma actuator also has potential to significantly reduce drag and fuel burn for commercial aircraft through improved control surface effectiveness and high-lift performance, allowing aerodynamic surface weight and size to be reduced.  Operational benefits are also anticipated for the efficiency, maneuverability, and stall prevention of military aircraft in high angle of attack operation.  Additionally, potential internal flow applications include plasma assisted combustion, flame stabilization, and flow management inside inlet S-ducts.","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Command & Control; Exciters/Igniters; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Simulation & Modeling"

The code, though still a surface paneling algorithm, has proven to be significantly more robust and computationally efficient. FlightStream uses CAD or an unstructured surface mesh and is adaptable to subpanels varying in vertex valence from triangles to surface polygons. The focus of the recently completed Phase-I effort preceding this proposal has been to develop the viscous formulation of surface-vorticity to allow the prediction of non-linear aerodynamics and the onset of flow separation through a new approach called the Fluid Strain-based Separation model. This theoretical development and demonstration has laid the foundation for an effective, high-fidelity, physics-based solution for flow separation. In this Phase-II proposal, the focus is to expand the scope of application of these non-linear aerodynamics and flow separation models through robust algorithmic implementation to the FlightStream code base. A part of this focus will also be to validate the conclusions obtained from the strain-based separation model about the nature of fluid flow and to develop fundamental relationships between the proposed Maximum Fluid Strain property and the primary fluid properties with regard to flow separation. Several major performance and fidelity enhancements are also proposed for this effort that are expected to place FlightStream in a very unique position in the aerospace industry. These include the application of the Fast Multipole Method for improving the solver speed and reducing its memory footprint; a higher-order vorticity sheet solver to improve the fidelity of the solutions and improve solver stability in non-linear flow environments and other mutually supporting enhancements. Research in Flight hopes to use this current effort to develop the very first commercially viable viscous, surface-vorticity, flow solver.","FlightStream is currently used in a variety of different applications by NASA and the industry. These applications can be categorized in the following manner:* Steady-state cruise aerodynamic performance* Propeller-wing interactions* Take-off / landing aerodynamic performance* Engine integration studies* Multi-disciplinary optimizationsThe impact of the non-linear aerodynamics and flow separation models developed as part of this effort will have a direct impact on the first three application areas listed above. Namely, steady-state lift cruise aerodynamics, propeller-wing interactions and take-off/landing aerodynamics.  The implementation of a robust model for predicting maximum lift force coefficients for any arbitrary geometry has obvious implications for the aircraft design groups at Langley as well as industry. Modeling non-linear aerodynamics also has direct impact on the accuracy of the FlightStream results obtained for aircraft in take-off and landing configurations. Further, the analysis of propeller-wing interactions can now be extended to include the effects of flow separation, and Research in Flight hopes to validate these enhancements within the framework of the NASA X-57 design effort in the near future in conjunction with NASA design engineers.","There is a significant overlap in FlightStream applications between NASA and the aerospace industry at large. Any enhancements made for a NASA effort is directly felt across the ever-growing FlightStream user community across the country. There are, however, additional FlightStream applications that are unique to the aerospace and marine industries. Primary FlightStream applications in addition to those in use at NASA include the modeling and performance of engine inlets, boundary-layer ingestion modeling, marine propellers and a potential future application for solid rocket motors (this is currently under development by Research in Flight). Most of these applications are positively affected by the development of the non-linear aerodynamics and flow separation models described in this document. For example, modeling boundary-layer ingestion is made possible because of the vortex shedding models described in this effort. Similarly, marine propeller analysis is now of higher accuracy as a result of the strain-based separation models developed as part of this NASA effort. These non-NASA applications are expected to increase the commercial appeal of FlightStream to the general aerospace and marine industries. Research in Flight expects to begin initial outreach efforts to industry to increase awareness of these newly forming FlightStream capabilities in early 2017.","Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Characterization; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Support"

This includes a proliferation of small UAS that will operate beyond line of sight at altitudes of 500 ft and below. Currently the UAS arena includes traditional airframers, established UAS manufacturers, hobbyists, academic institutions, and many air vehicle newcomers such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook that see UAS as a means to other commercial ends. A myriad of issues continues to slow the development of verification, validation, and certification methods that will enable the safe introduction of UAS to the NAS. These issues include the lack of both a consensus UAS categorization process and quantitative certification requirements including the definition of handling qualities. The how to of safely integrating UAS in the NAS raises many questions, and to date, there have been few answers. Perhaps the problem is too big. Because of a lack of quantitative data, attempts to address core problems thus far have failed to achieve consensus support. This Phase II program does not propose to tame the entire verification, validation, and certification problem, but instead to address the important need to define UAS handling qualities in piloted, pilot monitoring, and autonomous operations via a mission-oriented approach with an end product being the UAS Handling Qualities Assessment software toolbox (UAS-HQ) and corresponding specification that will guide UAS stakeholders through a systematic evaluation process. This process will be validated in Phase II via full flight envelope testing of a fixed wing UAS and low/speed hover flight regime testing of a multi-rotor UAS.","This proposal supports the NASA Air Vehicle Technology topic that solicits tools, technologies and capabilities to facilitate assessment of new vehicle designs and their potential performance characteristics and as specifically called out under the Physics-Based Computational Tools - Stability and Control/High Lift Design Tools topic, the definition of handling qualities for unmanned aerial systems. Beyond these specific NASA goals, NASA issued in 2014 a new strategic vision for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). From this effort came six new strategic thrusts. Of these thrusts, several involve the safe expansion of global air operations and are therefore directly related to the safe integration of UAS into the air space. The specific thrusts include safe, efficient growth in global operations, ?real-time, system-wide safety assurance, and assured autonomy for aviation transformation. This proposal therefore supports NASA's Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP) of which the UAS Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Project is another direct application. In this arena, the proposed Phase II team has discussed potential post applications with a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) project technical lead. The discussions have focused on the need to define UAS handling qualities under failure or off-nominal conditions, which is beyond scope of the proposed Phase II, but possible as a Phase IIe/III task.","The proposed Phase II team sees a strong demand for the advancement of UAS handling qualities capability from the DOD where the Air Force and Navy have long been looking for a path forward in this area. This assertion is supported by the active participation of Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Naval Air System Command (NAVAIR) personnel in the briefings held in Phase I. The team also sees this demand expanding to the growing commercial market, particularly on the sUAS side, as the FAA continues to open up the NAS to new UAS applications over the coming months and years. To this end, feedback from FAA personnel from the Small Airplanes Directorate was received in Phase I and their continued participation in Phase II will be encouraged. Outside of the government, this work is generating strong interest from traditional airframers and UAS manufacturers. Representatives from several of these companies are discussing possible Phase IIe opportunities to investigate UAS handling qualities in autonomous flight modes. Finally, UAS commercial end users will be engaged in the process to underscore the need for requirements as a means to demonstrate compatibility of their selected vehicle with the identified mission.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Teleoperation"

There is a need for accurate, reliable assessments of the condition of composite parts which may have been damaged through impacts, fatigue, or abrasion.  This is especially true for cases in which the  damage may not be visible from the surface. The RIPCoRDD system is designed such that it will enable composite rotor damage detection in seconds with absolutely no increase in weight, power consumption, or volume of the rotorcraft. The core of the RIPCoRDD device is a unique, distributed, high-definition fiber optic strain sensor (HD-FOS) which provides spatially dense strain measurements (every 1.25-2.5 mm) within the composite structure, coupled with a ground based installation of Luna's proven optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) instrumentation.  Commercialization will focus on transitioning the technology first to OEM manufacturers for non-destructive inspection applications, followed by deployment to rotorcraft end users for lifetime monitoring and diagnostics.","The Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection (RIPCoRDD) system directly addresses elements of the NASA technology development roadmap (topic 15.5).  While the proposed technology is broadly applicable to a range of applications within NASA projects, there are some for which the proposed work is especially relevant.  One specific program which has called for rotor health maintenance is the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project.  In addition, the advanced composites project is actively seeking new technologies which can help in the rapid inspection and characterization of composite material health.  Likewise, as space programs move more towards the use of composite materials, monitoring those structures for health becomes increasingly critical.","Rotorcraft play a key role in numerous areas of modern life, from life-saving medical transports, to enabling access to remote locations, to military use.  The performance capabilities of composites (strength to weight, non-catastrophic failure) have driven their use in the weight sensitive designs of rotorcraft.  Due to the complex structure of composite materials there is a potential for hidden damage internal to the blade which shortens lifetime while being difficult to detect.  By enabling true condition based monitoring of these rotors, the useful lifetime of rotor blades can be extended, lowering total cost of ownership.  In addition, this technology can be expanded into a host of non-aeronautical applications, such as wind turbine health monitoring.","Air Transportation & Safety; Characterization; Composites; Contact/Mechanical; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Structures"

Both surface damage as well cracks can be studied. 2) Life Estimation: Current component life prediction tools are constrained by the limited accuracy of simplified dynamic stress prediction methods. The proposed work will, make it possible run very accurate simulations under dynamic conditions. 3) Dynamic Factors: The proposed work will enable NASA to compute accurate dynamic factors for use during the design evaluation stage of gear boxes. These dynamic factors can be used to account for steady state dynamics, as well as for transients caused by short duration events.","1) Vibration Prediction in Time-Domain: To date, only frequency domain based vibration calculations with linear models have been commercially available. But Time-domain models are necessary to correctly include contact and kinematics induced non-linearities. Having the fast contact solver will allow very realistic drive system dynamic models, to run in the time domain. 2) Impact Dynamics: It will be possible to make predictions for survivability of drive systems subjected to transients caused by short duration events such as a load spikes. This is an important consideration in the wind-turbine and off-highway equipment industries. Modeling these transient dynamics can only be done in the time-domain. A fast contact solver will allow realistic prediction of these effects. 3) Automatic optimization: Access to a very fast solver will make it possible to run fast static analyses inside the optimization loop of a commercial general-purpose optimizer. It will be possible to optimize metrics such as gear contact patterns, transmission error, and stress while automatically varying the surface modifications and other design parameters. 4) Manufacturing Error Studies: Each manufacturing error has a unique probability distribution. A very fast solver will enable Monte Carlo type studies of manufacturing errors with realistic random distributions. The output will be the probability distribution functions of performance and failure metrics for the drive system.",Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Structures; Tribology

A well-established approach to this bleeds a portion of the compressor discharge air to flow through and over turbine parts. As engine compressor pressure ratios continue to increase, the temperature of this compressor discharge air also increases, to the point that the cooling air itself needs to be cooled.?Micro Cooling Concepts is involved in developing a concept for a heat exchanger co-located/integrated near the point of fuel injection in order to provide cooled cooling air. The main advantages of this concept are the minimization of the amount of heated fuel between the heat exchanger and fuel injector tip such that the fire danger from leaking tubing is eliminated, and the ease of delivering cooled cooling air to the secondary air circuit. Additionally, the modular concept distributes the heat exchange function, allowing for easy replacement of an individual heat exchanger module. For this program, high temperature materials will be used for fabrication using Micro Cooling Concepts' laminated foil construction approach. The end goal of the program will be to develop a prototype fuel-air heat exchanger and test its performance at engine relevant conditions. This effort supports the NASA goal of improving aeropropulsive efficiency through reduced fuel burn and increased cycle temperatures, specifically by enabling very high turbine cooling effectiveness.","A reduction in the temperature of available cooling air would provide additional heat sink, thereby enabling use of higher combustion temperatures. The benefits of such a concept include reduced fuel burn and the accompanying reduction in CO2 emissions, in alignment with NASA's goals, with accompanying minimal fire risk. This technology would be applicable to any NASA air-breathing fuel-based propulsion systems where available cooling air temperatures are currently too high to reach the desired performance goals.","The ability to provide cooled cooling air with minimal fire risk offers a compelling value proposition to turbine manufacturers and their clients. A major engine manufacturer has interest in incorporating the proposed concept into future civil and defense gas turbine engine products that currently show benefits from fuel-cooled cooling air. The designs proposed are inherently compatible with Micro Cooling Concepts' existing production line, enabling arrangements such as building the components under contract or licensing the IP to the engine manufacturer and/or their suppliers.",Air Transportation & Safety; Atmospheric Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Heat Exchange; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Passive Systems; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling

The first is to identify stage efficiency improvements and verify  structural feasibility of shrouding a low aspect  ratio HPT rotor blade designed to use CMC blades.  The second is to perform similar analyses for metallic and  CMC LPT blades . HPT stage efficiency gains will be determined using CFD analyses for shrouded and unshrouded HPT turbines as a function of clearance and stage reaction. The increase in blade component stresses due to the presence of a shroud, and the stresses in the shroud itself will be determined from structural analyses. Comparing analytic results  with available structural data for shrouded metallic LPT blades  will increase confidence in the structural predictions of shrouded HPT blades.The reduction in engine weight from  using CMC blades in the  LPT will be determined.  Current metallic LPT blades are shrouded, so that no significant  stage aerodynamic efficiency gain is anticipated from replacing metallic  LPT blades with CMC blades. In a geared turbine fewer LPT stages, or greater work per stage, may be achieved from using CMC rotor blades.","This work will contribute to the NASA Aeronautics Program goal of increased gas turbine efficiency.  Efficiency improvements contribute to the national goal  of reduced CO2 emissions.

The structural analysis capability of N&R Engineering will contribute to reduced fuel burn. N&R Engineering has extensive experience in the analysis of SiC/SiC CMC composite materials. Because these are light weight and high strength materials, engine weight will be reduced as these materials enter into commercial service. N&R Engineering will provide structural analysis services to NASA and other companies to achieve the reductions in fuel burn per passenger mile enabled by lighter weight engines. N&R Engineering is experienced in the analysis of cooling requirements for turbine hot section components. More efficient cooling approaches further the goal of reduced fuel burn.","Gas turbine manufactures, and other government agencies are potential markets for the services provided  by N&R Engineering.  These services are likely to be used for specific issues associated with the  turbine hot section.

The development of fast instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme conditions present under such test conditions is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  Spatially and temporally resolved measurements of velocity, density and temperature remain significant yet essential challenges in these facilities.  Unfortunately, widely available current suite of flow-field probes exhibit varying degrees of intrusiveness, requiring either the physical placement of probes or seeding of foreign particles or gases.

The state of the art active de-icing method on leading edges involves either an electrical, pneumatic or vibration induced debonding of accumulated ice. There is a need for an anti-ice coating that functions synergistically with active de-icing methods. The advantages are reduced power consumption, improved service life of mechanical components, lighter electronics and extra protection in case of failure of active device. The Phase I program has addressed this need and technology gap, and has demonstrated the feasibility of combining a durable anti-ice coating with an active deicing device, thereby creating an integrated de-icing system. Icing tunnel testing results demonstrated that the coating provides improved de-icing efficiency, along with a reduction in power consumption of the active de-icing device. In collaboration with a manufacturer of active de-icing systems and a company developing advanced technologies to enhance aircraft performance and safety, the Phase II effort will refine the coating composition and application characteristics for use on aircraft so as to meet the stringent requirements of the aerospace and aeronautic industry. Further, we will establish a product specification of an anti-ice coating system for use with active de-icing systems and develop protocols for applying the coating at both OEM sites and field applications. The success of the program will lead to prevention of ice buildup on aircraft leading edges, improve aircraft safety, and reduce energy consumption during deicing procedures.","The proposed integrated deicing system directly supports NASA's continued interest in researching the most effective means for aircraft icing detection, removal, and mitigation. Existing and next generation aircraft (including N+2/N+3 aircraft, as well as vertical lift and unmanned systems) will benefit from the technology as it will help enable all-weather operation, reduce weight and lower power consumption. Success in the proposed effort will advance the capabilities of the active de-icing systems. Apart from using the anti-ice coatings in conjunction with active de-icing systems, these coatings can also be used on the wings of unmanned aerial vehicles operated by NASA; radio telescopes and transmission/receiving dishes located in cold climates where icing can hamper the performance, rocket launch pads and microwave towers operated by NASA or its affiliates.The proposed program can also address the icing problem in both high altitude long endurance UAVs (HALE-UAV) and low altitude high speed UAVs (LAHS-UAV). Icing can occur on the wings of these UAVs during take-off/landing and ascent/descent, which can lead to an increase in drag and reduction in endurance and control, consequently jeopardizing the mission.","Other than aerospace, applications that can benefit from the use of anti-ice coatings, either as a standalone coating, or in combination with another active or passive de-icing device, include: (i) wind mills, where ice on the rotor blades can increase wind turbine load, as well as pose a safety hazard when chunks of ice can come loose and be propelled some distance from the turbine; (ii) communication towers, where, the presence of ice can be a safety hazard; (iii) transmission lines, where ice accumulation results in their snapping, and (iv) train cars, where the presence of ice can be a safety hazard.",Actuators & Motors; Air Transportation & Safety; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Nanomaterials; Polymers; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Structures

However, many UASs are capable of increasingly autonomous operation.  As autonomy pushes against this boundary it is inevitable that the LoS requirement must be replaced with onboard intelligence to sense and avoid trouble without pilot intervention. The software making these decisions must be developed and tested to standards that ensure reliability and safety.  Robust development, test, and operations tools will ensure quality development, adequate testing, and insightful operations of UASs.Windhover proposes to build upon their Phase I efforts to create a complete ecosystem of flight and ground software, as well as processes and standards for achieving the levels safety needed for operations of small UASs. The newest UAS operators are solving problems in their respective industries.  They need a robust UAS software development tool chain that provides access to vehicle control in a safe manner that their existing IT resources and software personnel are already familiar with. Application developers building on the Windhover infrastructure use the entire tool chain to create robust test campaigns.  The onboard test agent and ground automation provide a rich scripting environment that facilitates the efficient creation of multi-level test campaigns for verification and validation.  These application test campaigns are built upon the pedigree of the Windhover framework that has been developed and tested with the same tool chain.  Our Windhover software ecosystem will enable an exponential rate of innovation in the UAS software market and lead to novel solutions to the problems facing the integration of small UASs into the National Airspace (NAS).

Many of the current ideas will require that the low altitude airspace be mapped and cataloged.  NASA would be a good choice for these multi-sensor data acquisition flights.  NASA could use Windhover / Aerotenna powered UAS missions to fly the necessary flights to create the map of low altitude airspace.  These maps could then be used by others to safely fly through these areas.","Many potential UAS application developers cannot overcome the barrier to entry that is presented by safety related concerns. With a safety critical flight software (FSW) framework in place, they can focus on their problem space without needing extensive FSW experience. The Windhover ecosystem enables UAS application developers to quickly create application solutions that stand on the shoulders of a rock-solid platform.Java Script / Python user applications and the use of industry standard IT solutions at the heart of operations console brings UAS software development to a huge existing base of IT professionals.  The contrast with expensive, proprietary aerospace technologies opens up tremendous commercial potential for 3rd parties to add on and enhance the Windhover ecosystem.  The UAS operator can create applications to streamline a workflow, test a variety of simulated scenarios, and ensure their application is robust.  Once satisfied, they can sell their application to other operators in the Windhover ecosystem. In contrast to other UAS FSW platforms, the Windhover ecosystem is both certifiable and open, enabling expansion through additional applications by 3rd parties which will energize the commercial market for UAS.

It is now common to consider UAS for difficult and dangerous tasks such as fire fighting and dull tasks such as surveying crops. In addition, the autonomous elements from such UAS are being considered as a means to provide safe personal aviation. Open questions remain, however, about how unmanned autonomous aircraft can be safely incorporated into the NAS. UAS operating in the NAS must (1) sense and avoid other vehicles and follow air traffic commands, (2) avoid the terrain and land safely without operator intervention, (3) react to contingencies such as engine-out and lost-link scenarios, and (4) be reliable (by FAA airworthiness standards) and cost-effective. The current approach for UAS integration relies on radio links and the operator's acuity to direct them safely. Lost links, however, are unavoidable. UAS must have the capability to make their own decisions based on information available via databases and any information discovered by onboard sensors. This is especially the case for rare events such as the failure of propulsion or safety sensing.Near Earth Autonomy proposes to develop technologies and capabilities leading to fully autonomous systems that are able to discover and safely adapt to rare events in their environment with minimal or no human involvement. This proposal focuses on developing an Autonomous Contingency System in the form of sensors and computer software that will enable UAS of the future to be operable safely in the NAS. Additionally, the proposal addresses how the technical challenges can be met and how the technology developed can be shown to be both trustworthy and commercially viable for general aviation.","The initial application for NASA-relevant missions will be to assist with the Mobility on Demand initiative and with the UAS Traffic Management programs resident at Langley and at Ames Research Center.  Both of these activities are investigating technologies relevant to incorporation of UAS in the National Air Space. A successful outcome will be very useful concerning roadmaps and policy recommendations to the FAA. Near Earth Autonomy envisions another NASA market to be primarily units for testing and validation at both the system level and at the aircraft level. The autonomous capabilities that Near Earth proposes will contribute to NASA's testing and validation of the technologies and concepts for UAS operations in the NAS especially given the focus on ""on demand mobility."" Additionally, Near Earth's autonomous technology will provide an enhanced capability, enabling more comprehensive UAS flight testing for NASA's collaborative efforts with the FAA to accommodate UAS operation in the Next Generation Air Transportation System. As the autonomous flight capabilities mature and are integrated into aircraft, they will be of direct use to NASA in their flight testing of ground-based air navigational aids and guidance systems located in remote areas, such as Antarctica. Near Earth's autonomous technology will enable greater utilization of UAS in other NASA areas, particularly for experimentation and testing in NASA's various research centers.","We see a large number of military and commercial applications that could benefit from tools for Contingency Management.  Specifically we anticipate a global military market of 57,000 unmanned aircraft--primarily in the reconnaissance and attack configurations, with growing utilization of utility and cargo configurations. On the commercial side, our analysis forecasts a market of 160,000 unmanned aircraft, most of which would be in the public safety and precision agriculture segments.  Finally, the recent analysis from Uber points to a compelling market case for ""flying taxis"" to transport people in small self piloted aircraft in busy urban settings. We expect that our technology will be very relevant to such application.",Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)

While they system have served the National Airspace (NAS) well over the years, the imminent introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) poses a serious challenge. The variety, flexibility and accessibility of UASs ensures high demand for their use. The low-altitude, small-UAS (sUAS) are perhaps the most attractive platforms due to the low cost to own and maintain. These aircraft pose unique safety risks that are very different from other manned and unmanned aircraft.  To address these risks Intelligent Automation, Inc. (IAI) along with its subcontractor Purdue University propose to develop higher fidelity sUAS Trajectory Generator (sUTG) tool for Small UASs. The tool is capable of modeling rotorcraft, fixed wind and hybrid sUAS while accounting for the impacts of winds and sensor uncertainty. The model architecture allows for the use of high fidelity 6-DOF data augmented by flight plan data. The lack of credible trajectory model for sUASs is sorely required for improved mission designs, safety analyses, contingency management and NAS performance estimation.  This effort is a step in this direction.",Our proposed technique can be used for a wide range of remote sensing applications for NASA and other parts of US government including:- Integrating with existing UAS specific tools and ecosystem- NASA can use sUTG as a template to develop similar model to augment trajectory based tools- Integrating with legacy modeling and simulation tools such as ACES and FACET- FAA can also use the performance databased being created under this project as a template to standardize performance specifications- FAA researchers can use sUTG to analyze proposed used of sUAS before issuing a Certificate of Authorization (COA),The most promising Non- NASA commercial applications are:- Additional enhancement to autopilot system- Standalone safety analysis tool.,"Air Transportation & Safety; Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Processing; Intelligence; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Successful training is required today because more information gathering and decision making must be done manually, which requires training in the fundamental principles and objectives of traffic management. Successful training is required in NextGen due to the increased reliance on automation.Given the multitude of input channels and actors that must be included in an environment for comprehensive training of Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs), it would be too costly and too complex to attempt a full-scale human-in-the-loop simulation or table-top exercise that includes the direct participation of all of these entities. In Phase I of this research, we studied and prototyped effective techniques and technologies to allow virtual and/or constructive simulation of key components of the TMC's environment to achieve a significant step forward in the state of the art of TMC training. In Phase II, we will conduct further research on Traffic Management (TM) training techniques and create a more comprehensive prototype system for evaluation. The proposed innovation and focus on this research is called the COMprehensive Environment for TM Training by Simulation (COMETTS).NASA's recent research thrust in the Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART NAS) Test Bed provides an important step toward, and platform for, research in simulation-based training for the controller and TMC workforce. Such research holds the potential to significantly improve the transition of technologies from NASA to the FAA and onward to fully successful implementation and acceptance by the end users. This proposed effort will leverage SMART NAS to conduct research, development, prototyping and evaluation of advanced simulation-based TMC training.","As this innovative concept is directly related to the air transportation system, the most appropriate application of the concept and prototype will be further research on operational improvements in the US ATM system. This concept for simulation-based TM training can be applied by NASA across many concepts and technologies to enhance the technology transfer process and end-user acceptance of NASA-developed capabilities. By considering the training process as a core part of the research on advanced ATM decision support tools and procedures, NASA can optimize concepts and capabilities to facilitate training in the operational environment. NASA can use the COMETTS environment to perform research specifically on ATM training associated with new tools, to further improve the FAA's deployment process of new capabilities.","The simulation-based training concept described in this proposal can also be used by airlines and other Flight Operators for training of their dispatchers and ATC coordinators. Collaborative Decision Making in ATM requires a detailed understanding of terminology, operations, tools and constraints amongst all participants. Through a broad use of the COMETTS concept across both FAA and Flight Operator participants, CDM can be enhanced.The simulation-based training concept has extensive applicability across numerous other fields including military, emergency response, security, power plant operations, process control, and many other areas. The ability to simulate unstructured interaction with virtual/constructive participants is at the cutting edge of current market needs in many of these fields.

The first innovation involves the development of a web-accessible model invocation engine (the ""Web-based"" part of SWIFT) which was prototyped earlier, demonstrated to NASA/Ames in December 2016, and will be fully developed in the current proposed projectI.  This model invocation engine can be used as a front end to SMART-NAS and can potentially transforms NAS simulations into a Software as a Service (SaaS) model.  This transformation will make it practical for NAS analyses to be run anywhere, and its design is compatible with the Data Distribution System (DDS) engine inside of SMART-NAS as well as with the Sherlock database system maintained by NASA.  The second innovation, which is coupled with the first, is a standard modeling language, which we call the Predictive Query Language, or PQL (the ""Interrogable"" part of SWIFT).  PQL is a powerful language for coordinating model runs across the distributed SMART-NAS environment, or any other model-based infrastructure.  The final innovation involves developing applications (""app"") that run on both Apple IOS and Google Android smart phones that enable commercial pilots to easily access the status of the NAS (the ""Stakeholder"" part of SWIFT).  This app can access the current state stored in SMART-NAS or any other NAS data repository.","NASA applications include the following:As an interface to NASA's SMART-NAS system, SWIFT provides a ""Software as a Service"" (SaaS) model, the first of its kind, to the aviation community.  NASA can offer its various tools (ACES, FACET, Sherlock and others) as a service that is accessible through SWIFT and connected through SMART-NAS.As an engine that connects to a database such as the NASA-developed Sherlock system, SWIFT can access that data to configure fast-time and real-time models that can make future projections.  These future projections can be stored back into the database (if needed) and become accessible to other NASA analysts.As a stand-alone analysis engine, SWIFT can be used by NASA and non-NASA government employees to refine a study question (through PQL statements) and to execute the resulting analysis using the federated toolkit attached to the SWIFT web-based interface.As a tool to express analyses in standard format, NASA and other government researchers can use PQL statements, in a stand-alone mode, to specify research questions that can be shared with other researchers in a clear, easy-to-understand language that is compilable to actionable requests for aviation simulations.As a language that transcends aviation applications, PQL can be used for any projection of the future state of any system, including planetary systems, cosmological investigations, projections of the spread of disease, and so forth.","The potential non-NASA applications are isomorphic to the NASA applications except with a commercial intent.The SWIFT interface and IAI's government off-the-shelf federated toolkit can be used by aviation consultants, industry analysts, and other firms investigating one-off or multiple problems in aviation analysis.  Example questions might be ""If NextGen is configured to use performance-based navigation (PBN) approaches at [name an airport such as Miami International], what will be the effect on noise for the surrounding population?""  Such a question would be formulated as a PQL statement, which would require precise specification of the metrics involved and the configuration of the simulation tools (traffic, weather, PBN routes).The smart phone pilot app can be used to plan a pilot's work day, allowing the pilot to access all available information about the airports of interest..The PQL statements can be expanded to include non-aviation applications, such as applications in medicine, earthquake prediction, other scientific areas, and sociological projections.","Air Transportation & Safety; Data Processing; Programming Languages; Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Aircraft without ADS-B Out capabilities, ranging from commercial or general aviation aircraft with failed transponders to adversarial aircraft deliberately operating without required transponder equipment, will continue to exist within the general airspace and pose navigational hazards and tactical threats to SUAVs.  To meet these needs, Nokomis proposes to adapt its ultra-sensitive RF detection, identification, and geo-location (DIG) system, called Hiawatha to provide an unsurpassed trajectory management and anti-collision avoidance capability suitable for integration into SUAV platforms.  The Hiawatha system provides flight-tested state-of-the-art ultra-sensitive RF detection, identification and geo-location performance which has been proven to detect UAVs at distances up to 15km.  Nokomis will develop the Hiawatha Aircraft Anti-Collision System including software and hardware to aid in trajectory management and safe traffic flow of autonomous UAV operations capable of meeting the SWaP requirements for incorporation into a representative SUAV payload platform.  The RF-based traffic management and anti-collision avoidance system will be capable of monitoring the entire spectral range from 30 MHz to 3 GHz, while providing the necessary detection, identification, and locating abilities from all angles while operating in a non-interfering manner with other potential payloads. Specifically, as part of Phase II effort, Nokomis will enhance existing geo-location capabilities and implement Trajectory Prediction and Anti-Collision/Well Clear Modules to protect aircraft and allow for efficient Traffic Flow System for maintaining aircraft spacing. The Phase II effort will build, test, and demonstrate a prototype system.","In addition to the nearly 102,000 flights in the air across the United States today, UAVs and drones make up increasing segments of the aviation traffic in this country. The need for methods to integrate these aircraft into the transportation system in an efficient and seamless manner which is easily scalable as UAV traffic increases. Aircraft without ADB-D Out capabilities, including malfunctioning and non-cooperative aircraft will continue to exist within the general airspace and pose navigational hazards and tactical threats to SUAVs. The ability for UAVs to detect, identify, and track these aircraft to ensure safe operation and trajectories in traffic will become of increasing importance. The Hiawatha aircraft anti-collision system will provide a tool for trajectory managements and efficient traffic flow, especially for preventing collisions in case of transmitter failure or non-cooperative traffic.  In addition, the Hiawatha aircraft anti-collision system can aid in operations during approach or in dense traffic areas by providing range and bearing of nearby aircraft to maintain spacing during approach.  The passive nature of the system allows for the detection of non-cooperative or disabled aircraft, while the low cost and small size of the system allow for integration on various platforms.","The Hiawatha anti-collision system can be applied to a variety of UAV and drone applications in which way-finding or obstacle avoidance is necessary.  For drones used in agricultural applications, the system can be adapted to help the aircraft avoid electrical towers and other obstructions near fields.  Further applications can use beacons to provide location points for the tracking and way-finding of UAVs on long distance per-mapped routes beyond user control. UAVs operating as part of a swarm or network can use the system to ensure well clear and formation distances are maintained.  The system can also be reconfigured as a ground-based detection, identification, and tracking system of UAVs or other platforms, providing information about a region of airspace for space operations such as UAV and balloon launches. UAV tracking is of interest for security concerns of agencies and private corporations including, but not limited to, nuclear power plants, large public venues, sensitive government facilities, and to prevent tampering or corporate espionage, .  In addition, the automobile industry is expanding exploration into the development of fully automated vehicles.

We first analyze a) the requirement for avoidance based on the UAV's ability to get away from danger and b) the suite of candidate technologies needed to detect intruders with ample time to get away.   To meet this need we will build a reliable FINE TRACKING sensor for knowing where nearby objects are located and an EARLY WARNING sensor for the region outside the coverage of the Fine Tracker.   The first step is to substantially improve the candidate sensor technologies [radar, LiDAR and V2V] for our specific requirements.  This is because the individual technologies have typically been designed for other markets and on their own will not solve Sense and Avoid.   But the combination of our improvements to these three technologies along with smart data fusion will provide meaningful Early Warning and Fine Tracking of any likely intruders.We will then run experiments to verify that we can reliably detect and then avoid our two most challenging targets; namely power lines and toy drones.  We will then report on our results and provide recommendations for commercialization.","There are many Government applications:   The most immediate one is to do work with the Department of Homeland Security to provide UAV border surveillance along the US/Mexico border.This suggested solution will use a fleet of small UAVs flying autonomously back and forth between recharge stations to provide meaningful and accurate intelligence of border intrusion.   Then, high resolution photos collected by the smart UAV would be sent via our satellites to DHS agents in a remote command facility who will then decide on the level and type of engagement.  In addition to border security, this sense and avoid technology can be used to a) permit safe flight for NOAA surveillance of US waterways and landmass; b) help execute search and rescue missions for the US Coast Guard via UAVs and c) support the Department of Transportation to do long range inspection of the country's infrastructure.","The utility inspection problem for oil, gas and electric companies is also a big opportunity for small UAV flight.   In this problem, the UAV would fly tens of miles along utility and gas lines looking for places of encroachment and/or maintenance issues.   Encroachment occurs when non-suspecting organizations build and/or modify [i.e. dig] the land near these lines which could cause some danger.   Maintenance issues are due to the common aging of outdoor elements.  In both the Government application and the commercial application, the problem that we are solving is long distance inspection in which the UAV is smart enough to fly autonomously, not hit anything and offer surveillance.Also, in both cases the customer will desire imagery that is then sent back to a command site for human analysis.

We also propose an extension to the manner in which conditions were developed in Phase I.  Conditions were developed using post analysis of accidents and incidents.  The error chain of events was identified, information necessary to prevent the event was identified, and finally, a condition developed that detected the circumstances for a possible safety failure so that a notification could be transmitted to the actor who would then take the appropriate action to break the error chain.  This paradigm of condition development can be characterized as reactive.  With the NAS moving into a state of flux with the integration of UAVs and general increased traffic volume, reactive safety may not be acceptable.  In order to continue the steadily improving safety record of aviation, a more proactive approach must be considered.  We propose the use of a classical rule-based expert system and other artificial intelligence approaches that can make inferences of possible unsafe conditions using a temporal knowledge base populated by propositional statements generated by IIPS information sources.","Integrating the proposed system with the ATOS/SMART-NAS development effort:It is possible to integrate the IIPS with NASA's Airspace and Traffic Operations Simulation (ATOS) that is currently being integrated into the Shadow Mode Assessment Using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART-NAS) test bed.  In this integration effort, large number of ASTORs being run on the Amazon cloud cannot be monitored for correct behavior during runs and can only be verified by post processing.  The IIPS can be developed to monitor ASTORs for reasonable flight performance and generate alerts along with additional context when simulated aircraft begin to deviate.  Integrating the IIPS with the ATOS may allow subsequent integration with additional simulation platforms as they are integrate into the SMART-NAS test bed.  This may allow for seamless systems-level development on a National Airspace System level.It is also possible to use IIPS to support the transition to autonomy as IIPS develops its valued information at the right time (VIRT) concepts.  As autonomous UAV systems continue to develop, there will be situations where the autonomy will fail. It may be possible to have a human operator step in and perform a better recovery of the autonomous vehicle.  The IIPS VIRT functionality will optimize the time for a human operator to develop a complete and accurate situational assessment and perform the appropriate recovery actions.","The IIPS technology contributes to several FAA near-term goals. In order to be of practical use, IIPS must implement conditions that have been identified either as safety enhancements per Commercial Aviation Safety Team Safety Enhancements (CAST SEs), or as accident causes per the Joint Safety Analysis Team Controlled Flight Into Terrain (JSAT CFIT) and Joint Safety Implementation Team Loss of Control (JSIT LOC) documents.  The IIPS may be in a special situation where it can implement specific recommendations by the documents not done so to date by the aviation community at large.  Notification terminal information and presentation must also be consistent with recommendations and guidelines defined by the same documents.  It should be noted that these documents refer to other documents such as the Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) or that there may be additional documents such as Advisory Circular 25.1322-1 Flightcrew Alerting that must be considered while developing conditions and notifications.  A critical consideration for the IIPS is that it may implement a redundant check or may monitor other alerts or notifications so that an adaptive and enhanced alert or notification may be issued when the initial and primary alert fails to initiate remedial actions by the intended audience.",Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Process Monitoring & Control

Since there is going to be more traffic within in the same airspace volume some of the current event based, human centric safety mechanisms that are going to be overwhelmed.

ARCA's core algorithms mirror human safety assessments so that decision analyses are comprehendible on inspection and can be calibrated with experience and observation. Furthermore, ARCA archives operational data as it operates in the field, giving it increasingly better information from which to learn and make increasingly more accurate safety assessments.ARCA uses a Bayesian network to determine the estimated probabilities of incidents and accidents. ARCA's operational safety assessments are objectively linked to hard data. As in any estimation (human or automated), there are always uncertainties. However, ARCA does not rely on any heuristics or subjective integration algorithms. The assessments it produces are objective and quantitatively defensible based on its growing archive of operational information. This is a highly desirable characteristic of trusted automation.","ARCA will be well-positioned to integrate with NASA's SMART-NAS Testbed to provide a demonstration system in support of NASA's Real-time System-wide Safety Assurance Strategic Thrust. ARCA technology can serve a centerpiece of future automated ATC research and development. ARCA technology can also be embedded into vehicle control platforms, starting with manned flight decks (as decision support) and large UAS (working toward autonomous decision-making).","For air carriers ARCA can provide a post-flight approach analysis tool. This tool will allow air carriers to continually analyze the safety of the approaches flown and identify and analyze points during the approach where the risk level was high or unacceptable. ARCA would be complementary to and a cheaper alternative to Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA).For the FAA the near-term potential of ARCA is as post operations safety analysis tool similar to the tool that would be sold to the air carriers. The primary difference in capability is that the FAA would not necessarily have access to crew experience unless it was provided through an existing safety program. In addition to a standalone safety analysis tool, ARCA could be a future add-on to the FAA's DVARS program.",Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Processing; Diagnostics/Prognostics

Refractory oxides and minor constituents such as sulfur, phosphorus, and alkaline earth oxides are also generated as byproducts and can be used for the refining of finished goods, thereby further reducing dependence on Earth-based consumables. Iron is produced via reduction of oxides by hydrogen or carbon monoxide. Silicon, ferrosilicon, and high-purity fumed silicon monoxide are generated via carbothermal reduction of silica-containing resources. Reductants are generated using established ISRU-related technologies including electrolysis, the reverse water gas shift reaction, the Boudouard carbon deposition reaction, and combinations thereof. During Phase I, magnesium metal was successfully produced via silicothermic reduction. Alternative light metal reduction methods will be evaluated and compared to the baseline silicothermic reduction of magnesium oxide for structural applications, replacement parts, and manufacturing hardware on Mars. A high-quality fumed silicon monoxide product can be further oxidized and used for production of clear glass. Upon reduction with carbon, SiO can also be used to make high purity silicon for the production of semiconductor materials using doping agents such as phosphorus. The Phase II effort will expand on the findings of the Phase I work with demonstration of an end-to-end system to produce iron and steel at a rate on the order of one kilogram per day. Example parts will be made using casting, sintering, or advanced manufacturing methods. In parallel with the demonstration of end-to-end iron production during Phase II, light metals manufacturing methods evaluated during Phase I will be further refined. Small-scale production of light metals will be demonstrated during Phase II.","The primary application of EMP is for production of iron, silicon, and light metals as well as refractory metal oxides and byproducts including phosphorus and oxygen from Mars, Moon, or asteroid resources for manufacturing in support of advanced human space exploration. The EMP product suite includes many useful materials that will expand exploration and colonization capabilities while substantially reducing the costs and risks of bringing supplies from Earth. Many EMP product streams are suitable for use in advanced casting or additive manufacturing methods to allow for efficient use of resources.","One potential terrestrial EMP application is the production of high-grade silicon metal or ferrosilicon. The hydrogen-enhanced carbon monoxide disproportionation method employed in the EMP system for reductant production enables high rates of carbon deposition onto pure silica in the absence of a metal catalyst. Direct carbon deposition from CO generated during carbothermal reduction integrated with RWGS-electrolysis modules would reduce the purchase of carbon for the process while significantly reducing overall carbon emissions compared to current practice. The carbon deposited by this method would be of very high purity. Such processing would have particular application and potential for manufacturing cost savings if carbon emissions become regulated. In a complete closed-loop system including a reverse water gas shift and electrolysis unit, silicon or ferrosilicon manufacturing could be accomplished with virtually no carbon emissions.The EMP techniques have additional potential for the processing of lower-grade ores and feed stocks including other process residues and wastes. As higher-grade ores on Earth are more-difficult to find and mine, feed costs for existing technologies rise. The EMP can help to reduce overall processing costs by enabling the use of non-conventional feed stocks and the non-conventional metal oxide reduction techniques proposed for the Phase II effort.",Ceramics; In Situ Manufacturing; Metallics; Minerals; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Resource Extraction

Methane and ethylene are well known polymer precursors that can be used as starting material to make plastics in extraterrestrial environments.  PEM water electrolyzers have already been proven space worthy and are commercially available at various scales. Our innovation enables the creation of polyethylene and other polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates from the most basic starting materials: CO2, water and electricity. In Phase II, Opus 12 will continue to improve performance of the CO2 conversion process and build a working prototype of ethylene and methane production that will serve as the basis for a future commercial device.","Currently, materials for manufacturing in space have to be shipped from Earth at significant cost. Sending material to Mars costs $20,000 per kilogram, and this cost has poor mass scaling for large payloads, as the amount of fuel required increases exponentially with payload mass. Opus 12 has developed a breakthrough technology that will enable the synthesis of plastics from CO2 and water, which are available in situ in extraterrestrial environments.  Our electrochemical device can take water and CO2 from the Martian atmosphere and transform these molecules into polymer precursors (ethylene and/or methane).  This opens up a variety of space-based manufacturing applications, including 3D printing to manufacture tools and building materials in space. Producing plastics in space can furnish the building blocks for extraterrestrial built environments and can be a major step in furthering humankind?s ability to explore and survive on Mars and beyond.","Ethylene and methane are two of the most widely available organic compounds.  Ethylene has a global market of over $100 billion. Approximately half of all ethylene produced is polymerized to polyethylene. Based on customer interviews, existing producers of ethylene and ethylene-related equipment, e.g., Total Energy, Chart Industries, SABIC, have expressed interest in alternative feedstocks for ethylene production. While the natural gas fracking boom in the U.S. has created a glut of ethane feedstock, in other geographies, the supply of ethane is restricted, and SABIC is seeking new ways to increase its ethylene production at existing facilities.  Methane can also be used to produce polymers, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, which have the added benefit of being biodegradable.  Many players see a growing consumer demand for environmentally-friendly plastics, and polymers made from recycled CO2 would be a compelling product to market to consumers.","Conversion; Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fuels/Propellants; In Situ Manufacturing; Polymers; Storage"

The development of advanced ground test technology components and systems that are capable of enhancing environment simulation, minimizing program test time, cost and risk and meeting environmental and safety regulations is focused on near-term products that augment existing state-of-the-art propulsion system test facilities. Thus improved capabilities to model and predict component behavior in harsh ground test environments are needed for enhanced facility design. In particular, components such as pumps, turbines, valves and chokes may experience vibration and damage due to cavitation in the flowing liquid, and any reduction in the severity of the operating conditions would provide expanded test and performance benefits. The proposed innovation is to develop an unsteady cavitation model based on a tabular equation of state and a representation of cavitation bubble dynamics that together describe the growth and collapse of nucleated bubbles in a liquid cryogen. Important nonequilibrium mechanical and thermal effects will be considered by using a drift-flux model and adding an additional energy equation for the liquid temperature.  Validation of the advanced cavitation models will be accomplished for both steady and unsteady flows by comparing surface pressure and temperature data and computing power spectra from frequency domain analyses.  The final analysis tool will be used to demonstrate the significant nonequilibrium flow behavior for both the validation cases and actual production analysis problems of interest to NASA.","This technology will provide NASA with an efficient, robust cryogenic cavitation simulation tool suitable for use in propulsion systems ground test facility component design and analysis as well as other in advanced applications.  The research product will provide enabling engineering and scientific technologies to predict complex cryogenic flow problems with nonequilibrium cavitation, resulting in reduced ground test facility costs and system risk by increasing test productivity.  Potential enhancements include modified treatment of evaporation and condensation rates, turbulence/cavitation interaction modeling, detailed liquid/vapor thermal interface effects, variable transport properties, expanded thermodynamic databases and extended model validation.  The proposed cavitation modeling tool is also applicable to hydrogen inducers, impellers and pumps operating at high vapor fraction.","The growing trend toward coupled multi-physics analyses is opening significant new markets as more difficult problems can be addressed using advanced computational techniques.  The ability to robustly model complex cryogenic flows with cavitation will allow the commercial aerospace and defense industries to improve design and development of new products and streamline ground testing.  Our analysis software can also be applied in the fields of medicine (magnetic resonance imaging), food processing (ultrasonic freezing) and semiconductor processing (plasma etching and vacuum pumping of gas contaminants).

This novel imaging system will include a compact, single focal plane array camera and end-to-end image processing software to produce, high quality, low noise, high-speed video not currently possible with today's technology. The compact camera will be compatible with existing SSC camera housing and acquired imagery will be stored off-camera to prevent loss of information in the event of a mishap. The system will be able to record entire test sequences at >250 fps lasting up to 45 minutes. Most importantly, the system will produce XHDR (>120 dB dynamic range) HD format (1080p or larger) imagery so that relatively dark test cell infrastructure and test article hardware will be visible alongside exhaust plumes that may also contain ultrabright molten material. The imagery will be calibrated to provide engineering information such as radiance, color temperature and particle trajectories. Stereo calibration will enable multiple cameras to provide accurate 3-D XHDR image products. Rocket engine certification ground testing requires clear visual high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for NASA during rocket engine certification ground testing. This need is particularly true in the event of a mishap, when investigations into the underlying cause ensue. This technology can avoid common limitations of typical cameras such as image saturation, rolling shutter image wobble, camera geometric distortion, and no off-board storage, which makes it nearly impossible to obtain critical information in catastrophic situations that result in the loss of a camera.","Compact, color, high-speed extreme high dynamic range (Color-XHDR) video recording that can produce engineering-grade video to accurately record high energy events, such as rocket motor firings, at close range, without image saturation will have significant value to NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC). After a successful Phase II, I2R will be in a position to provide their state-of-the-art system to NASA SSC for incorporation directly onto the test stands. In addition to the facility at SSC, other NASA Rocket Propulsion Test (RPT) and NASA launch facilities namely Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Glenn Research Center Plum Brook Station and White Sands Test Facility, will benefit by using this technology. The Color-XHDR technology can also be incorporated into other NASA missions including both terrestrial and planetary exploration. For example, there is relatively no atmosphere on Mars, so there is limited diffuse scattering and dark shadows become visually darker.  This effect increases the dynamic range of the scene making it an ideal target application for our technology. Also, Color-XHDR technology could be used to directly monitor launch vehicles during launch, both from a distance and mounted on the rockets.","Compact, color, high-speed extreme high dynamic range (Color-XHDR) video recordings that can produce engineering-grade information to accurately record high energy events  at close range without image saturation will have significant value to defense-based facilities that actively test propulsion systems and perform launches. These include the USAF Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base, as well as Vandenberg Air Force Base. Commercial propulsion test and development entities, such as Orbital ATK, SpaceX and Blue Origin, would also benefit by our technology.  In addition to rocket propulsion, other application areas that would benefit from our imaging technology including robotic welding and 3-D printing where bright-dark contrast becomes extreme.Another potential application is small area UAV remote sensing and mobile mapping. Our compact technology approach will enable our imaging systems to be flown on small UAVs. We have spoken to imaging and mapping companies developing technology for strip mining where deep shadows produce extreme contrast. Routinely mapping mining areas is important for managing a site and to maintain safety. Mobile mapping from moving ground vehicles is limited by the dark shadows produced in many landscapes.

One aspect of the vehicle design is utilizing enough shielding to minimize dose on personnel. NASA CAD models inherit errors and issues during their inception that prevent them from being used with NASA?s radiation transport code, High Z and Energy Transport (HZETRN). XL Scientific developed a ray tracing tool to generate inputs for HZETRN, called the CAD Radiation Integration Tool (CRIT). This tool maintains material density and type, unlike any other existing capability. XL Scientific also developed methods of identifying and correcting common CAD errors. In phase II, XL Scientific will expand both CRIT and the CAD repair tools developed in Phase I. Functions will be added to CRIT to read STEP and DICOM file types. We will add interfaces for both HZETRN2015 as well as industry standard radiation transport code, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP). MCNP is widely used in the nuclear community for radiation transport calculations and adding it to CRIT will expand commercialization options to the nuclear and healthcare industry. We will also automate the CAD repair tools developed in Phase I. Automation will allow users to correct common errors quickly and reduce the overall time spent repairing models. Furthermore, XL Scientific will add a sensitivity analysis option to investigate what effect model simplification has on radiation transport results. At the end of the Phase II effort, XL Scientific will have a tool to diagnose and repair CAD model quickly and provide robust radiation transport calculations. This innovation is anticipated to be of interest to government and commercial entities.","The NASA Durability, Damage Tolerance, & Reliability Branch has expressed a need for CRIT. One technical mission of this branch is in calculating the minimum shielding required for humans inside of spacecraft. CAD models used for these calculations can have numerous errors and require extensive time to repair. CRIT will allow users to rapidly repair models and run radiation transport calculations.  The NASA Ames group has also expressed interest in using CRIT for their BioSentinel program. This mission will send a spacecraft past the ionization belt into an intense radiation environment. To meet the goals of this mission, the BioSentinel CubeSat must maximize radiation dose on a biomass payload while providing enough shielding to sensitive onboard electronics to complete the mission. Use of CRIT throughout the design process will aid in rapid design optimization. NASA Ames has mentioned that other missions in AES can benefit from our technology development as well.","XL Scientific has found several organizations interested in CRIT. The Air Force Research Labs (AFRL) space vehicles directorate is interested in this tool to calculate radiation dose on critical components of their vehicles. Similar to NASA, AFRL has numerous CAD models that require repair before they can be simulated. CRIT will reduce the time spent on these repairs. AFRL is interested in calculating dose on electronics. Varian Medical Systems (VMS) is also interested in CRIT. VMS is a major company in nuclear medicine and develops the radiation transport code Attila. CRIT could be run or integrated with Attila to better support this business sector. Our team is in discussions with VMS for the potential of using them as a transition partner. Presbyterian MD Anderson cancer center could benefit from the dose calculations provided by CRIT.

Spaceflight- ready medical devices will need to be capable of an increased degree of autonomous operation, acquiring clinically relevant and diagnosable data by every astronaut, not just select physician crew members credentialed in spaceflight medicine. Ultrasound is a diagnostic and treatment technology that currently fulfills mission medical capability support on ISS and is planned to accompany future deep-space missions. The Flexible Ultrasound System (FUS) is a new platform that is currently being developed by NASA and research partners to support this mission role. We propose three specific aims for this project proposal for methodological development utilizing the FUS platform: 1.) Define a list of highest priority/yield ultrasound methods to develop and implement using the FUS and our guidance prototype through careful review of the HRP roadmap and direct discussion with ExMC Physicians. 2.) Expand an Augmented Reality (AR) user interface for these ultrasound methods that provides procedural guidance in acquiring and initially diagnosing sonographic data for ultrasound procedures to enhanced degree of procedural competency. 3.) Develop and test the integration of magnetic-based Volume Navigation, and complementary dimensional referencing technologies, on the FUS platform to allow for 3-dimensional ultrasound procedural guidance through the Head Mounted Display. 4.) Integrate the current system with procedural guidance resources such as Electronic Procedures (eProc) and existing ultrasound training materials. 5.) Develop deep machine learning capabilities on the FUS platform to enable image recognition and analysis that can aid in not only quality image acquisition, but also analysis in austere, and remote operational environments.","This project maintains the spirit of the goals emphasized in the NASA strategy to revitalize and expand our investments in technology, commercial spaceflight, and robotic exploration precursors.  NASA's multi-destination human space exploration strategy as well as its ambitious program of innovative robotics missions will challenge engineers to develop these new and complex systems with advanced capabilities. The agency is exploring multiple destinations. It plans to conduct increasingly complex missions to a range of destinations beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), including cis-lunar space, near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), the moon, and Mars and its moons. VULCAN will be one of the medical tools for the Journey to Mars in the 2030s.","Tietronix has already initiated work with Methodist Houston and an NSF sponsored Cyber-systems of the future Operating Room that is an academic/industry consortium (with membership such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Karl Storz) on developing this technology for terrestrial medicine.",Analytical Methods; Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Knowledge Management; Medical

The MPXS source is comprised of sections, each designed for a specific range of x-ray imaging conditions.   The source is currently designed as a rectangular box made primarily of aluminum nitride (AlN) sheets.   Each AlN sidewall has a window that allows x-ray flux to exit.  The window can be a hollow section of the sidewall or a thin strip of low Z material over a window aperture in the sidewall.  Thin strips of metal can be placed over the windows for beam filtration.   Each window will output flux from one or more rows of spots (x-ray pixels, or xels) on the metal anode inside, for example a 1 x 30 xel row.  These xels are digitally addressed with separate electron beams from field emission cold cathodes in the cathode array.  The system will comprise one or more sources, paired with one or more digital x-ray detectors, controlled by software loaded on a laptop or mission systems.   Each pair will weigh less than 0.1% of a current tomographic imaging system in less than 0.1% of the volume.  Extensions to the source design can reduce these figures even further.   The programmability of the x-ray flux sequences/patterns from the sources will enable the range of imaging modalities, and make MPXS well suited to use with emerging AI capabilities in radiographic diagnosis.","This project will produce a versatile multi-beam x-ray source and configurable imaging systems for human subject imaging on space stations, planetary excursions and planetary or asteroid bases.   MPXS will meet the imaging needs for the dental and musculoskeletal (MSK) imaging conditions of current interest to NASA.  MPXS systems will go beyond the capabilities currently planned by enabling 3D/tomographic imaging, which will be particularly useful in MSK imaging and in some dental imaging.MPXS can then be used for a much greater number of medical conditions of interest to NASA, particularly head and neck injuries, several conditions requiring imaging of the chest area and dual energy X-ray osteoporosis imaging.  The specific gaps the proposed work addresses are 4.02 (We do not have the capability to provide non-invasive medical imaging during exploration missions) and 3.03 (We do not know which emerging technologies are suitable for in-flight screening, diagnosis, and treatment during exploration missions). Although not a focus in Phase I, MPXS could also be used for applications such as 4.27 (We do not have the capability to sterilize medical equipment during exploration missions).  Other applications could include sources for a range of instruments NASA uses on space missions, including XRF and XRD. The sources carried on board for imaging applications could be used for sample analysis both on spacecraft and bases and perhaps during excursions.","There are many commercial applications of the core technology being developed in this project, including a wide range of pre-clinical, clinical and industrial imaging systems.   Stellarray's smart x-ray sources, which MPXS will lead, can be used in various x-ray medical imaging systems, especially portable tomographic imaging (tomosynthesis or CT) for breast imaging, emergency medicine and systems for emerging markets.   A major mobile radiography and tomographic systems integrator is now discussing with Stellarray the use of simpler versions of MPXS sources for its mobile radiography solutions.   Stellarray will develop some systems on its own but more often sell sources and IP for applications where larger companies are better suited to clinical trials and market entry.  MPXS sources will also be sold to other developers, particularly at universities and medical schools, a number of which have asked for our resources as they are developed.  They could be sold at $75K range to these developers for a good business line.  By the time NASA is testing MPXS systems for its missions there should be a reasonably sized installed base at universities generating research and tests results for an even wider range of medical conditions, including new application designs and reconstruction algorithms.",Medical; Radiography

In Phase I the feasibility of using differential time domain THz imaging methods to enhance the contrast and detectability of features such as disbonds was demonstrated.  Kissing disbonds and cracks may only weakly reflect the THz pulses in conventional THz imaging.   The Phase I project developed the methods of shearographic loading of the samples, and used penetrating THz pulses to detect the subsurface deformation of the defects with better contrast than traditional THz imaging.   In a  disbond there is a region where the two sides of the material are not adhered, and the space between the two sides are essentially so close that THz interface reflection pulses from the non-adhered region may be partially cancelled out..  The  defect signature may be only  weakly detectable compared to when the spacing is greater than the minimum THz wavelength. The differential images null background clutter and highlight the subsurface distortion of the defects under loading.","THz  reflection imaging is a proven NDE technology for imaging sub-surface features, flaws, and defects within space flight structures such as thermal protection systems (ablative resin honeycomb, TUFI, SOFI), inflatable space habitats, composite overwrap pressure vessels, and radomes.

The proposed system will accomplish this task through the utilization of a two-stage filament melting process whereby a metallic filament is first heated to Curie temperature through induction and then deposited on a build platform where it is fused to the previous layer by exposure to a low energy laser.  This new unique process is known as Sintered Metal Printing with Laser Exposure (SIMPLE). Induction heating is not entirely new to Fused Deposition Manufacturing (FDM). There has been recent research into the integration of an induction coil into the ""hot end"" of a plastic filament FDM printer. The induction coil surrounds the metal nozzle, known as the ""hot end"" and inductively heats the nozzle when an AC current is applied. The nozzle then heats and melts the plastic filament allowing it to be extruded onto a platform where a part is formed. The use of induction heating, when printing with a metal filament, is similar but the induction coil heats the wire filament directly as it passes through its center. This system offers faster melt times resulting in faster feed rates, lower mass resulting in quicker more accurate printer head movements and lower overall power consumption.  Conceptually, the wire filament will not be heated to melting but heated to the Curie temperature and laid as a hot filament on the build platform. To gain adherence between deposited layers, a low energy laser is used simultaneous to the layering process to heat and fuse adjacent filament layers.","Government customers will initially be from NASA, where it should be of keen interest to the Advanced Exploration Systems division and to scientists seeking to take advantage of Techshot's metal printer through NASA Research Announcements. Most beneficial for Exploration is the ability to print spare parts, logistics support and adaptive repair.  Through its Space Act Agreement, its IDIQ contract and its role as a CASIS implementation partner, Techshot will offer both the SIMPLE equipment and the associated services required to conduct materials research and processing in microgravity aboard any NASA vehicles.","Currently there is a high cost barrier to entry for 3D metal printing with no low cost options available.  Techshot's SIMPLE metal printer will fill that void and be marketed as a low-end metal printer.  Techshot has successfully commercialized technology derived from SBIR contracts.

The ERASMUS technology integrates a plastics recycler, dry heat sterilizer, and 3D printer to create a system that accepts previously-used plastic waste and parts, sterilizes these pre-used materials, recycles them into food-grade and medical-grade 3D printer filament, and 3D prints new utensils and implements.

Recently, the Game Changing Development (GCD) Program, which is a partnership between NASA, DOE, and industry, was initiated to evaluate the feasibility of a low enriched uranium (LEU) NTP system.  A critical aspect of NTP is to develop a robust, stable fuel.  One of the fuel configurations currently being evaluated is a W-UO2 cermet.  Fabrication of full-size cermet elements (>20?) has proven to be difficult.  As a result, the use of cermet segments to produce a full-size fuel element is of interest.  However, techniques for joining the segments are needed.  During Phase I, diffusion bonding techniques were developed for producing fuel elements from cermet segments.  Microscopic examination and preliminary properties testing showed excellent joints were formed.  For example, quantitative tensile testing of W samples produced at 1500C HIP with a Nb interfacial coating showed the failures were in the bulk W and not at the Nb-W interfaces.  Therefore, the strength of the joints were greater than the strength of the bulk W material.  Using the most promising fabrication methods, a 6.3' long simulated cermet fuel element comprised of twenty-five 0.25' thick segments was produced to demonstrate proof-of-concept.  During the Phase II investigation, the HIP diffusion bonding process will be optimized for making W cermet based fuel elements.  This will be accomplished by performing a process parameter-characterization-properties study.  The optimized fabrication methods will then be used to make prototype fuel elements with W claddings and subscale fuel elements for delivery to NASA for hot hydrogen testing.","NASA applications that would benefit from this technology include Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP).  For example, the proposed Phase II effort directly supports the goals of NASA's GCD Program.  Initial NTP systems will have specific impulses roughly twice that of the best chemical systems, i.e., reduced propellant requirements and/or reduced trip time.  During Phase II-X and III, full-size full elements will be fabricated for testing in NTREES.  Potential NASA missions include rapid robotic exploration missions throughout the solar system and piloted missions to Mars and beyond, where power from solar panels becomes more difficult to obtain.","Both government and commercial entities in the following sectors would benefit from the development refractory metal coatings and diffusion bonding:  defense, material R&D, nuclear power, aerospace, propulsion, automotive, electronics, crystal growth, and medical.  Targeted commercial applications include high temperature-corrosion resistant claddings for nuclear fuel rods, hot gas path rocket motors, net-shape fabrication of refractory rocket nozzles, crucibles, heat pipes, and propulsion subcomponents; and advanced coating systems for x-ray targets, sputtering targets, turbines, and rocket engines.","Ceramics; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Fuels/Propellants; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics; Processing Methods; Prototyping; Spacecraft Main Engine"

Phase 1 results indicate that the  shutdown criticality margin is more than sufficient to maintain sub-criticality in the worst-case water submersion accidents. Key accidents that the accident submersion safe drums address include submersion in freshwater and sand with a stuck drum in the full-on position and submersion in water and wet sand with reflector loss.This SBIR will develop the submersion safe reactor shutdown system for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) identified in the Phase 1. Remaining subcritical during a during water submersion accident is a design requirement for NTP systems. As of now, all thermal spectrum NTP concepts (including LEU NTP systems) fail to remain subcritical during water submersion and thus are not water submersion safe. USNC's submersion safe control drums enable thermal spectrum NTP systems to remain subcritical during water submersion accidents. Key tasks that will be completed include:1.Develop a detailed integrated thermal-mechanical and neutronic design of the control drums.2.Design a power cycle and coolant paths that adequately remove heat from the submersion safe drums while minimizing complexity of the NTP system. 3.Demonstrate the Submersion safe control drum technology in a prototypical reactor experiment and raise the technology's TRL up to 4/5. 4.Deliver a set of NTP system point designs that showcase the full implementation of the drums integrated into a realistic NTP system.","NTP has great promise in spreading human presence to Mars and other locations beyond low earth orbit. USNC's submersion safe control systems will address key needs in NTP development to make NTP a viable technology to fulfill NASA human exploration needs. USNC's work directly aligns with the NASA Technological Roadmap 2015 ""TA 2: In-Space Propulsion Technologies: 2.2.3 Thermal Propulsion"" . Currently, NTP and USNC's submersion safe reactor shutdown technology are being investigated for a human Mars Mission in the 2030s time frame, but NTP also has application for many other applications beyond low earth such as lunar exploration architectures and robotic missions into deep space.   In the near term USNC's technology will be able to support NTP development efforts by providing the research tools and insight required to understand water submersion accidents in LEU-NTP systems. Before the Phase 1, little work had been conducted on the water submersion in LEU NTP systems and a great deal was learned. After Phase 2, USNC will have a much greater understanding and modeling capabilities that will assist in NASA NTP development efforts. Beyond NTP the technology and expertise that USNC is building has application to small nuclear systems for surface power and science missions.","The market for NTP systems and their supporting technologies extend beyond NASA with numerous potential customers in private industry and defense field. NTP is a game changing technology and it is difficult to quantify this non-NASA market but it has the potential to be very large.USNC is pursuing earth based mobile reactors and small modular reactors. These reactors are different than traditional reactors as they can be shipped in whole or modular sections. In shipment of these reactors it is essential to ensure that they are subcritical during water submersion (much like space reactors). The technology developed in this SBIR may have application in addressing water submersion in these earth-based reactors. In addition, a number of other companies are trying to bring mobile or small modular reactors to the market and the novel technology developed in this SBIR might find a market here. The market potential for advanced reactors is several billion dollars and approximately 40 U.S. companies are trying to bring advanced nuclear technology to the market backed by total of more than 1.3 billion dollars of private investment. USNC's submersion safe control technology can address the needs of this emerging market.","Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are the typical cryogens as they provide the highest specific impulse of practical chemical propellants.  These cryogens are stored at temperatures of nominally 20 K for hydrogen and 90 K for oxygen.  Due to the large size of these tanks, refrigeration loads to maintain zero-boil-off are high, on the order of tens of watts at 20 K and hundreds of watts at 90 K.  Space cryocoolers have been developed for cooling space sensors that have modest cooling loads and are not suitable for high capacity applications.  On this program, we proposed to develop a high capacity turbo-Brayton cryocooler that provides 150 W of refrigeration at 90 K.  On the Phase I project, we developed a preliminary design of the 90 K cryocooler, assessing its size, mass, performance, and maturity.  The proposed cryocooler significantly exceeds the performance targets set forth in the solicitation -- the cryocooler specific power is only 8 W/W (solicitation goal of 15 W/W), and the specific mass is 0.4 kg/W (solicitation goal of 12 kg/W).  On the Phase II project, we propose to develop and demonstrate the least mature components, the compressor and its inverter drive.  On a future Phase III project, we plan to build and demonstrate an engineering model cryocooler.  Successful completion of this project fills a clear void in space cryocooler technology.","Space applications for high-capacity turbo-Brayton cryocoolers include cryogen storage for planetary and extraterrestrial exploration missions, CEVs, extended-life orbital transfer vehicles, long-term geosynchronous missions, in-space propellant depots and extraterrestrial bases, and cooling systems for observation platforms requiring large arrays of infrared and X-ray detectors.

We will also refine the design of an innovative linear-reciprocating cold-circulator that resides at the same temperature as the BAC coolant, although we will not have the resources to build this component in Phase II. Compared to conventional reverse turbo-brayton cycle cooling technology our stirling-cycle technology offers higher cooling efficiency and requires no bulky recuperator component. Our double-acting stirling cycle configuration combines a linear motor with a moving piston/regenerator assembly into a self-contained module.  A number of such modules can be connected together into several possible cryocooler layouts to scale heat lift capacity, achieve system redundancy and provide flexible integration with the BAC coolant loop.  This modular approach provides the system designer with packaging options not available with conventional stirling cryocoolers.","Space-based Cryocooling - The cryocooler we will build can be used to produce cooling in the temperature range of 75 - 120 K. Lower operating temperatures are possible via staging. Potential applications include direct cooling of space sensors, vapor re-liquefaction for zero boil-off fluid storage or cooling superconducting magnetic bearings in support of flywheel energy storage systems.Space-based Refrigeration and Compression - The core cryocooler and linear motor technology could be applied to build higher-temperature Stirling coolers for in-space scientific experimentation or biological material preservation. The same enabling technology could be used to build linear compressors for refrigerant-based cooling or other working gas compression or fluid pumping.","Cryocooling - The cryocooler could be used to cool high-temperature superconducting magnetic bearings in industrial spindles and motors. The ability to cool a central load and reject heat at the periphery is ideal for zero boil-off re-condensation of liquid nitrogen, volatile fuels and other substances.Refrigeration and Gas Compression - The core hydrodynamic bearing technology could be applied to linear free-piston compressors for domestic refrigeration.

All of these abilities require the ability to transfer large quantities of cryogenic liquids (Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Methane) between tanks on separate vehicles. While all cryogenic rocket stages have to have a propellant fill/drain coupling for loading propellant on the ground, existing designs are not capable of in-space refuelability. A dual-purpose coupler that could be used for both ground fill/drain and for in-space refueling would be extremely valuable.In this proposed SBIR Phase II research effort, Altius Space Machines proposes continuing the development of just such a dual-purpose, lightweight, high-flow cryogenic propellant coupling to enable both ground fill/drain and in-space refueling. This coupling incorporates an innovative new cryogenic sealing architecture to enable a coupling with very low insertion/extraction forces, for manual, robotic, and astronaut-connected cryogenic propellant transfer operations. In Phase I, Altius demonstrated the innovative new cryogenic sealing architecture, and performed insertion/extraction and leak tests, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional spring-energized polymer seals, raising the TRL from 2 to 3 at the end of Phase I. In Phase II Altius will continue refinement of the cryogenic sealing architecture, and will design, fabricate, and test a family of couplers based on this architecture, and focused on an industry-provided launch vehicle application. Testing of the ground and in-space couplers during Phase II will raise the system TRL to 6, paving the way for Post-Phase II flight demonstration (yielding TRL 9).","Potential NASA applications include: 1- An integrated T-0 fill coupling for EUS that enables in-space refueling with the same coupling.

The device will automatically provide continuous and on-demand maintenance of Ag+ ion biocide levels in spacecraft water streams and storage tanks, as well as providing output data for silver concentrations and a profile of total silver added to the system over time. Considerable test work is planned under AES programs and, given silver ion's 'elusiveness' in water systems, the data will be far more reliable if the methodology for adding the biocide and measuring its concentration is performed by a reliable and flight-qualifiable design from the beginning. Phase I culminated in a validated analytical methodology and 4 flight preproduction prototype for measurement and control of silver ion at sub-ppb levels in finished waters. The Phase II Technical Objectives and Work Plan are dedicated to fabrication, test & delivery of 3 flight-qualifiable instruments that conform to spacecraft applications and specifications as defined by NASA. The specific objectives will be to 1) develop a complete analytical characterization of the detection method, inclusive of automated autocalibration and QA/QC functions, 2) develop automated machine-learning capability to support agile & reliable operation in long-duration missions, 3) demonstrate the Feedback Control Function to maintain consistent Ag+ ion concentration in active water systems, and 4) demonstrate all operating parameters required to analyze Ag+ in the ranges of 50-5000 ug/l in potable water.","Advanced Exploration Systems using silver as a biocide in water recovery and water supply systems are the primary focus of this effort.

In Phase II, ISL will optimize fabrication of the reversible sensor, develop prototype hardware having NASA-relevant footprint. The PNet-Mon prototype will be evaluated rigorously first under laboratory conditions. We have teamed with a prime contractor for testing the prototype in Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) system with the goal of integrating PNet-Mon with APH system for delivery to NASA.","PNet-Mon is intended for use in plant growth systems and chambers in space. Once integrated into NASA systems, PNet-Mon will provide vital quantitative information, in situ, about the ethylene gas levels.

In addition, the intrinsic CTE mismatch between C-C substrate and refractory carbides/oxides further limits the use of many other classical coating technologies. The successful Phase I results established the feasibility of overcoming these limitations through the use of a novel, functionally graded (FGM) coating technology. The proposed Phase II builds on the success of the Phase I program and clearly increases its TRL by offering subscale component testing at representative engine conditions. A successful Phase II program will clearly offer a new dimension in the nozzle extensions by offering different coating systems for multi-cycle capability at temperatures from 3000 F up to 4000 F.  The expected ability of the coating to survive such an aggressive testing combined with the sufficient retention of mechanical properties offers a direct path for a Phase III with many of the commercial space payload companies.

Inflatable habitats are key to reducing the weight of space structures, enabling future long term missions and planetary habitation. There is a need for monitoring the structural health of these habitats, as many of the methods used on earth are not applicable to the space environment or the materials used. To accomplish this goal, Luna has teamed with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) who is a leader in the development of CNT sensor technology. Luna is teaming with an established manufacturer to fabricate a sub-scale inflatable structure with integrated SHM sensors which will enable thorough characterization of the approach. During Phase I, the team successfully demonstrated damage detection in an inflatable prototype as well as dynamic impact detection of soft goods layers with the technologies. Phase II will focus on increasing the TRL of the sensing technologies and preparing for transition into future NASA missions. Phase III will focus on commercializing the technology with NASA and NASA affiliates.","Lightweight composites can provide not only significant mass and size savings, but also allow for more efficient and complex designs for future space vehicles and habitable structures. Use of new lightweight materials also raises a critical need to assess and monitor their structural performance. Lightweight and minimally invasive fiber optic sensors can be embedded in composites during their manufacturing process and utilized afterwards for structural health monitoring. This applies to flexible inflatable structures as well as rigid cured composite lightweight structures. High Definition Fiber Optic Sensing (HD-FOS) technology will provide NASA with a measurement technique that can report hundreds of strain or temperature measurement points along the fiber optic cable, allowing for a detailed understanding of the composite's structural reliability. Combined with piezo resistive surface sensors for impact detection, this multi-functional solution enables a wider coverage area of the structure and can improve sustainability of future crewed missions to Mars.","A multi-functional structural health monitoring technology would provide an innovative and revolutionary solution for many commercial applications. The aerospace and automotive industries are increasingly shifting towards the use of composites in design of future commercial vehicles in efforts to achieve significant weight savings to lower fuel consumption. This innovation will provide the ability to embed or surface mount lightweight fiber optic and piezoelectric sensors to a variety of composite structures and provide an unrivaled level of detail about the structure's performance for increased safety. The solution could be adapted to a variety of applications, from in-flight monitoring of composite fuselages and wings for aircrafts to in-vehicle monitoring of composite panels and springs in ground vehicles. Embedded sensors can initiate a movement towards the use of ""smart materials"" that provide information about their structural health and can detect the onset of defects or delamination prior to any visible surface damage.","Composites; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Deployment; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lifetime Testing; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Structures"

Due to this and the customized nature of satellites, existing space systems are very costly to stand up. Nor are they designed for repair, upgrade, or reuse to amortize the cost over multiple missions. As missions get further from low-earth orbit (LEO), the dangers of human extra-vehicular activity (EVA) for manual on-orbit assembly or repair increases, making robotic assembly of large structures very desirable. Honeybee Robotics (Honeybee) proposes to continue development of the Strut Attachment System (SAS) that provides a common electromechanical connection architecture for robotic on-orbit structures assembly. The SAS enables the creation of networked space frame structures with a strut/node architecture; enable payload docking to those structures for power and data transfer; and enable the creation of reusable, serviceable, and upgradable vehicle systems in support of lower cost space exploration. The proposed Phase 2 work plan is to develop the Strut Attachment System to TRL 4 with a robotic assembly demonstration of a networked structure showing power and data network connectivity. The SAS will consist of the Strut Attachment Mechanism, Strut Receptacle, Strut, and Node. Phase 2 will include furthering the development of the Strut Attachment Mechanism and Strut Receptacle, as well as beginning development of the Strut and embedded systems that enable a self-healing power and communications network across an assembled structure. The Phase 1 project resulted in a Strut Attachment Mechanism and Strut Receptacle at TRL 3 at the end of Phase 1 and Phase 2 plans will bring the SAS (Strut Attachment Mechanism, Strut Receptacle, Strut, and embedded systems) to TRL 4 at the end of Phase 2.","The SAS will be an enabling technology for future exploration missions by providing a core technology for in-space robotic assembly of: - Extended operation space exploration vehicles - Planetary exploration surface habitats - In-space transportation hubs Future exploration missions either in Earth orbit or to other planets will require large space vehicles. The optimal architecture for in-space operations may not look like a traditional space vehicle like the Space Shuttle or Apollo-era vehicles, and will be too large to assemble on the ground and launch into space directly in-space assembly will be necessary. In fact, the International Space Station is a perfect example of such a space asset. Combining the enabling capabilities of robotically assembled, networked space frame structures, with other in-space robotic technologies being developed such as the in-space refueling work going on at NASA Goddard and the Phoenix robotic servicer/tender going on at DARPA, leads to the capability to assembled large structures on-orbit, connect multiple modules to a common structure, and create very large space systems that are not possible with today's methodology.","There exist multiple defense and commercial applications for the SAS including: - Large deployable aperture arrays to address the exponential increase in global mobile data consumption - GEO hosted payload platform to provide less expensive access to space for science, defense, and commercial customers DARPA is interested in the development of a persistent platform in GEO that would provide common resources (e.g. power, communications, attitude control) to a large number of hosted payloads. Scientists, commercial entities, or defense customers many times desire an on-orbit capability, but the required investment to develop and launch the asset simply outweigh the benefits or do not mesh with budgetary constraints. What if on the payload needed to be developed and there was inexpensive access to GEO via commercial payload delivery systems such as DARPA's Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) architecture. A GEO hosted payload platform could provide significant value to numerous payloads. This GEO platform is likely to be a networked space frame structure and the proposed SAS is key to realizing that architecture. This concept has significant scientific, defense, and commercial value both for payload providers (customers) as well as the GEO host provider from a revenue perspective.","Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Structures"

In Phase II, CRG will refine the thermally-reversible polymeric materials for function as reprocessable thermosetting matrixes, and evaluate improved reclamation and additive manufacturing (AM) related processing methods for prototype demonstrations.  These materials and processes enable reclamation and repurposing of structural fiber-reinforced composites into new configurations during extraterrestrial missions, such as conversion to Additive Manufacturing (AM) feedstocks or direct fabrication into multipart constructs.  The thermally-reversible thermosets also present the opportunity to generate volumes of AM feedstock through function as a binder matrix, allowing compounding and impregnation/infusion of in-situ resources such as environmentally sourced metallic, mineralogical (i.e. regolith), and desized/milled non-reprocessable composites.  This approach will provide NASA with a means to support in-situ resource utilization with a reduced reliance on pristine raw material payloads.  CRG has already demonstrated the efficacy of thermally-reversible polymer structures in commercial adhesive applications, as well as in previous NASA technical efforts for modifying waste packaging plastics to provide improved compatibility to AM processing (NASA SBIR H14.03-9603), and in the feasibility demonstration of the Phase I effort of this project.  The proposed concept not only has the potential to enable resource reclamation and AM capability, but also to advance the state-of-the-art in AM materials technology.  CRG's proposed approach to develop thermally-reversible polymer materials for thermoset polymer reprocessing, and demonstration of reclamation and manufacturing compatibility evaluation, will provide NASA with a material and processing technology readiness level (TRL) of 5 at the conclusion of the Phase II effort.","Supporting NASA's Human Exploration Destination Systems Technology Area and LaRC, this project's technologies directly address requirements for reducing launch mass by reclaiming launched structural components into recyclable manufacturing feedstock and providing polymeric technology for utilizing in-situ resources as composite AM raw materials.  Recyclable composite materials would find potential in transport, colonization, habitat, and exploration systems. Future NASA space exploration and colonization missions will be planned to maximize available resources to enable mission success. Recyclable composites could play a significant role as an in-situ resource for those missions.  This project's technologies offer the ability to manufacture components and structures on-site as needed through reclaiming structural composites that are no longer needed, allowing for reconfiguration of those same composites to new geometries, production of AM feedstock from the desized composites, and/or application of the reclaimable composite polymer matrix as a binder resin for larger volumes of environmental sourced particulate materials. This serves to reduce overall launch cost, and provides deep space exploration with additional tools to fabricate components and structures at mission destinations.","This project's technologies, developed for NASA systems, would directly apply to systems operated by other government and commercial enterprises. Potential customers would be oriented toward emerging composite recycling markets and enhanced additive manufacturing feedstocks.Example systems include rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing of complex, low-run number, and advanced design parts for systems operated by the Department of Defense.  Prime defense contractors could find use of an enabling technology allowing 3-D printing of new and exotic polymeric materials or polymeric composites previously thought incompatible to additive manufacturing processes, including thermosetting systems.  This technology's attributes for improving the compatibility of polymers to AM systems would yield a high potential for private sector commercialization for AM and 3D printer manufactures, increasing the materials properties available in the feedstock.  Companies could dramatically expand the properties of raw materials available to consumers, create new product lines based on thermosetting material designs, and potentially be able to produce materials with custom thermal-mechanical performance on-demand.  The technology also enables businesses to additively manufacture components and systems previously impossible due to material limitations, and allows processes for the recycling and repair of composite materials previously incompatible to reuse after fabrication to first form.","Composites; In Situ Manufacturing; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Polymers; Processing Methods; Smart/Multifunctional Materials"

It had three tasks, one of which was to determine lunar surface bearing strength. Knowing the strength of the lunar surface was the single most important parameter - this essentially dictated whether landing on the Moon with significant mass like that of the Lunar Module was in fact feasible. During the Apollo program, astronauts used a Self-Recording Penetrometer (SRP) to measure geotechnical properties of lunar soil.  One of the instruments of the 1970 and 1976 Soviet Lunokhold rovers included a shear vane geotechnical tool.  Since 1976, there have been no geotechnical instruments deployed on any planetary body.  Our intent is to provide a geotechnical tool that will allow us to begin exploration again.The Apollo penetrometer approach was excellent for greater depths, while the Soviet approach worked well for the near-surface. We combine the two approaches into what we call the Stinger, a percussive shear vane penetrometer capable of measuring near-surface and subsurface soil properties to a depth of 50 cm or greater.  The objectives of Phase I were to design and build a simplified breadboard Stinger GeoTool and test it in lunar and Martian soil simulants to determine its applicability for robotic and human missions. The results of Phase I show not only accuracy and precision in determining soil properties, but also flawless execution of the breadboard design.  This paves the way for the Phase II effort.The primary objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to develop a compact impact shear vane penetrometer - the Stinger - up to TRL5/6 to determine soil physical properties near the surface and down to 50 cm depth.In conjunction with the instrument development, a soil mechanics model will be formulated based on laboratory tests with the instruments, in soil simulants, and in vacuum conditions.","Surface rover or ISRU missions: Mars2020 rover, Venus Mobile Explorer (VME), Lunar Resource Prospector.

Automation can monitor critical resources, perform routine tasks, respond to unexpected events, and manage the overall operation of on-board systems.  Crew members and flight controllers also use standard operating procedures to manage the tasks necessary to operate complex space missions. These procedures document both manual, non-automatable tasks and the interaction with automated space systems. In current NASA operations, however, automation systems and procedures are completely divorced from each other. Thus, procedures cannot start automation processes, monitor automation systems, or respond to state changes in automated systems.

While the approach of single Caution And Warning (CW) message mapped to a single response procedure may be sufficient for simple cases, for a well-connected system with inter-dependencies among the components a single component failure will likely negatively impact other components functions downstream that are dependent on the failed component. This may lead to the generation of multiple CW messages and hence the potential invocation of multiple conflicting malfunction and response and recovery procedures. QSI is proposing, with significant feedback from the NASA COR and other NASA stakeholders, on a more proactive approach that improves the CW message generation itself and produces a more appropriate, prioritized and actionable set of CW messages through the identification of the root cause failures, impact or consequence analysis of those failures and the associated risk assessment all of which are critical to the choice for the appropriate response/recovery procedure(s). The proposed solution will provide real-time capability to assess the health and its impact on the capability of a spacecraft, and utilize it to identify suitable recovery options to ensure crew safety and mission success.

However, during future space missions, flight controllers may be less available for this task, due to long communication delays during deep space missions, task overload as flight controllers manage many missions simultaneously, or reduced flight controller staffing per mission. To reduce the workload on the crew and/or flight controllers, it would be highly desirable to generate response procedures for multiple failures automatically or semi-automatically. When multiple failures occur, it seems attractive to use the procedures that were developed in advance to handle each of the individual failures. However, simply combining procedures in just any order might not work due to interactions among the faults, procedure goals, conditions, and effects. During Phase I, we began to develop the Multiple Failure Response Procedure (MFRP) System, which will automatically generate and present procedures for responding to multiple failures and ambiguity groups. The central idea of MFRP is to encode each the rationale of each procedure in a machine-readable way and to use this knowledge at run-time system to handle multiple problems and situations which may not have been specifically anticipated during procedure development. During Phase I, we developed a domain model and software prototype which generated valid responses for eight multiple failure scenarios for which naive application of single failure procedures was invalid or suboptimal, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach to multi-failure plan generation. For Phase II, we propose to extend MFRP flexibility, robustness, and ease of use. We will develop or enhance processes, models, algorithms, and software applications and tools to demonstrate the ability to handle complex domains, display multi-failure responses to users effectively, and reduce the cost and difficulty of applying MFRP to each domain.","The technology resulting from this research will generate multi-failure response procedures from single-failure procedures in real-time when multiple failures occur or when ambiguous diagnoses are returned by automated diagnostic systems. This capability will extend the range of adverse situations for which procedures can be provided to support crew members and ground-based flight controllers.

These highly reliable devices have no moving parts, operate over a large range of temperatures, and do not emit toxic or environmentally-unfriendly gases. These devices can be easily integrated into thermal energy conversion systems that meet NASA needs for innovative space power generation on orbiting platforms, extraterrestrial surfaces, and space transportation vehicles. To date, the adoption of TE generator (TEG) devices in energy scavenging/power recovery applications has been hampered by a lack of TE material compositions, no high throughput production methods for large-area conformable TEG devices, and high cost-per-unit area for tiling rigid plate TE devices. Production of large-area sheets of high-ZT TEG devices that conform to space vehicle and other relevant thermal gradient surfaces would be highly beneficial. This effort develops membrane-supported thermoelectric device manufacturing technology with in-situ sintering of high-ZT thermoelectric powders dispersed across a fiberglass sheet matrix serving as a mechanical support. The method provides intrinsic densification of the TE powders between the two faces of the fiberglass sheet and allows for large-scale conformable thermoelectric sheets to be produced with high performance at low cost.","Space power engineers can use these devices to produce custom fit power generation systems directly on surfaces with high temperature differences such as the hull of a space vehicle, satellite thermal busses, and extraterrestrial shelter materials. These large-area, integrated thermoelectric sheets will provide a means to maximize the extraction of otherwise wasted heat for both NASA and commercial applications such as automotive/aerospace exhaust systems, effluent piping, and petrochemical refining equipment. The proposed device embodiment is the only significant concept amendable to attachment to the contours and surfaces of space vehicles and as such will have a significant impact on generate power during space missions.","Unrecovered waste heat from energy-consuming industrial processes is estimated by the DOE at > 10 quads/yr (1 quad = 1015 BTU). Assuming a conservative 9 quads, 6% efficiency for TE devices constructed with our approach, 50% losses due to parasitic heat transfer losses and integration, and penetrating 10% of the waste heat market, we estimate an economically viable TE device could enable recovery of ~20 trillion BTU of waste heat/year. Additionally, the incorporation of TE devices in automobiles can improve the efficiency of their power system by up to 5%. This level of waste heat energy recovery would lower the average consumer gas consumption ~15-20 gallons with a cost savings on the order of $70?$100/year. A low-cost manufacturing solution would pay back in the first year, passing the savings onto the lifetime of the device, which based on non-moving parts, should be relatively long. The developed technology will lead to quasi-renewable energy recovery, or energy that would otherwise be radiated as waste environmental heat, resulting in a far-reaching impact on the world's energy consumption, including lowering the U.S. dependence on foreign oil.

An alternative is to form the pulse train with a mode-locked laser. However, since the resultant MLL pulse train is periodic, it must produce pulses in every symbol slot, not just once per symbol.  This means that for a 32-ary PPM scheme, the MLL optical efficiency is reduced by a factor of at least 32 by discarding the un-needed pulses.  In both cases, the electro-optic modulator itself induces an additional 60% optical loss, and requires nearly 0.5W of power to drive.  An alternative is to use a low-repetition-rate MLL in combination with a switch fabric to delay each output pulse into the correct PPM slot.  However, the use of photonic integrated circuits (e.g., silicon) is prohibitive due to the high intrinsic loss.  A 100-MHz PPM data rate scheme requires ~5ns pulse delay.  This represents 43-cm propagation in silicon, inducing a power loss over 10 dB.  Adding the loss due to spiraled delay lines, switch junctions, and coupling on/off chip, the aggregate loss of the switch fabric is 18 to 24 dB, representing a significant efficiency loss.  RAM Photonics proposes the development of a qualitatively novel approach to high-efficiency, low-bit-rate laser transmitters compatible with space-borne missions.  Specifically, we propose to develop a laser transmitter that attains highly efficiency optical data generation by (1) generating only one optical pulse per symbol at arbitrary temporal location, (2) eliminating all electro-optic modulators, and (3) exploiting new advances in fiver optic and opto-electronic packaging.  The new transmitter device has low dissipation (< 0.5 W total) and low SWaP footprint, and can operate at arbitrary data rates and generate any symbol formats.","PPM laser transmitters, particularly with ultra-low electrical power consumption and arbitrary data format, are of significant interest for many NASA programs.  The direct NASA application is a PPM laser transmitter with the following characteristics: 10-100-MHz symbol data rate; 250-ps symbol slot width, 16-128 PPM M-ary, 1540-1560 nm wavelength, 50mW average power, 25-ps pulse width, and total average power consumption less than 500 mW.  Further, the PPM transmitter developed in this program could be directly applied to small systems in near-earth orbit, such as Cubesats, and in proximity-length applications, such as orbiter-to-lander communications.   They can also be used to seed a high-power fiber amplifier for interplanetary and deep-space optical communications systems.The transmitter can also be used as the seed for LIDAR transmitters.  In conjunction with a low-jitter clock generator, the PPM pulses can be applied to mm-scale ranging for use in identifying objects and mapping contoured structures.  The technology in our commercial Cavityless pulse source results in ultra-low-loss optical pulse generation with less than 25-fs jitter, and an optical engine that adds less than 5-fs of additive jitter.","The clear first application is as a seed for long-range, high-performance LIDAR laser systems.  One specific LIDAR application is differential absorption LIDAR, which require laser sources operating at 1.57um for sensing CO2.  The technology developed in this program, although focusing on 1.5um for the particular communication application, is not specifically dependent on the wavelength of the light.  By using alternate laser diodes and fiber amplifiers (doped with Yb, Tm, or Ho instead of Er), the 1-um window can be reached as well as the 2.05-um CO2 line, which is immediately applicable to environmental and pollution monitoring. A multitude of other photon-starved applications require format-flexible PPM transmitters, such as deep-sea sensing, aircraft-to-submarine communications, secure long-range optical links, and optical wireless.  Further, we expect that the new seed source, combined with our commercial product line of fiber amplifiers (www.ramphotonics.com/products/spa-fiber-amplifier) that are currently targeted to low-noise amplification of single (solitary) pulses to high pulse energies, will generate a new flexible-format pulsed laser source that can enable new opportunities in sensing, laser accelerator drivers, medical laser therapies and surgery, and ultrafast laser material processing.",Lasers (Communication); Prototyping; Transmitters/Receivers

This antenna uses a tunable dielectric material and an array of radiating elements to create an interference pattern that steers the beam in the desired direction. This method provides moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering and similar functional performance to a traditional phased array at a fraction of the size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C).The Ka band ASM is specifically designed to be a flexible component in the communications chain. All of the interfaces to the ASM are simple, non-proprietary interfaces, and the KGS ASM is agnostic to radio, waveform, and network selections. A receiver can be readily integrated with the ASM to enable closed loop tracking, and the simple command interface of the ASM provides the communication system with the ability to easily and rapidly refine the beam position to maximize gain and ultimately improve link margins and data throughput without incurring additional power draw or mechanical stability effects.Modifications to the aperture to better integrate, survive launch, and operate in space were designed during Phase I; during Phase II, KGS plans to update the control electronics and software that drive the antenna and then build and perform RF test on the overall system to verify compliance with requirements. To date, a low-SWAP Ka-band steerable antenna for small satellites has not been successfully demonstrated in space. At the conclusion of this Phase II contract, the KGS ASM will be ready to go to space qualification testing and then a demonstration launch, where KGS will have the opportunity to prove the ASM's capability in the target environment.","This Ka-band ASM is a small, lightweight antenna which provides moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering or power-hungry phase shifters. This technology provides a high data rate communications solution for small satellites which, when paired with sensors, would provide NASA with the ability to transfer high volumes of sensor data from LEO satellites directly to the Earth via the Near Earth Network. In addition, because the frequency range of this antenna supports communication with NASA's Tracking Data Relay Satellite (TDRS), it could allow transfer of data from LEO satellites to other satellites in LEO or GEO orbits as defined in the Space Network User Guide. This technology is generally not expected to form the basis of the primary science activity on a satellite, but its ability to support the transfer of large amounts of data for relatively little size, weight, power, and cost means that it has the ability to enhance or enable a variety of NASA programs, ranging from earth observation activities to science experiments.","This antenna is appropriate for a variety of applications that require high data rate communications but do not have the funding or the weight budget to allow a phased array antenna, including university CubeSat teams, commercial companies, and government entities. This antenna is an especially good fit for entities that have low weight and power requirements, as these are areas where it performs exceptionally well compared to traditional mechanically-steered antennas as well as phased-array antennas. A variety of space-based ventures or early demonstrations that are expected to require high data rate communications have been announced recently, including Earth observation projects where the satellite itself captures large amounts of data that needs to be transferred back to the ground quickly and efficiently for analysis, as well as communications projects where a satellite acts as a node in a larger communications system and needs to be in a position to receive and transmit large amounts of data for as much of its orbit as possible.",Antennas

In Phase I, we have demonstrated the requisite performance using existing hardware coupled with off-the-shelf control electronics. Based on our results, we have designed a fully-integrated module capable of disseminating timing signals with sub-femtosecond error from 1-10,000 s. In Phase II, we will package the device and deliver it for external testing. Our system is expected to improve ground-to-satellite synchronization a million-fold over current RF-based time transfer systems, enabling applications including clock-based geodesy, very long baseline interferometry, coherent LIDAR arrays, and tests of general relativity.The Phase I breadboard demonstration performance is consistent with a timing jitter of 3 fs @ 1s and integrates down to 700 as at 30 seconds. The corresponding fractional timing instability is 3 x 10^-15 @ 1 second, which flickers at 2.7 x 10^-17 out to 2000 seconds. We have identified the systematic effects that limit both short and long term stability and incorporated the improvements into the Phase II design. With these improvements, we expect a 10x improvement in both short and long terms stability of the system.In addition, we reviewed and formalized the laser driver and control electronics specifications. The initial schematic capture for critical analog sub sections was completed and a suitable FPGA/microprocessor combination was chosen to control the system and process the timing information. Based on these designs, power and size estimates were used to complete the mechanical enclosure model for the time-transfer system. For maximum flexibility in the final architecture of the overall free-space time transfer system, each frequency comb sub-unit that includes the laser and control electronics will be housed in a 1U rack mount enclosure.",Optical atomic clocks; clock based geodesy; very long baseline interferometry; test of general relativity; deep-space navigation; coherent LIDAR,Ultra low-phase noise microwave generation; High resolution coherent radar; communication systems insensitive to jamming; extended mission duration in GPS-denied environments,"Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Guidance & Tracking); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Transmitters/Receivers; Waveguides/Optical Fiber (see also Optics)"

This software package will eliminate the computational bottleneck suffered by many standard NASA-utilized analysis tools such as GMAT, EMTG and NASTRAN. Currently these programs rely on serial nonlinear programming solvers such as the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer (SNOPT), despite the fact that their own codebases support full parallelization. The same is true for tools used in other industries for applications such as electric power grid optimization, nuclear reactor control and stock market analysis. The NLPAROPT algorithm can be quickly incorporated into these existing software solutions via a user-friendly interface and will offer an instant runtime reduction for very large-scale optimization problems. Irrespective of runtime gains, Phase I analysis has shown that the NLPAROPT algorithm is capable of outperforming industry standard serial solvers such as SNOPT for tested problems, including complex trajectory design problems. The Phase I effort has also identified several potential computational research avenues that, once completed in Phase II, will result in massive execution speed increases, further improving the attractiveness of this new parallel algorithm.","NASA currently utilizes SNOPT, IPOPT, and WORHP software packages for astrodynamics applications such as the design of complex spacecraft trajectories and other optimal control problems, but could greatly benefit from the introduction of a parallel large-scale, nonlinear, sparse optimization solution, one which does not have its speed bottlenecked by a single processor. The new parallelized NLP technique implemented in NLPAROPT has already been shown to result in a reduction in execution time, thereby reducing the optimization's turn-around time and improve communications between both designers and scientists. Our solver would act as a significant force multiplier for existing NASA tools such as GMATs collocation-based low-thrust transcription and EMTGs inner loop solver.  Additionally, NLPAROPT could improve run-times across all forms of problem optimizations, including trajectory design, resource management, attitude determination and control, and vehicle design.","Government agencies other than NASA, as well as commercial markets, would benefit from the improvements inherent in NLPAROPT, especially given the widespread use of nonlinear programming techniques as a primary method for solving some of the most difficult technical computing problems. For example, in economics the product-mix with price elasticity problem can be formulated as a nonlinear program and solved with a tool like NLPAROPT. Another field that depends heavily on efficient and robust NLP solvers is operations research, with the facility location problem and network optimization problems being archetypal examples of operation research challenges that may be cast as nonlinear programs.  Furthermore, industries dealing with problems such as power grid design, weather prediction, and crop planting optimization could benefit from NLPAROPT?s speed enhancements.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Beyond Photonics LLC's ""SWIFT"" laser was matured and largely productized, with an initial unit delivered in Phase I.  In parallel, conceptual and preliminary design and risk-reduction of a very compact short-cavity Tm,Ho:YLF Q-switched laser was achieved, which will be extended significantly in Phase II and result in a robust injection-seeded, actively pulse-stretched prototype.  The compact transmitter will include a ""nano-SWIFT"" that will have size and weight comparable to a butterfly-packaged DFB diode laser but with far better frequency stability and higher power.  In Phase II we will demonstrate output characteristics of 32 mJ, 100 Hz PRF, and 300-500 ns pulse durations from this compact robust injection-seeded transmitter.  This moderate-PRF moderate-energy transmitter will be immediately suitable for 3D winds from ground and airborne platforms and with continued TRL advancement eventually space platforms.  The transmitter will be capable of efficient operation at >4 W average power at lower pulse energies and higher PRFs (e.g.. 1 -4 kHz)  which is suitable for IPDA spectroscopy and hard target measurement lidar systems operating from space (following an appropriate engineering and qualification effort) using either coherent or direct detection with state-of-the-art low-noise direct detectors. The overarching objective of the proposed effort is to develop compact, efficient, and reliable pulsed and cw lasers and lidar transmitters for future NASA missions.  Specifically, we address needs described for 3D winds, atmospheric CO2 and H20 concentration sensing in the 2.05 um region; but we also recognize that such innovations can be readily applied to transmitter laser operation at other IR and SWIR wavelengths and associated instruments.","Potential NASA applications of the proposed compact single-frequency 2-micron laser transmitter include airborne demonstration systems for 3D winds and ASCENDS atmospheric CO2 measurement missions, as well as other NASA atmospheric spectroscopy efforts focused on the SWIR spectral region. The compact pulse-stretched transmitter developed in Phase II will match the wind measurement potential of the current NASA DAWN wind lidar operating at 100 mJ and 10 Hz, but in a much smaller and more reliable package.  The fully-functional high-power SWIFT cw laser delivered at the end of Phase I will be immediately applicable to several 2.05 um NASA remote-sensing programs, and will be available as a product from BP soon after completion of the initial Phase I effort; similarly, the ""nano-SWIFT"" will reach product maturity by the end of Phase II.  The innovations developed in this Phase I effort can inform ongoing and future NASA remote sensing programs, including 3D Winds, ASCENDS CO2 remote spectroscopy, and other programs requiring very compact, robust 2-micron lasers and associated photonic technology.  We also see this technology benefitting systems for identifying and tracking orbital space debris and other hazards from space.","Non-NASA applications of the proposed single-frequency 2-micron long-pulse, Fourier-transform-limited Q-switched transmitter laser technologies begun in Phase I and further matured in Phase II include eye-safe wind energy management lidar (winds forecasting, wind farm energy extraction optimization, and gust-front prediction), aircraft wakes detection and analysis, drone-based remote sensing applications, greenhouse gas flux remote spectroscopy, and numerous Doppler winds applications.  As noted above, the high-power and compacted SWIFT cw master oscillator sources would be made available commercially for numerous remotes sensing and spectroscopic applications.

The ideal laser source will be high performance for lidar (high pulse energy, high rep rate, short pulse duration) with specific targeted emission spectrum to meet ocean water transmittance and filtering requirements. It will also feature low SWaP and a rugged form factor with high reliability for continual use on mobile platforms. No existing laser source can meet these demanding requirements.To address this challenge and meet NASA's lidar source needs, Bridger Photonics, Inc. (Bridger) proposes creating a high power Q-switched, off-line Nd:YAG source at 946 nm, which, when frequency doubled to 473 nm, will provide high transmittance through ocean waters. Bridger's design will leverage three key innovations proven out in its Phase I effort: efficient, end-pumped, low-quantum-defect architecture; gain crystal design for optimal heat removal; and robust monolithic, alignment-free fabrication. The proposed design would allow for widespread deployment of mobile ocean-penetrating lidar transmitters.  Successful completion of this Phase II effort will allow Bridger to demonstrate >10 W of average blue power in a compact, turn-key package. Bridger has modeled and constructed similar lasers through SBIR efforts previously and will apply the innovations developed there towards this new system for NASA.","NASA's primary application for the proposed transmitter would be ocean bathymetry and underwater object detection.  The compact size, rugged design, and efficient electrical-to-optical conversion of Bridger's proposed laser would make it ideally suited for a mobile ship, airborne, or even satellite platform.  Due to larger scattering at shorter wavelengths, the 473 nm source would be favored over the traditional 532 nm source for most cloud and aerosol lidar applications.  The 473 nm beam would also work well as a general purpose OPO pump beam especially for generating green to near-IR signal waves or into the SWIR spectral band.  The former is an intermediate step towards generating the UV wavelengths used for measuring tropospheric ozone via differential absorption lidar, while the latter is useful for profiling other important greenhouse gases and pollutants such as CH4, CO2, H2O, CO, NO2, and many others.  Finally the 946 nm fundamental source would be useful for water vapor lidar.","The proposed laser would be the most compact, high-power, solid-state blue laser source currently available.  The primary market for this laser will be as an ideal lidar source for both bathymetric and aerosol lidar.  Within the lidar market there are many organizations that would be potential customers for an ocean penetrating blue lidar transmitter for bathymetry and underwater object detection: the Navy, NOAA, the EPA, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and the Coast Guard for instance. The delivered lidar system would provide the Navy with the capability to conduct rapid and widespread object detection beneath the ocean surface from an airborne platform.  Bridger envisions a wide variety of applications for this laser including gas sensing lidar, hard-target ranging, ablation applications including mass spectrometry, nonlinear spectroscopy and as general purpose OPO pump.  The proposed transmitter could easily be adapted to detect a host of gasses, most of which are detected in the short wave infrared and mid-infrared spectral regions and are well suited to a seeded OPO pumped either with the 946 or 473 nm beam.",Lasers (Ladar/Lidar)

A number of innovations will be introduced to the ADC in order to combine low power consumption with high signal to noise and distortion (SINAD), and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). The proposed ADC will employ a novel timing calibration and interleave randomizing techniques which permit minimizing the peak energy of the spurs and increasing linearity. The proposed ADC chip will include a frequency synthesizer and a standard compliant configurable JESD204B interface for data exchange with an FPGA. The ADC will be implemented using a deep submicron CMOS technology. The project's Phase I confirmed the feasibility of implementing the proposed ADC. Phase II will include finishing design, fabrication, testing and delivering the ADC prototypes which will be ready for commercialization in Phase III.","The low-power radiation hardened 20GSps 6-bit ADC with a novel calibration technique capable of suppressing the peak energy of the spurs has great potential in current and future NASA microwave radiometers. In addition to its primary application, the proposed ADC ASIC is directly applicable to systems that require direct digitization of wide bandwidth RF signals, such as deep space communication radios and reconfigurable radios for SDR applications. NASA missions using Ku band, such as OIB (airborne program for precise sea and ice elevation monitoring) will also benefit from the proposed high-speed ADC optimized to be used for direct digitizing purposes.","In addition to its primary application in spectral radiometry systems, the proposed wideband 20GS/s ADC and its building blocks will be targeting other commercial and military related markets which require high speed capture and digitization of wideband signals. Commercial applications include wireless (WiMAX, 3G, 4G) and fiber optic communication (10G Ethernet). The projected ramp-up of 100G Ethernet technologies will raise the industry demand for capable test equipment. High sampling rate provides the flexibility needed for such equipment. Therefore, it has great commercialization potential in this market segment. Potential military applications include high speed, secure communication and data transmission systems, and millimeter-resolution radars. Radiation hardness will secure a great demand for the proposed ADC in high energy and nuclear physics instruments, commercial communication and military satellites and nuclear power facilities.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage)"

It will operate at 35.7 GHz, have 400 MHz bandwidth, and output greater than 32 watts with 35 dB gain. It employs a two-stage depressed collector, allowing prime efficiency of 50%. Comparable solid state power amplifiers have 15% efficiency and output only 7 W. klystrons are the only amplifier technology that can be miniaturized to this degree.  Volume with power conditioner and driver is less than 0.500 cm3, half the allowed space. It uses a breakthrough ultra-miniature scandate cathode capable of 100A/cm2 at 1000 degrees C and 5A/cm2 at less than 800 degrees C. At this temperature, life is more than 100,000 hours. The klystron uses cathode ray tube construction, which lowers weight, size and cost (two to five times less than standard brazed ceramic-metal construction). Parts are fastened via glass rods or mechanical capture or by spot welding. Most parts are standard off-the-shelf, which further lowers cost. It uses a glass vacuum envelope, glass feedthroughs, combination RF window-coupler and barium getters to maintain vacuum.  In Phase I we successfully built two beam testers. In Phase II we construct an entire amplifier package in CubeSat volume. E  beam, inc. is a leader in innovative miniature cathodes, electron guns and vacuum electron devices generally. It has long promoted cathode ray tube construction as a way to mass produce medium power microwave tubes.","A major objective of NASA's Science Mission Directorate is to use smaller, more affordable spacecraft.  Another goal is multiple experiments on the same launch.  This lowers cost and risk.  The rapid deployment of small, low-cost remote sensing instruments is essential in meeting these objectives.  It has an explicit mission to reduce the risk, cost, size and development time of SMD observing instruments. This invention meets all those requirements and will find a ready market in NASA earth satellite missions.","CubeSats are the enabling technology for space research by universities.  This device will provide them with remote sensing capability of clouds, the ionosphere, other satellites, and earth features.The larger commercial application is its potential for communications.  Not only klystrons but broadband TWTs can be fabricated at a fraction of the cost of standard TWTs using this construction technology.  There is an important market between 100 and 1000 watts not adequately addressed.  These are powers too high for solid state to address efficiently.  The power is too low for standard ceramic-metal tube construction to address cost effectively.  The dollars/watt is too high.  Glass electrostatically focused TWTs and klystrons with glass rod fastening can be manufactured at one-fifth the cost of ceramic-metal tubes.  There are 300,000 cell towers in the U.S.  Frequency and power need to go up.

Suitably compact, light-weight and power efficient heterodyne instruments are required to enable polarimetric measurements for microphysical parameterization of ice clouds applicable to NASA's planned Aerosol, Cloud and Ecosystems (ACE) mission. Through the Phase 1 effort, VDI demonstrated the feasibility of an integrated 640 GHz polarimetric receiver. This included the demonstration of a 670 GHz LNA module and an OMT, each being compatible with full integration with the mixer diode based down-convertor. Goals of the Phase II include optimization of the OMT, development and evaluation of a fully integrated 670 GHz polarimeter, development of evaluation procedures to ensure the polarimeter meets NASA requirements, and development of a second prototype at 325 GHz to demonstrate the scaling of the technology. The estimated specifications of the 670 GHz prototype include receiver noise temperature ~6,000K (SSB at the horn aperture), power requirement 6W, volume ~1.5? x 1.5? x 0.75?. The goal isolation between polarizations is 20 ? 25 dB. Both integrated polarimeters will be delivered to NASA GSFC. Through Phase III, VDI will ensure that the technology is extended throughout the frequency range of interest for NASA?s atmospheric missions, roughly 100 GHz through about 1 THz.","The result of the Phase 2 effort will include the delivery of two sensitive and highly integrated receiver systems with polarimetric measurement capabilities, operating at ~670 GHz and ~325 GHz. Their compact size and excellent sensitivity will demonstrate the value of innovative integration technologies that are described throughout the proposal. Additionally, Phase III efforts VDI will extend this technology throughout the frequency range of interest for atmospheric studies, roughly 50 GHz to 1 THz. The integrated receivers that will become available through this research will greatly improve the performance and reliability of airborne radiometers such as CoSSIR, while also enabling the development of more compact satellite receiver systems for programs such as ACE and CAPPM. CubeSats that are playing an expanding role in NASA?s future atmospheric missions will be enabled by the compact size and low power requirements. Deep space probes that study the atmospheres of planets and their satellites will also be enabled.","In addition to scientific applications such as atmospheric studies, plasma diagnostics and molecular spectroscopy; commercial test and measurement systems will benefit from this project. VDI presently markets a product line of frequency extenders for vector network analyzers (VNAs) and spectrum analyzers (SAs) for all frequency bands from 50 GHz through 1.5 THz. The technology developed through this project will allow VDI to develop more compact, cost effective and reliable frequency extenders. The reduced size will make the extenders more useful for a variety of applications, such as antenna test ranges and on-wafer probing. Antenna testing, in particular, will benefit from the availability of polarimetric receivers. Other applications include imaging systems for portal security and industrial process control. Finally, integration will not only reduce system size, but will also increase reliability, and, over the long term, reduce costs.

Apart from the detector, the performance of these FPAs is determined by the Read-Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) that amplifies and multiplexes photo generated charge for signal processing by peripheral circuitry.In this project, we propose to develop a new ROIC for low background applications, specifically designed to overcome present limitations of image persistence and inter-pixel capacitance (IPC). The main innovation in this project is an adaptive unit cell that can be individually and randomly programmed via on-chip logic to control bias state and reset duration of any pixel in the array while the integration of science data is on-going.In Phase I we conducted a pixel trade study and performance evaluation for a Capacitive Trans-Impedance Amplifier (CTIA) and a source follower per detector (SFD) type pixel using analog circuit simulations. Then we generated the optimum unit cell layout, defined the overall architecture and created the top-level schematic. By the end of Phase I we have completed the blue prints for the design. The completion of the top-level schematics, verified through simulation, is a critical milestone in the development. It substantially reduces the risk associated with creating new ROIC technology and will allow us to efficiently fabricate and test the device in Phase II. All results from Phase I are documented in a preliminary Interface Control Document (ICD) so that the new ROIC can be considered for future missions.In Phase II we will produce the layout of the entire chip for fabrication using stitching lithography in a state of the art CMOS foundry and demonstrate its functionality on packaged prototypes. By the end of Phase II, wafers of a known functioning ROIC design will be available for hybridization.","Infrared Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) fabricated using this SBIR proposal's high performance, large format, and flexible ROIC will be a key sensor for nearly all NASA space missions which require high resolution infrared imaging and low read noise for low background applications.  The specific applications include:- Space based observations particularly where low noise is a requirement (for example deep space).  - Ground based space observations- All missions that require infrared spectroscopy (and hence typically low backgrounds and low noise), including remote sensing.- Space and ground based adaptive optics applications where low noise is key.  These devices are used to correct for the turbulent media between the detector and the target of observation. It is assumed that either a small portion of the large array can be used for this purpose (engineering grade array potentially) or a new design performed using the building blocks developed on this program.It is expected that leading IR FPA vendors such as Teledyne, Raytheon, DRS, United Technologies will be interested in this device for various applications.","There are many applications for FPAs made using this innovative ROIC, mostly in the 1-2.5 m region (low backgrounds).  It is useful for low noise apps and the larger formats appropriate for astronomy will be relatively expensive.  Smaller formats, larger volumes including linear arrays can be built using the same circuitry.  Potential apps are - Emission detection due to hot e-'s, leaky junctions, defects, latchup.  Systems exist in the commercial markets that detect emissions from semiconductors requiring very low noise/large format FPAs.  Spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging in industrial applications such as machine vision and process control:  The incoming radiation is separated into several wavelengths and from the characteristics of the spectra, problems can be observed, identified, processes controlled. Medical - reflected near-IR/Short Wave-IR wavelengths can provide information on skin/tissue conditions and pathology. - Applications in Biotechnology - small signal fluorescence spectroscopy is used for information capture, e.g. genome sequencing.- Agricultural inspection - e.g. looking at relative moisture content or reflected sunlight for the health of the crops. Our device would be needed in low background apps where the existing systems would not be sensitive enough.- Solar cell inspection - The FPA here would bring more sensitivity compared to existing systems.

Because FLEXEMS is inherently a stand-off instrument requiring no consumables, it requires no complicated sample-handling under most situations and can take a variety of different form-factors to suit the mission architecture: flow-through measurements of extraterrestrial water or melted ices implemented in microfluidic packaging; surface measurements of ices or minerals; integrated into optical microscopes; etc. Because FLEXEMS requires no consumables, it could be used indefinitely making it especially well-suited for long-duration missions where it could serve as both a primary instrument or a triage instrument for other instruments that may have a limited number of uses. Target extraterrestrial bodies FLEXEMS would be ideal to explore include Europa, Enceladus, comets and asteroids, Mars, and the permanently-shadowed craters of Moon. Additionally, its miniature size makes it suitable for Small- Sat missions to study organics such as O/OREOS. For terrestrial use, it will allow researchers in NASA's Space Science and Astrobiology Division to quantify the presence of different minerals and organics during analog field research and laboratory research and can integrate well into the NASA Ames Astrochemistry Facility.","FLEXEMS has many uses outside of NASA. Due to its sensitivity, specificity, and portability, it would be very useful for (1) environmental research of terrestrial and marine waters (e.g., DOM, humic and fulvic acid studies, aromatic pollutants), (2) process control and monitoring of closed and recycled water systems (e.g., Naval or cruise shipboard water monitoring, water treatment, municipal water recycling plants), (3) pollution monitoring of water, soils and sediments (e.g., BTEX, PAHs, pesticides, and fuels), (5) the detection of biological weapons (e.g., Anthrax). Considering only (1) and (2), it is anticipated that total 5- year revenue may be as high as $20M.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Biological Signature (i.e., Signs Of Life); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Ultraviolet; Visible"

Scintillators are materials that generate a light flash with an intensity that is proportional to the ionizing energy deposited.  However, scintillator efficiency gradually decays with increased exposure to radiation.  For exploration missions to hostile environments, such as those around Jupiter, Venus or Mercury, large ionizing doses are expected for the scintillation material, rendering them useless.  A common practice to mitigate dose effects is to anneal the scintillation materials.  In addition, sensitivity, dictated by detector volume, is critical for science missions, such mapping H2O concentration over a planetary surface.  This project will develop a scintillator module using advanced materials, such as Cs2LiYCl6(CLYC), LiSr2I5 (LSI), or Tl2LiYCl6 (TLYC), that provide both high-performance gamma ray and neutron spectroscopy within a single volume.  Si photomultipliers (SiPM) will maximize the active volume relative to the total volume.  The project will result in a large-volume, high-performance detector module, rigorously tested for flight, with protocols for annealing and science operation","The development of this technology will serve instruments for planetary science missions.  In the latest planetary science Decadal Survey (DS), gamma ray and neutron spectrometers are explicitly slated for a potential New Frontiers mission to complete a Trojan Tour and Rendezvous.  The DS also highlights the need for increased sensitivity and reduction of mass for neutron/gamma spectrometers, which are both directly addressed by the small form factor for scintillation detectors, and the sensitivity improvements outlined above. These detectors could also be used to examine the surface of comets, the moon, and/or Venus in support of other DS recommended New Frontier Missions: Comet Surface Sample Return, Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return, Lunar Geophysical Network, and Venus In Situ Explorer.  These potential missions could be proposed later in 2016 and onward.  As a case in point, RMD is participating in the development of a neutron detector using CLYC for the LunaH Map mission for mapping out the lunar southern pole hydrogen content, particularly within permanently shadowed regions.  RMD, as a subcontract to Arizona State University, is a part of the RAMA (volatile Resources, neutron Albedo, and MApping of hydrogen) proposal, and if awarded, will start early 2017.  Though both of these missions are planned with photomultiplier tubes (as opposed to the SiPMs proposed here), advances in this project may be directly translated to these missions.","The robust testing required for space flight leads to a high-quality terrestrial instrument that will have uses for military and homeland security applications.  Scintillation detectors are used in security applications where temperature conditions fluctuate and handling is rough, which is also valid for oil-well logging.  For other applications, such as radiation monitors at nuclear reactors, the radiation tolerance must be high as the instruments can be exposed to low-doses for multiple years. Our technology will be an excellent fit for Personal Radiation Detectors (PRD), Spectroscopic Radiation Detectors (SPRD), in Radioisotope Identification Devices (RIIDs), Area Monitors, and in Stand-off detectors.",Composites; Ionizing Radiation; X-rays/Gamma Rays

Therefore in situ measurements of absorption and backscattering, as functions of wavelength, along with in situ and satellite radiometery, are key to refinement and calibration of legacy ocean color algorithms, as well as development of next generation ocean color products such as phytoplankton functional type. Currently, commercial instruments exist for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral absorption coefficient, but no instrument exists for measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient. We propose to develop an active sensor for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient. The proposed instrument will use a broadband halogen lamp source, servo-controlled linear variable filters as spectral bandpass elements in transmit and receive optics, and a photomultiplier tube detector with integrated low-noise amplifier and variable gain. The proposed instrument addresses a critical gap in the field of currently available systems for measuring hyperspectral IOPs in situ, in support of hyperspectral ocean color missions.","The proposed novel sensor for measuring hyperspectral backscattering has wide applicability in the field of ocean optics and ocean biology and biogeochemistry. There are currently no instruments available that make this measurement. NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers,especially those working on risk reduction and optical IOP-radiometric closure studies as well as phytoplankton functional group algorithms, and increasingly complex biogeochemical and ecosystem models are currently hindered by a lack of ground truth hyperspectral backscattering data. Given the current push within NASA programs in preparation for launch of the PACE ocean color mission and EXPORTS field campaign, development of this system is very timely.","Similar to the NASA applications, the target market for the proposed instrument is broad.

Potential missions include the Origin Space Telescope and the Superconducting Gravity Gradiometer.  Cooling loads for these detectors will range from 50 mW to 500 mW at the primary load site, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems.  Due to jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is required for many missions.  In addition, a multi-stage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency with the lowest mass.  To address this need, we plan to develop and demonstrate a two stage turbo-Brayton cryocooler that provides refrigeration at 10 K, with additional cooling at 50 to 70 K.  On the Phase I project, we optimized the performance of an existing cryocooler and measured its performance.  During the proposed Phase II project, we plan to optimize key cryocooler components for operation in a 10 K cryocooler, and demonstrate the performance of the advanced technology through demonstrations at cold load temperatures of 10 K and below.  We will use these test results to develop a design for a fully optimized, flight cryocooler for a particular NASA mission class.","The successful completion of this program will result in the demonstration of an extremely efficient low temperature cryocooler with negligible vibration.

The DSCS Program builds off the previous successes of the USAF ""MicroSat Cryocooler System (MCS)"" Program (FA9453-14-C-0294).  The DSCS extends the Miniature Low Cost Cryocooler Electronics (mLCCE) performance reducing size, weight and power of the deep-space rad-hard integrated circuits.  The DSCS enhances the thermo-mechanical unit with a new inertance tube and regenerator packing to optimize the cryocooler design for 35K cold-tip and 150K heat rejection temperatures. To achieve this higher performance, the DSCS cryocooler is based on the Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) TRL-6 High Power Microcryocooler. LMSSC's initial trade study shows the predicted performance of the High Power coldhead is significantly better than the standard coldhead.  This is largely due to a greater regenerator volume, and thus greater regenerator heat capacity.  The High Power coldhead heat exchangers are slightly larger, increasing their effectiveness and improving performance. In addition, Iris proposes the Phase I electronics design will be reviewed against sample planetary mission parts lists in Phase II.  The uLCCE provides a mission-critical, radiation tolerant system solution, easily extendible to a radiation hardened flight platform.","There are currently very few cryocooler applications utilizing a cryogenic heat rejection temperature, mainly because, until recently, there have been no long-life cryocooler compressors capable of operating at cryogenic temperatures.  However, the recent demonstration of extended operation of Lockheed Martin's microcryocooler compressor at temperatures as low as 130 K has opened up new deep space cryocooler applications utilizing the capability of rejecting heat at very low temperature; for example, cooling JPL's MISE spectrometer for the Europa mission.  Having a proven cryocooler technology will very likely generate interest in designing cryogenic missions utilizing very low heat rejection temperatures to improve cooler efficiency, reduce the required electrical power and rejected heat, reduce the cryocooler size and mass, and enable cooling at lower cold tip temperatures.It is also very likely that cryocooler systems will be developed that make use of this proposed cooler in new cooling configurations. For example, the proposed cooler could be mated to more traditional second cooler which would provide the 150K or lower heat rejection temperature, potentially leading to greater system efficiency, since both coolers could be independently optimized.","The recently announced GeoCARB mission by NASA is a prime example of how the advances of a NASA-sponsored development can lead directly to a commercialization success. Our Iris Technology/Lockheed Martin team is a selected GeoCARB Mission Partner and we expect DSCS Phase II to offer a similar path to commercialization. In NASA's own words; ""By demonstrating GeoCARB can be flown as a hosted payload on a commercial satellite, the mission will strengthen NASA's partnerships with the commercial satellite industry and provide a model that can be adopted by NASA's international partners to expand these observations to other parts of the world."" Our advancements in size, mass and power reductions in DSCS Phase II will make the payload even more attractive for commercial partnerships.Other non-NASA applications include: cryo-pumps for semiconductor manufacturing, radio astronomy, SQUID magnetometers for heart and brain studies, HTS filters for the communication industry, liquefaction of industrial gases, superconducting magnets for MRI systems, superconducting magnets for power generation and energy storage, and superconducting electronics.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors)"

Interest is also for IR/FIR missions requiring 8-meter or larger diameter mirrors with cryogenic deformations <100 nm RMS. Fantom Materials is specifically responding to the need for ultra-stable mirror support structure traceable to the needs of Cosmic Origins for UVOIR, Exo and FIR telescopes, including mirror support structures, whiffle plates, delta frames and strongbacks. HoneySiC material has multiple features that make it very attractive as a potential future deployment hinge and latching material: 1) It's an additively manufactured Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) with no Coefficient of Moisture Expansion (CME). Individually molded parts become a monolithic construct, thus it is possible to manufacture an entire telescope using HoneySiC, 2) It's extremely light weight (HoneySiC panels have about 1/5 the density of beryllium, 3) It's extremely dimensionally stable due to a zero-CTE across a temperature range of -196C to RT. The thermal conductivity can be supercharged by addition of carbon nanotubes. The overarching program objective is to demonstrate HoneySiC as an ultra-stable structural telescope material. In Phase I, Fantom measured CTE and mechanical properties for HoneySiC HCMC and H2CMN to bring the basic material properties measurements closer to completion.

The key innovations are the use of a new interferometric modality and a novel non-contact optical probe that together measure high surface slope acceptance angles to nanometer sensitivity. When the probe is integrated with a precision motion, x, y, & z metrology frame, it will meet NASA's need to measure free-form optical surfaces from 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameter ranging from F/2 to F/20, including slopes up to 20 degrees (with potential for 60 degrees), with an uncertainty targeted at 2 nm RMS. The probe operation does not require tilting to measure slopes. This results in this simplified cartesian metrology frame, also critical to achieve 2 nanometer measurement uncertainty. These features: nanometer resolution and 20 degree slope acceptance angle, have up to this time not been found in a single probe or sensor, non-contact or contact. This Phase II proposal takes the probe and its innovative spectrally controlled light source into a production prototype level capable of meeting NASA metrology goals.","Free-form optics, both axially and non-axially symmetric, enable small and lightweight imaging and projection optical systems required by NASA. ""Future NASA missions with alternative low-cost science and small-sized payloads are constrained by the traditional spherical form optics. These could benefit greatly by the free-form optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements"". This application aims to enable those optics to be manufactured to the required tolerancesto enable free-form optics to be used as envisioned. As of today there are no metrology tools available to meet the 2 nm RMS measurement uncertainty required to meet these mission requirements. Thus the primary road block to manufacturing high performance free form optics is metrology. The PROBE developed in the previous Phase I projects and to be implemented in this Phase II is a unique approach that combines non-contact interferometric sensitivity with high surface slope acceptance. Thus the accuracy, speed and data density required for free form optics will be achieved. This combination will enable optical manufacturers to meet NASA's need to acquire nanometer level free-form optics.","The use of free-form optics in commercial applications is potentially massive, yet limited by the availability of high performance metrology. Cell phones, tablets, computers and remote mounted cameras utilize axially symmetric free-forms. Improved metrology means improved performance and higher manufacturing yields, and potentially lower manufacturing costs. Further, machine vision, security and defense related applications could benefit from free-form optics. New telescope designs at MIT Lincoln Laboratory promise wider fields of view with higher lateral resolution. Again metrology is lacking to produce these optics in the surface accuracy, data density and speed required to be commercially viable. Regarding illumination, higher efficiency lighting will bring more pleasant work environments and lower energy usage. Even for apparently mundane applications such as automotive headlamp lenses metrology is a limiting factor due to the extreme shapes.

The novel TAPS technology has no hot moving parts and incorporates well proven, reliable linear motors and alternators in an engine based on the Stirling cycle.  NES has designed, optimized, built and tested all sub-systems for reliability, ease of manufacturing and cost reduction over currently available Stirling engines.  The 1kWe TAPS formed the starting design for scaling down to a ~300 W tunable power thermoacoustic device.

Due to the significant manufacturing and assembly cost reductions afforded by the TAPS architecture over traditional Free Piston Stirling (FPS) systems, the TAPS solution could be used as a direct replacement over traditional thermoelectric or other Stirling based systems in space missions.Furthermore, the TAPS technology enables architectures that are difficult, or impossible, with other systems. Specifically, TAPS can easily be utilized for a combined power and cooling duplex, and some preliminary designs have been created. Such systems would enable a sustained presence in extreme planetary environments such as the surface of Venus. This can be achieved using radioisotope heating for long term missions or chemical heating for shorter duration missions.","Nirvana Energy Systems is currently working to commercialize the NASA technology through an exclusive patent license granted for the Alpha-STREAM technology that the TAPS technology is partially based on. The NES TAPS technology could be easily adapted to home use where high efficiencies are possible and the unit would function as a micro-Combined Heating and Power system.  In an installation such as this, the TAPS unit could be natural gas fed where to achieve overall high system efficiencies the unit would utilize excess heat to provide heated water for potable needs or for hydroponic heating. Excess electrical energy production would be sent to the grid.Similar to application for home power generation, other applications include commercial businesses, military uses (manned/unmanned vehicles and domesticated areas), and the transportation industry. In particular, these industries desire higher electrical outputs and the validity of the TAPS architecture afforded by this Phase I effort would offer strong evidence in the scale-ability of the technology. Moreover, the reverse cycle of the TAPS system can be used for cooling in many cases, including as a refrigerant free domestic cooling system.",Conversion; Generation

The approach with MVP, rather than using exotic propellants to achieve maximum specific impulse and system performance, is to use an inexpensive, inert, solid propellant. This enables the use of a propulsion system on lower budget missions by lowering the unit cost (no valves or pressure vessels), and minimizes range safety expenses. By using a commercially available, space rated polymer as propellant, MVP overcomes potential issues associated with liquid propellants such as freezing, over-pressurization, degradation (of tank wall and/or propellant itself), and cg perturbations due to sloshing. As a result, MVP's standalone risk to the primary payload is no greater than that of a CubeSat not equipped with propulsion. MVP harnesses technology used in 3D printing applications to feed propellant into proven electrothermal propulsion technology developed by CU Aerospace. To date, MVP has demonstrated a continuous 105 seconds specific impulse with 20 W input power, with 107 seconds peak. Phase II performance is expected to exceed 130 seconds. This should provide 900 N-s total impulse with a 1U (10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) system, attributable to the high storage density and permissible thin walled construction. A 4 kg, 3U CubeSat equipped with MVP could achieve 250 m/s Delta-V while expending less than 25 W during operation. CU Aerospace will design, fabricate, and deliver a 1U MVP system to NASA at the end of the Phase II program.","The MVP thruster system supports the NASA Roadmap for In-Space Propulsion Systems, nonchemical propulsion. MVP offers CubeSats and other small satellites a propulsion capability sufficient for various orbital maneuvers with several millinewtons of thrust requiring minimal thrust-control ACS and a minimal volume and system integration cost. The baseline MVP, occupying a 1U volume, has minimal impact on the CubeSat bus and payload. The solid propellant has no handling, storage, or operational restrictions beyond those of the CubeSat. The ease of handling and storage for the solid propellant can extend operation to planetary missions with no additional monitoring or controls.","The MVP thruster will provide a compact, light-weight, non-hazardous, propulsion technology solution that will be made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in DOD, industry, and academia for CubeSat and small-satellite missions. MVP will require no safety equipment for storage, transportation, integration, and testing, and place no demanding requirements on the launch provider, making it an ideal low-cost solution for industry, research, and academic small-satellite propulsion needs.","Fuels/Propellants; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Current methods include hitching rides as secondary payloads. Although this initiative has provided significant new launch capacity for CubeSat-class spacecraft, it is not without issues, most specifically limited orbits and orbital lifetime. Many missions need higher orbits to perform their missions; and lower orbits are subject to atmospheric drag that may cause premature reentry. Safe and affordable miniaturized propulsion can overcome these limiting factors and is a high-visibility capability sought by the CubeSat community. Even basic capabilities to push in one direction will allow nanosats to remain in orbit longer, or allow a satellite placed into low-Earth orbit to propel itself to a higher or more circular orbit. In Phase I, Plasma Processes designed, fabricated and delivered to NASA a miniaturized propulsion system compatible with non-toxic HAN- and ADN-based green monopropellants for small spacecraft propulsion. In Phase II, the green propellant thrusters will be tested will both monopropellants for pressure fed and pump fed 1U propulsion modules. The use of advanced, non-toxic propellants will increase mission capabilities including longer mission durations, additional maneuverability, increased scientific payload space, and simplified launch processing. Adding propulsion will also enable de-orbiting of the satellite after completion of the mission.","Potential NASA Applications include small spacecraft and satellite missions requiring Orbit change & Attitude Control, Precision Propulsion, Formation Flying and Target Reentry. Examples of future mission implementation are next-generation Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology Satellite (FASTSAT); Lunar Flashlight; NEA Scout; and SLS secondary payloads.","Commercial application of the technology will provide safe and affordable miniaturized propulsion to support the emerging small, micro- and nano- satellite community; and small satellite constellations to provide global internet and mapping by joint ventures including SpaceX/Google, TerraBella (Skybox), Planet Labs and One Web LLC.

The effects of EMI can be detrimental to electronic systems utilized in space missions; even small EMI issues can lead to total mission failure, resulting in significant mission delays and economic loss. Additionally, NASA is challenged to find ways of effectively shielding sensitive electronic equipment from EMI without adding significant weight to space flight vehicles and satellites in order to manage fuel costs. The solution for both issues resides in the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which offer the most promising solution for reducing spacecraft wire weight. CNTs are an alluring alternative to conventional conductors used in coaxial data cables because they combine mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and low density. DexMat has developed a novel CNT deposition process for directly applying CNTs onto dielectric materials to produce an electrically conductive EMI shield. By placing a premium on the quality of raw CNTs, DexMat has created a product with increased potential to reduce cable weight while minimizing insertion losses when incorporated into wire. In the proposed research, DexMat seeks to develop a small-scale CNT Tape production process and continue the development of the CNT separation processes. The need for CNT Tape was discovered while obtaining feedback from potential customers that noted the desire for a product format that allows for quick and easy integration into existing manufacturing processes without the need for outsourcing processes.","Lightweight CNT shielded cables would provide a significant cost-effectiveness by reducing weight in space applications. DexMat technology offers a significant weight reduction, up to 80%, in these wires resulting in a noteworthy cost savings for launched vehicles. Given the tremendous costs associated with satellite launches, the NASA will see significant savings from our CNT-based wire.","Commercial and military aerospace companies are seeking opportunities to reduce weight on their aviation and space platforms to improve range and lower operating costs. Fuel costs are one of the biggest concerns among commercial airlines. Reducing exposure to fuel costs is a significant priority for all operators of aircraft and space systems. A large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 747 uses approximately 135 miles of wire, weighing over 4,000 pounds, about half of this weight comes from wire shielding components. Significant weight reductions could save millions of dollars per plane over its operating lifetime.DexMat technology is extremely versatile and may be applied in a variety of industries and lead to enhancements of numerous products.  After showing successful integration into the aviation manufacturing industry, DexMat plans to expand CNTs into the textile, sensors and medical devices, electronics, energy storage and structural industries. CNTs offer significant improvements to existing technologies in these industries and could outperform current state-of-the-art products on the market.","Cables/Fittings; Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Nanomaterials"

To the extent that the power will be generated by solar panels, cube satellites have a limited round trip energy budget. Increasing solar panel efficiency and complexity alleviates the energy issue to some degree. Both however, occur at the expense of the original cube satellite advantages of being inexpensive, small, and reliable. As such, the objective of high power capabilities must also assume fairly short time scales in order to preserve the energy budget. It's this mode of operation, maximum energy and short high power events, where hybrid system designs typically make practical sense.In all cases, the energy storage requirements will depend on the payloads power profile and mission requirements. Cube satellite payloads are becoming more sophisticated and, in many cases, power hungry. Interesting high power payloads currently in development for small satellites include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and mechanical actuators for performing larger satellite maintenance. In order to continue the trend of increasing cube satellite capabilities, it's important to be ready with energy storage that is both capable of supplying high power and flexible to suit the range of payload possibilities.The hybrid ultracapacitor module proposed is a flexible, high efficiency, novel design that will enable satellite engineers to quickly and easily realize benefits such as extended battery lifetime, high peak power, and smaller size and weight that may be possible through a hybrid energy storage system. Additionally, the technology will translate to additional multifunctional, structural applications such as microsatellites, light aircraft, ordinance, and many more.","Hybrid ultracapacitor power supplies enable high power density well beyond traditional capabilities of bulk Li-Ion battery storage. The targeted application that this proposal will focus on is a high power (> 100W) HPS for integration into CubeSats. The CubeSat platform was chosen for its inherent size and weight restrictions and as a relatively low cost and standardized platform for this new technology. Future development of ultracapacitor based HPS systems will leverage the size, weight, and performance benefits demonstrated on the CubeSat platform for expansion into larger more powerful systems. Beyond cube satellites, hybrid power systems have applications in which there are high peak power but relatively low average power demands. Such systems include microsatellites, motor actuation, stage separation, burst radar and communication systems, and pulsed laser systems. The multifunctional structural technology included in the ultracapacitor cell and module design have numerous NASA applications. Multifunctional energy storage design seeks to improve overall energy and power density by incorporating energy storage into devices that traditionally serve a different function. The cell under development is a structural cell that may be incorporated into structures such as airplane housings for light electric aircraft, satellite frames, actuator casings, and many more. With a high temperature chemistry, the cell may also be used for heat sinking and back-up power storage.","The cube satellite platform is a fast growing market both in academia and industry. Many companies are also growing to develop larger microsatellites as the technology and business is proven on cube satellites. This technology is easily translated to all cube satellite and microsatellite developers. Beyond satellites, the multifunctional structural technology has garnered a significant amount of interest by other government groups and companies for a wide range of application. The structural technology is able to conform to custom shapes to provide high efficiency, long life cycle energy storage in areas where it was impractical to do so previously. For example, the cell may be shaped to conform to void spaces in small aircraft such as drones and ordinance missiles. With FastCap's high temperature electrode and electrolyte, the same technology can be used as heat sinks for power loss back up supplies on memory and computation boards. With the progression of light aircraft and electric automobiles, the structural cell is being considered to drastically improve system level energy and power density. Additionally, long lifetime and ultra-high reliability system such as smart weaponry and land mines are beginning to realize the benefits of a ruggedized structural cell for pulse communication, actuation, and ignition. FastCap is aggressively pursuing all of these opportunities with Phase II funding a critical element in achieving their technological goals.","Actuators & Motors; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Conversion; Distribution/Management; Manufacturing Methods; Nanomaterials; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Storage; Structures"

It is based on the commercial SuperSwift airframe and SwiftCore Flight Management System, which have been proven in the field to provide a cost-effective, powerful, and easy-to-operate solution to meet the demanding requirements of nomadic scientific field campaigns. The airframe capabilities will be expanded to achieve high altitude flights through strong winds and damaging airborne particulates. The SuperSwift's well-documented power and data interfaces will be employed to integrate the sensors required for the measurement of atmospheric volcanic phenomenon that will have broader applications for atmospheric research.The atmospheric models that are employed by dispersion studies provide information that can affect human safety. Examples not only include volcanic ash aviation hazards, but pollution alerts, toxic releases, dust storms and wildfire smoke hazards that often depend on the accuracy of these models. Accurate data input from the location as well model validation are needed for these important safety systems. Even basic atmospheric conditions such as wind and temperature are estimated or modeled from nearest weather stations that could be far from the location of interest and at limited elevations. Ground systems, manned aircraft, balloons and even dropsondes supply this data but have limitations.

These key potential customers would all benefit from the measurements provided by this system in various atmospheric conditions using different sensor payloads which, by design, are easily interchangeable. These key customers represent strategic activities within NASA including the Atmospheric Composition Focus Area, the Carbon Cycle & Ecosystems focus area, and the Weather focus area.","Key potential customers in other government agencies include NOAA, DOE and NSF. Public entities funded by these government agencies such as UCAR and NCAR are also important customers. Black Swift Technologies has engaged with multiple researchers at these organizations who are prepared to purchase commercial systems for atmospheric monitoring upon the successful completion of the Phase II work. For operational weather forecasting and monitoring the National Weather Service is expected to be a key potential partner and customer. Also, the capability of this system to operate in the hazardous environment of a volcanic plume can be utilized in wildfire monitoring and support, where particulates and severe turbulence are a regular occurrence. There is also a commercial market for the multi-hole probe sensor developed as part of this work.

In addition, this proposed solution provides for inter-satellite nanosecond-level time transfer capability (TA 5.4.1) improving absolute navigation.This proposed effort will build on the demonstrated results of the Phase I SBIR, and will focus on improving performance, developing and delivering a prototype CubeSat-scaled radiometric SDR-based navigation solution that with autonomous position, navigation and time (PNT) capabilities.","Improvements in position, navigation and timing (PNT) can benefit both human and robotic spacecraft as they will facilitate higher quality data return from science instruments and enable mission operation concepts such as precise landing and deep-space formation flying. The proposed technology provides multi-platform relative navigation and timing that directly supports cooperative and collaborative space platform operations and will advance autonomous navigation thereby by reducing reliance on Earth-based systems and reducing overall cost. The solution also supports coordinated nanosatellite formation and swarm operations to enable radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) distributed aperture operations. Two design reference missions were identified during the Phase I effort that represent currently science and exploration needs and potential infusion points into future NASA programs.The multipurpose SDR can also change its function with mission phase and requirements, and will be able to sense and adapt to its RF environment to improve communications all within CubeSat compatible size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints.For example, the SDR-based can also be configured and program to receive and process signals from external sources such as the TDRSS Augmentation System for Satellites (TASS) (also known as Next Generation Broadcast Service or NGBS) which is a global, space-based, communications and navigation service for users in low-Earth orbit.","The proposed solution also has great potential in a variety of military and pure commercial applications and in particular for cluster and fractionated spacecraft.  Potential commercial applications may include: 1. multi-static synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system for all-weather Earth observing remote sensing,2. Multi-ball spectrum utilization and geolocation constellations to map out spectrum use and interference sources, 3. Small satellite constellations that provice global communication (voice, data, internet, etc.) that use crosslinks for network connectivity to enable todays advanced modulations such as LTE that require that all network nodes have accurate time and frequency knowledge. 4.

Accurate attitude and position measurements provided by the DCIRU would also be required for future CubeSat constellation or formation flying missions, and for laser communication between other CubeSats, other satellites or Earth. There are currently no small Inertial Reference Units (IRUs) suitable for CubeSats that exist due to size, weight, and power constraints. The ATA/Boeing Team is proposing the development of the DRG for potential integration into the DCIRU in Phase II. The highly symmetrical and scalable DRG disc standing wave design was selected by DARPA and NVESD as the only MEMS design capable of navigation grade performance. The DRG consists of a MEMS disk resonator that provides rotation sensing capable of both tactical and navigation grade precision.","ATA has successfully developed and transitioned SBIR innovations into government and commercial programs. One example is our recent success transitioning technologies first developed on the NASA Phase I SBIR, MIRU I.

Two-phase pumped loops are an ideal solution for these applications.  A critical need for these pumped loops is a refrigerant pump that reliably circulates very slightly subcooled liquid refrigerant in the loop.  Creare proposes to develop a reliable, vibration-free pump that has innovative features to prevent cavitation in the pumping chamber and in the hydrodynamic fluid bearings, enhancing the overall pumped loop reliability.  The development of the refrigerant pump is built on Creare's proven pump technologies for space applications.  In Phase I, we designed and built a proof-of-concept refrigerant pump and demonstrated its ability to reliably achieve the target flow rate and pressure rise, with a minimum required Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) less than 0.5 psi.  In Phase II, we will optimize the pump rotor, bearing and motor designs; assemble a pump prototype; demonstrate its reliability and its steady state and transient performance under prototypical inlet conditions; and deliver it to NASA JPL for further performance evaluation.","The proposed refrigerant pump will enable reliable two-phase pumped loops for efficient and precision thermal control of critical instruments in remote sensing science satellites and exploration vehicles, including a future mission to Saturn?s moon Enceladus and the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.  The pump technology also has applications in circulating condensate in water recovery systems, and in mixing and transferring cryogens and propellants in space propellant depots.","The reliable refrigerant circulation pump technology also has applications for advanced two-phase thermal control systems for high power electronics systems in commercial and military satellites and aircraft, as well as circulating pumps for chemicals, fuels, and cryogenic fluids.",Active Systems

(ACT) proposes to develop a low-cost Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) evaporator using a technique known as Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), otherwise known as 3D printing, to produce low-cost LHPs to be used in CubeSat and SmallSat applications. The wick structure in an LHP assumes the role of a pump in a standard loop, pumping liquid from the lower pressure condenser to the higher pressure evaporator by capillary forces. The overall thermal performance of the system is therefore highly dependent on the in-situ characteristics of the wick structure. Current LHP wick manufacturing and installation processes are cumbersome, labor intensive, and suffer from a low yield rate. It is estimated that the cost to produce an LHP evaporator, including the attachment of the bayonet, secondary wick and compensation chamber, accounts for approximately 75% of the total system?s manufacturing cost. By 3D printing an evaporator envelope with an integral porous primary wick structure, the overall complexity and cost of the design can be significantly reduced.The Phase I program was fully successful. In Phase I, an LHP with a DMLS evaporator was built using ammonia as the fluid, and carried the predicted 45 W.  The overall technical objective of the Phase II program will be to design, build, and test a complete LHP thermal management system for a CubeSat.  Phase II work will include further optimization of the LHP manufacturing parameters, and the development of advanced wick structures such as a graded wick design. The deliverables at the end of the Phase II will include an LHP that has been thermal vacuum tested, and a second LHP flight unit with ethanol working fluid, that can be tested at NASA?s option on the ISS.","Ammonia and propylene LHPs are currently used in most NASA and commercial satellites.  In comparison with Constant Conductance Heat Pipes (CCHPs), they carry much higher powers (1 kW vs. 100 W) over longer distances (10 m vs. 2-3 m).  They also are better suited for ground testability.  An LHP can operate with the evaporator 2 meters above the condenser, versus 2.5 mm for a CCHP.  Their main drawback is that they are two orders of magnitude more expensive to fabricate and test than CCHPs.  Fabricating, machining, and inserting the primary and secondary wicks into the pump is the bulk of the fabrication expense (The remainder of the LHP is just plumbing).  The first benefit of the proposed evaporator/wick fabrication will be a significant reduction in cost of LHPs supplied to NASA.  A second benefit of reduced costs it that LHPs will be much more attractive for the smaller satellites, such as SmallSat and CubeSat, that NASA is now considering for future missions.  The overall budget for these satellites is severely constrained when compared to the larger satellites that NASA has fabricated in the past.  LHPs have not been considered in the past for these small satellites, partially due to their high cost.  The reduced fabrication costs will allow ACT to fabricate smaller LHPs for these smaller satellites, at a price that is acceptable with their smaller budgets.","ACT is one of only two companies in the United States that sells heat pipes, Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs), and LHPs to the government and commercial customers for spacecraft thermal control.  The benefits for the Air Force are similar to the benefits for NASA, both for today?s spacecraft, and for smaller satellites in the future.  The commercial communications satellite market is the current primary market for LHPs.  For example, one prime uses 5 to 6 LHPs on each satellite, and would also benefit from reduced costs.Finally, Universities are able to fabricate their own CubeSats for research in space; however, their budgets are much too limited to allow them to use LHPs as a thermal control tool.  In addition, these SmallSats have no need for the high powers and long lengths of current LHPs.  They could benefit from small size LHPs, if the cost can be significantly reduced.  ACT plans to explore this market, after satisfying the higher end government and commercial markets.",Passive Systems

These devices contain no moving parts and can sense rotations and accelerations with high bandwidth. However, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the size of an optical gyroscope and its sensitivity. Highly sensitive gyroscopes are needed to meet navigation goals, but Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) are extremely precious resources in spacecraft or UAVs. Enhancing the sensitivity of existing devices, reducing their size, or both can allow the use of inertial navigation in smaller airframes, or free up room to include larger mission payloads for scientific or military purposes. Using fast-light effects generated in fiber with Stimulated Brillouin Scattering, we will enhance rotation sensitivity of conventional Ring Laser Gyroscope, to develop IMUs that will deliver higher performance and/or lower SWaP than a traditional navigation system. In Phase I we built, tested, and analyzed an SBS RLG test bed with automated control and data collection, both under quiet conditions and under rotations.  We also established requirements on system stability to produce an interesting RLG using the technology, and determined it is technically feasible to achieve in Phase II. In the proposed Phase II work, we will demonstrate fast-light enhancement of an RLG in the lab and produce a prototype to characterize the potential performance of a fast-light enhanced IMU product.","The improvement of inertial sensor components is essential to support navigation and attitude control systems for future NASA satellite missions.

Indeed, these are the memory parts that will truly enable aforementioned missions. Unfortunately, none of these are ready for space. The purpose of this research is to investigate the challenges and opportunities in deploying 3D memory cubes into space missions.","In order to effectively address the SWaP constraints of space hardware, it is desired to compact the electronics to as small a size as possible.

Q-Peak's low SWaP and higher energy laser will extend the dynamic range of Sigma Space's LiDAR instrument to > 10 km. For NASA JPL, Sigma Space completed a design study of potential LiDAR solutions for a lander. It was concluded that the challenging LiDAR requirements could be met with a laser of about 1W average power, using short pulses in the green at a PRF of ~30 kHz. The biggest challenge to this application is the limited mass and the high radiation environment.Q-Peak proposes to develop a 1-W laser that has a volume < 8 c.c and a weight < 20 g. The SWaP is at least an order of magnitude lower compared to the commercially available laser source. The modular form factor allows the laser to be easily modified to produce different wavelengths by frequency up conversion.The ultra-compact laser along with the single photon LiDAR will find direct and immediate application on at least two more NASA missions - Restore-L and ARRM. Restore-L is an ambitious endeavor to launch a robotic spacecraft in 2020 to refuel a live satellite in low-Earth orbit and demonstrate a suite of satellite-servicing technologies, potentially including a satellite laser rangefinder using the same laser. The Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) is designed to send astronauts to visit a large near-Earth asteroid, explore it and return with samples in the 2020s. This is part of NASA's plan to advance new technologies and spaceflight experience in preparation for a human mission to the Martian system in the 2030s.","NASA remote sensing and LiDAR applications require compact, efficient, reliable, moderate-energy, nanosecond-pulsed lasers. These missions require improved and precision technology from previously flown LiDAR technologies as well as much reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) given the resource-constrained class of missions likely to use this capability. Missions to solar system bodies must meet increasingly ambitious objectives requiring highly reliable ""soft and precision landing"", ""hazard avoidance"", ""topography mapping"" and ""autonomous rendezvous to other satellites"" etc. Robotic missions to the Moon and Mars demand landing at pre-designated sites of high scientific value near hazardous terrain features, such as escarpments, craters, slopes, and rocks.Given the high sensitivity of launch requirements to SWaP considerations and to reliability, we feel that the proposed laser source is uniquely positioned for LiDAR remote sensing and autonomous landing based missions. Other NASA mission profiles or applications that would benefit from generically small, light- weight, low power laser sources would be equally well served.","An ultra-compact laser source can be used at 1 or 0.5 micron wavelength for LiDAR applications to map and image objects; a narrow laser-beam can map physical features with very high resolution. It can target a wide range of materials, including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols, clouds, and even single molecules. 0.5 mm wavelength penetrates water easily and is useful for bathymetry measurements in shallow water. The proposed laser can be used in the Automotive Safety and Navigation, Geography, Law Enforcement, Meteorology, Mining, Robotics, and Wind Farms markets. Military lasers have reached size and energy criteria but always at the cost of poor beam quality and consequent difficulties in atmospheric propagation for their intended applications. Q-Peak's advantage would be in having developed an ultra-compact, simple, and rugged technology for generation of single mode laser pulses in the green, near-IR, or eyesafe regions. This laser device will be much better suited for fieldable systems than present products with respect to both SWaP and mode profile. When converted to eyesafe wavelength present Department of Defense procurement of eyesafe rangefinder exceeds 2,500 units per annum with a constant need to advance the state of the art and reduce soldier carry-weight and workload.

Phase I demonstrated successful integration with NASA-selected motors and stress-testing of P3 in adverse environments including temperature extremes, vibration, and vacuum, resulting in a TRL-advance from 3 to 4. Phase-II efforts will focus on design-modifications relevant to space-qualification, performance characterization, and further environmental testing including radiation testing. Phase II is expected to result in a TRL of 6. Phase-III commercialization efforts will create a system of motor controllers that not only support NASA rover missions with a TRL of 7, but also support other space-based non-terrestrial applications, such as servomotor actuation on satellites for precision antennae and laser pointing and the deployment of articulated structures.","Brushless servomotors are essential in NASA applications such as mobile manipulation on rovers and for satellite navigation, control, and positioning. Unlike brushed motors, brushless servomotors have high torque density, add no brush friction, do not generate contaminating dust, and have lifetimes measured in years instead of days. The use of brushless motors however, requires custom, expensive electronics that are often larger than the motors they control. This is especially true for small motors that operate below 100 watts. The proposed snap-in P3 module will support a wide array of these smaller motors.","As machines become more intelligent through embedded processing and sensor fusion we expect them to do more too, improving not only industrial productivity but our quality of life as society ages. While embedded processors and MEMS-based sensors have become tiny, highly effective, and affordable; similar improvements in servomotors have evolved more slowly. At fractional-horsepower levels the power electronics contribute significantly to total bulk and complexity. Providing smaller and more efficient servo electronics enable OEMs to increase the competitiveness of their products. For example, robots can become more agile with additional degrees of freedom and less mass to accelerate. New fuel-cell designs combined with ultra-high motor efficiency will enable affordable prostheses with true dexterity instead of 0 or 1 degree of freedom; and orthotics will begin to assist human motions intelligently, rather than passively bracing.","Actuators & Motors; Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Navigation & Guidance; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Teleoperation; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

Due to the innovative motor design, the proposed system is significantly shorter than a conventional hybrid motor system but maintains safety, reduced complexity, and storability advantages of hybrid motor systems. The system leverages additive manufacturing for the rocket nozzle and injector system in order to decrease both weight and part count. This innovation is an ideal propulsion technology for a variety of sample return missions from Mars or other bodies with significant gravity wells.","With the wide variety of NASA objectives for sample return, one clear common thread is that high-performance, reliable propulsion systems for small vehicles will be essential to keeping the missions affordable. Parabilis' proposed bi-axial hybrid propulsion technology addresses this common need and enables mission designers to realize a panoply of new high-value science missions that use low-cost small vehicles. In addition to the sample return missions, a propulsion solution to these challenging problems would also be useful across a range of other demanding propulsion applications where high-performance and compact size are critical. These additional uses include entry, descent, and landing operations, launch vehicle upper stages, kick stages, and spacecraft main engines. Every NASA exploration mission utilizes these components to greater or lesser degree, therefore, advancing the state of the art in sample return propulsion is bound to have payoffs throughout the exploration enterprise.","Numerous sample return missions from various bodies are either currently underway or in development, with the trend expected to grow as exploration continues. Hayabusa 2 is an asteroid sample return mission operated by the Japanese space agency and is currently en route to a 2018 rendezvous with asteroid Ryugu. ESA is contemplating its own version of a Mars Sample Return mission in the next decade, possibly including samples from Deimos or Phobos. Russia has similar plans, based on heritage from its prior Deimos attempt using the Grunt spacecraft. China has also announced plans to return a sample from Mars by 2030. China is currently constructing the Chang'e 5 mission to return lunar samples. ESA had also contemplated the MarcoPolo-R asteroid sample return mission in 2014 but ultimately downselected a competing mission, however, the mission's high ranking at the time might lead to a future funding opportunity with the agency. The strong international interest in sample return missions comprises a potential first market equal in size to the NASA market.","Ablative Propulsion; Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Prototyping; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Main Engine; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

The converter operates as a charger, upconverter, and downconverter using a single transformer. The converter uses smart technology to interleave DAB converter stages for ripple current reduction and optimized load sharing of stages to extend the high efficiency load range of the converter to 6.25% of full load. By using smart technology, the load condition of each DAB converter stage is monitored and its load sharing controlled depending on the converters total load condition. In this way, each converter stage is kept at or above 25% load. Therefore the minimum load of the new DAB converter with four interleaved stages is one fourth of 25% or 6.25%. The design employs radiation-resistant and cryogenic-temperature-capable GaN HEMT devices to process 2 kW of power per stage. Mainstream has tested GaN HEMT devices to -225 C. GS66508T GaN HEMT devices are rated for 650 VDC maximum drain-to-source maximum voltage stress allowing for a maximum steady-operating voltage of 400 VDC at 60% derating.","Many NASA applications can benefit from incorporating the DAB converter into their electrical power systems. Spacecraft power systems can manage power sources with fewer power supplies.  To charge on-board batteries and provide the high-voltage DC bus for motor inverters, the power systems of NASA electric vehicles, such as the Modular Robotic Vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the Predator B, need compact, low-volume, low-mass dc-dc converters. The converter must also be bidirectional and multifunctional.","Military vehicle, and helicopter starter-generator power systems also necessitate the use of small, compact, dc-dc converters. These applications also operate in extremely low temperature conditions of less than -55 C in artic, high elevation, and cold, high-altitude, environments. Therefore the DAB converter is an optimal solution for these applications.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Conversion; Distribution/Management; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

Space qualified, high voltage power electronics can lead to higher efficiency and reduced mass at the spacecraft system architecture level, and serve as an enabling technology for operational concepts such as solar electric propulsion.Silicon carbide (SiC) is a robust technology with superior electronic properties for power applications. SiC devices offer higher temperature operation, lower on-resistance, higher breakdown voltages, and higher power conversion efficiency than silicon devices. However, high vulnerability to heavy-ion induced degradation and catastrophic failure has precluded this technology from space PMAD applications. Importantly, physical mechanisms for this vulnerability are not well understood, resulting in the inability to develop radiation hardened SiC devices. CFDRC, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University and Wolfspeed, is applying a coupled experimental and physics-based modeling approach to address this challenge. In Phase I, we performed electrical and heavy ion tests on 1200V Wolfspeed SiC JBS diodes to generate response data, and performed TCAD simulations to investigate diode sensitivity to design parameters and analyze electro-thermal mechanisms behind measured response. In Phase II, we will develop further insight into physical mechanisms in the diodes via development and application of advanced physics models. We will parametrically analyze design features to identify promising hardness solutions, which will then be fabricated and experimentally characterized. We will also perform heavy-ion testing of 1200V SiC MOSFETs and apply simulations for insights into governing mechanisms (to be further developed in follow on work). Direct participation by Wolfspeed in Phase II and beyond will ensure space-qualified, SiC power devices for NASA applications.","Space qualified, high voltage/high temperature power electronics is directly aligned, per the NASA Space Power and Energy Storage Roadmap - Technology Area (TA) 03, with science and exploration missions such as: missions using electric propulsion, robotic missions, lunar exploration missions to Near Earth Orbit, robotic surface missions to Venus and Europa, polar Mars missions and Moon missions, and others. A higher operating voltage can yield a lower distribution system weight for the same power level and is highly desirable across many areas of PMAD. SiC devices offer higher breakdown voltage, lower switching losses, and increased temperature tolerance, all crucial features for NASA space power applications. The radiation tolerant SiC designs from this project will add to the NASA components library.The TA 03 roadmap identifies the development of analytical models and predictive tools to model and characterize power and energy storage systems as a Cross-Cutting Technology which will provide capability to all NASA missions that require power electronics. Specifically highlighted is the need for physics-based models of power-related components. The modeling and analysis tools developed here directly address this need, and will help NASA better evaluate device performance under radiation and high temperature at an early stage, and design space qualified power electronics with better understanding and control of design margins, thereby reducing development time and cost.","Space qualified SiC power electronics will find application in power systems in all space-based platforms, including DoD space systems (communication, surveillance, missile defense), and commercial satellites. High voltage SiC power devices, through applications in inverters, high-voltage converters, motor drives, and switch mode power supplies, also offer significant performance benefits to power systems in other market sectors. These include national defense systems such as unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs) and soldier portable power systems. Applications in the terrestrial energy sector include PMAD systems in all-electric and hybrid cars, grid-scale energy storage systems, smart grid, green energy systems (wind/solar systems), solid-state lighting, and remote, off-grid power systems (crewed vehicles and habitats). Other commercial applications of SiC include high temperature power and control systems for extreme environments such as geothermal drill sites and sensor systems in engines of aircraft and hybrid vehicles. For all the applications listed above, physics-based predictive and accurate modeling and design tools reduce the amount of required radiation/temperature testing, thus decreasing their cost, and time to market or field application.","Conversion; Distribution/Management; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

To manage these extremes, heat exchangers composed of phase change materials that can expand and contract without causing structural damage, will be essential. This project will further-engineer ionic liquid-based phase change materials (PCMs) to: (1) tune the melting point for ORION platform heat exchanger applications, (2) further-elevate thermal conductivity for both solid and liquid, and (3) evenly-regulate heat transfer among components. In Phase I, InnoSense LLC (ISL) developed effective PCM formulations and tested their thermal properties. These materials exhibited high heat of fusion (254-272 kJ/kg) with low volume expansion (4-6%) compared with the current standard, pentadecane (~6-7%). We demonstrated IonoTherm to have higher thermal conductivity, heat storage, thermal diffusivity and thermal inertia over pentadecane. Further, tests indicated that IonoTherm did not corrode metallic substrates, phase-separate or degrade. In Phase II, ISL will fine-tune the PCM formulation and evaluate it in a flight level prototype heat exchanger. A NASA prime contractor has teamed with ISL to transition ISL's IonoTherm, and perform independent testing during Phase II and beyond under simulated field conditions.","Future missions will require manned spacecraft to travel further from the earth more than ever before. A major requirement for these spacecrafts is to maintain comfortable living conditions for the crew members. External temperatures and operating environments vary widely as the craft travels through space. In order to successfully-regulate cabin temperatures, heat exchangers requiring minimal volume and weight must be employed. ISL's phase change material will provide a nontoxic system that will operate effectively in a wide temperature range to maintain cabin temperatures. ISL will tailor IonoTherm for insertion into a heat exchanger that will offer excellent thermal behavior with low volume expansion. By reducing heat exchanger bulk, working space will be maximized.  ISL's IonoTherm shows promise for long-term reliability, which will ensure its effectiveness for long duration space missions.","The proposed heat transfer fluids will find a wide variety of commercial applications. They include the temperature regulation for polar shelters and vehicles. The wide operating range and high heat capacity will aid in the size and weight reduction of existing heat exchangers.

We also propose to validate a relatively low cost, out-of-autoclave process for affecting the bond, and validate analytical models to simulate the time- and temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior of composite TRAC bonded joint, and guide engineering qualification of the joints for future NASA missions, including CORSAIR.  Moreover, Roccor will also further optimize the system design, including proximal and distall end fittings that connect TRAC Boom into the CORSAIR storage canister and sample return projectile to validate strength and creep performance to mission requirements, and to incorporate load-limiting features that prevent catastrophic failure of the TRAC boom during operation.","CORSAIR comet sample return ""harpoon""Deployable solar sails (NEA Scout)Deployable mono-pole and di-pole antennas for CubeSatsDeployable CubeSat decelerators",Deployable solar sailsDeployable mono-pole and di-pole antennas for CubeSatsDeployable CubeSat decelerators,"Actuators & Motors; Characterization; Composites; Deployment; Polymers; Prototyping; Simulation & Modeling; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Structures"

This collaboration becomes more difficult in extended missions and crew members will need to have more autonomy. Augmented and virtual reality technology can help replace some of the guidance that ground controllers offer to crew members during procedure execution.  Our proposed approach focuses on integrating augmented and virtual reality technologies into the same tools that mission operations uses today, allowing for augmented and virtual reality assistance to be built and updated by flight controllers and other mission specialists just as they do for their other work products.

In Phase II we will extend the PRIDE platform to augmented reality devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens. TRACLabs is also partnered with the Georgia Institute of Technology's Augmented Environments Laboratory who will develop algorithms that dynamically adjust the augmented reality cues (both their position, orientation, and scale, along with the specific graphical elements used) such that they align with the necessary parts of the world without obscuring important parts of the world.","This research will be immediately useful to the NASA JSC Hybrid Reality Laboratory (HRL), which will use our software to guide users through their ISS models and train users on interacting with these models.

PRIDE is being field-tested  at several sites world-wide before deployment in actual operations in mid-2017. Augmented reality would immediately increase the effectiveness of the PRIDE software by providing hands-free assistance in performing complex and dangerous procedures. TRACLabs expects additional customers in the oil and gas industry will deploy PRIDE  once it has been proven effective. A major chemical manufacturer is also performing a pilot project in their plants using PRIDE for complex operations. In these cases, a heads-up display like the HoloLens or the DAQRI could be very useful in field environments  In all of these cases, we will offer augmented reality systems as an ``add-on'' to the existing PRIDE software we deliver.

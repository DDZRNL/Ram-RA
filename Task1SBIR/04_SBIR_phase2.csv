The proposed display will be automultiscopic and will be based on a projector, a stationary holographic optical element screen integrated with a high-speed electro-optical scanner and high-speed electronics with a software interface to NASA systems.  This minimum 8-in. diagonal drop-down head-up display with no moving parts will present six or more perspective views to air crew members, forming integrated virtual volumetric 3D images viewable over a 60 degree horizontal field of view.  In Phase I POC designed a laboratory prototype and successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system by assembling a single-user monochrome 3D-COD prototype.  In Phase II POC will further develop the true 3D display technology and construct a fully functional system that will project distortion-free, 400-600 lumen, full-color, virtual volumetric 3D images at a 30-60 Hz video rate for real-time user interaction with the images, each from his or her own perspective.","The crew-centered 3D-COD system will find applications in NASA Synthetic Vision Systems to significantly enhance air safety through improved pilot situational awareness by information presentation in 3D.  This system will benefit air traffic control, simulation, training, 3D design, and multicraft airspace image displays.","The 3D-COD technology has huge commercial potential, and will find applications in engineering development and entertainment, and particularly in theme parks, museums, and educational institutions.  Niche applications include visual tools for medicine, and for design and development of complex machinery and systems."

Among these is the Systems Analysis Branch (SAB) simulation environment of NASA Langley.  The current tools would greatly benefit from the portrayal of the daily preemptive Command and Control (C&C) activities performed by FAA and air carrier traffic managers.  These actions significantly influence daily operations and overall NAS efficiency.  Development of new operational concepts and evaluation of proposed changes requires simulation and modeling capabilities that include C&C effects.  This understanding is crucial for the evaluation of current or proposed operations.  Metron Aviation uses its extensive experience with and research of C&C to implement a model of NAS-wide ATM (C&C) actions and to integrate the resulting module into NASA Langley's SAB simulation environment.  The final product adds realism to future aircraft movement simulations performed by NASA Langley and admits exploration of new concepts that involve air traffic flow management.","Understanding of the system-wide impacts of NAS C&C is lacking in both operational practice and current research.  This understanding is crucial for the evaluation of current or proposed operations.  Currently, NASA programs such as Next-Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS/JPDO), Small Aircraft Transportation Systems (SATS), Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts, Virtual Airspace Modeling and Simulation (VAMS), and All-weather Capacity Enhancement NASA Research Announcement (NRA) are developing system concepts to meet increasing air traffic demand, reduce delays, and improve safety/security.  Realistic NAS-wide simulations, including C&C, are required to assess emerging operational concepts and technologies, since they all assume some component of human-mediated C&C.  Omitting this from the simulations risks missing important system behaviors that must be included in the development of the operational concepts and technologies.","Estimates of ATM costs due to delays range from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars per year.  Several research activities being pursued to meet the increasing demands in air travel promise to be costly and laborious to implement, and the difficulty of adequately assessing the anticipated impacts creates significant risk for operators and users of the NAS.  Development of simulation capabilities and benefit assessment methods that include the effects of C&C creates significant commercial demand for accurate and robust C&C modeling capabilities."

A large contributor to the above injuries and costs is that flight crews do not have sufficient situational awareness of the location and severity of potential turbulence hazards to their aircraft.  AeroTech will improve pilots' situational awareness of turbulence hazards by developing a cockpit Turbulence Hazard Decision Aid that provides them with integrated, graphical turbulence hazard information scaled to their specific aircraft.  This display will remove the need for inference that is required to interpret current turbulence information.  With better knowledge of turbulence hazards' severity and location, pilots will be able to avoid turbulence encounters or prepare for them by having all occupants seated with seatbelts on, thereby avoiding injuries.  Phase II work will develop a prototype decision aid, based on the Phase I CONOPS and results, and then evaluate the prototype in both a PC simulation and a flight simulator.  By the end of Phase II a meaningful, Integrated Turbulence Hazard Decision Aid will be developed and tested, paving the way for flight evaluations and commercialization in Phase III.","When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, this cockpit, Integrated Turbulence Hazard Decision Aid will contribute to NASA's Aviation Safety and Security Program's (AvSSP) current national goals of a 25-50% reduction in weather-related accident causal factors and a 25 to 50% reduction in turbulence-related injuries.  This work and the developed decision aid will be completely aligned with NASA's Turbulence Prediction and Warning System efforts, and NASA's Aviation Weather Information goal of enabling pilots to avoid atmospheric hazards by providing them timely, accurate, and intuitive weather information.  It is also very consistent with the stated goals of the Integrated Flight deck Information Systems element of the Phase II AvSSP.  Increased awareness of atmospheric turbulence provided by the decision aid may also add value to the NASA Airspace Systems program's goals of enabling ""through technology development and transfer, major increases in the capacity and mobility of the air transportation system.""","When the goals of the proposed R/R&D are met, this cockpit Turbulence Hazard Decision Aid will provide pilots with improved turbulence hazard information allowing them to operate more efficiently and safely.  Significant reductions in costs associated with injuries due to turbulence and in fuel waste due to inefficient operations in and around turbulence are expected to be major commercial drivers for this system. The market for this decision aid is all Part 121 carriers (both domestic and international), cargo aircraft, corporate jets, and some high-end general aviation aircraft (an estimated 55,000+ Part 121 and corporate aircraft alone by 2023).  Delta Air Lines was instrumental in the Phase I work and is supporting the Phase II work with evaluation pilots and flight simulators.

Eliminated are requirements for high voltages and currents characteristic of all previous impulsive or expulsive deicing systems. It is postulated that if the engine can operate safely in the hail environment as defined by the FARs, then it can be expected to operate safely and economically in the presence of particles shed by the deicer which are demonstrably smaller and less hazardous than hail. Such a system presents a viable alternative to the use of hot air ice protection systems, and will require a two magnitude lower power.","The system proposed is a viable alternative to bleed air ice protection for engine inlets. The number of NASA applications is not so large as the number of commercial applications. However, NASA has a national objective an overall improvement in the safety of aircraft operation. Protection of aircraft from exposure to icing environment is included in that charter. One of the most important trades involved in the development of icing conditions is between energy and icing performance. This trade has been shown that it can be addressed by the use of low power ice protection systems on lifting surfaces. It remains to apply these principles to engine inlets. This is the commercial promise of this system.","The market for electric powered ice protection is confirmed as a result of recent decisions by major aircraft manufacturers.  Clearly, the movement to replace conventional bleed air ice protection for lifting surfaces is well underway.  Even though the new electro-thermal de-icing systems present improvements in efficiencies of operation, the requirement still exists for use of anti-icing systems on the engine inlets.  The substitution of de-icing systems for anti-icing on engine inlets offers an opportunity for another order of magnitude improvement in the power required to protect engine inlets.   This is possible by the use of a mechanical de-icing system that repeatedly sheds ice particles that are small in comparison to the FAR hail and rain environments to which the engine is qualified.  The use of a de-icing system as a means of protecting not only lifting and stabilizing surfaces but engine inlets as well will result in overall operating efficiencies beyond any improvement offered to date."

Attempts to develop methods to directly detect aircraft icing meteorological conditions have met with mixed success. Combining ground-based microwave radiometers with radars has shown great promise, but deficiencies of the radiometers have limited their value. In our Phase I effort we have determined solutions to several technical challenges in the design of a narrow beam multi-waveband radiometer that is to operate in concert with weather radars. We have also calculated optimum eigenfrequencies for detection of aircraft icing conditions. In Phase II we will construct a turnkey fast sampling multifrequency profiling and dual polarization narrow beam radiometer system. In this radiometer system, all beams are collinear and match the antenna gain pattern of weather research radars. The radiometer will have the capability of profiling (ranging) water vapor along the beam as well as discriminate ice and water phase hydrometeors. We will also develop a fast beam steering system to operate in concert with the radar. The turnkey radiometer system and documentation are deliverables.","NASA is actively researching methods of detecting aircraft icing conditions, and has performed and participated in a number of aircraft icing studies with their Twin Otter, radiometers, radar, and other sensing systems. The technology proposed herein greatly enhances the value of the important radiometric observations by enabling measurements that match the sample volume of research radars at a number of radiometric frequencies.","The ground-based radiometric system developed herein, as well as being a valuable research tool, is to be operated with radars such as NEXRAD and Terminal Doppler Weather Radars (TDWRs) to detect and quantify cloud liquid water and ice in single- and mixed-phase conditions aloft. In addition to detecting icing conditions enroute and in approach regions, the system can forewarn and nowcast the need (or lack of need) to apply deicing solutions in advance of departure, creating savings and reducing delays. This quantification will also enhance weather nowcasting and predictive capabilities.  This large aperture narrow beam radiometer design is also applicable to characterizing and quantifying satellite link loss due to atmospheric absorption, and Radiometrics has had several inquiries for such a design in wavebands from 8 to 32 GHz, demonstrating a commercial market for this application."

Current-generation controllers are reaching levels of complexity that push the envelopes of existing V&V approaches, and further increases in controller complexity are required to provide the operational capabilities desired for next generation systems. Without improved approaches, there is little hope for affordable V&V of next-generation intelligent systems and, unfortunately, controller validation is required to ensure the safety of these systems. Barron Associates proposes an aggressive plan of research to develop monitoring algorithms that estimate, in real time, safety margins of complex feedback systems based on observed differences between the model used for controller development and actual flight data.  The Phase II research will focus on the flight test environment where these algorithms will allow the flight test engineer to monitor and revise the test plan in real time - accelerating the test-matrix buildup when safety is assured and avoiding test points where safety is questionable.  The tool will also recommend test points that could help refine safety margin estimates for as yet unexecuted maneuvers. The result will be reduced flight test costs and improved safety.","The proposed software tool will be a key enabling technology for safe and efficient flight testing of any advanced air vehicle, manned or unmanned.  The key area of application will be aviation safety and security, where the Phase II product will facilitate the safety of flight testing advanced fault-tolerant and damage-adaptive controllers for which design-time V&V assurances may be less complete than for traditional controllers (e.g., Lockheed's AIMSAFE as part of AvSP and Dryden's PCA system).  In particular, the intended initial application of the tool will be for the AirSTAR sub-scale flying test-bed.  The AirSTAR is intended to allow testing that is too high risk for manned aircraft, and effective safety monitoring is especially important in this high-risk environment.  Flight tests involving NASA's full-scale 757 will also benefit from the technology.","Non-NASA aerospace applications include flight testing of advanced military systems such as JSF, J-UCAS, retrofit reconfigurable controllers for F-18 and other aircraft, the Helicopter Advanced Control Technologies (HACT) system, and next-generation rotorcraft fuel and engine control systems.  Barron Associates is currently providing advanced control and V&V technology to all of these programs.  Significant commercial potential for the technology exists as well.  Initial demonstration on AirSTAR will provide a foundation for using the tool in tests of commercial transport aircraft.  An even larger potential market is in unmanned aerial vehicles.  There are a large number of unmanned vehicles currently being developed for both military and civilian applications, and these vehicles frequently utilize advanced control systems that represent relatively high risk.  Flight test programs of such vehicles could thus benefit substantially from the proposed software tool."

An adaptive geometry chevron using embedded smart structures technology offers the possibility of maximizing engine performance while retaining and possibly enhancing the favorable noise characteristics of current designs.  Phase I identified a promising candidate for a variable geometry chevron using high force Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators.  Building on coupled CFD/finite element modeling predicting successful performance, subscale demonstration-level actuated chevrons were constructed that yielded the required deflections in both benchtop and low speed wind tunnel tests.  Phase I also identified and tested new high temperature SMA (HTSMA) materials technology to enable the devices to operate in both low temperature (fan) and high temperature (core) exhaust flows.

The software tool could be used, for example, to determine the wall thickness of a launch vehicle's external cryogenic propellant tanks exposed to high but uncertain thermal and aerodynamic loads with a reliability of 0.99999.","A broad spectrum of design problems involving parts/subsystems/systems required to attain mission-critical reliability levels at minimum weight, yet subject to major technical uncertainties. These problems typically involve high temperature/high stress propulsion systems and range from single part designs such as novel CMC turbine blades used in advanced rocket engine turbopumps and jet engines to complete systems such as the unconventional propulsion concepts proposed for future space vehicles (e.g., nuclear thermal rockets, nuclear-electric, and solar-electric systems). These applications include conceptual designs where future technology status is uncertain as well as operational systems that experience variances in operating conditions and manufacturing fidelity.  The final product will be a suite of software tools that accelerate the design/analysis process, take the grunt work out of the typical engineering tasks of transferring/converting data streams from one application code to another, and capture the intrinsically probabilistic nature of design problems. This will enable engineers and managers to spend more of their time interpreting results and making wise decisions as well as yield a physics-based design-to-reliability solution.","A fundamental architectural change in the design process is proposed that could revolutionize the way many commercial designs are conducted that involve advanced technology and important uncertainties. For example, high-tech applications such as  nuclear-powered central powerplants, artificial hearts, flight-qualified control system actuators, home heat pumps/air conditioners, automotive engines, and avionic circuit boards all require ultra-reliable, minimal-maintenance operation. Some of these operate in uncertain hostile environments and all involve a continuous stream of technical improvements with inherent uncertainties. The software tool developed in this effort would accelerate these design processes while simultaneously yielding more reliable, cost-effective products."

Because there will be no opportunity to replace batteries on a regular basis, these systems will have to rely on energy harvesting strategies to convert ambient energy into electrical energy to provide long-lived power.  TPL proposes to develop a micropower system that will combine TPL's patented microbatteries and microsupercapacitors with vibrational energy harvesting for use with wireless structural health monitoring (SHM) systems.  The solution proposed will include all components required for a complete power supply for wireless SHM sensors, including proprietary power regulation and conditioning circuitry that draws very low power.

NASA's interest in structural health monitoring, in particular, extends to air and space vehicles, fixed wing and rotorcraft, satellites, inter-planetary mission vehicles, and high altitude, long endurance (HALE) vehicles.  For wireless sensors in general, NASA applications will extend from remote sensing on earth, climate and meteorological monitoring, and geolocation in planetary exploration.","There is a myriad of non-NASA applications that have been discussed throughout this proposal; but for structural health monitoring, they include bridges, buildings (particularly high value, or sensitive buildings such as nuclear power or chemical plants), seismic detection, and ships (e.g. oil tankers or other vessels carrying cargoes that may be harmful if spilled).

The control system for the reflexive structures will mimic the pain withdrawal-reflex on which the human body relies. This is important because rapid response is critical to survivability. The proposed reflexive system will incorporate a continuous health and performance monitoring system via embedded piezoelectric sensors, an adaptive composite structure based on CRG's shape memory composite material (VeritexTM), and an intelligence system which will be interfaced with both the health/performance sensors and the adaptive structure.

Normally flows with Reynolds numbers in the range of 20,000 to 120,000 are dominated by laminar separation bubbles and are difficult to transition without using very large traditional trip devices, such as distributed roughness.  Additionally, these traditional trips are sized for one flow condition and are either not effective at off-design conditions or create a large device drag penalty.  RHRC's innovative transition control technology is capable of transitioning flow across a wide range of low Reynolds number conditions without resizing or incurring an off-design performance penalty.  The system also produces minimal device drag.  The novel transition control technology was shown to reduce trip drag penalties by as much as 35% to 60% when compared to correctly sized traditional trips, and increasing to as much as 190% at off-design conditions.  In addition, the system can be implemented without external power. The commercialization potential for the technology is extremely promising, with applications such as micro unmanned air vehicles, high-altitude long-endurance aircraft, Mars exploratory flyers, and propeller systems.","The proposed transition control technology (TCT) has significant potential application in several NASA programs. The TCT system could be fielded in several NASA aircraft unmanned systems, including micro-UAVs, high-altitude long-endurance remotely operated aircraft (HALE-ROA) for reconnaissance, and Mars exploratory aircraft.  NASA designers will be eager to exploit the advantages of the current TCT technology in both airfoil designs and propeller systems.  The transition control technology will deliver revolutionary performance as compared to traditional designs in a low risk package. The system will be applicable throughout NASA's high altitude unmanned and micro-UAV aviation community.","The commercialization potential is excellent for a robust and reliable low Reynolds number transition control system.  Potential customers include the U.S. Military and radio control aircraft hobbyists.  The U.S. military has begun to dramatically increase its use of unmanned aircraft.  With electronic payloads becoming increasingly smaller, the opportunity for the application of micro-UAVs to military missions will increase.  The revolutionary performance offered by the TCT technology for this class of vehicles will make the technology extremely appealing.  The hobbyist market, particularly in the area of propellers and airfoils for radio-controlled aircraft, is a prime candidate for use of this technology.  Airfoils and propellers designed using RHRC's transition control technology will provide radically enhanced performance.  Both commercial suppliers of hobby aircraft and the military micro-UAV community will find the technology extremely appealing, allowing significant commercialization potential."

These actuators promise considerable savings in weight, power, and volume over existing electomechanical and hydraulic systems.  Incorporation of these actuators within lifting surface structure, or as trailing edge control devices, would greatly simplify the actuation systems of these aircraft, thereby permitting greater payload fraction, increased range, enhanced robustness, and/or smaller vehicle size, and thus reduce both operational and fixed system costs.  Choice between the two actuation concepts for a particular installation represents a tradeoff in actuation system bandwidth and power availability, and thus the same vehicle may include both systems depending upon the particular functional requirements.  These actuators represent a derivative technology from a previous Army SBIR Phase I/II effort directed at providing in-flight helicopter blade tracking using actively controlled trailing edge tabs, and thus have been designed to have low mass and low power requirements from their inception.  Since they lack any physical hinge joints, they may be embedded directly within aircraft lifting surfaces, eliminating interference drag associated with control deflection.","NASA has a need for advanced control actuation and systems to support long endurance high-altitude UAV applications.  This technology would help mitigate known issues with reduced aeroelastic stability of such high altitude platforms, as well as provide vehicle robustness (load alleviation) to atmospheric gusts.  Its all-electric actuation and lack of moving parts (i.e., no discrete hinges) enhances the actuator's capability to support longer duration UAV missions planned by NASA for the future.","The actuators developed here could support DoD applications and commercial aircraft uses for UAV flight control and ancillary functions such as deploying flaps, landing gear and doors that house optics or weapons.  They have a minimum number of moving parts, are extremely lightweight for the actuation stroke and force they provide, and utilize modest electrical power.  In one configuration, electric power is only required to switch the actuator between discrete positions, making this actuator ideally suited for flap deployment and/or trim tab applications.  These devices may also be used as auxiliary trim systems and flight control units for manned aircraft."

The MUNSID toolbox augments the current match-point solution approach using the mu-analysis method with identified nonlinear operators.  The procedure calls for a high-fidelity linear aeroelastic model to be tuned quickly with available aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic flight data sets, while block-oriented models are used to highlight the underlying nonlinear structure of the dynamic system.  This framework is capable of accounting for several nonlinearities including those due to aerodynamics, structures, control/actuator, and/or geometry.  Specifically, this on-line Flutter/LCO predictor can be used to accurately estimate a supercritical LCO case if the global nonlinear dynamic behavior is described throughout a hardening nonlinearity, as well as a more dangerous dynamic behavior, denoted as subcritical LCO, could be developed if a global softening nonlinearity is identified. The devised MUNSID Toolbox will become the flight control engineer's ""every day tool"" to predict on-line Flutter/LCO phenomena. In Phase II, MUNSID will be updated with fast and computationally efficient routines for system modeling, LFT representation, identification of nonlinearity, estimation of uncertainty, and stability analysis. Deliverables include the MUNSID production software including a GUI, a library of S-functions, and the related user manuals.","Nonlinear identification, modeling and analysis software for aeroservoelastic instability clearance is still non-existent, leading to cautious and expensive flight test procedures.  The proposed toolbox will become a standard analysis package for aeroservoelasticity. NASA/DFRC has been working for many years towards achieving a software package that would predict the onset of AE/ASE instabilities with a high factor of safety for efficient envelope expansion.  The proposed MUNSID toolbox is aimed at providing an expedient on-line prediction capability that integrates with current NASA procedures in the control room.  The methodology for a nonlinear Flutter/LCO predictor tool will complement and enhance the current capability for predicting instabilities during envelope expansion.  The MUNSID Toolbox will be applicable to flutter envelope expansion programs of military, civil transport as well as general aviation aircraft where the design is aeroelastically dominated or the potential exists for aeroelastically induced instabilities.","ZONA's business plan for this toolbox will follow the existing ZAERO product/service strategy.  The toolbox will be marketed towards the flight test applications on a wide class of aerospace vehicles: (a) USAF's UAV/UCAV, joint-wing sensor craft, (b) Next generation Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) with enhanced control/maneuver capability, (c) DARPA Morphing aircraft program, and (d) Boeing's 787 and executive jet designs of Cessna, Raytheon, etc.  Potential customers for the MUNSID Toolbox include engineers in the automotive industry, developing suspension and powertrain systems, aerodynamic developments for race cars, as well as for nautical engineers doing ship design and analysis, particularly mitigating vibrations and high acoustic noise due to large motors.  Other areas of application include aircraft carrier vibration issues, analysis of power blackout, and in flight dynamics for complex flying control systems for manned and UAV.  It will be a powerful tool for the aerospace industry performing health management within the health monitoring of flexible extraterrestrial vehicles and in vibration analysis for large solar panels and/or antennas in satellites.

The danger from fire and toxic releases aboard spacecraft is constant with only moments for detection and contravention.  Spacecraft are unique high-value systems where failure is measured in lives, dollars, time, and public perception.  Space crews have little chance of escaping vessels that cannot continue to support life.  It is imperative to detect danger in these closed-cycle environments at the earliest possible moment.

If successful, each prototype simulant could then be produced on a larger scale through a Phase III contract or by a privately funded commercial effort. The current simulants to be addressed by the Phase II include a spherical glass inclusion JSC-1a derivative for improved physical lunar mare characteristics, a terrestrially produced lunar agglutinate inclusion JSC-1a derivative for true chemical and mechanical property simulation, a lunar highlands simulant for simulation of over 80% of the lunar surface, and improved JSC Mars-1a simulant to meet the immediate needs for Martian experimentation and testing.

The team will also develop an improved protocol for testing radiation shielding material. This effort will entail developing a composite material which uses proven radiation shielding material Polyethylene(PE), as its primary constituent in the form of very strong/tough Spectra fibers woven into a 3D fabric. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that, compared to bulk PE, this composite approach has significantly improved mechanical properties, excellent electrical conductivity, good Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) shielding properties, and maintains excellent space radiation shielding properties of PE. We also demonstrated exposure to large doses of high energy actually improved the mechanical properties. In Phase II, the epoxy matrix used in Phase I will be considered along with Cyanate Esters, and Polyimides, As in Phase I, coating the PE fabric and reinforcing the matrix material will be ultra-high strength, highly conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Zyvex's unique and commercially successful CNT processing technology will be adapted to maximize the transfer of the extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of CNTs to the composite structures. The work plan includes approaches to overcome CNT processing and delamination issues discovered in Phase I. CARR will carryout more extensive radiation testing with several ions at different energies. Boeing which has significant interest in developing long term space exploration will guide the development of the material to meet specifications for planned applications.","NASA's needs for radiation shielding for extended space missions is unquestioned.  Polyethylene is the best known material for shielding high energy particles but is parasitic weight if it does not serve any other function. A material with good radiation shielding capabilities that can also have the strength to be an integral structural component, have the toughness to deal with micro-meteor impacts, and provide additional EM shielding clearly has value to NASA.  In addition to the Phase I SBIR we are just completing with Marshall, we also are working on a Phase II SBIR with NASA JSC to develop CNT composites with ultra-high specific strength for demanding space vehicle applications. We have had successful commercial spin-offs from this program listed below.  This work has been so successful that we are entering into a Space Act Agreement with JSC to collaborate with them in the pursuit of this technology.  The collaborative work on this Space Act Agreement is expected to include but go beyond structural applications; we also expect that other advanced material applications such as space suit fabrics and high surface area support for CO2 scrubbing will be explored.","The NASA funded work on CNT/Polymer composites have already produced two commercial successes. Epoxy concentrates with dispersed CNTs are being sold to Easton Sports who are using this CNT material to make bicycle parts (being used in the 2005 Tour de France), baseball bats (which were used in the College World Series), and hockey sticks. Aldela, the largest manufacturer of composite golf club shafts is also using this technology in their product.  We have had eight different industrial research contracts, many of which are ongoing, to develop CNT composites for a variety of applications.  Applications include structural materials, thermal interface materials, ballistic protection materials, and others. We are also working with a number of other companies either in a collaborative development mode, or selling them materials for testing and development.  We also have a DARPA program in their Defense Sciences Office to develop ultra-high strength CNT fibers. This work has led to a follow on program where Zyvex will be a subcontractor to Hexcel in developing a new generation of high strength fibers. This program has been awarded and is currently being negotiated."

This will close the hydrogen loop which currently requires 50% resupply and also produce carbon nanotubes, a high value product which may be employed as an adsorbent or catalyst for removal of atmospheric trace contaminants, thus further lowering the resupply burden for manned spacecraft.  Microgravity compatibility of Gradient Magnetically Assisted Fluidized Beds (GMAFB) has been demonstrated through a series of KC135 flight experiments.  Metallic cobalt, which has been fluidized in microgravity using the GMAFB method, is an excellent catalyst for promotion of methane pyrolysis.  Recently, fluidized bed catalytic methods have been shown to efficiently recover hydrogen, and produce single walled carbon nanotubes.  Using the GMAFB method, this process can be rendered totally compatible with operation in the microgravity of spaceflight or the reduced gravity of planetary environments.

In addition to the potential for significant power savings over existing lighting systems, the use of solid-state lighting eliminates problems associated with traditional lighting in closed systems such as short operational life (requiring resupply), high mass and volume, limited control options, and safety concerns including high temperatures, glass envelopes, and toxic materials.","Controlled-environment agriculture profitability often is most limited by energy costs. Dense crop stands block overhead light from reaching the majority of lower leaves in closed foliar canopies, thereby compromising yield and requiring high light levels that are not absorbed efficiently. Light-distribution systems that are low power, relatively cool, that uniformly irradiate all leaves within a stand only with wavelengths most efficiently absorbed by photosynthetic tissue, and that automatically adjust emissions to target new tissues as plants grow in height or spread without wasting photons by lighting empty space will substantially lower energy costs of controlled-environment production and will improve profitability."

The successful operation of the prototype would raise the system's TRL to 5 or 6 (system operated in a relevant environment).","The main NASA applications for the proposed technology is dual-use hydrogen storage and radiation shielding systems on board spacecraft, space station, and also smaller versions used for innovations in spacesuit design, possibly a specially modified Hard Upper Torso (HUT).  The primary purpose of this effort is to develop a piece of hardware for NASA that can ultimately be an important component of a Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS), providing at the same time energy-storage functionality.  The systems developed as a results of the proposed study will be useful to NASA in at least two respects: 1) radiation shielding for people and electronics, and 2) fuel storage for propulsion or electrical power generation. The multi- functional material in the current study significantly boosts the hydrogen storage ability of compressed gas cylinders and provides excellent radiation shielding characteristics, and results in a mass reduction for spacecraft.","Commercial areas that are under exploration are primarily related to fuel cell systems, with automobiles and other transportation vehicles of particular interest.  The main application of the developed carbons would be in gas-storage systems (automobiles, trucks, buses, locomotives, spacecraft, submarines, UAV's, etc.), with additional applications including radiation shielding in other aerospace environments (satellites, military/astronomical detectors sensitive to obscuring background radiation, high-altitude, long-duration aircraft, etc.).  AFR has also been approached by a firm specializing in hazardous gas packaging for their interest in storing gases at less than atmospheric pressure.  In such an application, our sorbent has the potential to double or triple the amount of gas in a cylinder, with concomitant gains in savings and efficiency.  Other uses of carbons with well-controlled pore structure include carbon molecular sieve membranes for gas separations, ultracapacitor electrodes, and catalysts.  AFR is actively working with Maxwell Technologies, our industrial partner, to bring our ultracapacitor electrode technology to market."

Solving the obstacle avoidance problem to permit truly autonomous operations in a cluttered and occluded environment has been the subject of considerable research. In Phase I, UtopiaCompression (UC) has developed a layered, intelligent and adaptive system concept that will facilitate UV operations by solving the collision avoidance and path planning problems using inexpensive imaging sensors and modest computational resources. In Phase II, UC shall fully implement this concept. UC's focus is to push the limits of automation in the 3D arena by providing a real-time, end-to-end solution that includes: (i) deriving 3D structures (computing depth) from overlapping (stereo pair) images or video sequence acquired from sensors aboard autonomous agents; (ii) using the derived 3D structure to compute and model a spatio-temporal vector field; and (iii) based on the distance to the moving/stationary objects, plan a navigation strategy that commands the agent to cruise along a safe path from a source to a destination, avoiding the stationary/moving obstacles in the frontal hemisphere. UC's proposed technology provides immediate benefits to NASA and Non-NASA commercial applications.","UC's proposed technology will provide immediate benefits to NASA.  The increasing use of airspace by (semi-) autonomous vehicles for(scientific,  civil or military)applications and the proliferation of orbital clutter composed of objects such as satellites, crafts, stations and more, is increasing the likelihood of accidental collisions between objects ? a possibility which carries a high toll in terms of financial cost and loss of life. UC's technology, if integrated into the payload delivery and control mechanisms of orbiting and exploration machinery, would enable automated collision avoidance. This capability would measurably increase the safety of space exploration, both manned and unmanned, and decrease costs associated with equipment damage resultant from collisions. The proposed technology will minimize the crew time required for spacecraft operations through automation, enabling the most productive use of minimal personnel. In addition, the object avoidance capabilities can be integrated into unmanned space vehicles and exploration machinery such as Mars Rovers, enhancing their mission capabilities and facilitating a greater degree of remote exploration.","UC adaptive obstacle avoidance technology has extensive utility for military and commercial applications. Intelligent collision avoidance will greatly enhance the combat effectiveness of autonomous vehicles in heterogeneous 3D environments. The technology provides the solution to the ""see-and-avoid"" requirements allowing UAVs unrestricted access to all military and civil regions such as low/high altitude airspace.

This type of filter consists of a lattice of different porosity layers formed in monocrystalline silicon by electrochemical means. Due to the nature of the material, mesoporous silicon filters do not suffer from thermal, mechanical, and environmental instabilities. More over, due to the high transparency of the mesoporous silicon throughout a large part of the far IR range, such filters can be made for wavelengths far longer than those that can be addressed with conventional interference filter technology. They will considerably outperform filters based on metal meshes. Such filters are expected to impact astronomical, commercial, military and scientific communities in many filter applications. In Phase I, the feasibility of the method was demonstrated by fabricating porous multilayers with ultrahigh thicknesses and good long wave pass and bandpass characteristics in the mid-to-far IR. In Phase II, optimized filters will be fabricated and their properties compared with design predictions. Phase III will involve product design, fabricating filter structures to meet customers' physical as well as optical needs, and marketing and sales investments.","Far-infrared imaging is a powerful technique to study the center of our galaxy and beyond. However, this wavelength range is difficult to work in. At these wavelengths, room temperature objects emit strongly. The strong Earth background causes weak signal-to-noise ratios.

Currently used filters suffer from problems stemming from the lack of materials that are transparent, stable and compatible with each other at these wavelengths. The proposed type of filter can solve these problems.","Narrow band pass, band pass and band blocking mid and far IR filters are used in environmental monitoring, chemical and biological analysis, imaging and other areas.

With Doppler radar systems from companies such as Baron Services starting at $300k and approaching $1M, the DPR is an attractive option at approximately $200-250K.  Additionally, the DPR will enable many research institutions, such as universities, government and private sector research labs, to advance their efforts in the areas of precipitation studies, weather forecasting and long-term climate forecasting while fitting within their budgets. With billions of dollars being spent on weather products and forecasting, this unique and low-cost sensor network will improve local QPE measurements and forecasts."

Hittite Microwave Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company that has been developing microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMIC) for over 19 years.  The T/R module circuit functions are diverse imposing several different process requirements.  For example the key process specification for the LNA is the minimum noise figure (Fmin) of the process, for the control functions the switch cutoff frequency, and for the PA the power added efficiency.  Hittite has focused on developing E/D PHEMT processes and simulations presented in this Phase II proposal are based on models from a new Triquint E/D PHEMT process.

SI2 Technologies' innovation is to apply its Direct Write techniques to fabricating flexible T/R modules that can be integrated with each array element.  The novelty of SI2's Direct Write manufacturing approach is that no tooling, masks, or harsh etchants are required.  SI2's ""printing"" technology lends itself to any number of applications that require flexible antenna systems (e.g., earth science, military asset tracking, civilian communications, etc.).

Such a large aperture phased array will enable measurement and monitoring of a number of geophysical processes that is not possible today.  For instance, an L-band SAR would be capable of measuring soil moisture, ocean circulation, and glacial flow under a number of conditions with fine resolution and minimal temporal effects.","Non-NASA applications of this technology include the development of flexible and conformal T/R modules for military applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles.

The resulting application will complement existing technologies, and serve as a rich, integrated interface that allows one to more easily and quickly plan for, analyze, and react to wildfires.","The research disseminates the work currently being done by scientists in the Ecological Forecasting Group at NASA Ames, complementing the past investment NASA has made in this work.  Our proposed wildfire intelligence portal will leverage emerging NASA MODIS products and combine that data with data from other sources, so as to add a richer layer of knowledge to the existing products.  Our proposed system, when implemented and deployed, will give NASA scientists the opportunity to gather feedback about the applicability of those products.   Based on evaluations from domain experts, NASA will be able to better assess its practicality and may be able to gain detailed domain knowledge that can help refine and extend its current product set.","The research has a direct application to a series of industry-specific, vertical portals that we are designing, such as a portal for sporting goods intelligence (""Sports InSite"").  The next-generation of our constraint-based integration technology will serve as the infrastructure for the front-ends to these vertical portals and allow us greater flexibility and automation during development and deployment.  Other aspects of our Phase II work, such as implementation of support for user-defined extensions and automatic highlighting of new information, also have direct commerical relevance, as these needs are ubiquitous in portal systems."

The approach is innovative in three ways.  First, it proposes a complete end-to-end system instead of a solution that addresses only a single step of the complex problem of accurately gathering, processing, and reporting of the data.   Second, it proposes a system that is designed to minimize human interaction and manual data entry.  Third (and possibly the most important) is that it proposes both the implementation of multiple algorithms to perform the data processing, as well as an extensible, open software architecture which allows algorithms to be incorporated into the system in the future.  This approach allows for the development of a dynamic system which can be extended not only by DDS, but by third parties as well.  Our proposal is relevant to topic E3.03 in that it provides for the efficient production of a DEM product from an active imaging system (LIDAR).","Lunar and Martial Surface Mapping ? NASA leveraged LIDAR technology as part of the Clementine project for mapping the LUNAR surface and will continue this effort with the Lunar and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter projects.  This high resolution data will be the key to determining optimal landing and environment exploitation sites. Weather Studies ? LIDAR is being used by NASA for discovering how high, thin clouds at many heights affect climate, understanding how dust and other particles move across the globe,  and exploring aerosols and clouds on other planets by satellite.  This capability is made possible with the use of Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) and was tested in the LIDAR Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE). Spacecraft Fault Detection ? As part of the Orbiter Boom Sensor system Optech and MD Robotics are attaching a LIDAR scanner to the boom of the space shuttle remote manipulator system (SMRS), in order to scan the surface of the spacecraft for faults.  This was developed in wake of the Space Shuttle Columbia incident.  Earth Science ? All applications of Earth Science benefit from accurate Digital Elevation Models derived from LIDAR data.  This includes floodplain mapping, precision agriculture, land use, forestry management and many other applications.","Disaster Management ? LIDAR data has been found useful for disaster management purposes, such as recovery of the World Trade Center, hurricane destruction analysis, and plume propagation modeling. Topographical Update ? LIDAR data is being utilized for topographical update projects. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has initiated a modernization of floodplain maps throughout the United States using LIDAR data in its Map Modernization Initiative. Coastal Erosion ? LIDAR data is currently being utilized to detect coastal changes in order to study coastal erosion. Nautical Charting ?LIDAR is being utilized for measuring seabed depths and topographic elevations for navigation, nautical chartering, rapid environmental assessment, and regional costal zone mapping.

POC proposed to develop a next generation ""true"" 3D visualization system that works without headwear and to link it through the NLR with a remote computing center.  To accomplish this goal we have developed in Phase I a fully functional 3D Multichannel Networked (3DMCN) system based on stereoscopic principles and compatible with the NLR network.  One of the enabling technologies that is being developed in this project is multicorrelated channel video compression, which takes advantage of spatial redundancy in multiscopic channels.  The Phase I demonstration included stereoscopic 3DMCN system linked to live real-time high definition (1080i) dual-channel video.  In Phase II we will continue the development of a new compression scheme that can offer 200-300% improvement in compression ratios for multiscopic channels versus independent channel compression used in other state-of-the-art compression approaches.  We will also concentrate on the improvement of the existing true 3D visualization system in terms of higher resolution, lower channel-to-channel crosstalk, and wider field-of-view.","The initial candidate NASA applications with the greatest potential for benefiting from improved multichannel compression fall into three categories. The first is Multi-Channel Video Compression Scientific Visualization, which offers the potential for collaborative efforts with true 3D displays; one rendering supercluster will be able to serve multiple visualization locations separated by thousands of miles.  The second is Scientific Data Visualization, which includes 3D visualization of scientific data for analysis, computer modeling, and simulation over the NLR.  The third is Live Multichannel Video Transmission, which involves multichannel data being transmitted in real time for display of sensing data/imagery acquired by satellite or aircraft in high definition.","Other potential government applications include:  3D visualization of forests and farmlands to monitor plant species, crop health, the impact of drought conditions, and the spread of plant diseases, etc., environmental monitoring of land use, vegetation coverage, water resources, pollution, etc.; visualization of natural disasters to assess damage and identify areas in critical need of assistance, and to identify endangered areas, as well as to forecast crop yields.

Each satellite is capable of entering into negotiations for a viewing opportunity via a Contract Net type protocol; and is capable of optimizing its bid.  As sensor deployment increases and autonomous vehicles become more robust, the need for a framework to support multi-sensor re-targeting in a dynamic environment involving multiple organizations becomes more acute. In our Phase 2 effort, we will extend the framework to include support for multiple types of sensor platforms as well as more sophisticated variants of the Contract Net Protocol. We will define various agent 'templates' specialized to the needs of the multi-sensor re-targeting environment. In Phase 2, the improved framework, AAMSRT, will support policy utilization to govern the sensor re-tasking. As part of the Phase 2 effort, we will engage the Open Geospatial Consortium for applicable standards, including use of SensorML, services, and OGC initiatives regarding sensor planning.","Commercialization potential of our proposed de-centralized and distributed AAMSRT framework extends to those cases involving a dynamic situation in which numerous sensor resources hosted on different types of platforms with different capabilities must be leveraged. This situation occurs in a number of application areas; hence, these areas hold the largest commercialization potential. The overarching application area area for NASA is that of  'Sensor Web', which involves specific applications such as earth observing and remote sensing projects for ecology applications and basic science.","Other application areas for our proposed de-centralized and distributed AAMSRT framework involve homeland security, commercial industry security, and DoD applications. One homeland security need occurs at land borders, involving fixed sensor assets, mobile robots, and UAVs. Commercial industries also have the need for multi-sensor retargeting further with regard to sprawling critical infrastructure areas, such as in rail yards; this involves fixed sensor nets and sensors located on mobile robots. The US Coast Guard has a similar need for AAMSRT; this involves sensors that oversee harbor areas, including sensors that are hosted on surface vessels and sensors that are located in buoys and on wharfs.

This work will be applied to two-color detectors and 320 ? 256 focal plane arrays during the proposed Phase II effort, leading to the next generation of HgCdTe infrared focal plane arrays. Multicolor detection will involve only an incremental development of the current skimming employed in Phase I. The resistor used in Phase I for skimming will be replaced with a photovoltaic detector that will have two functions: first, it will allow skimming by collecting part of the current flowing through the main detectors, and second, it will act as an independent detector for a second color. By employing a non-equilibrium mode of operation for the same detector, the majority and minority carrier densities will be greatly reduced. This will suppress Auger recombination processes in the active layers, and lead to dramatic increases in recombination lifetimes, dynamic impedances and detectivities.

The developed software products will be extensible and adaptable for future EMFF applications. Initial testing will be on EMFF hardware developed for a related DARPA program and loaned to this effort at no cost to the SBIR program.","EMFF has applications in planned future space telescopes such as MAXIM, TPF-I, Life Finder, GEN-X, XEUS, UVOI (Stellar Imager), FISI (SPECS), as well as in telescope assembly where it provides a propellant-less method for assembling hexagonal facets of a large primary mirror by using two EMFF space tugs, eliminating propellant contamination concerns. EMFF applications for low-earth orbit solutions include mitigation of differential J2 geo-potential perturbations for close proximity formations, maintenance of non-Keplerian formations, control of sparse aperture Earth-observing radar systems, and control of single spacecraft slewing and pointing control against Earth's magnetic field. Applications also exist for future exploration systems, including propellant-less inspection vehicle for long duration missions to Mars, tending of orbital fuel depots, docking and jettison of modules in a geometrically reconfigurable spacecraft, and electromagnetic rail gun for de-orbiting cargo enroute to the lunar surface.",Non-NASA applications for EMFF technology include: using the high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils to create high authority torque coils for single spacecraft in low-earth-orbit; transferring power between spacecraft spinning up energy storage flywheels on one spacecraft and using HTS coils on another; using the coils in a passive offensive mode where charged particles from the thrusters of another vehicle can be redirected to impinge upon that vehicle; using the coils in a passive defensive mode where they are used to distort the Earth's magnetic field in the vicinity of the spacecraft and thereby confuse magnetic sensors on other local spacecraft; holding occulters and sun shields in the proximity of a parent vehicle; stacking GEO assets in the direction normal to the orbital plane; provide slewing and attitude control for large cable-tensioned structures; and diversion of high energy charged particles to help protect sensitive avionics.

Present day Sun-Earth Connection missions like SOHO, or future missions, including the Solar Dynamics (SDO) almost exclusively analyze their data in IDL. However, the increasing amount of data produced by these missions, and the increasing complexity of image processing algorithms, requires higher computing power. Cluster computing is a cost-effective way to increase the speed of computation. Enhancing IDL to work on clusters gives scientists access to increased performance in a familiar programming environment. We propose to develop a tool suite that enables IDL to benefit from cluster systems. We demonstrated in Phase I the availability of all key technologies by developing prototype implementations. The main emphasis of the Phase II will be to enhance the interactivity of the tools and advance the suite to market-ready quality. Increased data analysis power enables e.g. near real-time data analysis for space-weather prediction or reduces the response time for analyzing data on demand, as desirable in virtual observatory environments. The wide spread of IDL allows scientists from other fields to benefit from the increased execution speed.","The problem of increasing amounts of data that needs to be analyzed exists in all branches of NASA. Increasing the computing capabilities of the data analysis software is therefore of interest to all NASA branches. The widespread use of IDL throughout NASA makes the tools developed in this project applicable, not only to the Sun-Earth Connection theme but within the entire agency. In addition, the development of a low-cost alternative to the commercial IDL software is a cost reduction factor beneficial all NASA branches.","IDL is widely used at National Laboratories, universities and private industry. Research branches processing observational data, including medical imaging, chemistry, and earth science, face the same problem of increasing amounts of data to be processed. Their interest is also to reduce the time needed to perform the analysis, making them potential customers for the tools developed in this project. The cost savings resulting from this project could make it even more attractive,especially to private industry."

Our solution consists of two integrated products, IDDat and RemoteMiner:   (1) IDDat is an advanced grid-based computing infrastructure which acts as an add-on to VOs and supports processing and remote data analysis of widely distributed data in space sciences.  IDDat middleware design is such as to reduce undue network traffic on the VO.  (2)  RemoteMiner is a novel data mining engine that connects to the VO via the IDDat.  It supports multi-users, has autonomous operation for automated systematic identification while enabling the advanced users to do their own mining and can be used by data centers for pre-mining.  In addition, our data mining algorithms have reverse engineering capabilities which enable analytical derivation of models from time series data.   These innovations will significantly enhance the science return from NASA missions by providing data centers and individual researchers alike an unprecedented capability to mine vast quantities of data.  Phase II work will encompass the building of a full commercial product with associated production quality technical and user documentation.","NASA is a data centric organization and as such shares with many industries an urgent need for sophisticated data mining technologies to deal with the tsunami of data.  Today, the vast majority of spacecraft data from past missions remain unexplored and this situation will worsen with the many planned multi-spacecraft missions (THEMIS, MMS, ST5, etc.).  Our proposed solution provides the necessary data analysis infrastructure and tools for the existing and the planned missions.  It leverages on-going efforts in the grid computing community.  Our technology is also expected to be relevant to other divisions within NASA such as the Intelligent Systems Project which supports development of autonomous systems.","All industries that deal with data are potential customers of our product.  No commercial data mining engine offers all of these facilities and a few systems support only a small fraction of the solution.  Given the customization of our solution to VO, NASA will clearly remain one of our main target areas beyond Phase II.   However, we have already identified several other important markets for deployment of our product including NSF, and DOE within the Federal Government as well as pharmaceutical, bioinformatics, health care, fraud detection and network intrusion detection in the commercial sector."

Metal mesh filters, based on a free-standing sheet of metal with a periodic area of apertures, have been used for many years. However, they have proven to be extremely difficult and costly to fabricate and are not presently available over a large part of the terahertz frequency band (100 GHz through 10 THz). Also, the terahertz filters that are available from commercial suppliers tend to have unacceptable loss in the pass-band (20% or more) and often cost over one thousand dollars per filter. Through this program VDI is developing new fabrication processes and mesh designs that will improve performance and greatly reduce costs. Successful completion of this program will make the filters available for NASA's terahertz missions, facilitate the development of improved terahertz detectors (by facilitating bolometer calibration and testing) and also make the filters commercially available for the greater range of terahertz applications that are now emerging, such as imaging systems and spectrometers.","The new filters will facilitate the development of extremely sensitive direct detector for terahertz applications. For example, JPL requires cooled bandpass filters to prevent saturation of new detectors by stray radiation and to reduce background noise. Astronomical researchers at JPL are developing a wide array of cryogenic detectors for the 1- 10 THz frequency band. Thus, the filters should be made available for each of the frequencies at which such detectors will be used for astronomical observations. A second important application for these filters is in calibrating receivers. For example heterodyne receivers based on hot electron bolometric (HEB) mixers have recently been found to be susceptible to a direct detection heating effect caused by background radiation. Even though astronomical receivers will not be affected by this problem once they are exposed only to the cold sky, this problem can prevent the accurate calibration of the mixers in the laboratory. Cooled bandpass filters are required to alleviate this problem.","Scientific applications of terahertz filters include chemical spectroscopy, plasma diagnostics, biomaterial analysis, electron spin resonance, and diagnostic instruments for particle accelerators. Military applications include compact range radars, covert communications systems, imaging systems, and chemical, explosive and bioagent scanners.  Potential large-scale commercial applications of the proposed terahertz filters include portal security imagers and scanners, medical diagnostics for clinical use, last-mile data links, and industrial process control. As terahertz scientists at NASA and elsewhere strive to create more advanced and elaborate terahertz systems, they will benefit from a wider array of fundamental system components, such as those that are available at microwave frequencies. Examples include circulators, isolator, attenuators, rapid switches and frequency filters. The filters being developing in this program represent one further step in the development of a mature terahertz technology base."

Historically the replacement materials have been carried with the spacecraft.  This problem increases dramatically as mission duration and distance from the earth increases, as in missions to Saturn or Titan.  It is estimated that a buoyant vehicle operating on Titan may require 75 g of make-up hydrogen per week.  This represents approximately 35 kg of additional mass at launch solely for the storage of make-up hydrogen to maintain buoyancy of the craft on Titan for a one-year mission.  During the Phase I project Lynntech demonstrated that hydrogen can be generated in-situ directly from the Titan atmosphere from 100 K to 300 K with 10 watts using proprietary plasma reformation techniques, and that metal hydrides are viable hydrogen separation devices.  Lynntech's low volume, low mass (~2 kg) system will save approximately 33 kg at launch ( >$72M) for a one year Titan mission. Based on a conservative estimate (using Mars mission equivalency factors), Lynntech's proposed system has an advantageous equivalent system mass (ESM) after only 47 mission days.  The Phase II effort will focus on further improving hydrogen production efficiency and a long-term endurance test of the system.","For Phase III, Lynntech will manufacture, flight qualify and deliver two mission-ready units to NASA.  With a significant increase in power, an additional NASA application of the plasma technology is the production of oxygen from Martian or lunar regolith.  Production of oxygen on the Mars or Lunar surface is an enabling technology for future manned and unmanned missions in space.  The oxygen generated can be used for breathing, propulsion, or in portable power generation equipment (i.e., fuel cells etc.).","U.S. commercial vehicles operate >215.8 billion miles annually as part of the more than 2 trillion miles traveled by all vehicles on U.S. roadways.  Heavy trucks and busses contribute more than 25% of NOX emissions.  By slightly modifying the device proposed here to operate using diesel fuel, the plasma reformer can be used to provide small amounts of hydrogen to be injected with the fuel in diesel engines.  This hydrogen serves to reduce NOX emissions by a factor of ten.  Because of its cost, simplicity and robustness, Lynntech's plasma reforming technology is an elegant solution to a longstanding emissions problem."

Magnesium diboride, a light-weight superconductor wire, is the ideal candidate coil material for ADRs in the 10-30 K range.  During the Phase I we demonstrated that drawing magnesium diboride wires to the needed diameter range could be achieved.  However to meet the most desired application requirements we need slight improvement in superconductor current density, reduction of powder filament size, and higher percent superconductor fraction at the desired wire diameter range of 0.075 mm - 0.150 mm.

This is particularly true for secondary mirrors, as they are convex and thus require large-aperture optics to test them.  Recent NASA programs, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), include monolithic secondary mirrors of significant size (larger than half a meter).  Secondary mirrors of such large sizes are difficult and expensive to test due to the large-aperture converging and nulling optics required.  Furthermore, calibration of these optics to the level required for next-generation programs is extremely challenging.  Subaperture stitching has the potential to provide accurate high-resolution maps of large-aperture aspheric optics without the use of even larger aperture optics or dedicated nulls.  QED's Subaperture Stitching Interferometer (SSIREG) has achieved nanometer-level accuracies on spherical optics with its novel compensation techniques.  Non-null capability is enhanced since the individual subapertures have significantly less aspheric departure.  However, the system is currently only capable of testing up to 280 mm optics of mild asphericity.  Phase I work demonstrated that the technology is scalable to larger aperture sizes.  This proposal focuses on innovations for leveraging the considerable benefits of stitching (high resolution, automatic calibration, and flexible aspheric testing) to aspheric optics.  Activities will include uncertainty analyses of aspheric tests, subscale measurement demonstrations, and development of concepts for testing larger amounts of aspheric departure.","This work will significantly enhance the efficiency, capability, and flexibility of large-aperture aspheric testing, particularly for convex surfaces, but also including monolithic and segmented concave surfaces.

Interconnects are needed that provide the required signal paths while imparting a total thermal heat load on the detector stage of less than 0.5 microwatts.

Experiments in the limited-space environment require from a GC system maximum productivity and universality with minimal resource consumption. A combination of a miniature short-column chromatograph with a detector capable of identifying unknown species would be an ideal instrument for flight analysis. A low-resource and power consumption micro-sized GC detector that is proposed for development in Phase II of this project is based on a technology of Penning Ionization Electron Spectroscopy in plasma (PIES). Adding another analytical dimension to the amperometric method that has earlier been employed in the metastable ionization detector (MID), PIES technology relies on the measurement of the energy of electrons liberated by Penning ionization in collisions between analyte molecules and helium metastable atoms in the afterglow of a gas discharge. Since the energy of Penning electrons is specific to the species, the resultant data can be used to identify gas components.  No optics or high vacuum is required, and the spectra in this technique are recorded by using a collector electrode placed into a glow discharge cell. In the Phase I of the project, the technology has been expanded to flowing plasmas with linear gas velocities of up to 9.3 m/s where PIES spectra were recorded in ~1.5 s. Phase II of the project is focused on further increasing the data acquisition rates, realization of PIES detector in a compact design, development of advanced measurement electronics, and testing the prototype detector with a commercial high-speed gas chromatograph.","A GC-PIES analytical device is intended for use in exobiology experiments onboard spacecraft or space probes where the detection and identification of a wide range of chemical species, over vast concentration ranges is often a primary requirement. Further advance of PIES technology to on-chip packaging would lead to the development of a MEMS GC-PIES micro-device capable of in sutu multi-species analysis with identification of unknown species. Such a micro-total-analysis-system (mu-TAS) would be is especially suited for carrying out gas analysis under severely limited conditions of planetary missions. Another potential NASA application of the instrument is monitoring environment onboard a spacecraft.","Miniature and portable analytical devices which would provide real-time identification of various gases are required in the majority of the GC detection fields. Such technologies are needed in industrial, forensic, military, security, science, environmental, educational and other areas. Some specific applications include: air quality monitoring, manufacturing process control, emission control, hazardous waste treatment,  airport security, weapons drug, alcohol, and other contraband detection; landmine detection; individual/consumer applications including but not limited to house and vehicle monitoring systems and many others."

A first-generation prototype motor was designed, built and tested in Venus-like conditions (460oC temperature, mostly CO2 gas environment) during Phase I. The Phase I tests demonstrated the feasibility of the design through verification that the motor can operate at 460oC for an extended period of time. A further developed and optimized version of this motor could be used to actuate drills, robotic arms, and other devices outside of an environment-controlled landed platform on the surface of Venus. The motor's capability to survive for hours (and potentially longer) in that environment is a major benefit to future Venus science missions since it would allow time for communication ground loops to optimize drill target selection and allow for multiple samples to be acquired from the subsurface. An extreme temperature motor would therefore revolutionize the exploration of Venus. In Phase II, both an extreme environment motor and an extreme environment drill system will be developed to TRL 6. Aside from Venus exploration, other potential NASA and non-NASA applications for an extreme temperature motor include actuation of fluid pumps, gimbals, robotic joints and manipulation systems, as well as turbine, expendable launch vehicle and furnace tending system components.","An extreme temperature motor a drill system developed to TRL would be a great asset to the Venus exploration program. Such a motor would allow actuation of robotic devices such as drilling and sampling systems, sample manipulation and comminution devices, robotic arms, and any other devices that require actuation outside of an environment-controlled landed pressure vessel. Operation of devices for extended durations outside of the landed vessel, particularly a 30 centimeter (or greater) depth drilling system, would revolutionize Venus surface exploration. Applicable missions include the Venus In Situ Explorer identified at a New Frontiers mission candidate and subsequent Venus Surface Sample Return missions. Also, technologies developed under the Prometheus program could employ extreme temperature motors, for example to actuate pumps and valves for liquid metal cooling systems. In addition to these applications, terrestrial robotic exploration of volcanoes and deep ocean hydrothermal vents could employ extreme temperature motors. These extreme environments are of scientific interest to both NASA and non-NASA agencies because insight into active earth processes and the origin and survivability of life would be gained. Also, the science gathered and technologies demonstrated could be applied to analog sites across the solar system. Other potential applications include motors for gimbal systems or other devices on spacecraft that orbit close to the sun or Mercury.","The most promising non-NASA application is actuation of electrical submersible pumps used in oil and geothermal wells to lift material to the surface. The temperature limit of these pumps essentially limits the depth at which they can be used, since temperature generally increases with increase in well depth. Therefore a pump that can operate at temperatures beyond what is currently achievable (300oC) would allow material transport from deeper wells. Other potential applications identified include (1) gas turbine starter/generators for aircraft engines, (2) actuators for turbine fuel and steam control, inlet guide vane positioning, bleed heat valve control and remote sub-sea system actuation, (3) high temperature electromechanical actuation systems for expendable launch vehicle thrust vector control and gimbaling of engines and adaptable aerodynamic surfaces, and (4) furnace tending for glass/ceramic manufacturing (for example, loading and unloading of castings, glass furnaces and hot or heavy metal, glass or ceramic parts.)"

Phase I results have shown the feasibility of these tools, which consist of novel modeling tools and advanced system and data analysis capability. The modeling tools differ from all known technologies in that they facilitate the capture of experimental data on COTS devices that get automatically transformed through novel modeling methods into newly created behavioral models with performance degradation and lifetime effects. These tools are relevant and important in providing NASA the means to quantify the reliability and lifetime (i.e., capability and risk) of COTS components and COTS-based systems and provide a trade structure for the assessment of competing technologies. Furthermore, these modeling and design tools provide a means of integrating disparate models, allow agile evolution of models, and encourage MBD reporting mechanisms be used in reviews. Ultimately, these MBD tools will enable lower-cost system development and cost versus lifetime assessment, shorten development time, and extend flight-proven technology to broader applications. Lynguent plans to develop MBD tools based on its Phase I feasibility study and to utilize a high temperature testbed (DC-DC converter) as a case study to demonstrate a calibration methodology for the tools to insure accuracy with respect to accelerated testing results. This calibration methodology will be developed in consultation with leading experts in the field of reliability modeling and high temperature measurements of electronics and packaging.","The potential NASA applications include all manned and unmanned vehicles that involve electronics (COTS-based or not). The tools being developed at Lynguent will offer a consistent approach to modeling, simulation and data management, test bench development, archival of test and simulation data along with the models used for design, and specification management. The Lyngo collaborative design environment will be new capability for modeling and design debugging in multiple commercially available tool flows. Thus, as a third party add-on tool suite, these tools will apply to electronics and mixed-technology systems that go onboard all NASA vehicles.","Lynguent's tools(ModLyng and Lyngo) are designed to be more mainstream than simply extreme environments. Since these tools are based on hardware description languages, they are applicable to any discipline (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic) where models can be expressed in terms of differential, algebraic equations. Event-driven phenomena can be modeled and simulated (i.e., digital or analog event-driven). The mix of these disciplines is also possible (i.e., mixed-technology). So, among the non-NASA applications are any electronics-based design involving analog, digital, mixed-signal electronics as well as mixed-technology systems such as MEMS. This is a very broad market spanning military and commercial applications, including transportation, medical electronics, semiconductor, and consumer product segments."

In order to achieve the desired performance from space, the antenna systems must have surface areas that are hundreds of square meters in size. However, to make it affordable to deploy such large-area antennas into space, it is necessary to fabricate these antennas on flexible substrates, which are lightweight, and can be rolled into small volumes. The fabrication of flexible antennas calls for new manufacturing techniques that are capable of addressing the challenges of patterning high-resolution features on very-large area flexible substrates, while achieving precise registration of the antenna features over the entire substrate area. In this Phase II proposal we will develop and demonstrate processes to fabricate large-area antennas on flexible substrates, focusing, in particular, on JPL's 2 x 3 m active membrane phased array radar; and we will fabricate the flexible panels required for JPL's antenna. The fabrication of the array antenna will be performed using Anvik's novel large-area roll-to-roll photolithography technology, which enables high-resolution and micron-level registration on large-area flexible substrates.","Large-area antennas offer the potential for highly sensitive and highly directional terrain mapping, and thus are essential for providing information for scientific use. For example, electronically steerable phased arrays provide the capability to detect surface and subsurface topology including ice or features hidden by surface dust, and are thus attractive for a variety of NASA earth sensing missions, as well as missions to other planets and moons within our solar system. The very-large area flexible substrate patterning technology developed for this program will also be highly attractive for many other NASA programs. For example, solar sails and gossamer spacecraft will use ultra-thin flexible substrates with integrated electronics, communications, and power systems. Additionally, sensor skins consisting of arrays of sensors will need to be applied conformally to very-large area structures, such as aircraft wings and buildings, requiring the fabrication of electronics and MEMS on flexible materials. The NASA balloon program, which uses large-area flexible substrates for exploration of earth's atmosphere would also benefit through the integration of electronics and sensors into the ultra-thin balloon material.","There are numerous applications for Anvik's flexible antenna fabrication technology in both the commercial and military sectors. For example, soldiers in the field would greatly benefit from flexible antennas due to their light weight and convenient portability, thus reducing the burden they must carry. Additionally, Anvik's lithography-on-flex technology can be used to manufacture frequency selective surfaces (FSS), which consist of repeating arrays of features that selectively absorb or transmit electromagnetic energy, typically at microwave frequencies. Fabricated on large sheets of flexible material, FSS can be applied to ships, for example, to improve their stealth capability; or may be used in commercial or military aircraft, in conjunction with conformable antennas, to serve as radomes, while optimizing aerodynamic performance. As another example, large-area flexible displays have enormous military and commercial applications. For the military, they will provide a reduction in the load a soldier must carry, while reducing the power levels needed for operation. In commercial applications, they will find widespread use in home entertainment, as well as in cell phones and automobiles. Additionally, manufacturing technology for flexible electronics is essential for the enormous mobile electronics market, where lightweight and conformability are key factors that determine the success of a product."

Although there are several miniature TOF-MS systems currently available (NASA has a design available for licensing) the proposed innovation will out-perform all of the miniature designs currently available by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (resolution and sensitivity) and has mass resolution comparable to current full-size research instruments. For commercial applications where volume, mass and power requirements are not so stringent, a device that performs better than current full-sized instruments can be designed.","NASA has identified a need for a miniature, high-resolution, high-sensitivity (femtomolar) tech-nique to identify biologically important molecules for astrobiology applications such as missions to Mars and Europa and for conducting molecular biology experiments on the international space station. Laser-based TOF-MS is a powerful technique for the detection and identification of a wide range of atoms and molecules. For biological molecules, MALDI TOF-MS can detect DNA/RNA fragments, whole proteins and peptides and digested protein fragments. In addition to biological applications, laser-based TOF-MS can analyze a variety of analytes from numerous matrices including isotopic and elemental analysis. Our design can meet the requirements for mass range and sensitivity as well as requirements for volume, mass and power. Having demon-strated that this technology works; solutions to the few technical/engineering problems identified during this work, as well and integrating a sample introduction/translation system etc. can be ad-dressed in a Phase II grant.

Affordable planning and execution of prolonged manned space missions depend upon the utilization of local resources (e.g., soil, atmosphere, etc.) and the waste products which are formed in manned spacecraft and surface bases.  The purpose of the investigation is to develop materials and associated processing technologies for habitat structure on planetary surfaces to effectively shield humans and sensitive electronics such as solar arrays and integrated circuits from the harmful effect of deep space radiation environment.  Unlike Earth, on the Lunar or Martian surface, there is practically no protection from primary deep space radiation sources such as Solar Particle Events (SPEs) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs).  SPEs produce intermittent and extremely high fluxes of charged energetic particles associated with major solar flares.","The development envisioned in our program will synthesize ethylene, and, subsequently polyethylene. Polyethylene can be used in the construction of habitats, tools, and replacement parts. Assuming a successful Phase II program, our preliminary design will serve as a basis for an ISRU system that can be used Mars Exploration and settlement. We expect that the NASA/government market to be driven by NASA's Astrobiology and space exploration programs. We envision ISRU demonstration experiment and pilot scale payloads as part of future Mars landers.  The in situ production of polyethylene and perhaps nutrients provide enormous cost savings for early Mars missions and therefore we are confident of early precursor flight experiment opportunities.","While it is often difficult to identify near term commercial applications of technology directed to ISRU projects, there are significant near term commercial applications of this technology.

An example is the production of syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) from hydrocarbon fuels. This application provides an alternative source to petrochemical refining for fine chemical production.

Current mechanical excavators mount a fixed array of rock cutting tools on a cutterhead that operates efficiently only in a narrow range of material conditions. The LPE would be able to accommodate the different materials that are encountered on planetary surfaces. The LPE will sense geologic changes and respond with changes to achieve the lowest cutting energy possible. The result is a flexible machine with reduced power requirements. A large LPE would be used to mine ice deposits and regolith for processing, and to excavate openings for habitats and shielding. A small LPE would be used for exploration. One LPE would be simpler and easier to maintain than a stable of excavators, each for a specific geology or application. Phase II will further define the properties of the ice-regolith mixtures and then design, develop, test, and deliver a functional prototype LPE unit to NASA.","Excavations for ISRU are included in many NASA scenarios to reduce mission operations costs. The LPE would be a general-purpose machine with the ability to excavate regolith and ice-regolith mixtures; it would also support surface construction activities. The LPE is easily scaled from very small to large. It is applicable to future manned/unmanned exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. It could also be adapted for use in ultra-low gravity environments, such as asteroids. Efficient and reliable excavation of a wide variety of planetary surface materials will greatly enhance/enable exploration and bases from start-up outposts to advanced self-sustaining complexes.","The same qualities of the LPE that apply to space would also attract terrestrial users. Development of the LPE will improve terrestrial excavators. The terrestrial market is expanding rapidly as demand for urban infrastructure (foundation openings, transportation tunnels, utility passages, etc.) skyrockets. Urban construction settings restrict the use of explosives, to minimize damaging vibrations, making mechanical methods attractive. In addition, shallow tunnel construction is rapidly changing from cut-and-cover to wholly underground, because excavations disrupt city traffic.

(MEI) supported by Lockheed Martin and the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) propose to develop an integrated hydrogen generator and purifier system for conversion of in-situ produced hydrocarbons to fuel-cell-grade hydrogen.  With increased space exploration activities, mobility on planetary surfaces becomes a vital resource: without mobility on the surface, exploration activities are limited to landing sites.  There are many needs and many solutions to the mobility challenge, depending on the distance and nature of the transportation required.  Rovers provide a range of transportation possibilities, from the very small rovers for site recognition to the large rovers for crew transportation during extra vehicular activities (EVA).  While very small rovers may be powered by photovoltaic cells, fuel-cell based power systems may be the alternative to power mid-size to large rovers.  Due to the various penalties of storing gaseous hydrogen on-board the rover, it is advantageous to carry methane instead of hydrogen and to have an on-board reformer to produce hydrogen on-demand for the fuel cell.  Proton exchange membranes (PEM) are currently the choice on many fuel-cell based power systems.  While other fuel cell technologies are being developed, proton exchange membranes (PEM) are currently the choice on many fuel-cell based power systems.  The proposed system combines microchannel microreformer technology for hydrogen production with palladium membrane technology for hydrogen purification and separation in an integrated hydrogen production system, resulting in optimized size and energy efficiency.","The technology developed for the proposed Reformer System will serve in multiple future exploration missions. The application is of direct use for any applications where mobile power is required, such as rovers and crew transport vehicles. For instance, in the earlier precursor robotic missions, robotic rovers may be needed for automated ISRU plants, to transport materials being processed, etc. In the later manned missions, the crew transportation vehicles may be use to aid extra-vehicular activities.","Advanced high-density hydrogen storage and generation systems have far reaching commercial importance. Integration of such systems with fuel cells offer the promise of generating electricity and heat while offering several benefits relative to conventional generators including reduced noise, reduced emissions, high energy efficiency, and reduced maintenance.

Oxygen yields  of 15 kilograms per 100 kilograms of feed soil were demonstrated during Phase I  using both lunar and Mars soil simulants. This is about five times the oxygen  yield achievable by hydrogen reduction. Up to 30 kilograms of oxygen per 100  kilograms of feed soil are recoverable by adjustment of the carbon-silicon  ratio. Soils are sequentially subjected to iron oxide reduction by  carbon monoxide, in-situ deposition of carbon throughout the soil by carbon  monoxide disproportionation, and finally high-temperature carbothermal reduction  of silicates by the deposited carbon. COSRS operates in a closed system.  An inventory of carbon is maintained in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon  dioxide, and solid carbon. Most of the oxygen recovered from soil is in the form  of carbon monoxide, which is converted to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is then  reacted with hydrogen in a reverse water gas shift reactor. The RWGS system  regenerates carbon monoxide for use in the COSRS process and produces water,  which is electrolyzed. Hydrogen from electrolysis is recycled within the RWGS  system. Oxygen from electrolysis is the COSRS product.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters,  approximately 150 words)COSRS is a potentially enabling technology for human  Lunar exploration because it can produce the majority of the oxygen available in  undifferentiated Lunar soil, or roughly five to ten times the yield of hydrogen  reduction technologies. This increased productivity eliminates the need to  beneficiate the soil, thereby enabling automated lunar oxygen facilities that  could produce return propellant prior to the arrival of the crew. This will  greatly decrease the launch costs required to support a lunar base, and also  enable long range exploration using ballistic hoppers employing Lunar oxygen.  The COSRS will also work on asteroids, Mars, and Jupiter's moons.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters,  approximately 150 words)The integrated COSRS/RWGS/Electrolysis system has an  application in production of pure silicon metal for terrestrial manufacturing of  photovoltaics and electronics components. The integrated COSRS/RWGS/Electrolysis  system also has future applications to the production of large quantities of  oxygen, iron metal, and silicon metal from random lunar and Martian regolith for  lunar and Martian bases, and could be used in the same way to allow useful metal  production from very low grade ores on Earth. Furthermore, the closed COSRS/RWGS  system would enable the terrestrial production of iron and other metals without  generating carbon dioxide greenhouse gas."

The IMISPPS conducts both the Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) and Sabatier (S/RWGS) reactions in a single reactor to produce a useful high-specific impulse fuel (methane plus carbon monoxide) and water, which is condensed and electrolyzed to produce oxygen and hydrogen.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the S/RWGS reactor to react with fresh Martian CO2 to produce more fuel, while the oxygen is stored to provide oxidizer. Some of the carbon monoxide is removed by cryogenic separation to increase propellant specific impulse. The IMISPPS system produces the correct amount of oxygen to burn the methane produced, almost doubling the leverage of a Sabatier/Electrolysis system alone.","The IMISPPS would provide NASA with a technology capable of producing methane/oxygen rocket propellant on Mars with the correct oxidizer to fuel ratio of two moles to one in a single reactor while using the CO2 atmosphere of Mars as the raw material for the production of the vast majority of the propellant.  The leverage of the hydrogen imported from Earth would be about 20, greatly reducing the cost and difficulty of Mars Sample Return missions and human missions to Mars by reducing the mass of propellant to be launched to Mars.  Operation of a single reactor would reduce the propellant production system weight and complexity compared to other systems based on the Sabatier process and an oxygen production process.","On Earth, the IMISPPS has applications in the area of carbon dioxide sequestration and processing to reduce the greenhouse effect.  For example, cement kilns emit CO2 in high concentrations amenable to separation and processing. In conjunction with a renewable or nuclear power supply that generates hydrogen, the IMISPPS system could be used to combine the hydrogen and CO2 to convert the hydrogen into a readily transportable form (methane) that easily fits into the existing energy infrastructure. The carbon monoxide produced by the IMISPPS system can also be utilized to make various commodity chemicals. Carbon monoxide is the key to Fischer-Tropschs higher hydrocarbon synthesis to produce valuable hydrocarbon products, such as alcohols, olefins and waxes.   An additional use for the carbon monoxide and methane produced by the IMISPPS system is as a strong reductant gas. The product gas produced in this system could be used in carbothermal reduction process to produce pure metals and pure silicon."

These results show the feasibility of developing miniaturized SiC multichip power modules (MCPMs) to form a core power building block component.  The MCPM building blocks utilize a distributed control and communications structure, with a communications network established between the core silicon-on-insulator (SOI) controllers of the MCPMs, but with no single controller in command of the system.

Multi-gram quantities of pure DWNTs, hydrogen-containing functional derivatives of DWNTs, highly hydrogenated fullerenes have been synthesized and incorporated in polyethylene matrix to form composite materials of exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability and enhanced proton radiation shielding efficiency.   The tensile strength of the low-density polyethylene composites with DWNTs was evaluated to be in excess of 200 MPa, and the Young's modulus exceeds 3500 MPa, while the composite toughness is retained at a very high level of ca. 10 J/cm3. These values compare favorably to the strongest polymer films, including those of aramide polymers. The thermal oxidation degradation point of polyethylene is up-shifted by more than 100 oC at 1 wt. % loading of the DWNT filler. A prominent increase in proton radiation shielding efficiency, reaching 35 % in terms of water equivalence thickness was obtained for composites containing DWNTs and fullerene hydrides. Virtually no degradation in properties was observed upon proton irradiation.  In Phase II, the central technological achievement of Phase I effort, the effective lamination of the unique as-produced DWNT films with polyethylene will be further developed for manufacturing practical composite articles for aerospace applications, including advanced components for EVA suits.

The CO2 and humidity control unit in the existing PLSS design is relatively large, since it has to remove 8 hours worth of CO2.  If the sorbent regeneration can be carried out during the extravehicular activity (EVA) with a relatively high regeneration frequency, the size of the sorbent canister and weight can be significantly reduced.TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a compact, regenerable sorbent-based system to control CO2 and humidity in the space suit ventilation loop.  The sorbent can be regenerated using space vacuum during the EVA, eliminating all duration-limiting elements in the life support system.","The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact, and simple CO2 and H2O removal system for the PLSS.  Use of regenerable systems that reduce weight and volume in the EMU is of critical importance to NASA both for low orbit operations and for long duration manned missions.The sorbent developed for this project can also find use in the spacecraft air revitalization.  For the shuttle application, in which CO2 recovery is not as critical. the same pressure swing system can be used in combination with the space purge.  In other spacecraft systems, this system can be coupled with a CO2 pump/compressor, storage tank and a Sabatier reactor for an Advanced Air Revitalization System to carry our combined CO2 and humidity control.","The sorbents developed in this project  can be used in the purification of natural gas, using these sorbents for CO2/CH4 separation.  Various CO2 removal technologies are being used currently to carry out CO2 removal from the natural gas, including liquid amines and molecular sieves.  Both of these systems has very high power requirement due the energy intensive regeneration process.  Since our sorbent can be regenerated by simple pressure swing, the energy consumption in these separation systems will be greatly reduced.  CO2/CH4 separation systems will be even more important in the future as the use of lower grade natural gas that contains higher CO2 levels will increase as the U.S. demand for energy grows.  These sorbents can be applied to the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) systems used in commercial hydrogen manufacturing, providing a lower cost alternative to the PSA."

However, operating complicated tools and performing intricate repairs requires manipulators of great precision and excellent coordination. Human hands are very complex instruments with capacity for reception of and reaction to tactile stimuli for guidance in their functions. Integration of tactile sensing suites into robotic platforms (presently sensor impoverished) poses major technological challenges. The IFOS team, including well-known robotic experts from Stanford and JPL, proposes smart robotic skin including embedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors, custom-engineered composite skin materials, data interpretation and on-board decision-making.

The proposed approach for this effort is to use large numbers of self-powered, miniaturized, ""stick on"" piezoelectric sensory nodes that are synchronized within a radio frequency network.  Each node will continuously monitor an accelerometer, acoustic emission sensor, or PZT element for an impact event, such as the foam impact that caused the Columbia tragedy or a micro-meteor impact.  When a programmable threshold is exceeded, a low-latency signal acquisition circuit will capture the event as a digital waveform for post-processing and impact characterization.  In addition, autonomous collaboration and synchronization between nodes of the network will provide for accurate location determination through amplitude and time-of-arrival analysis.  The innovative signal conditioning circuit design is capable of operation in the micro-watt range on average while constantly maintaining the capability to process and acquire ultrasonic acoustic signals.  Additionally, the system will provide a general purpose hardware platform on which integrated structural health monitoring algorithms and sensing techniques can be implemented.  Such performance can provide operating lifetimes of 10+ years on a single AA battery, or unlimited operation from scavenged power sources.","This system could benefit many current and future NASA space flight and exploration programs, including the Shuttle, ISS, and Project Constellation programs, or a Moon or Mars habitat, where the risk of MMOD impacts causing critical damage to vehicles or life support systems exists.  In addition to MMOD impacts, the basic design of the proposed system could be used for detection of leaks from pressurized vehicles and habitats through the produced airborne and surface-borne ultrasonic energy.  The system would also enable the detection of crack propagation in structures through Acoustic Emission techniques while requiring minimal vehicle resources.",Potential Non-NASA applications include asset monitoring during shipment or transportation through the continuous monitoring and recording of shock events for both commercial and military equipment.  Such a device could be placed in a shipping container and provide a history of any shock or high-g accelerations experienced including a timestamp and potentially location via GPS.  Currently available commercial systems have very limited battery life and only provide an indication that an acceleration threshold has been exceeded with no way to characterize the event through signal analysis techniques.

Implications of the innovation Thermal protection systems (TPS) are crucial for crew safety. New techniques of on-orbit assessment of TPS are needed to accelerate Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) development.

Many of the immediate uses are military focused from joining ceramic armor tiles to their backing plates to the use of the nano-phase particulates in self-destructing penetrators that upon missing their target would explode into dust before causing unwanted collateral damage. An ordinance related nano-phase exothermics application is for IR decoy flares. In this application, a range of nano-phase particulate would be selected for their capability to emit in the IR range and burn and radiate with the appropriate intensity. Additional DoD joining applications include  joining Si3N4 tubes to one another that would enable the fabrication on 1-meter long gun barrel linings and in applications where ceramics, ceramic composites or refractory metals need to be joined  such as hypersonic vehicles, aircraft and ordinance.

This concept is based on optimizing both the physical configuration and material selection. While yet to be proven, engineering estimates show load capacity improvements are between five and ten times other standard designs. This improvement in load capacity allow smaller gearboxes to be used for any particular application and thus reduce the system mass.","The evolution of the Mars rovers has highlighted the need for reducing the weight of the standard planetary gearboxes that are used throughout the system. Because of the pervasive use of these gearboxes they compose a significant portion of the overall mass of the rover. As next generation rovers are becoming larger the importance of reducing gearbox mass is becoming critical. To date, the majority of the gearboxes used on the rovers have been based on very conventional materials, process and designs. This has primarily been a result of the fast paced schedules associated with rover development. With little time for recovery, these programs are extremely risk adverse and the idea of developing new technology on the program is absolutely impractical.   This is the underlying motivation for performing this proposed research effort at this time.  As there is no rover planned for the 2007 there is a longer than normal dwell between rover programs. The hope is to capitalize on this time to advance the technology used on the common gearboxes employed on the rover. This will allow new technology to be introduced into the gearbox designs. As the current Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover design is potentially mass critical, lightweight gearboxes may be enabling technology for the mission.","This investigation will have far reaching effects on basic mechanism designs that employ planetary gearboxes. Planetary gearboxes are commonly used on deployable structures, covers and doors, hinges and instruments.

The benefits of AVHRE result from the combination  of four innovations: (1) the patented vortex injection technique which generates  a coaxial vortex pair, driving high solid-fuel regression rates and improved  combustion efficiency; (2) high-regression rate paraffin solid fuels; (3)  patented regression sensor technology, and (4) a new fuel formulation innovation  to control the solid fuel regression characteristics and provide improved  structural integrity of the grain. These innovations simplify hybrid rocket  design, development, and manufacture both inherently and by providing many  practical design degrees of freedom that can be harnessed for a given  application. Specific benefits of the AVHRE technology include: (1) increased  propellant mass fractions; (2) the ability to tailor and optimize a hybrid  propulsion system for a given application; (3) increased ISP efficiency; (4) a  reduction or elimination of residual fuel; (5) improved grain structural  integrity and increased thermal properties; and (6) reduced need for thermal  insulation. The Phase II effort will design, develop, and test a 10,000 lbf  AVHRE-I chamber and a suite of practical AVHRE engineering design tools that  will be delivered to NASA upon completion of the project.","POTENTIAL NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters,  approximately 150 words)The AVHRE addresses key design, performance, and  operational challenges of traditional hybrid rocket engine systems. If  successful, this would catapult hybrid rocket systems into a highly competitive  position for many Earth-to-orbit propulsion applications, where their inherent  safety, simplicity, and low-cost could be competitively harnessed. The AVHRE  hardware, analysis, and engineering design approaches developed during the Phase  II program will be useful tools that NASA will benefit from. AVHRE addresses the  need for high performance, low cost, reliable/safe, and flexible propulsion  technology required for Earth-to-Orbit (ETO) applications and planetary  missions. The fuel formulation technology demonstrated during the Phase I AVHRE  project can also likely be adapted for producing ISRU fuel grains to meet  Martian and Lunar propulsion needs.","POTENTIAL NON-NASA COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS (Limit 1500 characters,  approximately 150 words)AVHRE is expected to have a competitive position in  reusable and expendable launch vehicles, sounding rockets, and upper stage  propulsion systems. A new market is also emerging to provide suborbital launch  vehicles for space tourists. The AVHRE could play a vital role due to its  inherent safety and lower development cost. ORBITEC is also closely  investigating the entertainment markets, including rocket car demonstrations at  air shows, amusement rides, and model rocketry packages that would use the  cartridge loaded AVHRE propulsion system. In addition to these applications,  this new type of vortex combustion may have significant industrial benefits. For  example, many classes of air-fired combustors can use the vortex combustion  technology for improved combustion efficiency, potentially reduced emissions,  and to reduce the required pre-processing."

The triaxial swirl injector is ideally suited to a wide range of liquid oxidizers and fuels, including hydrogen and a wide range of hydrocarbons.  It holds the potential of excellent high-frequency combustion stability characteristics and low injector production cost, similar to a pintle injector.  Additionally, the triaxial swirl injector offers the potential for excellent injector and combustion chamber thermal compatibility and outstanding propellant atomization characteristics, both at levels far superior to a pintle injector.  The triaxial injector concept is well suited to both main injector and preburner applications.  The Phase I SBIR effort focused on understanding the influence design variables have on injector performance.  We developed the mechanical design concept for a prototype injector.  The proposed Phase II effort will complete the detailed design and analysis of the prototype injector.  The test hardware will be fabricated and tested with several propellants.  A preliminary design will be developed for a large-scale combustor.","Current NASA applications for the swirl triaxial injector include CEV and a range of in-space applications.  The goal is that the injector will be analytically scalable from as small as 50lbf-class to larger than 80,000 lbf-class for a variety of hydrocarbon fuels.  The combination of analytical model results and test data will validate the design methodology.  The design is amenable to a variety of liquid fuel combinations including LOX/CH4 and LOX/kerosene.  The characteristics of the triaxial swirl injector also make it very attractive as a preburner injector for both fuel-rich and ox-rich staged combustion systems.","There is a wide assortment of non-NASA customers for a demonstrated triaxial swirl injector.  The marketplace currently appears to need a 40,000-lbf-class pressure-fed injector - Rocketplane XP, Virgin Galactic and Microcosm/Scorpius Falcon.  Additionally, the USAF ARES program is interested in similar sized LOX/hydrocarbon engine systems.

Many powerful vibration signature analysis techniques for engine-health monitoring rely on key-phasor signals to extract/enhance critical fault signatures from noisy vibration measurements.  In many situations (e.g. SSME HPOTP), such speed measurements are not available, usually due to the safety concerns of a key-phasor's intrusive installation (e.g.in a high-pressure liquid-oxygen environment for HPOTP).   As a result, the ability/reliability for health monitoring and post-test diagnostic evaluation is severely limited.  The proposed NI-VMS overcomes this problem by utilizing a novel signal analysis technique called Pseudo Key Phasor (PKP) to reconstruct a PKP signal directly from external vibration measurements.  This procedure enables powerful signal analyses that require a key phasor to become applicable, greatly enhancing fault detection and diagnostic capabilities.   NI-VMS can reduce the risks of catastrophic engine failure and improve the reliability of NASA's current/future propulsion systems.  Phase I feasibility studies using SSME test data have successfully demonstrated the technical merits of NI-VMS.  Phase II will complete design, development, and testing of the prototype NI-VMS hardware/software system.","Successful development of NI-VMS can provide enhanced diagnostic evaluation capabilities for NASA's current SSME as demonstrated through several HOPTP anomaly investigation activities related to the Space Shuttle return to flight. For NASA's future propulsion systems development, when intrusive key-phasor instrumentation is not feasible, NI-VMS offers a valuable alternative to meet the health-monitoring requirement.","NI-VMS has significant applications in commercial/DoD transportation, power generation industries, and the manufacturing sector where many aircraft/plant engines/machinery are not instrumented with key phasor due to safety/cost concerns. NI-VMS's unique capability in performing non-intrusive monitoring will exert a strong appeal for these industries to use it to meet industrial and commercial health-monitoring requirements in reducing the risks of catastrophic hardware losses and plant downtime.  Benefits to U.S. industry will be realized through contributions to safer aircraft/spacecraft propulsion, more efficient power generation, reduced downtime, and reduced operation and maintenance costs."

A video camera machine vision system can supply position information of external objects, but no range information. Ideally, a system that, in one package, provides 3-dimensional relative information about external objects is needed. To this end, Nanohmics will develop a lightweight, compact, low power, low cost, modular sensor system that produces a depth map of the surroundings. By combining a color optical camera, a multi-element range finding system, and digital processing electronics, a single low cost sensor system can be designed to provide relative position and anti-collision information i.e. a 3-Dimensional Vehicle Imaging Sensor for Incident Obstacle Navigation (3D VISION MapperTM). The proposed system could, for example, be mounted on the long-neck mast near the PANCAMs and NAVCAMs on Martian robotic rovers.","Robots deployed for planetary exploration missions, such as the Mars Rovers, must be able to autonomously avoid rocks, crevices, holes and cliffs.  Technology developed during the Phase I SBIR program could be utilized to extend the mission life of robots deployed to planets where remote communication with the robot is not practical because of time delay and power limitations.  Additionally, the robot systems to be used on Mars must be able to detect and recognize shadows in order to avoid losing sunlight to power solar panels while avoiding obstacles during terrain navigation. Autonomous exploratory vehicles require depth information in order to calculate the best course to avoid obstacles. The 3D VISION MapperTM is designed to produce this information in a pre-processed manner, thereby offloading some of the heavy processing work from the main control processor.  Due to the difficulty of control of fully autonomous vehicles, semi-autonomous control systems are currently more widely used. In this way, a human operator gives general directions to the robotic vehicle: a destination, a path to travel, or waypoints. The semi-autonomous vehicle then avoids local obstacles and moves to the desired location. The 3D VISION MapperTM is ideally suited for such applications. The depth map data can be easily converter to a ""top-down"" map-like view and presented to the operator graphically.","Applications outside of NASA include the following: Consumer Electronics (Gaming, role-playing environments,PDAs) Security & Surveillance applications ( Image processing and Identification) Automotive (Airbag Deployment, Occupant sensing, Obstacle avoidance, Autonomous Navigation) Robotics & Machine Vision (Assembly robots, Pick & Place, Part Inspection, Measurement & Gauging) Hazardous Area Mapping  Robots in urban search and rescue missions could utilize the technology developed in this program.

As early as the 1960s, Werner Von Braun and others recognized the need for a nuclear rocket for sending humans to Mars.  The great distances, the intense radiation levels, and the physiological response to zero-gravity all supported the concept of using a nuclear rocket to decrease mission time.  These same needs have been recognized in later studies, especially in the Space Exploration Initiative in 1989.  One of the key questions that has arisen in later studies, however, is the need to utilize a nuclear fuel form that does not emit fission products into the exhaust stream.  Unlike the Rover/NERVA programs in the 1960s, the rocket exhaust in a current day nuclear rocket should contain no radioactivity. We will investigate a series of coated fuel forms that will inhibit fission products and actinides from diffusing out into the surrounding coolant.  A demonstration experiment will be designed that will allow fuels containing uranium-238 to be fissioned, heated to very high temperatures, and assessed for emission of any products.","This project will result in the ability of NASA to develop a nuclear thermal rocket.  Such a rocket will revolutionize space flight in the solar system.  The nuclear rocket is applicable to Moon base construction, missions to Mars, and fast missions to the outer planets.  If a nuclear fuel can be developed that does not expel radioactivity, the nuclear rocket can be used from Low Earth Orbit outward with no need for any type of shuttle vehicle to high orbit.  Development of a nuclear rocket with clean exhaust will enable the human race to expand into the solar system safely.","The commercial potential of this project is extremely high.  The ability to inhibit the diffusion of atoms at very high temperatures by coating the fuel with a series of appropriately chosen metals layers will be applicable to several markets where high temperature gases are contained by metallic structures.

Many of the components in cryogenic distribution systems at the launch site can be complex and require an insulation that can be formed to irregular shapes to minimize heat leak. Aerogel beads are configurable to virtually any shape and offer a lightweight insulation solution with substantial improvements over conventional insulations. Success in the commercialization of high performance insulating aerogel beads has relied on the effectiveness of converting loose beads into functional insulation components. This type of insulation component requires reasonable mechanical strength and should be able to withstand a certain degree of compression, tensile, and flexural loads.  Aspen Aerogels' solution entails the use of mechanically resistant aerogel beads and a binder that does not penetrate the surface of the beads.  Preliminary investigation into composite development in the Phase I effort has resulted in a net shape insulation component having excellent thermal and mechanical properties.  This type of insulation component is able to fill areas that are currently inaccessible with existing insulation products. A high-performance thermal insulation composite, such as that described in this proposal, will have a significant impact in insulation technology advancement.","Aerogel bead materials with superior mechanical resilience have numerous possibilities for use in advanced cryogenic space transportation technologies, as well as other high performance insulation needs. The material has been proposed for insulating cryogenic distribution systems for applications in space transportation and insulation of miles-long cryogen transfer lines.  NASA can also use the resilient bead composite insulation in various applications, from space launch vehicle propellant tanks, Space Shuttle upgrades, interplanetary propulsion and life support equipment.","Applications for Aspen Aerogels' bead composites are not restricted to NASA's field of interest.  Important industry applications include transfer and storage of liquefied natural gas or for transferring crude oil beneath the ocean.  The novel insulation produced could also be used for high temperature superconducting (HTS) power transmission lines that require cooling with liquid nitrogen.  Aspen's hybrid aerogel beads can offer thermal management solutions for handling or transportation of various cryogens (LOX, LH2, LN2, LHe, and LNG), supporting cryogenic equipment manufacturers and suppliers.  Provided low enough costs, the aerogel beads could become a commodity used in refrigerators and household freezers."

Here, flow induced instabilities can generate flow anomalies such as large scale pressure fluctuations that may couple with other system components and generate deleterious structural vibrations or lead to system malfunction as was evidenced in the RS-68 engine on the Delta IV system.  Identifying the source of these flow  instabilities is extremely difficult since they may arise from a variety of coupled phenomena such as hydrodynamics, valve timing and scheduling, and cavitation related events in cryogenic propellant and oxidizer feedlines.The proposed Phase II program addresses this deficiency; the product of this effort will be a reliable predictive tool that can characterize flow instabilities, identify dominant frequency modes, and  elucidate structural response in valve and feed systems.  Phase I activities demonstrated the simulation capability for instabilities in varied flow devices (e.g.  venturis, orifices)  used in the E-1 test facilities at NASA SSC. The Phase II work will extend this to include fluid-structure interaction for analysis of system vibration, structural damage and gauge valve response.  Extensive validation will result in a predictive diagnostic tool for liquid rocket propulsion systems.","Our product addresses a core need of NASA in testing and designing of feed systems and valve systems for a new class of liquid rocket engines for upcoming programs such as Project Constellation for a new Crew Exploration Vehicle, as well as the Mission to the Moon.  This tool will significantly enhance NASA's analytical capabilities in predicting instabilities in high-pressure, cryogenic test stands as well as quantify risks in the operation of propellant delivery systems.  It can also play a vital role in unsteady analyses of the external fuel tank pressurization for the space shuttle and can aid in the testing and design of engine health monitoring systems.",The commercial applications for our product are directly related to reliable designs for valves functioning in cryogenic environments.  Launch companies are also interested in our product to identify failure modes in control valves. The simulation tool can also play a vital role in identifying hazardous operating conditions and designing control systems for dynamic disturbance mitigation since flow instability and structural resonance can touch off relief valves and damage pipe hangers and supports.

This will involve developing new techniques for health monitoring and data fusion, as well as those for  identifying, characterizing, and exploiting analytic redundancy. To achieve our goal of demonstrating the features of the proposed technology, Phase II  will focus on  developing an integrated health management system  prototype for   a combined system of   Electrical Power Distribution and Control subsystem and Attitude Control Subsystem  that is present in all space vehicles, including the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). The prototype will be developed based on an open architecture, and will be tested on hardware facilities maintained by Boeing Phantom Works to ensure the proposed technologies will reach the required maturity level  for transitioning to NASA by the end of the Phase II period.  Our subcontractor Boeing is part of a team selected by NASA to develop preliminary designs for the CEV. The partnership will allow us to transition the Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) and control reconfiguration  technology developed  under this project to the CEV program aggressively during Phase III.","The proposed integrated health management and control reconfiguration technologies will be directly applicable to the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) design.  Specifically, the proposed techniques for fault detection and diagnosis, information fusion, and degradation management, as well as tools for health management design, will contribute to the integrated health management capability for the CEV significantly.   The fault tolerant control reconfiguration algorithms developed in this project is also applicable to many current and future space missions, including Triana, MAXIM, LISA, etc. The capability to continue the mission under failure, as well as the cost saving and increased reliability, will be very attractive from the mission level perspective.","The proposed technologies have wide application in fault tolerant control of both manned and unmanned aircraft. For human operated aircraft, there has been significant effort  during the past decade in developing  flight control reconfiguration methods for vehicles subject to a limited amount of control surface damages. The control reconfiguration design has been developed based on the idea of analytic redundancy control concept by leveraging off the remaining control surfaces to produce equivalent force and torque in the direction of the lost ones. However, control methodology that allows the aircraft to ""limp"" home under the underactuated control situation has not been closely addressed. The autonomous underactuated control concept developed in this project can potentially be applied to aircraft flight control systems as the backup mode that would significantly increase its safety and reliability beyond its current level. Similarly, for  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle/Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UAV/UCAV) systems, the ability to maintain/continue the mission subject to severe damage of multiple control surfaces due to enemy fires or actuators outages via autonomous underactuated control design algorithms would offer a tremendous power to military operations' success."

Currently these engineers are limited to the use of big simulators such as the Space Station Training Facility (SSTF) for the ISS, which is costly to run and requires a scheduling of the facility a long time in advance. The targeted tool would fill the gap between the very limited validation done at their desktop (mainly peer review of the procedure) and the simulator run (where the procedures are tested in the very expensive training environment). This project has a number of innovative aspects, which will make the work of procedure developers easier and more consistent. Benefits realized from using a desktop based procedure validation toolset include the increase in safety, reduction of training costs, and improvement in procedure delivery time through early detection and resolution of errors.","Use of procedures is pervasive to all NASA organizations, and programs, whether they support on-orbit or ground-based operations, for crew use or as automated procedures, for payloads, sub-systems or for entire spacecrafts. In the coming years, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and the CEV will continue to depend heavily on complex procedures. Providing these programs with an advanced procedure V&V toolset on the desktop will provide a significant support for shortening the procedure development life cycle. A desktop validation tool has the potential to significantly reduce the number of SSTF runs and the number of procedure defects found during SSTF sessions.","The envisioned toolset can be applied to any complex system requiring an operational procedure as it also needs ways to be validated. Desktop based tool support for such system is currently missing. A tool that can be customized to different systems will be useful within DoD organizations using heavy equipment operating procedures, such as airplanes, tanks, transport equipment, or logistics support equipment. In the commercial arena, operational procedures are also being used in a broad range of areas, such as airplane checklist, power plant, refineries, and chemical plants operations.

Previous efforts in developing a collaborative or a multidisciplinary optimization process never considered how uncertainty in the atmospheric conditions, in the entry parameters of the vehicle, in the condition of the vehicle during entry, and in the performance of the TPS will influence the design and provide a risk assessment for a mission.  The work completed during the Phase I effort demonstrated that it is feasible to develop a tool for multidisciplinary optimization under uncertainty (MDO-U) for entry vehicle design, and the new information which is gained is insightful and meaningful.  The functionality and the value of the new MDO-U design tool were demonstrated through a case study where MDO-U was performed for the HL-20 vehicle under a LEO consideration.  During Phase II a general purpose and user friendly MDO-U product which can be used in entry vehicle design, and in many other engineering areas will be developed.","Uncertainties due to manufacturing tolerances, material variability, the operating environment, and the state of the operating structure, are encountered in aircraft structures, launch vehicles, entry vehicles, and propulsion systems.  The ability to account for such uncertainties in all these different areas and for the cross-coupling between disciplines, during the design stage will be valuable.  Therefore, the MDO-U system will be useful to all NASA groups interested in designing space vehicles or aircraft.  The case studies performed for the HL20 vehicle during Phase I and II, will demonstrate the value of the new development and will help promote its use within NASA.","Uncertainties due to manufacturing tolerances, material variability, the operating environment, and the state of the operating product, are encountered in the automotive, the shipbuilding, the heavy construction equipment, the defense industries (missile development, ground combat vehicle design), and bioengineering.

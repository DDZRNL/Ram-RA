Parametric ROM techniques developed by the proposing teams present a considerable opportunity to extract dominant aerodynamic and structural dynamics in a compact form that can be used to evaluate and optimize controllers for suppression of flutter and gust loads. This Phase I effort is focused on facilitating ROM technology adoption by ASE control engineers in NASA by providing (1) ROM techniques cast within a genetic algorithm and superposable platform for automated development of configurable, state-consistent ROMs and (2) the ability to apply the configurable ROMs for design and evaluation of aerostructural controllers. These components will be integrated within a modular software framework to streamline the entire workflow and efficiently transition from the model reduction to control synthesis. In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed technology will be demonstrated for ASE problems of NASA interest (e.g., suppression of gust response and flutter). The Phase II efforts will focus on: (1) optimization of the ROM and control synthesis modules in terms of execution efficiency, robustness, and autonomy; (2) further process automation and exact input/output formatting for direct integration of the framework into NASA’s controller development workflow; and (3) extensive software validation and demonstration for ASE and flight control design of realistic aircraft of current interest to NASA","This research will deliver NASA a valuable tool to automate ASE ROM and control synthesis; design advanced aerostructural controllers; and perform real-time ASE simulation; and will markedly improve the process for considering aeroelasticity in controller development through rapid predictions of gust loads, ride quality, and stability and control issues. It will significantly decrease simulation validation and workflow lag time, reduce development costs and time. NASA projects like MUTT, MADCAT, and QueSST will benefit from the technology","The non-NASA applications are vast, and will focus on aerospace, aircraft, and watercraft engineering for fluid-structural interaction and fatigue analysis, control and optimization, hardware-in-the-loop simulation, and others. The proposed development will provide a powerful tool which can be used for fault diagnostics, optimized design, simulation and experiment design and planning, and more."

With their incorporation of lightweight flexible structures, such configurations may require active/adaptive control systems for load redistribution, flutter suppression and gust load alleviation to ensure reliability and safety. Unfortunately, contemporary analysis methods are unsuitable for aeroselastic and aeroservoelastic analysis of such configurations. Design tools are dependent on low-fidelity approaches that are inadequate for reliably analyzing advanced configurations, whereas CFD coupled to finite element structural models require significant user input to define and support advanced configurations, not to mention extensive computational resources. A new efficient approach that automates the geometry setup, mesh generation, and assembly of fluid-structural coupling interfaces is needed for aeroselastic/aeroservoelastic analysis of conventional and new concepts. To address this critical need, Continuum Dynamics, Inc. proposes the development of a mid-fidelity CFD-based aeroservoelastic analysis to support vehicle design, active/adaptive control effector design and integration, as well as control system development and flight and wind-tunnel testing. Building on CDI’s legacy in the relevant disciplines, the project emphasizes technology development to streamline workflows and eliminate user involvement associated with mesh generation and fluid-structural model interfacing to efficiently and accurately undertake full flight envelope vehicle evaluation and optimize when and where to utilize high-fidelity models.","The proposed effort directly supports several NASA projects: the Advanced Air Vehicle Program’s Advanced Air Transport Technologies (AATT) project developing the next generation of subsonic and supersonic civil aircraft; the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program’s Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS) and Transformational Tools and Technologies (TTT) Projects, the integrated Aviation Systems Program’s (IASP’s) Flight Demonstrations and Capabilities (FDC), as well as the X-56, X-57 and X-59 aircraft.","The proposed effort will produce an aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic analysis to design and evaluate advanced air-vehicle concepts that use structural flexure, novel control effectors and propulsion arrangements for performance enhancement and control.

A key technology for this vehicle is an innovative landing gear concept, the pivot piston, that facilitates takeoff and landings without the need for high lift devices and enables entry into the single aisle transport market. In NASA SBIR Topic A1.01 a critical gap has been identified wherein “the use of lightweight flexible structures, the development of new airframes (truss-braced wings, blended-wing bodies, etc.), and the intentional exploitation of aeroelastic response phenomena require a comprehensive understanding of the aeroelasticity involved if they are to succeed.” This is certainly a recognized truth for the Ascent 2600 BWB, which will require innovative aeroelastic suppression methods to ensure desired ride qualities and safe operations for passengers that are no longer distributed along a relatively narrow tube. To this end a group of JetZero collaborators led by Systems Technology, Inc. (STI) propose the Active Control for Environmental disturbances and Structural interactions (ACES) system that will introduce novel active control techniques and will a feature a unique blend of the available wing, kink, and body control surfaces to mitigate undesirable aeroelastic interactions. Feasibility of ACES in Phase I will be demonstrated for the challenging gust load alleviation problem using the Ascent 2600 configuration, while in Phase II a broader range of aeroelastic problems including flutter suppression will be addressed with the effectiveness of ACES ultimately demonstrated in flight using the 13.5% dynamically scaled Pathfinder vehicle.",This proposal directly addresses NASA ARMD Strategic Thrust 3 – Ultra Efficient Subsonic Transport. The Ascent 2600 zero emission BWB meets the 2025-2035 stated goal that “Aircraft meet economic demands of airlines and the public with revolutionary improvements in community noise and energy efficiency to achieve fleet-level carbon neutral growth relative to 2005.” The ACES system will utilize active control technology to mitigate the aeroelastic challenges associated with the BWB design including gust load alleviation and flutter suppression.,"The target commercial market for the ACES system is the single aisle commercial transport market for which JetZero’s Ascent 2600 provides a natural market entry point. The single-aisle segment flies about 50% of all passenger-miles and consumes more than 50% of aviation fuel. The introduction of a new, highly efficient transport in this category provides the greatest environmental benefit."

The proposed platform is capable of emulating the acoustic environment within an aircraft propulsion platform by generating a target noise signature using acoustic actuators.  Revolutionary noise control treatments can then be introduced into the generated acoustic environment to rapidly characterize and tune their behavior.  The platform is capable of emulating many aircraft propulsion platforms at different engine operating conditions as well as generating diagnostic noise signatures which can aid in the characterization and calibration of aircraft noise treatments.  The proposed emulator is flexible in that it allows characterization of a treatment over a wide variety of propulsion platforms and operating conditions. It is also inexpensive to build and maintain as compared to the infrastructure required to utilize a full propulsion platform test bench.,This emulator is relevant to the Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) project by allowing the characterization and testing of propulsion noise reduction technologies.

Since fan broadband noise results from the interaction of turbulence with solid surfaces, it is important to resolve turbulent eddies up to a certain scale in order to achieve an accurate fan broadband noise prediction. Unfortunately the computational cost of the wall-resolved LES approach is found to scale with the Reynolds number as Re2.72, similar to Re2.91 of the direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach. To obtain a faster tool for fan broadband noise prediction, this SBIR effort will pursue the WMLES approach, in which the inner portion of the boundary layer will be modeled rather than resolved. The approach can reduce the computational cost to Re1.14. As a feasibility study, the Phase I outcome will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed WMLES approach for accurate simulation of NASA 22-in fan noise source diagnostic test (SDT) case.

These designs leverage a more compact engine-airframe integration to reduce drag and distributed turbofans with smaller diameters to control noise. These tightly coupled systems have posed a greater challenge to numerical prediction tools, especially for problems such as aeroacoustics that requires high-fidelity simulations. While high fidelity simulations (e.g., wall modeled/wall resolved large eddy simulations) have demonstrated predictive capabilities for separated boundary layers, transitions, and turbulent wakes, they are often infeasible in design contexts due to their high computational costs, and only limited to component level analysis. This SBIR project will incorporate recent technical advances Cascade has made in low dissipation, compressible flow discretizations and wall modeling for large eddy simulations, as well as an innovative approach for treating stationary-moving interface which is conservative, numerically stable, and computationally efficient. The proposed framework is implemented to exploit cost-effective throughput afforded by modern accelerated architectures (e.g., GPUs). This will finally result in an approach for these turbomachinery flow and aeroacoustic calculations that are both accurate and feasible (with less than 1 day wall clock turnaround times). This affordable approach will eventually provide a high-fidelity computational solution for system level designs.","The GPU-accelerated LES framework will benefit NASA's turbomachinery research by providing an efficient and high-fidelity simulation approach for turbomachinery flows and associated noise problems.

The key technology that allows for the success of the project is the use of an acoustic analogy based on surface and volume integrals coupled to a dual-mesh, dual-solver paradigm, where an unstructured mesh near-body solver is coupled to a Cartesian, adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) off-body solver using an overset domain connectivity algorithm. The use of unstructured overset meshes affords the necessary flexibility for handling complex moving geometries while at the same time enabling efficient capturing of blade, hub, and other high-Reynolds number wall boundary layers. The use of a high-order accurate method combined with adaptive mesh refinement in off-body regions enables the accurate resolution and convection of vortices and wakes over long distances. Far-field acoustic signatures are obtained using an acoustic-analogy approach based on the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) equation.  Together with the commonly used permeable-surface integration of the FW-H equation, the feasibility of the direct volume integration of the quadrupole term will be demonstrated for moving overset meshes. The quadrupole integration enables accurate characterization of the dominant sources of broadband noise in CROR propulsion systems, such as rotor-wake/rotor interaction and rotor trailing-edge noise. Furthermore, the direct integration of the quadrupole term in the FW-H equation obviates the need to identify a proper permeable integration surface common of other approaches. Hence, our approach results in a noise-propagation methodology that is naturally suited for the prediction of sound generated by the complex moving geometries that are the ultimate interest of this project.","The proposed techniques will provide a novel cost-effective high-fidelity tool for open rotor noise prediction capable of handling complex geometries. This is an important application area for the NASA Aeronautics Mission Directorate, both for fixed wing applications with CROR propulsion and for extensions to rotary wing aircraft. Our surface and volume integration FW-H code will be written in a modular fashion which will be delivered to NASA for inspection and coupling with internal NASA codes.","The immediate customers for CROR noise prediction will be the aerospace propulsion OEMs. However, we anticipate significant opportunities in the rotorcraft industry as well as for propeller and fan driven aircraft. Particularly, in the emerging eVtol industry, noise is a principal driver towards community acceptance, offering a significant additional commercial market opportunity to be exploited."

These measurement advances will be coupled with development of advanced processing techniques to take full advantage of the enhanced measurement capabilities, including handling of the three-dimensional (3D) problem related to non-uniform inlet geometries. One focus of this project is to combine proven design principles and established device structures to develop, package, and install high channel-count, high-density arrays of MEMS piezoelectric microphones into model-scale engine inlets. Back-side contact piezoelectric MEMS microphones combined with advanced packaging methods will enable ultra-smooth sensor installation to avoid flow disturbances that would perturb the conditions inside the inlet and/or reduce the effectiveness of the measurement due to extraneous flow noise generated by the sensor. A second focus of this project is to develop innovative processing algorithms to take advantage of the newly-enabled, high-fidelity data-acquisition capabilities. The increased sensor density and lower-cost sensors will enable measurements with higher modal density and dynamic range than previous measurement campaigns have been able to achieve.

This project relates to development of cryogenic (rotor and stator) generators required for future thin/short haul aviation or commercial transport vehicles which use turboelectric, hybrid electric, or all electric power generation as part of the propulsion system. Turboelectric, hybrid electric and all electric power generation as well as distributed propulsive power have been identified as candidate transformative aircraft configurations with reduced fuel consumption/energy use and emissions. However, components and management methods for power generation, distribution and conversion are not currently available in the high-power ranges with the necessary efficiency, power density, electrical stability and safety required for thin haul/short haul, or transport-class aircraft. Specifically, motors/generators are desired with >98% efficiency, specific power >13 kW/kg, and total power >200 kW. For generators, high power density can be achieved if the rotational speed is high (15,000-30,000 rpm), however low AC loss conductors are required in the stator. This can be achieved by designing the stator with a high purity aluminum “hyperconductor” at cryogenic temperatures with a cryogenically cooled superconducting rotor. During the Phase I we will be investigating the use of cryogenic aluminum “hyperconductor” as a low AC loss conductor for stator coils. With the development of low AC loss aluminum “hyperconductor” wire by Hyper Tech, we can achieve high speed cryogenically cooled generators with power densities over 30 kW/kg for aircraft.  During the Phase I we intend to demonstrate approaches for manufacturing aluminum “hyperconductor” strands and cables suitable for high speed machines (500-600 Hz, 15,000-25,000 rpm), and analyze the AC losses of the conductors in applied magnetic fields for developing generator conceptual designs with high speed rotors.","Besides electric passenger aircraft, NASA can benefit from many applications where lightweight power components are required such as smaller land-based generators, invertor type transformers, inductors and higher frequency power conditioning equipment.","Hyperconductor aluminum is a solution for manufacturers of invertor transformers, high speed motors and high speed generators (10,000 - 30,000 rpm) requiring high power density who seek lighter weight and higher efficiency 4-20 MW class aircraft turbo-generators, offshore oil platform motors, marine propulsion and generation and portable emergency power systems."

Modeling and quantification of icing effects on aircraft performance therefore plays a critical role in aircraft design and certification. High-fidelity CFD analyses of aircraft with imposed ice shapes are impeded by time-consuming manual pre-processing and mesh generation that are difficult to automate. Given the desire to adapt the mesh to optimize a given output functional (e.g. aircraft CLmax), these challenges are particularly important as the mesh quality in the vicinity of complex ice shapes directly impacts the accuracy of CFD solution error estimates. The objective of this project is to develop, demonstrate, and deliver a high-resolution automated unstructured mesh refinement framework for aircraft icing predictions. The capability will interface with existing NASA CFD solvers and provide access to high-resolution icing data in a manner consistent with established procedures for accessing CAD geometry, while locally disambiguating between CAD and ice shape. Grid quality improvements will be made near the complex ice geometry to improve error estimates. In Phase I, the capability will be developed in FUN3D using metric-based anisotropic mesh refinement to achieve optimal CLmax prediction for an iced aircraft configuration. Mesh refinement at the ice surface will be augmented to leverage the new API to query the true ice shape to improve the resolution of the surface discretization. Accuracy and efficiency of the developed capability will be demonstrated for a canonical wing geometry as proof of concept. Phase II efforts will further develop and mature the capability, and demonstrate on more complex topologies including high lift geometries and perform uncertainty quantification to understand and improve solution sensitivity and accuracy.","This technology has applicability not only for fixed wing aircraft icing predictions, but also for rotor blade icing predictions for rotorcraft and eVTOL configurations. Direct applications reside in several of NASA’s programs such as the prediction of performance degradation for fans, ducts, propellers, and airframes, due to the presence of ice accretion. Impacted NASA programs and projects include Advanced Air Transport Technology, Commercial Supersonic Technology, Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology, and others.","NOAA deploys aircraft during inclement weather. Commercial transports and business jets fly at conditions where in-flight ice accretions occur frequently. Aircraft fly to service oil rigs in the North Sea, Alaskan coast, etc. Commercial and military UAVs are more susceptible to icing due to their size, flight regime, and speeds. These examples show enormous market for improved icing predictions."

HeldenMesh is an existing commercial CFD mesh generator already in widespread use in industry and NASA for generating meshes for Navier-Stokes CFD flow solvers like FUN3D and USM3D.  It was originally developed under Helden internal research and recently enhanced under several NASA and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) funded SBIR efforts.  Our proposed effort builds upon these past efforts by incorporating two enhancements to enable more accurate and robust WMLES simulations.  First, HeldenMesh is modified to generate a quad-dominated surface mesh and a hex-dominated near-wall layer mesh for a more efficient and accurate cell type which is more suited to WMLES analysis.  Second, HeldenMesh is modified to generate wedge elements in the viscous layers at sharp trailing edges to improve the overall grid quality and grid normal alignment.  Any further development required to improve HeldenMesh’s WMLES mesh generation capability is identified under Phase I and plans made for completion under a follow-on Phase II.  With these enhancements in place, we then demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of HeldenMesh for WMLES applications using the FUN3D flow solver on two test cases coordinated with NASA.  As part of these demonstrations, WMLES meshing best practices are developed in terms of grid quality, impact of anisotropic stretching near and far from the wall vs. isotropic meshing, number of viscous layers, layer growth rate/profiles, as well as spanwise/chordwise spacing requirements in the critical near-wall regions.  A grid convergence study is also performed with impact of cell count in critical regions vs. accuracy.  Our effort culminates with delivery of an enhanced HeldenMesh executable with a direct FUN3D interface for independent testing.",The successful completion of this Phase I effort supports all NASA programs and projects that use CFD.  HeldenMesh is already used extensively by NASA for generation of unstructured meshes and is already a key component of their CFD process.  The technology developed under this project will enable design decisions by Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) and Human Exploration Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD).,Helden Aerospace has already successfully transitioned its existing HeldenMesh commercial grid generator to industry.  Grid quality improvements made under Phase I benefits users running WMLES and also the majority of users performing RANS simulations.

The key issues in the Phase I/Phase II program are the redesigning - scale down of the present highly successful Ohio State University megawatt class induction motor to, (1) optimize overall design (poles, topology, size, etc.) from 1 MW class to a 200 kW class UAM eVTOL motor as well as, (2) to operate with single fluid bearings and (3) synergistically integrate the lubrication with cooling in order to operate a single fluid and to achieve maximum power density and reliability. During this program, two full-size motors (shaft equivalent performances) with different coolants and cooling lubrication methods will be fabricated in order to allow a complete shaft-to-shaft testing program and an apple-to-apple comparative analyze of the two cooling/lubrication solutions. The first motor will use deionized water for both cooling and lubrication while the second motor will use a proprietary single fluid & semi-evaporative cooling and lubrication method. At the end of Phase I, the electromagnetic circuits and the cooling/semi-evaporative cooling will be fully modeled and simulated, while all fundamental bearings aspects (tribological, dimensional, life estimation etc) will be addressed.

Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) air vehicles present a challenging environment for measurement and instrumentation systems due to the presence of strong Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) created by the powerful high voltage motors. Fiber optic sensors are an ideal solution to this problem given their light weight, ability to make distributed multi-parameter measurements with a single optical fiber and their native immunity to EMI. However, the associated optical interrogation electronics are not fully immune to EMI and may not operate properly in the presence of these high electric and magnetic fields. This problem demonstrates a need for ruggedized, EMI hardened optical interrogators to support critical testing needs for ground and flight based EAP applications. Luna Innovations has partnered with magniX, a leading manufacturer of electric propulsion units (EPUs) for electric-powered aircraft to address this problem by developing and testing an EMI hardened version of its proven Hyperion® platform of fiber optic sensor interrogators. The Hyperion is a versatile optical sensing platform, compatible with a variety of sensor types, including fiber-Bragg-grating based temperature and strain sensors that can simultaneously monitor as many as 1,024 sensors at up to 5kHz. The existing commercial product has an optical bandwidth greater than 80 nm and a spectral resolution of 1 pm. The proposed innovation will validate the performance of the modified unit under high levels of EMI exposure through laboratory testing and will demonstrate performance in a relevant operational environment by testing around existing electric propulsion units.",The proposed research will directly address NASA’s need for an optical interrogator that is immune to EMI. This system will find potential applications in electric powered aircraft such as the X-57 Maxwell and other vehicles being developed under the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RLVT) and Electrified Aircraft Propulsion Technologies (EAPT) projects. It may also be useful for ground testing at the NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT) or for other applications under the Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) umbrella.,"The proposed EMI-hardened Hyperion will find a ready market for instrumentation in emerging commercial electric aircraft designs. Besides aviation, large scale electric propulsion platforms in the transportation sector would be a likely market, such as locomotives, electric semi-trucks, and electric boats. With some cost reduction the system could also be applied to the electric automobile market."

Physical probes can be inserted into the flow, but point data is insufficient and the probe will invariably alter the flow field, potentially affecting the quantities of interest by changing the flow pattern, quenching key reactions, or acting as a catalyst. Optical diagnostics are non-intrusive, but existing techniques cannot provide robust velocity data in a high enthalpy flow, let alone surrogate parameters like temperature, species, and pressure. Therefore, there is a need for diagnostics that can measure these thermo-fluid properties over the wide field-of-view typical of large-scale supersonic and hypersonic applications. ISSI proposes to address this need using Linear Absorption Tomography with Velocimetry (LATV). LATV is based on laser absorption spectroscopy, a molecular diagnostic that is directly sensitive to the absorbance of a target fluid along the measurement path. The diagnostic utilizes a network of laser beams and tomographic reconstruction algorithm to produce 2D measurements of velocity, temperature, species, and pressure in a tilted plane. This diagnostic has been demonstrated for internal supersonic reacting flows as well as jet plumes. Our implementation is unique in that it utilizes Bayesian physics-informed neural networks to conduct data assimilation with built in uncertainty quantification. Use of the LATV technique at hypersonic flight conditions requires application-specific considerations, which will be explored in the Phase I effort. Quantifying spatio-temporally resolved exit conditions in NASA’s 8 ft. hypersonic tunnel using this technique is a long-term goal of the Phase II program. Accuracy and precision will be assessed by comparing LATV measurements to conventional probe data in a controlled setting.","The LATV diagnostic can be used to probe internal and external flows of both reacting and non-reacting fluids. As such, the diagnostic has a wide range of potential ground and flight test applications. One application of LATV is real time characterization of NASA’s extreme condition wind tunnels. The ability to quantify and time resolve flow field parameters such as velocity, temperature, species, and pressure in real time could drastically improve online interpretation of results and decision-making during test campaigns.","The final product from this program will be a system capable of producing 2D tomographic reconstructions of velocity, temperature, species, and pressure for high-speed wind tunnels. This technological capability is of interest to ISSI’s current commercial, research, and military wind tunnel customers. ISSI expects to aggressively market this capability to these customers."

Existing FOSS technology uses external cavity tunable lasers, which are assembled from discrete components with precision intracavity laser alignments. This creates cost and complexity, inhibits volume scaling, and inhibits ruggedization.  These factors have in turn inhibited widespread commercial adoption of FOSS in avionics applications and precluded embedding this technology into commercial flight vehicles for continuous in-flight structural health monitoring.  Praevium will endeavor to solve these problems by building on its prior work done in developing micro-electromechanical systems tunable vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (MEMS-VCSELs) for swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT). Although FOSS employs optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR), which is similar to SSOCT, the much longer interferometer delays and much lower wavelength sweep rates employed in FOSS require the effects of Brownian motion on the MEMS actuator to be mitigated. In this work, Praevium Research will minimize the effects of Brownian motion through re-design of the MEMS actuator structure. Additionally, Praevium will develop a low weight and power ruggedized butterfly package based on newly emerging electrically pumped MEMS-VCSELs, eliminating costly and bulky components such as the pump laser, isolator, and wavelength division multiplexer needed in commercial optically pumped devices. Praevium will work with subcontractor Sensuron, who has expertise in FOSS to evaluate the newly developed laser. Sensuron will evaluate the Praevium MEMS-VCSEL in various interferometer configurations, and develop high speed data acquisition and computation to integrate the new laser into a fiber bragg grating based sensor measurement. Results will be compared with existing laser sources.","This work will develop a new cost-effective ruggedized laser technology that will accelerate proliferation of optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) fiber optic sensing of physical parameters such as shape, deflection, temperature, and strain.

Novel hardware and software architectures are needed to provide a cost-effective and unified way for testing new advanced technologies for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). To facilitate V&V activities at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) and beyond, American GNC Corporation (AGNC) and Penn State University’s Applied Research Laboratory (PSU-ARL) are proposing the Flexible Aerial Systems Testing with the Reconfigurable and Expandable Payload (FAST-REP) System. This system will provide NASA with a flexible scheme to conduct two types of testing: (1) recording sensor data in flight and then performing V&V afterwards in an offline way using the acquired data and (2) running candidate software in real-time and capturing the outputs and decisions to see if they match expectations of the developers and customers. The latter test allows to incorporate effects of sensor sampling rates, latencies, resolutions, program execution times, etc. in documenting the performance of the algorithm under test. To enable this, FAST-REP will consist of: (i) an expandable and reconfigurable structure mounted to a flight vehicle; (ii) power delivery module with optional battery; (iii) single board computer or microprocessor running application code with flash memory for data storage; (iv) supporting electronic circuits for multi-sensor data acquisition and interfacing ports; and (v) suite with different types of sensors (motion, vision, ranging, thermal, magnetic, etc.). The system is reconfigurable to different UAS types and sensors, both in terms of the embedded system as well as the mechanical structure.","NASA is leading the nation in research for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) to enable a safe and efficient air transportation architecture capable of operating above populated areas. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) supports this objective by engaging in identification, development, and testing of technologies and procedures for enabling UAS’ to operate in an airspace occupied by human-piloted aircraft. FAST-REP will ensure progress toward that vision by providing a reconfigurable and scalar payload architecture for testing legacy and new UAVs.","It is widely expected that the UAV industry will continue to grow, placing the FAST-REP in a desirable position for widespread use. Applications include inspection, agriculture, remote sensing, surveying, delivery, photography, etc. with many of these such as package delivery involving operation in urban locations that require a high level of safety assurance and rigorous V&V of new technologies."

Utilizing a 3D simulation, the TE will test complex sensor fusion and ML decision-making routines. This system allows for testing of non-deterministic, “black-box” models by evaluating their performance in a realistic setting integrated with flight software and hardware. By carrying out failure modes in the TE, the certification tests can expand to include cascading failures in emergency scenarios, simulating rapid changes in operating conditions such as incoming storms, sensor failures such as obscured camera views, and hardware failures such as a bad Inertial Measurement Unit sensor (IMU). The high-level architecture of our solution contains a test management system. This system provides a way to design test suites, evaluate test results, and decide on further tests to pin down the complex, subtle failures that can occur in multi-sensor AI systems. The flight simulators that currently allow failure injection do not contain this useful post-test analysis. This test management system will also run parallel tests faster than real time, greatly surpassing the speed of current single-instance user-run tests. The purpose of the proposed Phase I work is to advance state-of-the-art to create a TE capable of certifying that complex nondeterministic algorithms used in autonomous UAS flight are safe for integration into the wider NAS environment; and (in Phase II) to subsequently develop tools to validate algorithms for prognostics, vehicle health, sensor fusion, decision-making, and cooperative planning using the Phase I TE. Phase I work will result in a technology demonstration and final report detailing the TE proof-of-concept.","The solution supports NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility Mission by enabling a consistent, rigorous certification process that will increase UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS). Relevant NASA applications include the Airspace Operations & Safety Program, Integrated Aviation System Program, Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program, Scalable Traffic Management for Emergency Response Operations, and Transformational Tools and Technologies.","Improved certification will advance use of UAS across a variety of markets including healthcare, search and rescue, delivery, and agriculture.

For this NASA Phase I SBIR project, Circle Optics proposes to develop new optical and mechanical designs for the purpose of satisfying NASA interests in improving air traffic safety. Under Focus Area 19, Integrated Flight Systems, Topic A2.02, Enabling Aircraft Autonomy, NASA and the FAA are seeking technologies to enable intelligent vehicle systems, including new software and hardware sensing and perception technologies. With the goal of enabling piloted vehicles augmented with autonomous capabilities to increase air safety, as well as autonomous unmanned air vehicles, NASA needs a next generation optical imaging and sensing system to address the gaps in situational awareness. In response, Circle Optics proposes to develop an EO/IR visor type sensing system that provides improved detect and avoid sensing in accord with the FAA DO-365B Detect and Avoid MOPS and thus help support NASA’s goals for intelligent vehicle systems. Towards meeting these goals, Circle Optics would engage with both eVTOL and UAV companies, and companies developing detect and avoid hardware and software, to better understand the operational environment and the SWaP-C limitations that may impact such systems. Circle Optics mechanical design efforts will then include lens and system mounting, mechanical and thermal stability, electronic support, and the anticipated assembly fixtures and tools. Circle Optics would also advance the optical design, while focusing on SWaP-C requirements, manufacturability, and mechanical compatibility, to develop a nearly fabrication ready design.  As a result, Circle Optics imaging devices can move NASA closer to having the optical sensing capabilities to enable situational awareness and safety for future air vehicles, their drivers or passengers, and their airspace environments.","NASA is collaborating with the FAA to anticipate the future world of urban air mobility by developing standards, and encouraging technical innovation, so eVTOLs and UAVs will be able to travel safely within the national airspace.  Once developed, Circle Optics EO/IR sensors may be useful to NASA on vehicles that are used for space, lunar, or extra-planetary navigation and collision avoidance.  Similar Circle Optics camera systems may also be useful to NASA in capturing panoramic scenes or photogrammetry during space exploration missions.","The Circle Optics visor system for detect and avoidance EO/IR sensing can be optimized for use on DOD / USAF aircraft to image the airspace to provide situational awareness and search and track functions of potential hostile aircraft.  Small commercial drones or UAVs will likely need similar optical detection, avoidance, and navigation imaging, but with a smaller SWaP-C than needed for eVTOLs."

These tasks are generally long duration, repetitive, highly precise, or require high speed response. All of these tasks are well suited to computer automation but current autonomous systems struggle to perform without human oversight and intervention, especially in off-nominal conditions. Avilution proposes to solve this problem by providing resilient sensor fusion using its eXtensible Flight System (XFS) modular avionics software framework and high level decision capability through the X-Avionics’ Xavion application. XFS is a commercially available product that enables the rapid integration of disparate sensors and components into an integrated system. Avilution will expand upon this foundational capability by providing synthetic airspeed to data consumers that is derived using disparate sensors. Additionally, Xavion has an emergency glide path functionality that currently provides a pilot with an optimal route to a safe landing in the event of an engine failure. In this proposed effort, Avilution will combine the data aggregation and sensor fusion capabilities of XFS with the emergency glide path routing of Xavion into a robust system for autonomous aircraft. The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to increase both the reliability of autonomous aircraft systems and their high level decision capabilities. This technology will allow autonomous vehicles to better respond to abnormal conditions and increase overall system survivability. Avilution intends to market this technology for use on both manned and unmanned aircraft with applications for both commercial and DoD customers.","NASA has an increasing fleet of autonomous vehicles including the Global Hawk, Predator and Tiger Shark. These types of vehicles all have the potential to benefit from the improved fault tolerance and survivability of sensor fusion and the autonomous landing capabilities of Xavion to help preserve the vehicles, life, and property in the event of an engine failure.","This technology, delivered as software on Avilution’s XFS platform, can assist across the spectrum of automation of aircraft including both piloted vehicles and fully autonomous aircraft. The sensor fusion can improve data both for pilot displays and autonomous systems, while the landing assistance can provide guidance during emergency situations."

TruWeather Solutions has a NASA Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research project to develop a Wind Hazard Impact Location Service (WHILS) in Hampton, VA that we will integrate into our In-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance (ISSA) platform.  TruWeather seeks to expand beyond “wind” to “weather.” This project seeks to expand the service into the  Weather Hazard Information Location Service (WHILS2.)  Weather hazards impactful to AAM include wind, turbulence, ceiling, and visibility. The TruFlite suite of services currently includes global, regional and local scale weather products. The goal of WHILS2 is to predict when and where it is safe to conduct a UAS urban mission, where urban corridors can be planned. This project will focus on hazardous weather detection in low-altitude, urban environments enabled by the accelerated deployment of a robust weather multi-sensor platform scalable to urban area in the world. We will develop algorithms to retrieve different weather parameters from a set of sensors. We will validate the retrieved data against other weather data sets, including modelled data.

Western Avenue, CA90501 - 1727",(310) 320-1827,1,3,"NASA is seeking to supplement low-altitude meteorologic information to enable Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) service. AAM is a concept for safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible aviation (e.g., passenger transport, aerial work, and cargo transport) both locally and intraregionally. The use of data from sensors that are not currently aviation-approved to identify local conditions along the route of transit, rather than making broad assumptions from sparsely distributed sensors, would allow for more effective use of the airspace, enhance safety, and improve operational efficiency by providing improved real-time wind, cloud ceiling, and visibility data. To address this need, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop the new Extraction of Supplemental Meteorological Data (EXTRA) system to provide fine-granularity weather data based on (1) direct measurement from low-cost, widely distributed meteorological sensors, (2) artificial intelligence (AI) data extracted from nonmeteorological sensors, (3) central data collection, (4) extrapolation of overhead conditions from ground conditions, and (5) go/no-go determination based on safety criteria. The system will result in very fine-scale data to fill the gaps in legacy weather-sensing equipment in order to enable the emerging transformation of the skies that AAM will bring about. EXTRA operates on the principle of multi-sensory integration by which data sets from a range of disparate sources (such as direct readings from weather sensors or AI analysis of traffic camera imagery) are collected in order to synthesize a detailed map (down to a resolution on the order of 100 ft) and to subsequently extrapolate from that weather map to the wind field above the location of the sensors (i.e., winds aloft) and ultimately make go/no-go recommendations. This technology directly supports the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) AAM mission.","The EXTRA system has direct applicability to NASA research, specifically to the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) mission to accelerate applications of passenger transport, aerial work, and cargo transport. Among the three pillars of the AAM ecosystem (vehicle, airspace, and community), weather is a critical aspect of the airspace component and the EXTRA technology addresses this critical need with a minimal-footprint, low-cost solution.","Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will revolutionize transportation and delivery with an enormous impact expected on the commercial aerospace industry. Safe operation of all aircraft including new electric and hybrid aircraft (e.g., Joby Aviation, Wisk Aero ) requires monitoring of the weather, and the EXTRA system will be an essential element of the overall AAM system."

These models will also provide metrics for policy makers to assess long term impact of the policies for reducing the environmental impact of aviation.  Modeling of two major sources of environmental impact of aviation: (1) persistent contrails and (2) emissions have been proposed. A machine-learning approach is proposed for forecasting regions of persistent contrails formation using features derived from atmospheric data and satellite images. Compared to earlier models that are point-based, our proposal is a region-based prediction methodology with reduced uncertainty in the prediction of regions of persistent contrails formation using clustering techniques. For improving the emissions estimates, we propose a computational procedure for estimating the takeoff weight considering in part information provided in the flight plan. Simulation of trajectories with the estimated takeoff weight along with regions of persistent contrail formation predicted by the machine-learning model provide environmental impact in terms of expected emissions and contrail formation.","The proposed machine-learning model for forecasting regions of persistent contrails formation, and the takeoff weight estimation method for improving emissions estimates integrated into NASA’s air traffic management (ATM) simulators such as the Future ATM Concepts Evaluation System and the ATM-Testbed will enable environmental impact assessment of technologies and concepts for improving safety, efficiency, capacity, and throughput, and of implementation of NASA technologies in the current and future NAS.","The machine-learning model, along with trajectory simulation integrated into a web-enabled cloud-based tool will enable the FAA and the aircraft operators to determine environmental impact in decision-making. These models can provide information to policy makers about relative merits of environmental horizons (10 yrs vs 20 yrs) and efforts to reduce the impact of emissions and contrails."

Increasing autonomy while maintaining or improving efficiency and safety will require effective teaming between humans and automation in routine and contingency operations. Concepts for highly automated future air transportation, like UAM and UTM, describe procedures for addressing contingencies, implicitly assuming automated services will be able to coordinate well enough to address contingencies, with little or no human input, if procedures are pre-defined. However, if traditional air traffic operations are to be a guide, humans will need to be involved in coordinated contingency planning for UAM/UTM operations. To address the need for coordinated contingency planning in UAM/UTM, we propose a Contingency Planning Toolkit for Advanced Air Mobility (CPT AAMO), whose architecture appropriately distributes work among system organizations and agents (human and automated). Its design is based on a systematic analysis of potential allocations of contingency planning functions. The analysis is not just about allocating functions between humans and automation, but also the allocation of responsibilities across organizations in the system. Metrics include function allocation coherency, operational tempo, and coordination load. The analysis enables us to assess each candidate architecture according to system properties like safety, resilience, equity, integration, and resistance to cyber-attack. Our approach allows NASA to move beyond function allocation to task design, providing a systematic assessment of what will and will not work as a procedure/task.

The overhead stack of lead plane, tanker, and aerial supervision aircraft is eliminated. Night air operations are de-conflicted through the use of controlled 3D entry and exit corridors to eliminate the risk of mid-air collision.

To successfully integrate UAS for wildfire operations, traffic management limitations among not only manned and unmanned vehicles, but also air and ground actors, need to be overcome. During today’s operations, emergency responders are overwhelmed with data from different sources and platforms. UAS operations need to be integrated without increasing the workload of emergency responders or sacrificing the safety of operations. Effectively communicating and providing a common situational awareness on a single platform is key for the successful integration of new technologies in the firefighting field. Improving Aviation is proposing to develop a portable wildfire management tool that combines two critical aspects of wildfire suppression efforts: a common situational awareness map for multi-modal vehicle operations (including crewed and uncrewed aerial vehicles, ground vehicles, and pedestrians) and a real-time weather transmission standard to exchange atmospheric information required for real-time models of wildfire spread. The proposed platform is based on Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) open-source software, MoVE, a publicly available multi-vehicle testing framework that incorporates multi-modal vehicle motion and provides a common situational awareness picture where connected vehicles share telemetry data, including position and atmospheric information. The MoVE platform will be enhanced to serve as a wildfire management operations platform providing a self-powered, self-contained portable station with telemetry information exchanges from multiple ground and air vehicles equipped with varying data links.","The proposed solution aims to advance the development of the Traffic Management-eXploration (XTM) project and System Scalable Traffic Management for Emergency Response Operations (STEReO) system by providing a tool and framework to enable the integration of UAS in emergency management operations, leveraging principles from the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system. The research performed in this effort will enable effective, low-latency communications and a common situational awareness picture.","The target commercial market is the wildfire suppression industry as well as public and agencies responsible for emergency response. These agencies can use the proposed tool to obtain a common operational picture, ensuring the safety and efficiency of wildfire management operations and achieving an interoperable real-time communication system that can share data across multiple involved actors."

The proposed software application would assist maintenance personnel and equipment owners to optimize system operation and maintenance activities by providing up-to-date information of key health metrics. The relevance and significance of the proposed innovation lies in the possibility to improve the capabilities to predict and model the behavior of SOV's. More generally, this proposal seeks to develop technology for health determination and fault management, prediction, prognosis, and anomaly detection. The proposed innovation addresses a gap between academic research and actual available commercial applications for monitoring the health status of real, field-deployed, industrial systems. The few options commercially available require the incorporation of additional hardware (sensors, signal conditioning modules, etc.) with obvious impacts to system cost and complexity. In relation to this, the proposed approach will make use of non-intrusive, low-cost techniques for measuring a coil’s resistance or impedance, which in combination with calibrated models that correlate resistance and temperature, will allow to 1) determine if the coil’s insulation has been subjected to operating temperatures higher than its rated class, 2) estimate cumulative damage based on total operating hours, and remaining useful life, 3) detect shorted coils, 4) assess internal leakage of the valve by detecting deviations in measured impedance (ac valves) from nominal values, and 5) provide confirmation of a valve operation in case of limit switch failures (ac valves). Furthermore, the proposed system would allow processing of historical usage data to estimate and maintain reliability curves, thus providing operators with additional insight to better understand and expose risk.","It is expected that the proposed application would be of interest to most of NASA’s research centers, testing centers, and launch sites, given the fact that solenoid valves (SOV) are basic components of most fluid systems. At SSC, there are currently more than 600 SOV's in operation, with a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 75 days. The Gateway Refueling System is another candidate for the deployment of technologies like the ones introduced in this proposal, since SOV’s are one of the basic components of its present design.","Given their nature and function, solenoid-operated valves are ubiquitous in industrial applications. In this sense, it is expected that a monitoring and advisory application like the one proposed here could find widespread application throughout a diverse range of industries, as for example oil & gas, nuclear, manufacturing, power generation, chemical, food, and pharmaceutical among others."

There is a critical need for technology to realize this target, specifically technologies to enable autonomous inspection, maintenance, and repair (IM&R). Under previously funded NASA efforts TRACLabs has developed CRAFTSMAN, a supervisory robot control framework. However, this approach still requires supervisory/operator interaction to perform verification of task outcomes and inspection. This potentially limits the ability to widely deploy such a supervisory system due to the level of required operator attention and interaction. Techniques to automate such tasks are needed to reduce operator burden. Additionally, the lack of robust error detection becomes increasingly critical in remote tasks on the lunar surface and in dangerous ground-based tasks such as those involving propellant transfer. To address this shortcoming and to increase the autonomous capabilities of TRACLabs' robot control suite for use in HEOMD domains TRACLabs proposes the Generative Adversarial Networks for Detecting Erroneous Results (GANDER) system to leverage Generative Adversarial Networks to perform online error detection in ground operations tasks. The resulting system will increase the inspection and task outcome verification capabilities of these systems, thus increasing the autonomous behavior of deployed robot systems on Earth and on other planets and moons.","In addition to benefiting NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) operations at KSC, enabling autonomous inspection, maintenance and repair functionality will be of increasing importance in the upcoming Artemis missions.

In addition to the need to supply a larger collection of medications, the pharmaceuticals within the medical kits will need to maintain appropriate stability. Current practices involve repackaging medications outside of manufacturer’s packaging to conserve mass and volume on the spacecraft. Although operationally necessary, it is not known how the repackaging affects the shelf-life of the drugs. Improved packaging systems are needed, as it has been shown that medications are susceptible to the unique conditions experienced during spaceflight, including radiation, microgravity, and vibration.

For primary packaging, high-efficiency blister packages will provide protection to susceptible solid pharmaceutical doses against environmental exposures (e.g. moisture, oxygen) without the typical costs to mass and volume. This solution will maintain additional advantages of blister cards, including protection from vibration, and the packs will be developed to be compatible with a range of medications through broad protection against failure mechanisms.

The CDRA captures CO2 using a sorbent material, traditionally zeolite. The zeolite must be maintained at specific temperatures for successful adsorption (20°C) and desorption (200°C) of the CO2. The CDRA relies on cartridge heaters and solid conductive metal fins to generate and spread heat to the sorbent material. The cooling system connects to the main cooling system on the spacecraft. This thermal management system is employed to maintain the appropriate sorbent (i.e., zeolite) temperature for adsorption and desorption temperatures of the CO2. The current system has been used for over 30 years, and many problems have arisen during its lifetime including performance vs. resource usage, closed loop operation, zeolite dust causing leaks, and sensors failing due to thermal fatigue. The proposed thermal management system mitigates many of these issues by combining the heating and cooling modes, operating passively, and replacing the solid metal fins with a unique, two-phase heat transfer vapor chamber system. By using vapor chambers instead of solid metal fins, there is minimal temperature gradient along the heat transfer device which will increase the isothermality of the surrounding sorbent material. This allows for faster, and more even, heating and cooling of the sorbent bed, which will ultimately improve the CO2 adsorption and desorption rates.","This novel vapor chamber thermal management system would be used for the current Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) on board the International Space Station. It will allow for less power usage, combined heating and cooling mode, high isothermality in the sorbent material, and a more efficient carbon dioxide removal assembly.

This method will drastically reduce thermal contact resistance, reducing regeneration cycle time and total power input. In Phase I, Mainstream will formulate a zeolite paste capable of being 3D printed into a self-supporting structure, develop the process of embedding the heating elements into the structures, and demonstrate the fabrication of a zeolite structure with embedded heating elements.

A cyclone separator reduces the total particulate matter loading while collecting larger particles (i.e., 1–10 µm, >10 µm). The remaining sub-micron particles (i.e. 0.1–1 µm) are then removed using an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), which drives particles entrained in the gas stream onto a collection electrode. Mainstream will optimize the geometry, electrode material, and key operational parameters to achieve a very high efficiency (>99%) for particles down to 0.1 µm. Collection electrodes can be regenerated in place through gas reaction or removed and scraped for safe storage and reuse or disposal, retaining all carbon particles. In Phase I, Mainstream will leverage our existing CFD and design toolsets to experimentally demonstrate sub-micron particulate separation with a combined cyclone and ESP system. Regeneration of electrodes would occur in-place or be used for safe disposal of carbon. Using process model designs and experimental data, Mainstream will design a carbon removal system and detail system size, weight, and power requirements. In Phase II, we will fabricate and validate a full-scale prototype system and advance system development for rapid integration.","NASA applications for the proposed carbon removal system for sub-micron particulates separation include integration with oxygen recovery systems for future long-duration manned missions such as Gateway and Mars. Additionally, this technology is applicable for both general air purification of the main cabin of the manned spacecraft as well as the removal of planetary dust from main cabins and airlocks of the planetary habitat.","Non-NASA applications are numerous including automotive, thermal oxidizers, incinerators, industrial separators, commercial/medical/residential air purification, and particulate concentrators.

Since the development of SA9T for the Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) system in the 2000s, studies have continued to investigate a multitude of new sorbents with enhanced performance specifications. These new sorbent candidates in many cases have direct application to closed environment CO2 removal (space-based vehicle and submarines). New regenerable sorbent formulations have the potential to benefit current space-based applications that rely upon the current state of the art (SOA) candidate. Sorbents with improved CO2 and H2O capacity can also result in potential reductions in mass, volume, and pressure loss in new systems. Paragon, through internally funded research activities, has developed the sorbent manufacturing expertise to develop new candidates that meet and exceed the key performance metrics laid out in this SBIR solicitation. These new sorbents will be chemically tuned and experimentally investigated with the goal of achieving higher working capacities for CO2 and H2O.  In addition, the test facility and required hardware to accurately evaluate sorbents in a simulated atmospheric environment for space-based applications has also been developed and operated by Paragon. As clearly defined in the SBIR Topic H4.07 description, NASA has a need for new technology alternatives to the RCA in order to establish a robust suit program.

These levels must be controlled to established values of 2.2 mm Hg at a metabolic rate of 2.44 g/min. Historically, the Metox has been used to remove CO2 from the suit. The sorbent in the Metox has a finite capacity during an EVA and must be regenerated after the mission is complete. The capacity limits mission times, which can only be increased by making the Metox larger. The technology that is planned to replace the Metox is the RCA which utilizes two beds that are alternately used to remove CO2 and H2O and then regenerated by exposure to space vacuum. The RCA has been under development for over 10 years and has utilized an amine-based sorbent (SA9T). Although SA9T has good reversible CO2 uptakes, higher capacities are desired to maintain low CO2 levels and reduce O2 losses. In addition, this sorbent emits low levels of ammonia which must be removed from the suit using a separate technology. In this SBIR Phase I project, Reaction Systems will develop new sorbents that will outperform SA9T and at the same time exhibit reduced ammonia emissions. Reaction Systems’ strategy to accomplish this goal consists of two important components. The first component consists of identifying sorbents that have high probability to perform better than the SA9T. Reaction Systems has demonstrated expertise in the development of advanced sorbents for CO2 control in both EVA and cabin applications and will also employ a consultant who is an expert in gas surface interactions and in the synthesis and characterization of organic compounds. The second component of our strategy is the application of a rapid screening method that will provide accurate and relevant performance data so compounds with the highest potential can be quickly identified.","This technology could be used for CO2 control in a space craft cabin or on the surface of the Moon or Mars (Artemis goals). The CDRA, used on the ISS for CO2 control, uses pressure and temperature swing adsorption cycle to remove CO2. The CO2 is removed with a mol sieve that is heated to 400°F during regeneration. The cycling causes the sorbent to break down into dust, which clogs filters or ends up in the cabin air. A sorbent that does not require a temperature increase for regeneration would reduce power consumption and eliminate dust.","This could also be used for control of CO2 emissions from power plants. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased from 280 ppm to over 400 ppm over the last 50 years primarily due to CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. An effective method to remove CO2 could be used to remove CO2 from the effluent and compress it into a concentrated liquid for sequestration, storage, or use."

Multiple pieces of PV blankets with the width of 4 m are mounted on the ultra-lightweight structure and provide a total area of 216 m2 and power output of ~60KW with the III-V PV cells at an efficiency of ~30% at the standard test condition (STC). During the installation, a stable base will first be set up with a double tripod, which will support the vertical axis with a motor for solar tracking. A foldable frame will be erected with an inflatable envelope as well as an actuator in the horizontal direction to reduce the dimension of the base and provide support to the solar blankets. Then horizontal beams are unfolded, and solar blankets will be raised and hung on the beams. Each blanket is attached to a smart mounting fixture to provide in-plane rigidity, so that the load will be transferred to the base through multiple loading paths for the stability and rigidity of the large PV array. This smart mounting system enables novel packaging, deployment, retraction, and modularity concepts and can be scaled up for higher PV capacity at the lunar South Pole. The innovations in materials discovery and structural design can be brought back to the earth for temporary solar array for shading and energy supply to remote communities, or power supplies to rescue sites after extreme weather events. The model and algorithm for virtual experiments will advance the state of the art of the material and structural design and analysis.","A lightweight, vertically deployed, retractable 50-kW-class (~60-kW) solar array is proposed for surface photovoltaic energy harvesting near the lunar South Pole, which can meet diverse needs including lunar bases, dedicated power landers, and rovers. This robust, lightweight, re-deployable solar array is applicable to different solar modules as well. The success of this project will lead to new technology for the next generation of solar arrays for the NASA Artemis Program.","The highly efficient lightweight thin film cell is ideal for unmanned aerial vehicles; the vertical structure can be used for energy harvesting and shading for residential and commercial buildings; the smart mounting fixture can be used for building integrated photovoltaic systems; the ultra-lightweight composite can be used for vehicles, naval vessels, aircrafts, and building structures."

The rationale is that fine micrograins, containing well-ordered, uniform atomic lattice crystals, materials will exhibit less brittle fracture and resist oxidation and ablation. In other words, they will behave more like high temperature metals. This proposal takes the view that refractory carbides such as hafnium carbide are the best high temperature ablation resistant materials possible, and their ultimate performance depends upon a well-ordered atomic lattice in a uniform, micro-dispersed grain structure.","The number one application is high temperature hypersonic shielding materials, but the methodology has application to any type of structural ceramic material when high performance is required.

Through our substantial experience in applying and developing neuromorphic algorithms for spacecraft systems, we have determined that the performance of our algorithms can be substantially improved if the lowest level substrate, the building blocks, were designed to use the most power efficient traits of neuromorphic hardware. More efficient performance of key mathematical operations in neuromorphic hardware would provide high value to spacecraft developers as they can translate their existing work directly into a vastly more power efficient and faster processing system. NERVES is driven by a practical need and the pipeline to commercialization is already established through Exploration Institute’s track record and current work. NERVES directly maps conventional algorithms to any neuromorphic processor, combining the benefits of more capable, well known algorithms with the power savings of a neuromorphic architecture. A neuromorphic chip like Intel’s Loihi has a computational power density of more than 1000x that of a CPU or GPU for some tasks. Based on our initial analysis, Exploration Institute predicts that NERVES will enable these kinds of power savings (or conversely, computational capacity increase for the same power) which will greatly improve NASA's capacity for onboard autonomy. As an added bonus, NERVES provides a more verifiabile approach to neuromorphic computing in space, by allowing the use of verified computing approaches (non-neuromorphic, conventional) on neuromorphic hardware with all the power savings that can entail.

We propose our fully implemented Thinking Robots Autonomous Cognitive System (TRACS) architecture at TRL5 as the basis for a cognitive agent for future NASA deep space missions.  TRACS is open, modular, makes decisions under uncertainty, and learns in a manner that the performance of the system is assured and improves over time.

Communication from ground control may take hours, or longer. We propose to build a modular and adaptive goal-based cognitive system with the understanding of spacecraft operations to provide effective mission management and control during periods of no or low communication.

The immediate beneficiary will be LunaNet, but the benefit will be even greater for interplanetary missions where route revision in response to a link change would be delayed by at least one round-trip communication to Earth.",The same performance improvements that will accrue to NASA space flight missions from adopting Reactive Routing will likewise benefit space flight operations mounted by all commercial space businesses and other national space agencies that use DTN for mission communications.

COMMANDS offers a decentralized AI-based solution to configure, optimize and manage communications for NASA’s lunar networks. It will provide significant improvements in throughput, end-to-end latency, overhead and resource consumption in delay/disruption tolerant networks (DTN) backed by our previous NASA’s SBIR program, LEARN. COMMANDS is based on our tactical AI design and builds a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework that enables the lunar network to sense, adapt, act and learn from its experiences and unknown environment autonomously. This automates and optimizes mission operation and resource efficiencies without necessitating involvement from a mission operations team. We propose to deploy graph-based machine learning that enables neural comprehension of all available network parameters and conditions into a node embedding. Next, our tactical AI uses a hybrid approach to combine expert systems and AI to bring robustness and intuition designs. COMMANDS extends our Python-based simulation of DTN Lunar communication for the training, testing, verification. We further use the CORE network emulation tool to demonstrate the validation and performance gains of the COMMANDS as a novel network traffic management software service. We propose an alternative approach for training graph neural network (GNN)-based design. To efficiently train GNN, first, we find the centralized solution to the network routing, resource allocation and control, bundle scheduling and fragmentation. The centralized solution will be formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). We propose to solve neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) to solve this centralized problem. The outcome is a centralized solution, which will help us in the design of a decentralized GNN-based solution.","COMMANDS technologies, when fully developed and demonstrated, will offer commercially viable, cost-effective delay-tolerant networking solutions to deploy intelligent overlay network solutions over commercial communication services for future space missions, such as Artemis. In addition, they will substantially reduce the operational complexity for mission engineers by automating, with high confidence, various tasks of planning, scheduling and managing communication resources across multiple heterogeneous networking assets.","Space-based broadband internet services such as Starlink and Amazon Kuiper demand terrestrial-grade service quality despite many spacecraft participating in data forwarding. We expect our AI-based DTN technology to further advance such systems by seamlessly allowing the addition of new communication assets, e.g. unmanned aerial systems, to quickly adapt to varying user demands with little planning"

Our approach will focus on quantifying the system level benefits of reduced-temperature operation of a power-scaled Er:YAG oscillator and power amplifier.  A primary challenge to the Er:YAG laser system is inherently low gain and quasi-three-level lasing transitions of the erbium activator ions.  It is well-established that reducing the laser gain medium to sub-ambient temperatures improves achievable laser efficiency.  However, models based on cross-section data from the current literature that simply use Boltzman statistics for scaling cannot account for the observed improvements, inhibiting system trades of performance versus temperature.  Fibertek proposes to address the lack of data in the current literature by collecting spectroscopic data over the temperature range 77K-300K to determine the optimum gain medium temperature for Er:YAG.  This data will be integrated into an advanced energetics model to accurately predict improvements in laser efficiency.  The model predictions will be validated through laser demonstrations as well as to guide a study to assess the improvements relative to potential SWaP penalties associated with operating at a reduced temperature.  Energy scaling of Er:YAG could potentially provide NASA with a compact laser transmitter that could revolutionize weather and climate research by providing three dimensional distributions of water vapor profiles, estimates of perceptible water vapor, high resolution methane column measurements, distributions of planetary boundary layer heights, and attenuated profiles of aerosols and clouds.","The key NASA application include the following all of which have been identified as mission and technology development area in the 2018 Earth Science Decadal Survey.

SWATH is a fully continuous, solid surface deployable parabolic reflector architecture. The continuous solid surface enables higher frequency operation than mesh systems at lower costs. SWATH leverages Opterus’ high strain composite (HSC) material technologies as the primary structural element, this material innovation provides material stiffness within the reflector shell while accommodating high bending strains to stow extremely compactly, readily conforming to CubeSat and SmallSat form factors. Further, SWATH leverages a mold-based manufacturing process for low-cost, rapid manufacturability. NASA has outlined a need for deployable high frequency antenna apertures for V-band (65GHz - 70GHz) for space-based air pressure sensing on earth. Such technologies would address gaps in weather forecasting abilities as a result of inabilities to accurately measure atmospheric pressure from long ranges, such as over oceans. A proliferated constellation of CubeSats or SmallSats performing sensing operations in the oxygen band would improve weather forecasting capabilities by increasing understanding of current conditions over a larger area to inform predictive models. The most cost-effective solution for a proliferated space-based sensing constellation requires small or cube satellites. Currently there are no high frequency deployable antenna solutions with spaceflight heritage. Typical high frequency antenna reflectors are rigid structures that do not conform to SmallSat or CubeSat form factors. Current state of the art deployable antennas for small spacecraft are typically mesh-based deployable antennas, these systems are limited in operating frequency to approximately 50 GHz due to mesh leakage and mesh shaping constraints. Mesh antennas also demand extensive touch labor and part counts which causes high costs and long lead times compared to SWATH.","SWATH enables earth science missions and improves weather forecasting capabilities through enabling space-based remote sensing such as Oxygen Band Radar systems, Differential Absorption Radars.

That is the case of classification or target detection problems. Using hyperspectral data with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (such as deep neural networks) has been a considerable challenge due to the sheer data sizes, immense hardware requirements and long training cycles. Our company has developed a technology that overcomes these hurdles. Our system captures spatio-spectral content in a compact, information-rich, monochrome image, termed diffractogram.  They can be used directly for inferencing, i.e., target detection and classification. This is achieved via optimally designed nanofabricated, diffractive-filter arrays (DFA) integrated into an existing sensors (FPAs).

It came to our attention from conversations with NASA experts Dr. Patrick Gatlin and Dr. Mason Quick that our technology had great potential to improve on the current approach since it can observe other spectral bands simultaneously and efficiently, resulting in an improved detection rate. Moreover, the system can be used for other applications that use space hyperspectral data such as vegetation monitoring, detection of algal blooms, etc.","Despite their usefulness and applicability in virtually every sector, hyperspectral sensors have not attained a wider adoption primarily due to two obstacles: 1) a very high price tag and 2) onerous data requirements.

Infrared sensors used in probe and satellite missions need to provide orders of magnitude larger effective well depth, thereby affording longer integration times. Longer integration times provide improved signal-to-noise ratio and/or higher operating temperature, which reduces cooler capacity, resulting in SWaP-C savings. Digital pixel sensors (DPS) can offer vastly improved dynamic range and a welcome disconnect between sensitivity and maximum signal.  No longer does the sensitivity have to worsen by the square root of the increase in well capacity, as is the case of conventional analog pixels.  Instead, the maximum well capacity can be increased independently on a DPS by increasing the number of bits in each pixel.

A key drawback is the use of discrete filters that need special hardware for stabilization (to survive a rocket launch) and precision alignment to within microns of the FPAs, adding weight to an assembly that has to be cooled by a large cryocooler for cryogenic operation. A more elegant solution is to deposit thin-film filters directly on a single large-format FPA, lightening the package, making it more reliable optically, and drastically improving the size, weight, reliability, and mission life of the cryocooler. In Phase I, we propose to develop and demonstrate such a solution, a key challenge being to achieve the demanding passband requirements of such filters.

Specifically, we emphasize that the proposed system is compact, lightweight, power efficient, and therefore can be mounted on small to mid-sized un-crewed aircraft systems. The sensor features a small (centimeter scale) exposed beam path that allows ambient air circulation without active gas sampling. The proposed sensor is based on mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy using Pendar’s proprietary distributed feedback quantum cascade laser array (QCLA) technology. Our monolithically integrated chip-scale coherent source can withstand harsh operating conditions while offering superior wavelength and intensity stability compared to other broadband mid-infrared sources. Broadband spectral coverage (up to 500 cm-1) combined with high frequency resolution (~100 MHz) enable a multi-tasking sensor capable of detecting a multitude of gases including toxic industrial chemicals, chemical warfare agents, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds. The laser source can rapidly tune over a large bandwidth to provide fast spectral measurements, enabling >100 Hz time response. Absorption measurements in the mid-infrared fingerprinting region ensures that a small pathlength is sufficient to reach uncertainty levels of <1% even when operating on moving platforms. By the end of Phase I, we will have built a prototype sensor and experimentally demonstrated that the sensor can reach targeted sensitivities under simulated flight conditions.","The proposed sensor can be directly adopted for airborne missions such as on NASA’s Airborne Science aircraft fleet, un-crewed aircraft systems and balloons to provide lower cost atmospheric gas measurements. The CO2 sensing capability can be utilized to augment the space-based measurements of CO2 dry air mole fraction under the OCO-2 project. The TEMPO project can also benefit from additional ozone and NO2 measurements.","We believe our proposed sensing solution can be adopted for chemical threat detection, which would be of interest to the Department of Homeland Security.

We will develop a Wildfire Integrated Modeling, Prediction, and Learning Environment (WIMPLE), a hybrid AI tool for wildfire risk assessment. WIMPLE is based on our Scruff AI framework, which provides integration of different kinds of AI models, sharing and composition of models, with spatiotemporal flexibility in model composition.

In many arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater is rapidly being depleted, which is affecting agricultural productivity over the long term. The over-exploitation of groundwater due to the current drought episode in South-Western U.S. has already led farmers to fallow hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland. Informed assessments and policies related to groundwater supplies can only be made on the basis of large-scale, precise estimates of depletion and recharge. However, current technologies have poor resolution in time and/or in space. We propose to leverage very recent advances in artificial intelligence applied to Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) in order to study groundwater depletion and recharge. Variations in groundwater levels induce deformation at the surface of the Earth, which can be captured by satellite-based InSAR measurements. Our technology allows to lower the detection threshold of surface deformation in InSAR time series by about an order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art; the associated resolution in space is a few km with a time resolution of roughly a week, thereby potentially offering a new tool for groundwater management decisions.","The tools proposed in this Phase I proposal will rely extensively on NASA data, by analyzing partly processed InSAR data available on NASA's Earth Data portal.

Both the spatiotemporal co-alignment and event-based analysis innovations build upon the same technological foundation, i.e., the SpatioTemporal Adaptive-Resolution Encoding, STARE, a geo-spatiotemporal encoding methodology developed to support combining diverse datasets in their native states for integrative analysis. STARE encodes spatiotemporal coordinate locations, along with neighborhoods (or intervals, or resolutions), of the data elements using two (2) 64-bit integers in a hierarchical manner. The spatial scheme of STARE encodes geolocation and spatial neighborhood hierarchically in 8 branches of quadtrees, whereas its temporal scheme encodes International Atomic Time and temporal intervals hierarchically also in a tree but with branching following calendrical units, such as day, week, month, etc.  Mapping space-time intervals onto tree hierarchies then encoded into integers not only 1) provides an outstanding way to uniformly index and thus organize geo-data of different, irregular layouts with spatiotemporal co-alignment for scalable processing but also 2) establishes a solid foundation to facilitate efficient event-based analysis. We plan to use the POSIX-compliant flexFS of Paradigm4 to implement a directory (folder) hierarchy mirroring that of STARE for Cloud web objects. Such a POSIX-compliant data store not only realizes the spatiotemporal co-alignment of diverse, unaltered data for easy, performant retrieval and utilization but also present the Cloud web object store in a “view” compatible with the all-familiar filesystem, to which most users are accustomed, e.g., in on-premises high-performance computing (HPC) environments and on individuals’ desktops or laptops.","Our technology possesses the unique capability of harmonizing geo-spatiotemporal data varieties for fusional analysis in their native resolutions and layout, including the vast barely-tapped resource of NASA Level 1 and 2 data currently in HDF files in Distributed Active Archive Centers. This data-variety harmonization facilitates spatiotemporal data placement alignment first in storage for effortless search-and-filter and second in memory for performant and scalable distributed parallel processing, including Cloud and minimizing duplication.","Our technology will enhance analysis productivity while reducing resource demand and cost for all geospatial analytics practitioners in academics, government agencies, and industrial-commercial organizations.

The targeted NASA application is EPRV (extreme precision radial velocity), a technique used to measure the masses of temperate planets orbiting sun-like stars that calls for a spectrometer with R~100,000 in the visible to NIR spectrum (400-900nm).  A single chip measuring occupying less than 170 square millimeters of area can implement this function, minimizing the need for complex control systems that are required for stabilizing larger bulk realizations.   In a FTS, two replicas of an input lightwave signal are subjected to independently controlled time delays and recombined to produce a so-called interferogram.  By forming the interferogram over a suitably wide range of time delays, an autocorrelation representation of the signal is formed which can then be digitally Fourier Transform to yield the desired spectrum.  The iFTS uses a novel set of coarse and fine time delay adjustments with a digital architecture wherein MEMS actuation provides 17 bits of time delay control.  In this phase 1 effort, the complete system will be analyzed to produce reachable system performance specifications for a later Phase 2 consideration.  Moreover, an early effort involving the deposition and characterization of key layer materials for optical waveguide construction will be performed, using Obsidian Sensors' proprietary Integrated MEMS on Glass manufacturing process.   The goal will be to explore the possibility of adding an optical waveguide module to produce a low cost photonic integrated circuit fabrication technique that includes MEMS and thin film transistors.   PDK (process design kit) from commercial photonic waveguide foundries will also be considered with recommendations compiled for which direction to follow for a later Phase 2 implementation.","EPRV instruments that are being contemplated for ground based telescopes is the immediate outlet for the iFTS technology.  The market for such scientific instruments with performance goals that far outstrip any defense or commercial application is not large but significant for a small company like Obsidian Sensors.   Because we are targeting a production technology that promises to be lower cost per unit area of device, higher volume applications stand to benefit from a successful iFTS development.",The successful demonstration of iFTS for the EPRV application can directly impact much larger volume applications across the medical and even consumer markets where less challenging spectroscopy performed in real time in the molecular fingerprint regions of the infrared can be used for diagnosis and analysis.

(CCI) has developed and patented a continuous fiber 3-D printing technology known as CF3D®. CF3D has unique capabilities to reduce cost, accelerate design cycles, scale throughput, and create highly tailorable structures (e.g., in terms of design and material properties). By utilizing continuous fiber reinforcement, snap curing aerospace-grade photopolymers, and robotics, CF3D can drastically reduce the time and cost of creating continuous fiber-reinforced composites. CF3D allows for fabrication of unique structures that would be impractical to produce with traditional methods requiring autoclave or vacuum bag pressure during curing. One such structure is an open iso-grid rib structure. Iso-grid composite structures are not a new technology and have been built and flown on space structures, however traditionally are very expensive to produce.CF3D is very conducive to the manufacturing of iso-grid composite structures, either with a skin or as an open lattice concept. The single carbon fiber tow can be put on a support surface of any shape (e.g., flat, cylindrical, or spherical). Each tow is then stacked on top of the previous tow and UV cured in-situ, resulting in any rib pattern desired for the target strength and stiffness of the structure. A unique property of the composite open iso-grid structural concept is its bulk thermal expansion properties. As each rib of the iso-grid structure is composed of all unidirectional fibers oriented along the length of the member, the CTE is very low. Published studies on T800 unidirectional laminates show CTE to be in the range of -.4 (10-6 X K-1) in the fiber direction. This results in a structure that is overall lightweight and isotropic given the nature of the iso-grid concept with a very low CTE. Using high strength, low-cost intermediate modulus fibers to build a lightweight, low CTE structure has the potential to greatly decrease the weight, cost, and lead time of dimensionally stable structures.",Potential NASA applications include dimensionally stable space structures and light weight space payloads and vehicles structures.,"Potential Non-NASA applications include commercial dimensionally stable space structures and light weight space payloads and vehicles structures.

The paraboloid mirrors would be made in space by spinning the mirror support structure or the entire satellite simultaneously in two orthogonal axes while releasing the liquid precursor into it. Spinning around the first axis generates an artificial gravity, while spinning around the second axis generates a paraboloid surface in the liquid mirror precursor. The precursor is subsequently allowed to solidify thus preserving its paraboloid surface and forming a mirror. The currently proposed precursor material is a photopolymer which is cross-linked by exposure to an on-board UV source. Alternatively, the precursor materials can be two-part epoxies, metals (K, Na, In), their alloys and thermosetting and thermoforming polymers. The proposed system also includes a thermo coating system which would deposit a reflective coating onto a formed mirror surface in case the mirror is fabricated of a weakly reflecting precursor. Additionally, the mirror support structures are proposed to be made of shape-memory materials which would offer high packaging density for launch and which would unfold upon application of heat. Utilizing such structures avoids dedicated actuators and greatly reduces complexity, weight and packaged volume of the system. There are no fundamental limits to the size of space-made mirrors, since they are fabricated in zero- or microgravity. The mirrors can be repaired in space by re-deposition of the precursor (or re-melting in case of metals), re-spinning them and solidifying the precursor.","The proposed mirrors would enable new techniques of constructing large- and very large aperture telescopes in space, opening up new opportunities for terrestrial and space exploration. With relatively few mirror generation steps, this technology would favorably compete with present multi-segment large mirror assemblies, in terms of cost, complexity and reliability, while offering potentially much larger apertures. In addition, the proposed mirrors can be re-worked while in space, thus extending the useful lifetime of space telescopes.","The proposed technology would enable large aperture space telescopes to be launched with relatively small vehicles, while avoiding complicated assembly in space. The cost of the resulting mirrors is expected to be orders-of-magnitude lower than present ones. As a result, the cost of high resolution space and terrestrial surveying, cartography and surveillance will be reduced by orders-of-magnitude."

However, their capabilities come at great cost, especially manufacturing complexity and safety-related overhead expenses for a given telescope program.  There is a significant performance gap between beryllium and SiC materials and the lower-cost aluminum substrates.  This presents problems for telescope programs unable to afford beryllium systems:  though science and engineering seek highly capable optical systems, common and less expensive metals such as aluminum 6061 lack the material properties required to deliver required capabilities.  Subject matter experts at Outpost technologies and its partnering organizations, Materion and the UAH CAO, have noted that aluminum’s low specific strength/stiffness and high coefficient of thermal expansion have crippled past balloon-based telescope systems due to excessive mass and material limitations.

Due to the shorter wavelength, requirements to the surface figure (shape) and finish (roughness) of X-ray mirrors are many orders of magnitude more stringent than for visible-light optics. Metrology technology has not kept up with the advancement in fabrication technologies. The deficiencies in the metrology, rather than in the fabrication technologies, primarily limit the optical quality. We propose to develop a novel “turn-key” technology and methodology for high precision calibration and sophisticated data processing directed to advance the Cylindrical Wavefront Interferometry.

Freeform optical components can reduce a telescope's size and weight (reducing launch costs), but are challenging to test and validate with traditional metrology tools due to their lack of symmetry and large changes in curvature (increasing manufacturing costs). Improved metrology systems for freeform optics have potential to improve performance and reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding prescription-specific null correctors or holograms. Metrology systems for freeform optics require a challenging combination of capabilities: high-resolution (ideally sub-nanometer) measurement of large deviations from a planar surface and steep surface slope. At OptiPro Systems, we have recently developed (in part through NASA SBIR projects) a chromatic interferometric probe capable of sub-nanometer metrology of optical surfaces, which is essential for precision optical components such as telescope mirrors. The probe's range is currently limited to small surface sag (""measurement range"") and shallow surface slope (""acceptance angle""), preventing direct application to freeform optics. We propose fundamental enhancements to the chromatic interferometric probe to enable cost-effective metrology of freeform optics: wide measurement range and acceptance angle, while maintaining sub-nanometer performance. Such improvements require understanding unproven concepts and potentially major redesign of the probe optical system. The Phase I project aims to verify these concepts, using bread-board level proof-of-concept demonstration and computer simulations, and deliver a report detailing a clear path toward implementing these improvements in prototype probes and their use in metrology of high-performance freeform optics.","Potential NASA applications include metrology of freeform and other optical components for NASA missions, including flagship/decadal missions, small satellites, and everything between.

To continue these advancements, the Astronomy and Astrophysics survey for the 2020's identifies the need for high resolution x-ray imaging and an increase in small scale missions to support long term scientific goals. The gap in the soft x-ray detector market place is difficult for smaller budget mis­sions to manage as they must choose between cheaper sub-par detectors or those designed for class C and above missions, costing many millions of dollars each. By selecting commercially available sensors for this application, cost per detector decreases and smaller missions will be included in the rapid development cycle of terrestrial detectors that includes larger area arrays and smaller pixels.

This proposal addresses this need with a solution for sediment buildup in the melt stream of ocean world ice penetrating robots (cryobots) that descend via hot water drilling. Ocean worlds remain of critical interest for astrobiology but cryobots require deep drilling to reach areas of interest on Europa or the poles of Mars. Previously built and tested prototype cryobots such as Stone Aerospace’s THOR system demonstrate high efficiency using downward-pointing closed cycle hot water drill (CCHWD) jets on the nose cone of the vehicle, however debris released from the ice could potentially obstruct a cryobot and it will accumulate as refreezing ice behind the cryobot excludes salt and sediment. Our proposed solution mitigates silt, solids, and salt accumulation using HWD jets in new ways. It uses the two-pronged approach of A) control of meltwater circulation, speed, and flow using jet orientation or mechanical rotation plus B) obliquely-oriented HWD jets to create Sequestration Side-Pockets (SSPs) in the surrounding ice. This system is part of an extended plan for using CCHWD jets to manage sediment for cryobots called MJOLNIR (Managing Jets of Liquid for Nullifying Ice Refuse). Control of vectored HWD jets equipped for selectable spray and variable pressure will hollow out SPPs on the side-periphery of the nose cone of a cryobot. These SSPs will accept and accumulate brine and sediment. Controlling jet pressure, angle, spray, and orientation gives precise control of meltwater circulation and speed for sediment transport and deposition. This allows sediment to settle out when appropriate, by centrifugally driving it into pre-cut pockets of still water.","MJOLNIR allows ice penetrating cryobots such as THOR to breach debris-laden ice (ice fraction >50%), providing steady state debris mitigation over long descent distances.

The patented electric ignition system utilizes recently discovered unique properties of some 3D printed materials whereby electricity applied to the material carves an ""arc-track"" through the layered material. The associated Joule-heating pyrolyzes fuel, and as oxidizing flow is introduced, ignition spontaneously occurs. This property is being developed into a power-efficient system, that can reliably cold-start and restart hybrid rocket motors.

For every gram of liftoff mass removed from the return vehicle, the incremental reduction in gross liftoff mass from Earth is several orders of magnitude greater. Consequently, any technology that can reduce the mass that must be lifted out of the target body’s gravity well will have a huge impact on the amount of mass that must be lifted off the Earth’s surface. For an ascent vehicle, regardless of whether a solid, liquid, or hybrid rocket is used, thrusters will be needed for the reaction control system. Studies have shown that above a certain threshold, monopropellant systems become more mass-efficient than cold gas systems. An in-house trade study has shown that for total impulses above 140 N·s, a traditional hydrazine system has less mass than a cold-gas system. The same study also showed that if a foam-based ignition system is used with hydrazine instead of a granular catalyst and external heaters, the breakeven point drops to just 44 N·s. Furthermore, as the total impulse requirement increases, the mass advantage of the foam-based hydrazine system increases significantly.

TDA Research, Inc. will develop a chip-sized hybrid supercapacitor that can operate in extremely cold temperatures (-180°C).  The supercapacitor electrodes will use a 3D printed microstructure to provide high areal capacitance and power in a small package suitable for high power delivery and low temperature operation. On-chip micro supercapacitors provide the unique capability to store electrical energy and deliver it very quickly and efficiently, enhancing peak-load performance. They also offer excellent cycling capability (1-2 orders of magnitude better than batteries). The devices developed here would find use as energy storage devices in NASA space systems that operate in the extreme environments of space missions, and will not require special environmental housings. In Phase I, we will prepare the electrode materials and fabricate chip-sized supercapacitors. We will then demonstrate their ability to store energy at temperatures down to -180⁰C over 5,000 charge/discharge cycles, elevating the TRL to 4. We will benchmark our 3D printed hybrid supercapacitor against COTS devices and complete a techno-economic feasibility study of the proposed on-chip energy storage device.","TDA’s proposed 3D printed hybrid supercapacitor can withstand extreme low temperature environments found on Titan, the Moon. Mars, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies and can be used during the descent through kilometers of cryogenic ice expected in these planetary survey missions. The applications include supplementing batteries during high power transients: power precision actuators and sensors, high-torque force actuators, radio-frequency (RF) electronics, guidance and navigation avionics and instruments.","Micro supercapacitors can also be used to supplement batteries, enhancing peak-load performance. Other commercial applications could include energy storage in various MEMS sensors that are being used in: (i) Personal Wearable Devices; (ii) Transportation Systems; (iii) Photovoltaic Technologies; (iv) Power Grid Applications; (v) Medical Devices; (vi) Defense."

NASA Glenn Research Center’s JFET-R technology is the only one that has shown 1000’s of hours operation under Venus surface conditions. NASA desires computational analyses on the surface of Venus. Ozark IC is currently working on a NASA Phase II to create an all-SiC based RISC-V microprocessor in parallel with a rugged high-density packaging system. For this computational system to achieve maximum potential, access to a high temperature read only memory is critical. Companies like Cerfe  and UPenn are creating high temperature thin film non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies. In this project, Ozark IC will utilize its extensive experience in rugged additive manufacturing to create a macro scale thick-film HT ROM technology as an alternative technology. This proposal’s objective is an all-additive ROM that will integrate well with the JFET-R technology or accompany, off chip, a microprocessor module. The project will design, simulate, package, and characterize an all-additive ROM technology based on materials that were qualified up to TRL-5 in previous NASA SBIR programs. This work will first attempt to create an all-additive ROM structure in which each bit is created, or “programmed” during manufacturing. Ozark IC will also investigate using this technology for programming the ROM once, after manufacturing. Each design will be tested at 500°C to validate feasibility of Venus surface operation. Parallel work will investigate SiC thin film options for ROMs as well as all the necessary read-out electronics using JFET-R for any of these ROM structures. The body of this work will culminate in a scalable ROM structure that can accompany the SiC RISC-V chipset in a single heterogenous package. Ozark IC is well positioned to determine and address the requirements of these ROM memory structures from its work on the RISC-V microprocessor.","The proposed HT additive ROM is the next logical development step for enhancing computational power on the corrosive, high-pressure (~100 bar), high-temperature (up to 500˚C) Venus surface. The system will also be useful for other high temperature environments, such as Mercury, as well as high temperature avionics, re-entry, and propulsion sensing and controls.","Any application that needs very high temperature data collection is a potential market. Some examples include: geothermal exploration to improve drilling efficiency, jet engine sensing and actuation for distributed engine controls, avionics for high temperature sensing and actuation in hypersonic aircraft and health monitoring of molten salt reactors."

Detection of these materials and their spatial distribution within a mineral matrix are fundamental capabilities required to meet NASA strategic goals. Benefits of this method have been demonstrated on the Mars 2020 SHERLOC instrument, which successfully landed on Mars on 18 February 2021.  NGDUV lasers address the need of increasingly miniaturized next generation chemical and biological detection instruments for deep UV Raman and fluorescence detection in extreme environments including lander missions to Titan and other ocean worlds with temperatures of -200 0C, or below, as well as shadows on the Moon, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies. Specifications for a deep UV laser for operating in these extreme environments, with the performance and size, weight, and power consumption compatible with these missions, was studied as part of the Mars Perseverance SHERLOC development.  The prospect for suitable lasers includes a long list of laser types, each of which has a long history of development and different potential for applicability.  Fundamental to all laser types is the need for an excitation wavelength below 250 nm to minimize fluorescence background from targeted samples and enable unambiguous Raman and fluorescence spectra of simple organic molecules.  The second requirement is for a laser emission linewidth and line stability, independent of ambient temperature less than about 0.01 nm. The laser types which could potentially satisfy these needs includes semiconductor, fiber, solid state, and gas lasers.  Each of these laser types will be evaluated and a path forward proposed for the most likely prospects.",NGDUV lasers have application to increasingly miniaturized NASA instruments to detect trace organic chemical and biological materials on surfaces from small fixed-landers and rovers.

Additionally, the proposed work covers an exploratory set of small-scale experiments and a proof-of-concept demonstration. The project targets a well-rounded approach of “design for manufacturing” and “design for reliability” for temperature hardened memory electronics. A high temperature tolerant memory technology is needed for sensing and logging operations in harsh environments. To this end, silicon carbide offers a mature semiconductor technology that is akin to silicon in many aspects of its processing. A dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is a crucial part of many silicon electronics. It provides a fast high-capacity storage solution in many applications due to its relatively small cell structure. The most compact DRAM array is based on one capacitor one transistor (1C1T) memory cell. Even though the 1C1T memory cell is volatile in silicon due to the relatively high leakage currents at its p-n junctions, it is speculated that such a cell would be “practically” non-volatile and static if fabricated in silicon carbide. This is due to the fact that the reverse biased leakage currents in SiC p-n junctions is minimal, drastically cutting the loss rate of the stored charge, or increasing the time constant of the charge storage system. The longest possible time that DRAM holds onto its data before losing it to leakage is called the charge retention time. Charge retention times in silicon are small, requiring constant refresh cycles, which are not very power-aware. The initial experiments in silicon carbide indicate such times are very long in SiC, making its 1C1T cell “practically” a non-volatile and static memory unit. In this project, we plan to design and fabricate SiC DRAM and SRAM memory cells, and investigate their potential for use in harsh environments, to pave the way for advanced logging and metrology in extreme environments.","Exploration of inner planets such as Venus and Mercury require electronics that can operate at high temperatures. The peak temperature on Mercury is as high as 430 C, while the lowest temperature is as low as -180 C. Additionally, even though Venus is further away from the Sun, it is significantly warmer than Mercury. Lastly, gas giants (for example Jupiter) and some solar probes also require electronics that can operate at temperatures above the reach of silicon electronics. The proposed work provides a high temperature electronics solution.","High temperature electronics include components ranging from the drill logging and sensing devices needed for the commercial oil, gas, and geothermal exploration activities to the active components, controls, and sensors needed for jets and hypersonics.

The 3D-MIM process offers an intriguing fabrication method for making components of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) that are ideal for use in extreme temperature deep space environments in small spacecraft.

This proposal will focus on fluid collection mode only. The SASS can deliver and store liquid samples in microgravity-compatible containers which can be stored or immediately tested without the need for post-collection elution steps. The current SASS (non-microgravity compatible) prototype can recover bacteria and fungi from surfaces below 50 CFU and gave positive results enumerated by plate count. It can also sample areas as large as 1 sq ft. Its vacuum function also allows it to sample porous materials (cloth and nylon). Closed environments such as the ISS and spacecraft for other planned interplanetary destinations require sustainable environmental control systems for manned spaceflight and habitation. These systems require monitoring for microbial contaminants and potential pathogens that could foul equipment or affect the health of the crew. Current sampling and post-collection processing are crew-time intensive. Therefore, our proposal is highly relevant to NASA’s mission.

Meshing is a time consuming process that can easily account for over 50% of the total effort involved in completing the analysis. It requires modifying the CAD model to delete small parts such as drill holes to avoid an excessively fine mesh which increases simulation run time while at the same time reducing the quality of results due to an increased numerical noise arising from fewer particles striking the small triangles. The code will utilize the existing open source CAD library OpenCASCADE to directly operate on STEP files. The CAD library will be used to load the geometry and to replace the line-triangle intersection checks used for testing surface impact in particle tracing codes with a line-CAD check. This approach retains the analytical description of the surface geometry preventing feature loss due to tessellation. It also simplifies introducing dynamic behavior since the CAD components can be transformed or translated through parametric equations. Objective of the Phase I effort is to complete the feasibility study by developing a standalone code that can simulate motion of particles around a CAD-defined geometry. We also investigate schemes for storing surface data using options such as point clouds or face splitting. Timing of this direct method will be compared to the legacy approach based on a triangular surface mesh. We also investigate approaches for utilizing surface charge to compute the spatial variation of electric fields to simulate charged particle transport which may arise when analyzing lunar regolith or electrostatic return. This study will naturally lead to a Phase II effort during which the developed algorithms will be further developed into an end-user contamination analysis code.,"The mesh-free CAD based approach lets NASA contamination control engineers analyze redistribution of molecular, particulate, or biological contaminants in complex dynamic systems such instrument signal pathways, sample return enclosure seals, or drills without needing to perform the time consuming meshing that also leads to a loss of detail and divergence from models used by the mechanical team. It will simplify modeling of contamination transport during spacecraft deployment, during servicing operations, or during landing and re-entry.","The NASA CC applications extend to the wide aerospace industry, as contractors tend to follow the same set of requirements.

This instrument will be created to autonomously isolate and concentrate amino acids and fatty acids from samples delivered to the instrument. These chemical species have long been chemical targets of NASA missions and may be indicative of life. More specifically, ARIEL is a sample processing instrument that will extract ions, amino acids, fatty acids and non -polar organic molecules from either solid, liquid, or mixed samples. The ARIEL sample chamber will be equipped with an ultrasonic horn which not only increases the extraction efficiency of the target analytes, but also lyses any cellular material, thus making it available for further characterization. ARIEL will autonomously carry out a pair of sequential extractions, the first of which removes ions, amino acids and small fatty acids. The second extraction dissolves medium and long chain fatty acids as well as any non-polar organic compounds present in the sample. ARIEL’s fluidic system will send the first extraction solution to a processing channel equipped with a solid phase extraction (SPE) column that will specifically isolate amino acids and short chain fatty acids. Any other ions in solution will pass through the column. The second extraction solution will be sent to a separate channel containing an SPE column designed to remove medium and long chain fatty acids while other non-polar organic species pass through the second column. Once the target analytes are isolated on two separate SPE columns they can be washed, eluted with a minimum volume of solvents, and delivered to ARIEL’s two separate outputs. These outputs can be designed to interface with derivatization systems and analytical instrumentation used by NASA such as GCMS, LCMS or LDMS.","NASA is interested in detecting low concentrations of amino acids and fatty acids since they are indicative of life under the appropriate conditions. AREIL uses UAE to efficiently remove amino acids and all fatty acids (including short chain species) from either solid or liquid samples. The de-salted, concentrated analytes are concentrated on solid phase extraction materials at low temperatures and autonomously delivered to on board analytical instruments for characterization.","Non-NASA uses of ARIEL include the processing of difficult to handle samples such as soils, minerals or food stuffs which can be either wet or dry solids. ARIEL can also process mixed (solid and liquid) samples such as dairy samples.

This will allow for initial diagnostic testing of areas on small bodies, such as comet nuclei, to determine where larger cores should be collected and returned to Earth. Depth resolved measurements will be more indicative of volatiles trapped within the material that might vaporize off the surface during collection and avoids contamination that can occur at the surface.

The system will contain a Plume Capture and Delivery System (PCDS) which transports plume molecules  to the CAS to be analyzed for 13C/12C carbon and D/H hydrogen isotope ratios. Although Enceladus’s plume is thought to have created Saturn’s E-ring, the plume particles are expected to be sparse at flythrough altitudes. With a very small sample, the CAS produces high-precision measurements, making it ideal for a plume flythrough. This proposed effort will design a PCDS and develop the CAS further to strengthen the D/H analysis with the constraints of relatively low-abundance of deuterated methane, along with the need to also measure 13C/12C isotopes jointly. The proposed measurements in an Enceladus plume flythrough would answer crucial questions about Enceladus’s methane origin, giving insight into the possibility of life on Enceladus.","Ocean worlds discovered pose an exciting possibility of finding habitable regions, and more information must be learned. The CAS   is a novel technology that analyzes small sample amounts to produce high precision data. This is imperative when traveling to a new planet/moon, where the flythrough environment is uncertain. The CAS can take measurements to guide future knowledge and missions with insight into the possibility of life on Enceladus. This technology is being proposed for Enceladus, however, could be extended for other worlds as well.","By expanding the CAS capability to measure D/H ratios in methane, the technology will be attractive for a range of greenhouse gas and environmental sensing applications. In addition, there are energy related applications for the technology, specifically by enabling the improved analysis and characterization of underground geothermal sources and undersea hydrothermal seeps."

Ocean worlds, bodies that contain liquid oceans, contain many of the key ingredients thought to be necessary for life. Ocean worlds such as Jupiter’s moon Europa and Saturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus, are all ocean worlds that are considered prospects for harboring life. NASA is currently funding efforts to develop technologies capable of detecting molecular signatures of life. Giner proposes to assist in these efforts with the invention of a life detection instrument called the Biosignature Life Chip. This instrument utilizes an antibody microarray with antibodies specific to conserved molecular markers that are widely represented in life on Earth. This approach is compatible with NASA’s definition of life, which seeks organisms capable of evolution. Such organisms will likely have similar molecular features including proteins encoded by DNA and cell membranes which encapsulate organelles. Although similar microarray life detection instruments have been proposed, Giner’s Biosignature Detection Chip is unique in that it utilizes surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for detection rather than fluorescent detection with labeled secondary antibodies. This allows for a simplified instrument which carriers fewer reagents and buffers and utilizes fewer steps than other similar devices. Giner’s Phase I efforts will be directed toward achieving TLR3 by developing an SPR assay capable of selective and specific detection of target antigens. With the completion of Phase I, we will report on the performance of the antibody microarray including sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity for each antibody in the array. Phase II efforts will expand the number of evaluated antibodies and will include the development of a prototype SPR device.","NASA has several programs that utilize protein or nucleic acid microarrays for commercial applications. Examples include a protein microarray to monitor bioreactor bioproducts, a portable sensor for the measurement of trace toxic metals in water, and the monitoring of microbes in a spacecraft environment. While the microbe monitoring project utilizes mass spectrometry to detect ribosomal RNA, we believe that Giner’s Biosignature Detection Chip can be potentially be repurposed to detect bacteria in sterile environments.","Giner’s Biosignature Detection Chip is designed to be specific for conserved markers of life. However, a portable SPR sensor instrument can potentially be employed for commercial applications including monitoring of water for contaminants including microbes and toxins, as well as biomedical monitoring of markers of disease."

Advancements that address battery operation at extreme temperatures, combined with high specific energy and energy density are critically needed. Conventional rechargeable Li-ion cells operate within a narrow temperature range of -20 to 40 ºC, and they particularly suffer from capacity loss at lower temperatures. Improved batteries that minimize the need for strict thermal management, which adds mass to the spacecraft, are critically needed. The solution to making rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that operate in extreme temperature environments is to develop a solid electrolyte that does not suffer from poor solid-solid lithium conductivity. New materials and methods for tailoring these solid-solid interfaces are needed. It is also critical to combine this modified solid electrolyte with high voltage cathodes and stable anodes to produce the high energy density batteries that NASA needs. In this project TDA Research will develop surface modified solid electrolytes and surface modified electrodes that combine to make high voltage lithium rechargeable batteries suitable for the Lunar environment.","The targeted NASA application is for energy storage (batteries) that do not require excessive thermal management on the Lunar surface. NASA has specifically identified this need, and it is the primary target application. Similarly, extreme temperature tolerant batteries would serve NASA for additional missions (Mars, Titan, etc.).","There is an immense dual-use commercial market for solid batteries on Earth. Electric vehicles, electric aircraft and numerous other energy storage applications would greatly benefit from being able to work below -40 ºC, and safety would be greatly enhanced by solid-electrolyte batteries that were not flammable and could survive temperatures above 100 ºC (for example, vehicle fires)."

These hot and cold lunar conditions can last several Earth days, because of the slow rotation of the Moon, or permanently in shadowed craters and poses the significant challenges to small, low-power (~100 W or less) payloads, rovers, and landers required for lunar science, and survivability of the rovers electrical power subsystems during lunar day/night becomes a critical issue. As such, one strong technology candidate for meeting future lunar electrical storage thermal management needs are ThermoElectric Coolers (TECs) which are a well-established technology (> $1.1B market in 2021). TECs are solid-state, lightweight, have no moving parts or working fluids, and operate with highly reliable, uninterrupted, low maintenance, and environmentally-friendly cooling. Toward this goal, Nanohmics team proposes to develop a TEC system suitable for lunar electric power subsystems cooling during lunar day, and high-efficiency heating during the lunar night. The proposed Thermoelectric Temperature Regulation Unit (ThermoTruTM) will employ modular printed circuit boards (PCBs) based TEC devices that can be configured to meet thermal power dissipation shortcomings to address the lunar day cooling needs (radiator T = 30 – 35 °C, ∆T > 15 °C, 10 – 100 W of heat lift) and lunar night heating needs (electronics at > -20°C, ∆T to radiator > 20 °C, and radiator T ~ -50 °C) for small rover EPS survivability. A lunar night heating subsystem for small rovers currently does not exist. Using the combined benefits of compact cooling (day) and efficient heating (night) in a single, all-passive (i.e. no mechanical thermal switch) has numerous benefits for lunar rover and other lunar surface systems.","The proposed work will develop high efficiency thermoelectric convertor (TEC) systems which will increase the survivability of lunar rovers’ battery storage during day/nighttime by cooling/heating operations and extend the NASA mission times. These modular and conformal TECs can be used in many NASA missions, which require localized cooling/heating needs. Furthermore, the highly efficient TEC designs will also enable to use thermoelectric technology for many other space cooling and power generation missions.","Efficient TECs provide a means to meet next generation smart cooling needs which can reduce the CO2 and greenhouse gases emission compared to competitive cooling systems. These mass-marketable TECs can replace most multistage TECs and compression-based systems in other applications such as automotive, defense, biomedical, and waste heat recovery markets which are worth more than a billion dollars."

In Phase I we will optimize and develop a scalable electrophoretic deposition approach to apply tunable erosion resistant and highly emissive passive coatings consisting of mixtures of low work function material and hard/conductive boron doped diamond materials. The coating properties will further be tuned according to the technical constraints and needs specific to the locations of interest on the spacecraft that require high emissivity and erosion resistant coatings, which will be identified in the beginning of Phase I. The coating development activities will be guided by an evaluation of the electron-emitting properties of the coating before and after Xenon ion sputtering, across a broad range of energies, and identify first and second crossover energies, maximum yields, and energies of maximum yields. Finally, we will estimate the feasibility of transitioning this technology to pertinent spacecraft components of interest to NASA and our Phase II commercialization partners. In Phase II, Faraday, USU, and commercial partners will apply the optimized coatings to testable components and expose them to simulated launch conditions, space weather, ionospheric charging, and ion sputtering erosion and deliver a prototype to NASA. Success in meeting these criteria will provide technical/economic validation and accelerate transition toward establishing commercial adoption of the technology to meet NASA and other commercial applications within Phase III.","This next generation space weather mitigation technology will enable the local and selective application of autonomously emitting, erosion resistant coatings onto spacecraft components and improve their resilience to space weather events.

This response to SBIR Topic  S14.01 Space Weather R2O/O2R Technology Development  addresses one of four areas identified for priority development:  Space weather forecasting technologies, techniques and applications.  Specifically, exploring transition of tools, models, data and knowledge from research to operational environments–including preparation and validation of an existing science model that may be suitable for transition to operational use.  The main innovation of the new model is the ability to provide uncertainty estimates in addition to the computation of satellite drag.  Satellites are affected by the variability in density and motion of the near-Earth space environment. Drastic changes in the thermosphere’s neutral density, due to geomagnetic storms or other phenomena, result in perturbations of LEO satellite motions through drag on satellite surfaces that can lead to difficulties locating important satellites, temporarily losing track of satellites, and errors in predicting collisions in space. To meet increasing needs of upper atmospheric and space weather conjunction analysis and debris tracking requires improved satellite-drag nowcasts and forecasts in the 150-2000 km altitude region. Orion Space Solutions’ aerodynamic drag-forecast tool, “Dragster,” addresses those needs with well-validated, full-physics atmospheric models and ensemble data assimilation techniques.","NASA’s current operational satellite drag needs are the responsibility of CARA, which provides NASA asset protection and mission support in collaboration with the US Space Force 18 SPCS. Dragster benefits NASA via CARA by outperforming the current operational model, and reducing risk. The Project would benefit NASA’s CCMC for research purposes, and CCMC will help with metrics analysis.","The $400B space economy will be $1T by 2032. The Kessler Effect could result in the closure of a $1T industry.  Dragster errors are smaller, and error bars are realistic, therefore spacecraft can fly closer together because the threat of collisions is reduced.

These improved geomagnetic cutoff modeling timelines will be compared to geomagnetic cutoff measurements for a selected Solar Particle Event (SPE). This proposal is submitted to the Space Weather Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) Technology Development subtopic and will provide key research that can be used to improve future geomagnetic cutoff models.

Equatorial spread-F (ESF), is mainly found within 20° of the magnetic equator and occurs at night. ESF frequently occurs when the eastward electric field is large, and when trans-equatorial neutral winds are small. ESF onset driven primarily by the electric field and on the neutral winds stems from the importance of these terms in the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which drives the ESF phenomenon Sultan, [1996].  While Gravity waves may seed perturbations that set off an instability, Fritts et al. [2009] demonstrated that F-region eastward neutral winds at sunset play the dominant role in triggering ESF.

Membranes are attractive for spacecraft use because they require less power, fewer components, and less infrastructure volume than alternative methods, with no consumable mass, noise, or safety hazards. In support of NASA’s priorities for space plant biology and space habitation system development, PHILM™ provides precise and timely CO2 control for plant growth chambers that is reliable, safe, compact, and energy efficient. PHILM™ can operate in microgravity and reduced gravity, advancing space plant biology research and space agriculture capabilities in space stations, transit vehicles, and surface habitats. PHILM™ is also readily transferrable to terrestrial botanical research and agriculture (plant growth chambers, greenhouses, and indoor farms). With PHILM™, indoor farmers can enrich greenhouse CO2 for increased crop yield, by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, a safer and more sustainable alternative. This Phase I project will establish feasibility and demonstrate proof of concept for supported ionic liquid membranes to maintain target CO2 concentrations in spacecraft plant growth chambers utilizing cabin air. The team will analyze a baseline system architecture, develop a breadboard prototype, and conduct experiments to validate performance predictions over expected operating conditions.","PHILM™ provides precise CO2 control for plant growth chambers in microgravity and reduced gravity applications advancing space plant biology research and space agriculture capabilities in space stations, transit vehicles, and surface habitats.

High frequency, accurate, in-situ data is currently not available however, as state-of-the-art elemental monitoring involves taking samples from these systems, returning them to Earth, and performing high sensitivity analysis in the laboratory. As these procedures are costly in terms of time and money, new technologies must be developed to enable in-situ, on-demand elemental analysis of liquids to support the rapid development of plant research in space.

(ACT) proposes to develop a TRAP (Thermo-Radiative Assisted Photovoltaic) Cell technology to simultaneously harvest the incoming solar and outgoing thermal radiation in a single integrated device, with goals to achieve total efficiency >35% in the near-term (~2 years) and > 45% in the mid- to far-term (5-10 years). ACT’s TRAP Cell leverages the “dark” photovoltaic (i.e., thermo-radiative (TR) cell) technology that ACT has developed in two previous successful NASA SBIR programs. A TR cell can be viewed as the reverse mode of a PV cell. In a PV cell, the electrical power generation can be viewed as a result of the imbalance of incoming radiation from the sun and outgoing radiation from the PV cell. Conversely, the electrical power generation in the TR cell is a result of imbalance of the outgoing thermal radiation and negligible incoming radiation (from deep space), which creates a charge carrier motion resulting in electric power generation. Our proposed TRAP Cell will consist of three layers: a conventional space photovoltaic cell as the top layer, a mid-infrared transparent solar absorber as the middle layer, and a “dark” photovoltaic cell as the bottom layer. When producing electrical power, the conventional PV cell needs to face the sun, while the “dark” photovoltaic cell needs to face the ultra-cold deep space. To address the challenges when combining them together, we introduce a mid-infrared transparent solar absorber layer (e.g., undoped germanium layer) between the solar cell and the “dark” photovoltaic cell. Due to the mid-infrared transparent nature of the solar cell (top layer) and solar absorber (middle layer), the bottom thermo-radiative cell layer is only radiatively coupled to the ultra-cold deep space, while the top and middle layers will utilize the entire solar spectrum by either generating electricity directly or converting unused solar radiation into heat to provide thermal energy for the bottom layer","One application is to produce more electrical power during the lunar day due to the enhanced system efficiency, while also continuously generate electrical power by the thermo-radiative cell part using the waste heat during the lunar night. This enhances and extends the performance for lunar missions. Another potential application is attaching TR cells to the radiators of RPS to significantly increase the electrical power output and boost the overall system efficiency of many deep space missions","Our TRAP Cell technology could be used as the residential solar panels in the future. In the daytime, the panel could produce much more electrical power than that produced by conventional solar panel alone. In the nighttime, the bottom TR cell layer can still produce electrical power. Therefore, our system could continuously generate electricity for residential use throughout the day and night"

At present UT-Si cells manufactured by Regher Solar have a 22% Beginning-of-Life (BOL) efficiency, which is exactly in between Copper-Indium-Gallium-Selenide (CIGS) and Epitaxial Lift Off Inverted Metamorphic (ELO-IMM) thin film solar cells that are currently considered for making flexible solar blankets. However, the End-of-Life (EOL) efficiency of UT-Si cells drops minimally when exposed to space radiation making them more attractive for the use in space since radiation damage is mitigated. This was shown in our recent NASA SBIR project. By further improving the efficiency, UT-Si cells can achieve EOL efficiency significantly higher than ELO-IMM cells while being as inexpensive as CIGS cells making them the optimal choice for flexible solar arrays. The main proposed innovations include: (1) Develop polymer nanocomposite coatings impregnated with the nanoparticles of fluorides doped with rare earth ions to improve the conversion efficiency of the solar cell; (2) Enable radiation the coating be radiation tolerant by optimizing its composition and thickness; (3) Develop a low-cost and manufacturable process of coating to replace cover glass for space solar blankets and panels; and (4) Qualification testing of CICs and mini-blankets with LUVCON coating. Phase II will demonstrate feasibility of the proposed innovations at the scale of the blanket and conduct comprehensive electron and proton irradiation testing. We will collaborate with blanket manufacturers to package UT-Si solar cells in CICs and blankets and conduct complete qualification to achieve TRL 6.","UT-Si solar cells with improved efficiency can be integrated into novel flexible solar array deployment systems to meet NASA solar array specific power (250 W/kg) and stowed volume efficiency (50 kW/m3) goals. UT-Si solar cells have a potential to meet NASA goals for the long-term operation in high radiation environment (1 MeV 6e15 e/cm2). Together this will make UT-Si solar cell technology an ideal choice for several NASA projects including LISA solar array, Vertical Lunar Solar Arrays and large-scale solar arrays for Solar Electric Propulsion",The main advantage of improved UT-Si technology is compatibility with high volume manufacturing and low cost. Production of improved UT-Si solar cells can be quickly scaled up to 100 MW/year to meet the demand of growing space industry. The example applications include satellite mega constellations and space based solar power that will need tens of MW of affordable space-stable solar cells.

The device is based on two correlated frequency combs of the same repetition rate, generated in a single laser cavity. Because of this correlation, while the bandwidth of a tooth of each comb is in the Megahertz range, the bandwidth of the interference is less than 0.1 Hertz. Dispersion control of the circulating laser pulses leads to a further increase in sensitivity of this intracavity phase interferometer. In addition to the boost in sensitivity, we will reduce the noise. The classical noise limit will be reached by classical means like a high repetition rate of the measurement and additional control loops. Applying the technique of squeezed light will then be used to approach the fundamental limit of sensitivity.

This proposal accounts for an active spacecraft, namely deputy, approaching a chief spacecraft in close-range rendezvous and in proximity autonomously, and simultaneously. A key enabling technology in these missions is autonomous rendezvous and capturing that requires precise position and attitude control. Two main innovations relative to the current state of the art are proposed: robust adaptive unscented Kalman filters using multiple sensors, and fault-tolerant finite-time pose control algorithms deployed via on-orbit flight software. SCOUT is building fault-tolerant and robust 6-degree-of-freedom finite-time controllers to conduct proximity operations with faster, more accurate tracking performance and more efficient control energy consumption than the conventional controllers in the presence of actuator faults, parametric uncertainties of the system, and unknown external disturbances. Developing autonomous relative navigation systems for rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking will yield persistent, robust and precise pose (position and attitude) state estimations remotely. For close-range rendezvous, absolute and relative GPS navigations using GPS C/A code measurements will be developed while star-trackers and Inertia-Measurement Units (IMUs) are used for relative attitude estimations between the chief and the deputy spacecraft. SCOUT shall build real-time orbit determination systems for absolute GPS navigation using onboard GPS C/A code measurements, which can be used for supporting  autonomous navigation.","This effort will yield advancements in autonomous, resilient space system operations across a wide range of NASA applications necessitating distributed, persistent multi-satellite operations. Navigation does not commonly implement dynamic control for changing conditions, momentum, and maneuvers. RPO and science mission planning is time-consuming and scheduling-intensive with lacking real-time data; proximity operations are highly prone to abort maneuvers due to state measurement deviation or false-positive conjunction data messages.","Persistent, proactive tracking and state estimation, including during maneuvers, will facilitate rendezvous and proximity maneuvers. Orbital servicing and logistics end-users lack closed-loop, persistent, robust control for rendezvous and proximity operations: this has led to SCOUT’s on-board navigation capabilities being adopted by Orbit Fab, Momentus, and potential commercial and Defense users."

The accuracy of these models has direct implications to the uncertainty of warnings and limitations for volcanic ash hazards, pollution alerts, severe storms, and wildfire smoke hazards. Improved data collection and model validation are two powerful ways to improve the accuracy of the models and the important safety systems they support.

The S2 has conducted many difficult deployments, but the proposed work will extend the capabilities to a much larger mission set. The redesign for severe weather will be extensive and include a new aerodynamic design and modifications for precipitation and icing. The long duration capability represents a dramatic shift in how UAS data gathering for Earth science is conducted. Essentially, the aircraft will be capable of autonomous landing and recharge of it's batteries through solar panels integrated into the wings.

NASA wishes to equip all future planetary missions with a MEDLI like EDL system.  Many planetary missions do not have the funding or project timeline to fly an EDL sensor suite similar to the MEDLI and MEDLI2.  Sigma-Netics will develop a low cost Data Acquisition System that can survive the rigors of space flight and be cost effective to fly on all planetary missions.  A fully qualified target cost of less than 1 million dollars is achievable by the innovative approach we are outlining.  By using hybrid technology to make a custom EDL “system on a chip” massive size and weight saving will be had.  In addition by utilizing MIL-PRF-38534 will maintain the ruggedness and reliability of the MEDLI & MEDLI2 SSE. Cabling makes up considerable mass in all data acquisition spacecraft systems. By going wireless the entire system size and mass is greatly reduced. This will allow for the agency’s desire to deliver larger payloads to planets. The SBIR has requested a module size of less than 10 cm3 with a max number of four modules. Sigma-Netics believes this achievable by integrating all of the signal conditioning and multiplexing into hybrid microcircuits specifically designed for EDL type applications. With our experience with MEDLI & MEDLI2 SSE the fundamental circuity would remain similar. The electrical system design and brass board prototypes will demonstrate that this new design meets and performs similar to MEDLI2 SSE with its measurement uncertainty. This will be fully demonstrated during phase one. Then we will begin the integration of that base design into hybrid microcircuit design. This way we keep the performance, but create our system on chip structure and the smallest EDL sensor support electronics ever built.","This technology would be especially relevant to upcoming Science Mission Directorate (SMD) planetary missions,such as DAVINCI and VERITAS, but low-cost data acquisition systems with these capabilities would also berelevant to the other science lines of business, especially for future cost and volume-constrained and distributed systemsmissions.","Aerojet Rocketdyne, Astrobotic, Astranis, Masten Space Systems, Collins Space Systems, AVS-UK, Busek, Curtis Wright Nuclear, and CERN provide Sigma-Netics real time market intel to availability and opportunity for a product solution like the one proposed here.

Most radiation robust mixed-signal integrated circuits utilize specific CMOS technologies and substrate strapping layout techniques to achieve high degrees of radiation robustness. In a mixed-signal IC, each of the transistors in the circuit play a specific role. The IC becomes dysfunctional after radiation exposure when the characteristics of one or more of the transistors changes and the affected transistors are no longer able to perform their intended role in the circuit at the intended level of performance. As a result, the circuit fails one or more specs. With autonomous ELA, each transistor may be isolated and tested during a calibration routine. If the transistor fails a designated test, its size (effective W/L) or bias condition can be modified until it is able to perform its intended role. By performing these calibrations during calibration periods and self-correcting the circuit as it is exposed to radiation, the resulting circuit can potentially function with a higher dose of radiation than otherwise possible without ELA. Architecture, choice of technology, and transistor layout structure are elements that have been studied and compared for radiation robustness. We are developing a new general approach that may be suitable for improving the radiation hardness using a number of architectures, can be applied to any CMOS technology, and can be better suited to conventional layout techniques due to the higher density achievable as compared with ELT transistors. In the solicitation, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), charge-sensitive amplifiers, and readout integrated circuits for photomultipliers are identified as demonstration vehicles. In this proposal, we gear our description to ADCs but the concepts may be applied to other analog circuit blocks called out in the solicitation.","Our new method of ELA will be able to be applied to any analog or mixed-signal IC resulting in improved radiation hardness for a wide variety of applications required in space vehicles and their payloads.  Our approach exploits the ease with which basic microprocessors can be implemented on ICs providing control, and the high transistor density allowed in even non-leading edge CMOS technologies.",Our new method of ELA will be able to be applied to any analog or mixed-signal IC resulting in improved radiation hardness for the large number of applications and environments where radiation-tolerant and/or radiation-resistant analog or mixed-signal ICs are required.

Our proposed solution brings together engineered nano-scale waveguides, precision laser stabilization techniques, and advanced photonic packaging to realize true chip-integrated comb sources for demanding terrestrial and space-based applications in timing, spectroscopy, and quantum sensing. The project will translate directly into a commercial device that will provide a stabilized broadband frequency-comb output with low size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. Frequency combs are extremely stable multi-wavelength laser systems that provide a coherent link between the optical and microwave domains. Octave-spanning combs are essential for modern atomic timekeeping, where the comb is required to read out an optical atomic clock laser. The current state-of-the-art in compact frequency combs are fiber-based mode-locked lasers. While such systems have been instrumental in starting the transition of frequency combs outside of the laboratory, the SWaP requirements are still incompatible with many uses, especially space-based applications. In contrast, microcombs offer a path towards reducing the SWaP of these systems by an order of magnitude, opening possibilities for the integration of combs into hand-held devices and low-power spacecraft. The proposed KOMODO platform represents a new paradigm for fully stabilized microresonator frequency combs with low SWaP. We will achieve this by improving the TRL of four key technologies in this program: 1) turn-key comb generation with hybrid-integrated pump lasers, 2) advanced dispersion control through engineered photonic-crystal ring resonators, 3) self-referenced microcomb stabilization, and 4) environmentally robust photonic packaging.","The development of octave-spanning microcombs addresses needs for stable and broadband frequency references with low size, weight, and power in NASA focus areas including precision timing, navigation, geodesy, LiDAR, atmospheric spectroscopy, and precision-radial-velocity measurements.

Interviews with members of the spaceflight sector pinpointed several issues that Spaceline will address: (1) Spaceline will enable the rapid development of mission concept of operations, (2) Spaceline will provide a robust and flexible schema allowing for the design and review of plans in multiple coordinate systems, and (3) Spaceline will greatly reduce the overhead to communicate complex mission plans among team members. The proposed innovations of Coverage and Access Analysis to Spaceline will provide increased utility across all three use cases. Early in the lifecycle of a mission, while the ConOps is still in development, users will execute the analysis tools to calculate a baseline efficacy of a mission plan to support their proposal efforts. This baseline can then be used as a reference point for comparison against more complicated plans.","Our proposed addition of coverage and access analysis in the Spaceline ecosystem will directly facilitate NASA in their goal of developing Mission Design Analysis tools to increase the accuracy of science modeling and enable design of future observing systems by predicting and optimizing their impacts on science data collection. By allowing users to experiment with observation designs earlier in the design cycle of a mission, teams have the opportunity to develop a more advanced ConOps, supporting mission success.",Spaceline would support commercial Earth orbiting constellations as well as Space Situational Awareness applications. Spaceline can test the efficacy of constellation-based sensors which monitor the activities of other spacecraft and provide a training tool for operations team members. The visualization portions of Spaceline will be easy to insert into third-party web sites or museum kiosks.

The Innovation Foundry has been doing “digital engineering” for many years and well before that term became prevalent. In these facilities, the pace required to conceptualize, model, simulate, and analyze complex space systems for early-stage work has led to the development of custom tools analogous to those that are now being deployed across entire organizations to support full-lifecycle digital engineering. This leads to challenging decisions regarding whether to transition to broader and newer tools or to stay with heritage tools for which there may be a viable commercial or open-source alternative. A flexible, scalable interfacing mechanism between existing internal infrastructure and new digital engineering technologies is required to enable the combination of these capabilities and graceful evolution of JPL’s concurrent engineering environment. The Open Model-Based Engineering Environment (OpenMBEE) is an open-source collaborative engineering system. Integration of the existing JPL concurrent engineering infrastructure with OpenMBEE will efficiently support this gradual evolution of the JPL concurrent engineering environment that is consistent with the state-of-the-art and positioned to keep up through community contributions. This integration will also enable connections to the Sedaro Satellite platform for unified spacecraft simulation - enabling more mature concepts through integrated, high-fidelity simulation and analysis.","The interfaces developed through this effort will enable the JPL concurrent engineering environment to efficiently leverage new and emerging digital engineering software technologies. This will improve their ability to deliver mature concepts that are less likely to change and cause cost and schedule overruns later in the project. In addition, this incorporation of OpenMBEE and Sedaro Satellite in the earliest stages of the project lifecycle will ""seed"" the digital thread with model information and simulation assets and ease phase transitions.","Modifications to Sedaro Satellite to support JPL missions will benefit other commercial and government customers developing innovative missions. In addition, the implementation of Sedaro Satellite at a leading organization like JPL will deliver value to commercial organizations using the platform by creating a uniquely high-fidelity mechanism for communication of their COTS capabilities with JPL."

There are recent trends to improve SE through the use of models to create model-based SE (MBSE) and connect FM to SE and operations. One such approach for performing a rigorous SE is the Goal-Function Tree (GFT) representation using Systems Modeling Language (SysML) that was developed at NASA JPL and MSFC. Despite their inherently close relationship to SE in practice, SHM/FM practices have remained disjoint and not tightly integrated with SE. Historically, SHM has been designed into the system only after the nominal system is designed, which essentially makes it a band-aid of the problems without consideration of how these might have been prevented or mitigated. Between SE and SHM/FM, separate sets of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), knowledge repositories, modeling methodologies and analyses processes with non-relatable results are typical. This lends itself to a large technology and knowledge gap between the two sets of practices that result in significant inefficiencies throughout the life cycle, from design through verification and validation (V&V) through operations. Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI) plans to integrate TEAMS® analytic capabilities with GFT to provide a multidisciplinary solution that connects an important SE approach with a tool that provides analytic capabilities for FM design and operations. It intends to integrate SHM/FM directly within SE from the beginning of a project, thereby suitable for FM of future spacecraft. This effort: (1) performs FM design analysis of a system design modeled in GFT, (2) enables FM design to be evaluated in an operational context by performing SHM functions, (3) supports Trade Studies to evaluate merits of FM architecture; and (4) enables “System” level assessment and visualization of FM qualities modeled in GFT.","QSI's technology will enable NASA to better plan and execute future Space Missions. It's applications include verification testing of NASA’s next generation launch vehicle such as the SLS, cis-lunar infrastructure including the Gateway and deep space human exploration such as the Habitat. Exploration Upper Stage is also a target. TheGateway spacecraft has vehicle models, which can be integrated in the MBSE environment and evaluated against FM robustness. Europa is a candidate for demonstrating FM capabilities within GFT driven MBSE practices.","The technology can be applied to DoD’s Mission planning and Rapid design of space missions / satellites including Geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), Medium earth orbit (MEO), and Low earth orbit (LEO), commercial space launch vehicles (e.g., SpaceX), NORAD, Space Command ground segments, JSF, Navy shipboard platforms, submarines, BMD systems, UAVs, UGVs and unmanned submersible vehicle markets."

(QSI) in collaboration with Dr. Stephen B. Johnson of Dependable Systems Technologies (DST) proposes a novel, causal-model based systematic methodology for assessing damage propagation due to one or multiple originating faults and how the propagation affects and damages other components. In fault propagation, downstream components from the root-cause fault which rely on its function, may also fail. When the root cause is mitigated, those downstream components resume their normal operating behavior. During damage propagation, the originating fault’s damage, leads to the failure effects in which physical damage to downstream components is a consequence, such that those components can no longer function nominally. Even if the originating fault recovers or is replaced or bypassed, the downstream damaged components do not recover and continue to remain in a failed state.   This proposal aims to create new capabilities for QSI’s TEAMS® tool suite to represent the differences between components in which failure effects ‘pass through’ or cause only functional impairment versus those that can cause physical damage. During TEAMS® model design, this new capability will enable the modeler to represent the activation of a downstream component failure mode when a specific failure effect (a TEAMS® ‘function’) arrives at the component. This will signify that though the failure effects begin with a single fault (cause, failure mode), a second fault will now exist in the relevant downstream component so that if the first fault is removed the second fault will remain unless another repair is made. During operations when TEAMS® is used to perform diagnosis, TEAMS® will alert operators that a second independent fault may exist as a consequence of the effects of the first fault. The impact of this new capability on the TEAMS® fault management metrics modeling and generation capability will be explored during the course of the SBIR project.","The proposed technology is aimed at facilitating effective usage of model-based systems engineering for improving fault tolerance and mitigation response capability during design, and the concomitant software tool for supporting its implementation, will allow NASA to better design, plan and execute future Space Missions. The proposed technology is positioned for direct applications for NASA missions that deploy complex equipment such as the Lunar Gateway, the Space Launch System, the Human Lander, Europa Clipper and rovers such as the VIPER.",We envisage the proposed technology to be of significant interest for DoD’s Mission planning and Rapid design of space missions/satellites where model-based design processes will be used for supporting infrastructure Space services capabilities.

FM solutions are an important enabler of autonomous operation.  They help reduce operations costs by reducing the number of required monitoring personnel and help increase the chances of success by ensuring a rapid response to faults. NASA’s science program has over 100 spacecraft in operation or development.  Many of these platforms are autonomous, or uncrewed, and many other agencies (both government and commercial) around the world are launching spacecraft of their own.  The industry for autonomous vehicles is growing rapidly and expected to transform all aspects of travel on the ground, in the air, and in space.  FM technologies are necessary to keep people safe and to keep things running. The design process needs to integrate FM concepts from the beginning, and we plan to develop a proof-of-concept tool that makes this easier.  Our plan is to replicate an analogous spacecraft power system on a real-world test stand and develop the tools and capability to model and simulate this test stand with various fault conditions.  We will use this ability to determine the ideal design to achieve FM objectives, then build a real-world version of the FM system and test it in the real-world power test stand. This approach ties a modelling and simulation capability to a real-world system, which allows us to assess performance of the approach.  We will leverage existing tools and capabilities where possible, and add new features where required.  Broad simulation testing and intelligent design automation will simplify and accelerate the design process ensuring that engineers can create more reliable and fault tolerant systems in less time than before.","NASA can incorporate this toolset and capability into the design of all the crewed and uncrewed systems they are developing.  It will provide value in reduced operations costs for the uncrewed systems, and it will provide reliability and safety improvements for crewed systems.  This means the crew can spend less time monitoring and maintaining the vehicle and more time focusing on exploration and ground-breaking science.  Sudden unexpected failures shouldn’t leave people stranded and FM technologies can help get them home.",The toolset and capability to seamlessly integrate FM technologies is important for designers of autonomous vehicles in both the defense and commercial industries.  The fast-growing market for self-driving cars provides a fantastic opportunity to roll out these technologies on a large-scale and demonstrate improved vehicle robustness and reliability.

Data assimilation is an advanced statistical method for preparing relatively low-resolution, high-fidelity sensor information for these NWP models. This method produces a first-guess field that serves as an estimation of the current state of the atmosphere in operational NWP models, which ultimately produce weather forecasts that are essential tools for forecasters. Despite many advances in the field, shortcomings are still very apparent and NWP models still have prediction issues with common weather occurrences, including those that produce extreme weather. The very large data volumes and computational expense of imperfect data assimilation requires unique solutions to improve NWP predictions. With the advance of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), along with other techniques for processing large volumes of data, the possibilities for improving data assimilation are numerous. This proposed effort will take advantage of recent advances in AI/ML in order to generate better initial conditions for NWP models, which will contribute to improved forecasts of extreme events. This effort will begin by gathering large amounts of data prior to and during major winter weather events to create training datasets for proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reconstruction which will provide an AI/ML approximation of the natural state based on the data collected. We plan to run NWP models using both traditional data assimilation and with POD dynamic modeling for winter cyclones. The new AI/ML technique should present new approaches for future NASA model development and NASA computational groups.","The proposed research will leverage AI/ML advances as a method to improve data assimilation in Earth systems models, specifically weather models. This work has broad applications for developing NASA climate and weather models, along with applications to the development of the NOAA Unified Forecast System, which will be the state of the science over the next decade. This work has broad applications for several NASA groups, including GMAO, ESTO/AIST, CISTO, and NCCS.","Numerous scientific organizations, national laboratories, and universities are aiming to bring together AI/ML talent with atmospheric and climate scientists, and this work is one effort that could provide proof-of-concept. The development of the UFS by NOAA would also benefit from improvements in data assimilation as they continue to develop state of the art tools for Earth systems prediction."

Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs), which track cloud/water vapor movement and assign a height, provide key passively sensed initial condition information for numerical weather prediction. However, data produced by current operational AMV algorithms are sparsely available and contain high uncertainties in the vertical direction. Comparison with radiosonde profiles indicates that AMV height assignment errors comprise 70% of uncertainty. Our work aims to fill EOS gaps by learning a mapping between high-temporal resolution GOES-16/17 geostationary satellites operated by NOAA/NASA and radiosonde observations. We use our WindFlow model that applies deep learning based optical flow techniques to track clouds and water vapor in sequences of geostationary images to produce direction and speed data. WindFlow provides an efficient approach to generate dense and accurate wind vectors. Outputs of WindFlow, paired with thermal infrared imagery, provides information content to directly predict wind speed, humidity, and temperature at varying pressure levels. This proposal aims to generate a 3D atmospheric product from geostationary satellites validated against radiosondes and lidar observations.","Applications of 3D atmospheric winds are numerous throughout NASA Earth science research and development. Assimilation of our data with systems operated at the NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) has the potential to improve analysis and forecast products, including short-term and sub-seasonal.  Dense atmospheric winds will also have implications to wildfire monitoring and subsequent air quality issues.","Commercially the developed technology has applications to aviation, renewable energy, finance/insurance, and forecasting. In aviation, surface level and atmospheric winds have great economic value to airlines in terms of safety and potential operating cost savings.  Renewable energy markets are largely powered by weather conditions and must be estimated for stable operation of the power grid."

The craters on the lunar poles are of particular interest as they are in permanent shadow and may harbor valuable resources such as water ice.  However, the shadowed craters present a challenge for power generation since conventional solar arrays cannot be used for energy collection on vehicles such as rovers.  Laser power beaming has been proposed as one method to power a rover directly from an energy source located at the rim of the crater, which could be a solar array or nuclear reactor (Figure 1).

However, the space environment has multiple radiation sources that interact with the SiC crystal and can damage the circuit. Studies show that when heavy ions impinge on an operating SiC power device, the device degradation may range from no discernable damage to increased leakage to catastrophic failure. In SiC MOSFET devices subjected to high-energy ion bombardment in the OFF-state, single-event burnout (SEB) and single-event gate rupture (SEGR) are two major failure types. Commercial SiC power devices have been observed to incur catastrophic failure at biases below 40% of their nominal blocking voltage, and irreversible degradation (SEGR) at biases well below 10% when exposed to ions with a Linear Energy Transfer (LETs) at 10 MeV-cm2/mg. Latent gate damage that precedes SEGR significantly limits the safe operation area of SiC MOSFETs for space applications. To avoid SEB failures, derating schemes are proposed like reducing the operating voltage to less than half its rated value. Similarly, to minimize SEGR, the operating voltage is reduced to less than one quarter of its rated value. Such de-rating penalty not only diminishes the SiC technology advantages of performance, cost and weight in space but may lead to costly field failures.

Gallium nitride (GaN) offers significant advantages over state-of-the-art silicon (Si) technologies for power electronic applications including higher breakdown voltage and power density, faster switching, and lower switching losses. High-voltage (HV) enhancement mode GaN-on-Sapphire multi-channel lateral Schottky barrier diode (SBD) technology has recently been demonstrated up to 10 kV breakdown voltage (BV), the highest in GaN devices till date. This GaN device technology is scalable for voltage.  Other commercial GaN power device technologies are known to show heavy-ion induced radiation susceptibility with leakage and catastrophic damage seen well below their rated voltages. A thorough investigation of the heavy-ion response of this emerging, HV GaN SBDs and underlying mechanisms is essential to developing radiation tolerant devices for space applications. We propose to use an integrated experimental and physics-based modeling approach to address this challenge. In Phase I, we will perform heavy-ion testing of the HV GaN SBDs to generate radiation response data. Detailed TCAD modeling of heavy-ion induced single-event effects (SEEs) will be performed for the SBD structures to investigate physical mechanisms driving the observed radiation response. In Phase II, we will perform additional heavy-ion and total dose testing as a function of temperature and bias. Extensive TCAD-based modeling will be performed to determine radiation and temperature-dependent physical mechanisms, and to investigate device design changes for improved radiation tolerance. Promising solutions will be prototyped and characterized via electrical and radiation testing. Participation by a commercial vendor of GaN devices in Phase II and beyond will ensure space qualified GaN power diodes.","Radiation tolerant, high voltage/high temperature GaN power electronics is an enabling technology for power management and distribution in spacecrafts and scientific instruments. It directly supports NASA goals for Lunar and Planetary Surface PMAD and the Kilopower program. It also benefits Remote Sensing Instruments and Sensors related to NASA Science and Exploration missions.

Unfortunately, the adoption of  SiC and GaN technology into space applications is hindered by their susceptibility to permanent degradation and catastrophic failure from single event effect heavy-ion exposure. This degradation occurs at <50% of the rated operating voltage, requiring the operation of SiC/GaN devices at de-rated voltages. Diamond is one of the candidate materials for the next-generation WBG semiconductor devices capable of overcoming the current limitations of SiC/GaN technology. In addition to having the highest breakdown field, it has the highest p-type conductivity, making it a unique p-channel material for power electronics applications. It also holds a solid hope to be hardened against single event burnout (SEB) due to its superior thermal conductivity and ability to maintain an excellent crystalline structure under heavy ion exposure. Euclid Beamlabs, in collaboration with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will develop a new quasi-lateral diamond power MOSFET  that will overcome current limitations by combining the inherent advantages of diamond material, SEB hardened transistor design with advanced 3D femtosecond laser writing capabilities of micrometer-scale conductive structure fabrication inside the diamond.

URFCs provide a more compact and lightweight version of RFCs where the system can be significantly simplified with elimination of several balance of plant systems.","The specific energy of URFCs can easily beat batteries for large energy storage requirements.

Currently used Li-ion batteries, while sufficient for short-term energy discharge cycles, are not optimal for the Moon’s 29.5 day diurnal period as their energy storage capacity scales linearly with system mass. Regenerative Fuel Cells (RFCs) offer an alternative method for storing electrical energy with more favorable scaling metrics, combining electrolyzers (split water into H2 and O2 gas in times of energy surplus) with fuel cells (generate energy during energy deficits by recombining gases into water). RFCs have a mass advantage over batteries for Lunar operations, with energy densities of 400 to 550 Wh/kg. PEM electrolyzers produce saturated gases which, if the temperature drops below dew point, may result in condensation that can freeze and damage fluidic connections in the system. Thus, any solution that incorporates RFCs requires a dedicated dehumidification subsystem. To meet this challenge, Lynntech proposes a two-stage water removal/reclamation system that involves traditional compression and phase separation, as well as cascading Metal Organic Framework (MOF) based desiccant beds with vacuum heated water reclamation/regeneration. Lynntech intends to design a system with 2 independent canisters with multiple in-series MOFs each for simultaneous absorption and regeneration. One MOF canister will dehydrate water while the other regenerates captured water to the H2O tank. These canisters then switch, resulting in continual gas dehydration and water regeneration throughout the operating cycle. Lynntech will team up with Framergy, experts in MOF development and optimization, to design this hybrid MOF-based approach to RFC dehumidification that exceeds NASA’s desired mass recovery rate to decrease overall system mass.","Lynntech’s development effort will enhance and expand the capabilities of RFCs in NASA application by optimizing system energy density while avoiding proportionally increasing system mass. Such advancements greatly increase the viability of long-term missions to asteroids, planets, moons, or any other operation that experiences cyclic exposure to sunlight. Additionally, improved RFCs may be used for life support during In Situ Resource Utilization operations, providing H2O or O2 for human consumption.","Long-term solar-powered flight may greatly benefit from lightweight solutions to increase efficiency in RFC systems.

How to design a flight like liquid/liquid detonation engine, and how to design an injector capable of handling the extreme temperature and pressure environments.","RDE’s have the inherent advantage of being theoretically more efficient than standard combustion engines. This is due to the detonation engine utilizing a Humphrey cycle over a Brayton cycle. A Humphrey cycle is a constant volume cycle, where a Brayton cycle is constant pressure.","In a perfect system and RDE has the potential to be about 15% more efficient than that of a constant pressure device.

Paragon seeks to refine and analyze process technology and architecture concepts to separate and handle lunar NWVs, along with processes to concentrate ammonia from the NWVs and generate useful products such as refrigerant, propellant, and fertilizer. This project, titled Ammonia and Volatiles Accumulation in Lunar Architectures for Non-Water Capabilities furthering Human Exploration (AVALANCHE), targets the capture, concentration, and utilization of ammonia as the primary NWV with the highest potential impact value to sustained human lunar surface operations and generation of a lunar resource economy. While ammonia is the primary target, the separation and handling of other NWVs, such as mercury, and solid precipitates resulting from the possible reactions of NWVs with one another, such as ammonium sulfite, is considered a vital part of this proposal. This proposal approaches the solution space from the In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) system architecture-level, which allows for the opportunity of evaluating technology and process concepts that would otherwise be non-viable as standalone solutions. Components and architectures will be simulated to evaluate their performance in a trade study that will allow assessment of the costs, risks mitigated, and value-added by various configurations. This, along with a feasibility study and down-selection, will result in design and experiment plans for resulting component(s) and architecture to be developed and demonstrated within Phase II of the AVALANCHE project. The top-down system analysis methodology and the potential benefits resulting from these concepts to other systems is enabled by Paragon’s unique position as an industry leader in ISRU technology.","The proposed technologies, processes, and architectures are applicable to the handling, separation, and concentration of NWV's and the processing of ammonia to value-added products on the Moon.

Based off of design concepts from previous SBIR awards, our cover technology is currently at TRL 2. The timing and urgency of providing flight-ready SCC covers may make it necessary for a two-stage approach to address this technology gap; providing first generation covers for the first few Artemis missions that are intended for EVAs over a single mission while developing a second generation cover that will be capable of use on repeated missions.  Using information provided by NASA, we will produce a mechanical mock-up of the SCC port in our lab to ensure timely and effective development of the cover and its operation.  Intermediate covers may be sent to NASA for evaluation using the xEMU depending on the design iteration timeline.  Recommendations and feedback from the xEMU team will be integrated into revised cover designs. We will also produce a retaining device to hold and protect the cover as well as keep it clean when it is not installed on the suit. If desired, this retaining device may be designed to be situated within the same location that the umbilical is stored in when not in use. This will provide a secure location away from the potential dust carried into the habitat during donning, doffing, or cleaning procedures.","This cover supports a current and urgent need for future NASA missions to protect the SCC ports from lunar regolith. Protecting these ports to enable recharging the xEMU will help ensure longer duration EVAs. The primary customer is the xEMU team as this is a custom cover designed to integrate into the current suit architecture. We will continue to explore additional application for a similar cover for protecting connectors on rovers and in habitats, ISRU plant interfaces, and control panels.","We anticipate that a similar type of cover on commercial rovers and landers will be needed that will create a follow-on market for this technology.  Economic benefits include increased lifespan of interconnecting systems, such as the xEMUs, rovers, and ISRU plants. The size of the commercial market for a similar product will be determined in later phases through market research."

Lunar dust fouling was a critical issue for Apollo spacesuits, causing abrasive wear that led to pressure leaks, impaired visibility, scratched gauges, and penetration into deeper layers. Dust mitigation was not an engineering design driver for the performance of the Apollo Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), because the number of extravehicular activities (EVAs) were limited. However, the future exploration EMU (xEMU) will have to remain usable for a much longer period, thereby necessitating more emphasis on dust mitigation. In particular, the Pressure Garment System and Portable Life Support System (PLSS) must be ready to withstand the elements, protecting not only the astronauts, but their own internal hardware from regolith migration and intrusion. Apollo missions’ human health effects included inhalation and irritation, which emphasize the importance of keeping astronauts safely isolated from dust. Paragon intends to develop Exploration Labyrinth Dust Seals (xLiDS) to improve astronaut safety and prolong equipment. For the xEMU PLSS (xPLSS), NASA has identified six components that will need gas flow to or from the surrounding ambient environment. Each component will require a specialized cover to prevent dust infiltration without impairing their flowrates. Without those covers, critical xPLSS functions could be disrupted, such as cooling, purge capabilities, and seal integrity . Paragon has developed a unique method of casting complex, labyrinth-like geometries that allow gas to flow while still preventing regolith migration into critical life support systems. xLiDS can be customized to fit the needs of every xPLSS port. Paragon’s extensive experience with spacesuit components, dust mitigation strategies, and rapid prototyping will quickly advance the desired mitigation technology through the iterative design and fabrication process.","The xLiDS concept is a customizable dust mitigation solution for any planetary surface technology. It protects mission equipment from being fouled or clogged by regolith dust, enabling sustained operations for lunar and Martian habitation. In addition to mitigating dust for the xEMU xPLSS, xLiDS technology can scale to larger infrastructure and/or mechanisms that have various degrees of regolith exposure and/or geometries. Custom xLiDS can handle varying types of flow for consumables, data, and/or power (ex: in-situ resource utilization).","xLiDS offers a versatile approach to mitigating dust issues for commercial companies that are interested in lunar surface infrastructure, including spacesuits, softgoods (ex: expandable habitats), and human-spacecraft-robotic interfaces. xLiDS could also apply to terrestrial industries like mining, construction, pharmaceutical, sandblasting, agricultural, and ruggedization of desert equipment."

JSC-1A lunar dust simulant used by NASA is highly magnetic (especially so for the small grain size fraction). Both experimental and theoretical studies on soils brought back by Apollo missions suggest that lunar minerals are even more magnetic than their terrestrial analogs and fine fractions of lunar regolith (below 30 µm) are virtually impossible to separate by magnetic means because all fine grains are attracted by magnets. The MDFS will employ either a permanent, electro- or electropermanent magnets used as an additional step of air filtration for small pressurized compartments to eliminate/minimize lunar dust transfer between compartments and to main cabin areas. Currently the airlock systems used on ISS have been decompression pump for removing air from airlocks (up to ~13 kPa) prior to EVA and it is proposed that airlocks are purged with air after the EVA and decompressed to allow the lunar dust particles tracked in to be captured by the magnetic air filter. The MFS functioning will require minimal or no power and will not require frequent replacements. In the proposed program, a full-scale working model of the MDFS will be built and tested at Pioneer Astronautics lab.","The MFS system is one of the key technologies for establishing human presence on the Moon for the Artemis program. Air filtration and clean breathing air are absolutely necessary for any manned mission, additionally it will protect interior surfaces of the spacecraft and many delicate components from harmful effects of harsh lunar dust.

NASA is seeking advances in the removal, management, and monitoring of airborne particulates and external dust to address the intrusion into and containment of lunar dust within the pressurized habitable volumes and compartments in crewed spacecraft systems. Under this SBIR project, Analytical Scientific Products is proposing the development of an efficient, compact, low-power, autonomous, low-maintenance, regenerable dust filtration and collection device for cabin air and airlock compartments during lunar missions. This filter takes in the dust laden gas from the target region, removes and collects the particles, and releases the clean gas back into the compartment. This device is unique because it is equally effective in filtering all dust particles irrespective of their origin (i.e., both lunar dust and cabin dust), it has no moving parts, and it imposes an extremely small pressure drop for fluid flow. The technology development will occur in three phases. In Phase I, we propose to perform numerical modeling to design the key components of the device, construct a breadboard device, and perform tests to demonstrate the effectiveness of this device in filtering and collecting dust particles. In Phase II, we will mature the technology through more detailed analysis and fabrication and testing of an alpha-prototype to fully characterize the performance before the construction of a beta-prototype that will be delivered to NASA. We will field test and commercialize the device in Phase III.",The primary intended application of the proposed technology is in the space industry where the deleterious effects of particulates are well known and can compromise the safety and functionality of various systems. It can be used to remove the dust particles and clean the air in spacecraft cabins and airlock compartments during the future missions to various planetary bodies including the moon and Mars.,"The proposed dust filtration and collection device can be used in any system that requires both separation and collection of particles from the carrier gas, is sensitive to pressure drops, and there is potential for exposure to hazardous particles/gases.

Apollo missions revealed surprising levels of dust in the near-surface lunar environment. This dust is implicated in fouling of joints and seals on equipment.  It is also believed to be an inhalation hazard. As NASA takes precautions to prevent the transport of this lunar dust into its inhabited environments, both on the orbiter and lunar habitats, it needs a means to assess whether those controls are effective. This method must be sufficiently accurate to guide NASA crews and operations, and reliable for long-term deployment. This Phase I project explores the use of ensemble optical methods, including both angular scattering dependencies and light intensity fluctuations, to assess suspended particulate mass in the identified size fractions below 10µm and below 2.5µm.  Additionally, it will incorporate a space-proven ultrafine particle monitor to distinguish the presence of particles below 100 nm in size which are characteristic of smokes. The ensemble scattering approach uses an optically defined sampling volume, eliminating the need for small focusing nozzles that can become clogged, thereby increasing the robustness of the instrument.","This project targets NASA's stated need to monitor the mass of suspended airborne particulate matter aboard the Artemis lunar habitat and spaceship environments.

Parts for NASA safety-critical applications require 100% inspection to certify uncompromised mechanical performance. There is thus a key opportunity for in-line, in-situ, identification and correction of defects during the AM build to produce finished parts that are already fully qualified, and eliminate the need for scrapping finished defective parts. Laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) is the only currently viable method for in-line defect detection during the AM build. The IOS LUT receiver's automatic compensation for optical distortion enables it to work on rough as-built surface finishes. Its noncontact nature allows it to operate on hot, moving, vibrating surfaces, while quickly moving along the surface of complex geometries. This gives close access to defects for sensitive detection, so that corrective measures can be taken, often during the following build layer, before they are covered over by further deposition. LUT thus has great potential to make AM parts more reliable and cost-efficient. Our previous work has addressed the application of LUT to detect defects in parts during AM conducted on Earth. This proposed project extends that work to AM in space, in reduced gravity. In Phase I we will produce interrupted-build samples with simulated defects on an AM machine designed for use in space, run LUT scans on them, and further develop algorithms and software to enhance defect detection and identification from the scans. We will also make preliminary assessments to show the feasibility of integrating LUT into this AM machine, of greatly reducing LUT system size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C), and of in-line correction of detected defects during a build.

Benefits of the proposed innovation include a reduction in electrical power requirements compared to current electron beam and arc welding systems designed for OSAM and further power reduction compared to laser welding systems; a lightweight deployable design that minimizes launch costs; precision spot size and energy flux control  enabling precision welds on a wide range of materials, material thicknesses, and joint configurations; and a radiation based welding process that enables welding non-conductive materials including thermoplastics and ceramics while reducing the risk of damaging sensitive electronics that may be close to the weld. The Phase I effort will focus on defining a full-scale SO-WARM system, concept of operations for the full-scale system, and associated subsystem requirements including a well-characterized welding testbed; evaluating different solar concentrator configurations based on mass, launch volume, lifetime/durability, and complexity; quantifying full-scale production rate and functional specifications; and demonstration of the solar welding process in an inert atmosphere through a closed-feedback-loop testbed with three aerospace materials including metals and non-metals.","The primary application within NASA’s technology roadmap for SO-WARM is TX12.4: Manufacturing for which the SO-WARM accommodates the desired capabilities outlined in technology candidates TX12.4.1 for in-space fabrication, assembly, and repair. Secondarily, SO-WARM fits into TX13.2: Test and Qualification. SO-WARM can be incorporated into several NASA in-space construction efforts such as OSAM-1, OSAM-2, the lunar Gateway, and the ISS. It can also be used as a free-flying module, servicing satellites and structures as needed on-orbit.","There are several applications of the proposed solar welding technology that will benefit the DoD, NSF, and other federal agencies interested in advanced manufacturing techniques. These include a solar welder for use in remote locations on Earth and by underserved communities who may not have access to established infrastructure."

As a result, for such tasks there is often a human in the loop to create supervised autonomy. We are proposing to develop a software framework that enables operators to more easily command robots by leveraging more computer vision. The key innovation of this proposal is to connect a perception pipeline that recognizes instances of known classes of objects with affordances: a description of how an object should be manipulated. For example, given a depth image of a scene, the system will recognize door handles and hinges and annotate the scene to automatically inform the user how a robot could open the corresponding doors. Our work combines automatic recognition of affordances with a user interface (UI) that enables an operator to fine tune affordances if needed. The operator feedback will be used to retrain the system to further improve system performance and decrease the amount of operator input required. This is expected to reduce the cognitive load on robot operators by allowing them to focus on high level tasks including appropriate actions on objects that are relevant to a given task.","The initial focus is on enabling higher levels of autonomy for IVA such as cargo unloading and science experiment tending.

Multiple 3D-TPS recipes developed to date include a spun carbon:phenolic yarn constituent.  Future recipes may require alternate yarn constructions (denier, blend ratios, fiber chemistries, etc.) in order to tailor TPS properties to specific mission requirements.  Stretch-breaking and subsequent processing of carbon based yarn blends is technically challenging and domestic based sources for such expertise are extremely limited.  T.E.A.M., Inc. proposes to address these issues by using our newly minted yarn fabrication facility to develop and characterize a carbon-phenolic yarn solution.  Baseline machine settings for current carbon yarn blend recipes being developed for the Army will be used as a starting point.  A significant portion of Phase I focus will be on quantitative characterization of yarn properties at each step of the process (tensile strength, blend quality, denier, twist level.)  This will establish baseline properties and characterization techniques to be used for further iterations anticipated in Phase II.

Beneficial applications include spacecraft returning to Earth from low Earth orbit, exploring other planetary bodies (e.g. descent to Mars, Venus, and Titan), and reducing the cost of access to space by enabling the recovery of launch vehicle assets. Current deployable aerodynamic decelerators are constrained by existing blowdown system limitations including mass efficiency, and long term storage of high pressure gas. Hydrogen, while an ideal candidate for its storage capacity, has high leak rates when considering long duration missions and transits. Gas generators provide a solution that has a higher density than cryogenic liquid hydrogen, however, these hydrogen generators are yet to be a space qualified technology. In this effort, Outpost Technologies Corporation (Outpost) will develop GasPak which is a low mass and clean gas generator that will be used for hypersonic inflatables on space missions. In order to achieve this goal Outpost will leverage its relationship with Dutch company TNO to procure commercial off the shelf nitrogen gas generators to be used in a feasibility study and benchtop prototype. From these steps a hydrogen gas generator will be designed and brought to a PDR-level by the end of Phase I. By the end of Phase II, the gas generator will reach TRL-8 by being demonstrated on an orbital Outpost mission with Earth return.","The primary NASA application will be Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs) as planned for use on missions to planets and moons with atmospheres as well as returning payloads to Earth. Additionally, GasPak may be used in substitution for other single use pressurant systems such as deployment of spacecraft components and planetary landing impact suppression.","Outpost will use the GasPak technology in its own reusable satellites to deploy the heat shield for re-entry.

Recently developed simulation tools to predict Plume-Surface Interaction (PSI) effects such as dust lofting, obscuration, debris transport, and surface cratering lack practical uncertainty assessment capability. The multi-physics, multi-phase, gas-granular media interaction modeling relies on complex algorithms and numerous physics submodels derived from experimental datasets with limited fidelity and considerable uncertainties. Model and algorithmic complexity and the frequent immaturity and sparsity of the fundamental physics submodels elevates the urgency of sensitivity analysis capability for PSI simulations. This project proposes development of an efficient Forward Automatic Differentiation (FAD) based sensitivity derivatives in conjunction with non-intrusive UQ methodologies for gas-granular flow solver Loci/GGFS. The FAD will enable run-time sensitivity analysis and propagation of underlying sub-model uncertainties through the overall PSI simulation model towards uncertainty quantification of simulation output metrics. The approach is efficient, especially for large parameter spaces and requires a limited number of simulations compared to sampling methods. Sensitivities analysis allows identification of dominant sub-model contributors of uncertainty, guide improvements, and provide a rapid propagation of critical uncertainties to the simulation output metrics.  The resulting tools will be delivered to NASA for ready application for Lunar and Martian landers, including the Human Lander System, to aid in quantifying and identifying uncertainties and deficiencies in current simulations.","Immediate NASA applications include the support of a broad range of numerical simulations, especially in determining uncertainties present in models used therein. Identification and understanding of model uncertainties will have a direct impact on missions requiring propulsive landing and take-off, such as the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) landers, for the Human Lander System (HLS), and future Martian robotic and human landers.","Potential non-NASA applications include a wide range of sand and dust related military and civilian applications such as rotorcraft sand/dust brownout and engine dust ingestion. In addition, multiphase flows occur in many applications in chemical, and fossil-energy conversion industries where accurate physics modeling plays a huge role in the flow behavior of real particulate systems."

However, this is not a trivial task for these types of environments. As the jet/plume from the rocket engine, used to decelerate the vehicle, encounters the surface, the low atmospheric pressure, low gravity, and cohesive soil properties result in large dust clouds and even crater formation. These phenomena are called plume surface interactions (PSI). Incremental progress is being made to study PSI through a series of proposed test campaigns being conducted at multiple NASA Research Centers and utilizing large vacuum chamber facilities, such as the MSFC TS300 or LARC 60' Sphere, and tested under relevant conditions. One critical instrumentation need that NASA has identified for these tests is direct surface (wall) shear stress measurements. In the Lunar environment, surface shear stress is the primary driving force by which surface erosion occurs. To overcome this technology gap, Ahmic Aerospace and our assembled team propose to adapt our state-of-the-art wall shear measurement technology to target surface erosion environments occurring in plume surface interactions. In Phase I, Ahmic will conduct a series of incremental steps along two parallel paths to meet this end goal. The first path will simplify the PSI problem and consider a series of static-surface erosion tests utilizing existing wall shear sensors and known erosion geometries, thus circumventing the immediate need for an active erosion sensor. These tests will serve to compare direct and indirect wall shear measurement approaches in a jet impingement environment and examine the influence of surface erosion geometry on wall shear. The second path will consist of a feasibility study to develop a wall shear measurement methodology for active surface erosion environments and examine the steps necessary to achieve this goal.","The proposed wall shear diagnostic techniques present a direct solution for NASA’s PSI ground testing needs. As part of the recent project focused on advancing modeling and simulation capabilities, PSI validation data is being acquired in a campaign known as the Physics Focused Ground Test (PFGT). Much of this initial work is being carried out in NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in the Test Stand 300. This test campaign would directly benefit from Ahmic’s proposed instrumentation and methodology.","The Air Force and SpaceX represent non-NASA markets for the proposed diagnostic techniques. These entities are currently investigating the technical feasibility of using rockets for point-to-point transport of high-value cargoes to remote landing sites. To do this safely will require knowledge of PSI, viscous erosion physics, and how the granular particles will be ejected from the surface."

This innovation is enabled by a novel space propulsion system that combines chemical and electric propulsion with shared propellant between the modes (multimode propulsion, MMP).  Through previous efforts, we have developed technologies that enable this type of system. This includes development of our electrosprayable ‘green’ monopropellants FAM-110A and FAM-122A, demonstration of chemical and electric thrusters using these monopropellants, and development of a propellant feed system capable of supplying the three order of magnitude difference in flow rates required for operation in either mode. This project will demonstrate a 22 N chemical monopropellant thruster using our FAM-122A monopropellant, designed for inclusion as the main engine in a transfer stage capable of injecting a 25 kg small satellite payload into a TLI orbit from a small venture class launch vehicle using only chemical propulsion. The transfer stage systems, however, will also accomodate our feed system and electrospray thrusters, initially used for purposes of minor course correction, pointing, and disposal maneuvers. As electrospray technology matures, upgraded thrusters can be swapped into the vehicle to enable missions to Mars, Venus, and near Earth asteroids. This project will also perform small scale hazard classification tests, data from which will be used to assign a DOT 1.3 interim classification by the conclusion of the project in addition to investigation and development of production scale up plans.","A transfer stage with the proposed multimode propulsion system is capable of performing near term missions to the moon using near term ready technology advances, but has the capacity to grow in capability with further developments in electrospray technology. Further improvements to electrospray technology will enable the same transfer stage to accomplish missions to Mars, Venus, and unique near-Earth destinations along with the flexibility to achieve these missions without significant alteration to the propulsion hardware.","A multimode propulsion transfer stage can also function as a last-mile delivery service or on-orbit servicer for commercial and DoD applications, with the resiliency offered by the use of a shared propellant.

Rather than imposing a standard to design to, we have developed a universal adapter to rapidly connect and integrate subsystems with disparate hardware and software interfaces. This adapter is called the Multipurpose Adapter Generic Interface Connector (MA61C). Our approach is to provide an adapter based on hardware and software that is compatible with the wide variety of hardware and software interfaces used in the industry. We have adapter (hardware) modules that are suitable from CubeSat-class up through large satellites, as well as for use as ground support equipment, that provide a full suite of hardware and software interfaces. Software drivers are included that are compatible with many satellite subsystems (currently, about 80% of small satellite subsystem vendors). In conventional small satellite assembly and integration, there are many point-to-point connections, with most data interfaces routing back to the central flight computer and most power connections routing back to the central power system. Whereas by utilizing MAG1C, much more modular integration is enabled, with MA61C providing all necessary data routing and providing plug and play capability.","The MA61C adapter provides interchangeable HW and SW with standardized interfaces. It enables spacecraft to be built up with a plug-and-play convenience with components that are otherwise not supportive of plug and play by utilizing data analysis . The MA61C device has a Command and Control system that allows localized verification of the devices, greatly reducing the time and complexity of manufacturing. The MA61C adapter turns existing satellites into modular systems that can be altered rapidly to meet shifting objectives and risks.","MA61C reduces integration time and enables late-stage HW swaps. It also accelerates innovation and eases testing of new technologies and satellite configurations.

While classic PPT technology is mature, it has historically been limited by its size and propellant load. CUA developed the Fiber-fed PPT (FPPT) and developed miniaturized several electronics subsystems including high-density energy storage via MLCC capacitors (life tested), low erosion discharge geometry, regenerative carbon igniters with negligible erosion, compact power electronics, and electromagnetic thrust vectoring. QT-PPT seeks to further the miniaturization of the subsystems, but with a 70g Teflon disc (no fiber). In this Phase I, CUA will leverage the technology improvements from FPPT to build a more accessible QT-PPT system with lower size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C). The entire system including PPU is tightly integrated onto a stack of PCBs approximately 0.5U in size which offloads most of the manufacturing and quality control to the specialized PCB manufacturer, and enables the “Quick Turn” PPT system integrated by CUA. The proposed technology is estimated to have a specific impulse of 2400s and a total impulse of 1640N-s, enough to lower a 5 kg CubeSat from 1000 km to 400 km.  The total impulse can be increased with additional volume and fuel loading if desired for deorbiting larger CubeSats. CUA’s thrust vectoring technology is slated for integration into the system during the Phase II effort, relieving requirements for separate attitude control systems that may be difficult for small missions to meet.  CUA’s long term goal will be to establish the QT-PPT as a mature integrated system solution with standard lead times under 6 weeks. One QT-PPT will be delivered to NASA at the end of the Phase II program.","The practice of responsible space and deorbit capability of LEO satellites is critical for the prevention of an escalation of space debris.  With an anticipated 1640N-s total impulse from a 0.5U QT-PPT system, deorbit from 1000 km is possible at end-of-life with only power and attitude determination available from a CubeSat to guide the thrust-vectored propulsion system (no reaction wheels or magnetorquers required).  Unlike drag-based deorbit systems, QT-PPT also provides an “as needed” collision avoidance option for the entire mission.","Commercial interest in nano-/small-satellites continues to grow, and it is more important than ever that these satellites have access to a technology for end-of-life deorbiting. The QT-PPT provides a compact, light-weight, non-hazardous, high total impulse propulsion technology solution available in a family of sizes to meet the differing mission needs of users in DOD/industry/academia."

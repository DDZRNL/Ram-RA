Box 609, Myrtle Creek, OR 97457 - 0102",(541) 863-2655,2,3,"A microgravity-compatible Continuous Brine Evaporation Cartridge (CBEC) is proposed for greater than 95% water recovery from highly contaminated wastewater without concern for precipitation of organic and inorganic solids.  The CBEC utilizes a small, counter flow evaporation chamber and heat exchange technologies, which reduce Equivalent System Mass (ESM) for water recovery via an evaporation system.  A gas phase catalytic oxidizer converts organic contaminants in the moist air stream to carbon dioxide and water.  The CBEC system dramatically lowers consumables and reduces long-term waste storage requirements compared to a traditional wick evaporation system.  Highly contaminated wastewater streams such as urine, hygiene water, and RO brines are major wastewater streams for the CBEC.  The Phase I project will focus on development of the counter flow wick evaporation cartridge and the catalytic oxidizer.  The Phase II will incorporate thermal efficiency and mechanical durability to improve ESM of the CBEC system and result in delivery of 2 prototype systems, one large scale and the other for testing in microgravity.  These efforts will be the foundation for the design and construction of a flight ready prototype for use on the International Space Station.  The CBEC process will exceed the goal of 95% water recovery by 2022 set forth by NASA in the space technology roadmap.","The NASA application for this technology will be as Flight Hardware for deployment in support of future, long duration exploration objectives beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) where efficient, reliable, and low-maintenance water reclamation systems will play a critical role in reducing ECLSS logistics.  The CBEC technology provides a simple, microgravity compatible method to recover water from highly contaminated wastewater and brines without concern for organic and inorganic solids.  The use of a counter flow evaporation cartridge, catalytic oxidation, and heat exchange technology will lower the ESM for this technology compared to conventional air evaporation technologies.  Such a water recovery system will be purchased as Flight Hardware by NASA, or by an aerospace contracting firm on behalf of NASA, resulting in enhanced capability in support of manned missions beyond LEO, where minimization of expendables, reliability, and simple operation are highly valued.","This specialized, innovative technology cannot compete effectively against large-scale distillation or reverse osmosis based desalination processes; however, the CBEC technology is ideal for smaller scale or specialty applications due to its simplicity, small size, and ability to rapidly produce pure water and permanently contain salts.  These applications include routine or emergency water production and the reduction of wastewater disposal volumes aboard ships, at industrial sites, or where nuclear wastes require concentration and confinement.  Other highly advantageous commercial applications include the recovery of valuable salts from concentrated solutions where relatively low temperature recovery is required and the destruction of volatile components is desired.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Remediation/Purification"

The proposed SBIR Phase I project addresses an innovative torrefaction (mild pyrolysis) processing approach that can be used to sterilize feces, control odor, and produce a stable, free flowing powder that can be easily stored or recycled, while simultaneously recovering all of the moisture, producing additional water, and only small amounts of other gases (CO2, CO, CH4) and liquids. The overall objective of the Phase I program is to demonstrate the feasibility of a near full (1/3) scale integrated Waste Collection/Torrefaction (WC/T) unit for fecal waste streams. The Phase I work will be accomplished in three tasks: 1) test unit design and construction; 2) laboratory testing on relevant waste streams; 3) evaluation and preliminary Phase II prototype design. This work plan will address the key questions about the WC/T unit feasibility for the application to human fecal waste and related solid waste streams.  In addition, the torrefaction method can be applied using the same or similar conditions to other types of wet or dry cellulosic biomass (food, paper, wipes, clothing) which provides for some desirable redundancy in the waste management system. The Phase II prototype will be compatible with the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) and complementary to the Heat Melt Compactor (HMC), both now under development by NASA. The torrefaction process can also be accomplished with minimal crew interactions, modest energy requirements and will be able to tolerate mixed or contaminated waste streams.","The proposed approach will make it technically feasible to process human fecal waste and related mixed waste streams, recover moisture, and produce additional water and other useful products in space which will benefit long term space travel, such as an extended Lunar stay or a mission to Mars and Asteroids/Phobos. It is beneficial to NASA in also allowing for solid waste sterilization and stabilization, planetary protection, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and/or production of chemical feedstocks and carbon materials. In particular, the solid carbon-rich residue has several potential applications in space. These include production of activated carbon, a nutrient-rich substrate for plant growth, as a filler for polymers and composites, radiation shielding, C-H-O storage, and fuel gas (CH4, CO, H2) production.","In the near term, the fecal waste processing component of the technology would also have applications to fecal waste resource recovery and/or sterilization/stabilization problems in remote areas such as underdeveloped countries, arctic regions, military operations, oil production platforms, rural areas, farms, submarines, ships, etc., analogous to the uses for NASA technology developed for water purification. In the long term, the technology could be modified and integrated with widespread terrestrial efforts to process fecal and related solid waste streams for resource recovery and biochar production. Biochar is currently being used for soil amendments, soil remediation, polymer fillers, composite materials, and carbon sequestration.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fuels/Propellants; In Situ Manufacturing; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Processing Methods; Remediation/Purification; Resource Extraction; Waste Storage/Treatment"

Though no such system has been demonstrated in space to date, numerous methods have been proposed and developed to various degrees. In this Phase I effort we propose to develop a versatile microgravity-compatible brine de-watering method that exploits the Brine Residual in Containment (BRIC) approach. The system is essentially passive, employing the combined effects of surface tension, wetting, and system geometry to drive and stably support the fluids involved. Our approach balances performance with simplicity, the latter which leads to a safe, clean, low-cost, fast-to-flight device with high probability of success. The broad solution approach is expected to be tolerant of pretreatments, contaminates, particulates, and widely varying input feed lines. Preliminary data suggests that the compact and lightweight approach requires only ~0.02kg of disposable support material for ~1L (~1.8 kg) of solid brine produced, and that maintenance expectations are as low as 30 minutes per 50 days per crew member. Our Phase I deliverable is a low-g drop tower-demonstrated prototype with a clear plan for rapid construction and flight qualification of a flight version for verification and validation aboard the International Space Station.","The capillary BRIC technology for brine dewatering is a critical and urgent item for life support aboard spacecraft. It is envisioned that NASA will be a prime user of the proposed technology and serve as both collaborator and customer of said devices. In addition to qualification, fundamental data concerning capillarity, phase change, and stability may be useful for other space-based applications involving drying or de-watering.","Commercial aerospace companies are currently developing life support capabilities that will also require closing the water cycle. In this light, the proposed work is directly applicable to commercial spaceflight as well. On the ground our research has applications to large scale passive fluidic operations for dewatering algae for H2 production, advanced microfluidics for water management in fuel cells, lab-on-chip devices, and porous structures for scaffolds in tissue engineering.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Fluids; Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment"

For this reason, NASA has invested in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), which comprises sun trackers with high resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometers.  NASA is currently looking to expand their observation network in order to provide more data for their atmospheric research, but this will require a reduction in spectrometer size and cost.  OPTRA proposes to address this need through the development of a novel hybrid spectrometer design that leverages the strengths of Michelson and lamellar grating interferometers, while mitigating their individual weaknesses.  The end result will be a compact, rugged, low cost spectrometer capable of the same performance as the current TCCON network.  This technology will further be extendable to any applications where spectral data is required, but instrument size and cost are at a premium.  Examples include methane pipeline monitoring, volcano emission characterization or UAV-based remote sensing.","The proposed technology will be applicable to a wide variety of applications for which a spectrometer is needed to characterize or quantify chemicals of interest, but where size and cost are at a premium.

In addition, natural gas companies require a method to monitor their pipelines to prevent significant losses and to minimize the environmental impact of their operations.

Along the way, we saw several opportunities to further reduce size and cost, and improve accuracy of the entire system. Likewise, power consumption can be decreased and reliability improved. In the end, the resulting Phase I proof-of-concept system will have fewer moving parts, be lower cost, consume less power –important for solar powered installations – and will be more compact than the original system and have an accuracy better than 0.3%. Most notably, the product of Phase I will serve as a platform to validate further hardware and software improvements that will be incorporated into a commercial version in Phase II.","Looking to the very near future, the proposed laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR) could be installed at numerous sites - especially in the arctic where satellite (e.g. GOSAT, OCO-2) data are unavailable – to form a world-wide network capable of making real-time measurements of greenhouse gasses (GHG).Also, the proposed LHR can augment other methods currently used by NASA to measure the abundance of GHG. Also, the LHR lasers can be changed or more can be added to measure other species such as water vapor (H2O) and nitrous oxide (N2O).  Further, since sunlight is a very broadband light source, levels of pollutants such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and carbon monoxide (CO) if the lasers and optical detector were changed.","One can envision several applications for a low cost, accurate atmosphere radiometer. Any place airborne chemicals need to be detected and/or their concentrations measured, the LHR is a potential solution. Applications could include:? Measurement of smokestack emissions from the ground.? Ground-based measurement of airborne jet or rocket engine performance by monitoring exhaust components.? Detection and classification of harmful airborne gasses or chemicals using a manmade, broadband light source in lieu of sunlight (e.g. monitoring the atmosphere in large factory or in a mine elevator shaft using a stabilized 300 – 2600nm light source).The system can be expanded to simultaneously use multiple lasers to measure species or compounds having spectra that span a wide spectrum.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing)"

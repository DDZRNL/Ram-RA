Among them, linearized reduced-order modeling approaches rely on linearization of the nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic flow equations, assuming that the amplitude of the unsteady motion is limited to small perturbations about the nonlinear steady-state flow condition. Various approaches of linearized ROMs, such as Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average (ARMA), first order Volterra Kernel, Impulse Response method, etc., can be broadly found in literature. However, few of them are geared towards the controller design oriented plant modeling, i.e., to obtain a plant model with control surface actuator modeling and gust excitations, and various types of sensor definitions including sectional/component load monitoring capability. In light of this, ZONA proposes to develop a discrete time state-space aeroservoelastic modeling technique with component load monitoring using NASA developed high fidelity Navier-Stokes flow solver, FUN3D. The subspace realization algorithm will be utilized to identify the individual aerodynamic systems, i.e., due to the structural deformations (modal coordinates), control surface deflections and discrete gust, respectively. The dataset needed for the aerodynamic system identifications are obtained by a wrapper program, called OVERFUN, driving the underlying FUN3D solver. OVERFUN’s trim or static aeroelastic analysis solution will provide an initial background solution accounting for static aeroelastic effects. This unique initial flow solution sets the proposed efforts apart from other research work where an initial flow around rigid configurations is normally assumed. Once all three sub aerodynamic system are identified, they are coupled with the structural equation of motion represented in modal space and actuator models to yield the conventional state-space forms of aeroelastic model and plant model.","The proposed effort is highly relevant to on-going and future NASA fixed wing projects, which involve innovative design concepts such as the Truss-Braced Wing, Blended Wing Body, and Supersonic Business Jet. The proposed work will offer a computational tool to the NASA designers for early exploration of design concepts that exploit the trade-off between the passive and active approaches for mitigating the potential aeroelastic problems associated with those configurations.","The proposed discrete time state-space ASE plant model generation can be applied to many categories of flight vehicles including blended wing-bodies, joined wings, sub/supersonic transports, morphing aircraft, space planes, reusable launch vehicles, and similar revolutionary concepts pursued. Hence, the proposed research and its outcomes will be highly needed for designing the next generation of civil as well as military aircraft to meet the stringent future performance goals."

Resolvent analysis is a frequency-domain technique that can identify resonance phenomena such as jet screech and other tonal acoustic effects, predict the large-scale coherent structures that are the main source of aft angle jet noise, and that provides, at the same time, sensitivity maps that can be used for optimal sensor or actuator placement for noise control. Cascade’s LES framework features a novel mesh generation paradigm based on the computation of Voronoi diagrams, which allows for the generation of high-quality, body-fitted, conformal meshes and the use of low-dissipation numerical methods required for high fidelity large eddy simulations of multi-scale turbulent flows in complex geometries. We project that the combination of the Voronoi-based LES and resolvent analysis can be successfully commercialized by assuming a role similar to that of modal analysis in solid mechanics. In Phase I, we propose the case of a heated supersonic over-expanded turbulent jet issuing from a circular convergent-divergent nozzle as a testbed for both Cascade’s Voronoi-based LES framework and a resolvent analysis tool provided by Caltech as a subcontractor. The first task is to implement and validate shock-capturing capabilities into both the resolvent tool and LES compressible flow solver “Charles”. Armed with the large-eddy simulation data, The second task is to conducte a detailed resolvent analysis of the over-expanded turbulent jet, with special emphasis on broadband aft angle and tonal shock-induced noise.

However, reducing NOx emissions is at odds with turbine engine efficiency and performance: increasing thermal efficiency by boosting the pressure ratio in an engine by 30% leads to a 5% decrease in fuel consumption, but a 100% increase in NOx emissions. Accordingly, the aerospace industry is seeking methods to reduce NOx  and CO2 emissions while maintaining or improving current turbine engine efficiency and power. This proposal furthers the development of Thermatin, a novel germanate-based thermal barrier coating (TBC) top-coat material with phase stability to 1800C+. Thermatin’s high temperature phase stability enables a potential 200C+ increase in allowable TBC surface temperatures in aircraft and industrial turbine engines over today’s standard. This increase would directly support lower energy requirements for active cooling in lean-burn engines, reduced NOx and CO2 emissions, and improved overall engine efficiency. Germanate-based TBCs have previously been demonstrated to meet target parameters established by the turbine engine industry for use in next-generation high efficiency/low-emission turbine engines, including high temperature phase stability, low intrinsic thermal conductivity, low density and high coefficient of linear thermal expansion. The proposed effort aims to demonstrate high temperature phase stability in thin coating form and optimization for resistance to CMAS attack. Our research efforts will be directed toward meeting performance requirements in the following areas: 1. establishing deposition parameters that produce phase stable Thermatin coatings with standard morphology using electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), 2. demonstrating high temperature phase stability in thin-coating form, and 3) demonstrating high temperature structural stability when exposed to CMAS contaminants.","This proposal directly addresses the NASA directorate goals and the Durability and Protective Coatings Branch goals for decreasing NOx and CO2 emissions in advanced combustion engines while preserving or increasing engine efficiency. Thermatin also aligns with several non-emission focused projects within NASA's sub-divisions, including the Entry System and Technology Division's contributions to the design and material properties for the SpaceX Dragon capsule re-entry system.",Thermal barrier coatings will play a key role in enabling future emissions reductions and efficiency gains as a result of improved combustion techniques.

Various active combustion control methods have been demonstrated for improving combustion stability in jet engines but they have not found wide-spread commercial use. Moreover, plasma has been shown to be a promising tool for improving flame stabilization.  The rapid actuation time and authority of plasma discharges also make plasma an attractive actuator for active combustion control. Plasma can both improve both static stability via kinetic enhancement of reaction pathways and dynamic stability, especially if configured in a closed-loop configuration. Plasmas have already been demonstrated in literature to have positive effects on combustion dynamics. However, further work is necessary to understand the dynamics of flame response to plasma’s, particularly at realistic conditions. To this end, this proposal will use explore a novel method of using plasma as an active control actuator in an LDI combustor to enable reduced emissions and operation at conditions which would have otherwise been unstable.

Although eddy-resolving  CFD methods for computing high-speed jet noise are available, such methods are computationally expensive and are currently deemed impractical for use in a design optimization loop. On the other hand, the prediction of turbulence generated noise using the RANS equations provides a less accurate but more cost-effective approach for practical design problems, wherein the turbulence length and time scales needed to model the local noise source terms can be extracted from the RANS turbulence model solution, as performed by the NASA JeNo code. In this Phase 1 proposal, we seek to demonstrate the feasibility of using the exact discrete adjoint of a coupled RANS-JeNo turbulent noise prediction methodology for optimizing far-field acoustic objectives of jet noise. Based on our previous experience developing an unsteady RANS-FWH (Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings) far-field acoustic optimization capability, the Phase 1 proposal targets the formulation of the turbulence noise source terms used by the JeNo code, along with the discrete adjoint of these terms within an existing adjoint-enabled RANS solver. The immediate goal will be to demonstrate the possibility of reducing these noise sources through nozzle shape optimization. In Phase 2, this capability will be linked with the NASA JeNo code, and the remaining terms for the formulation of the discrete adjoint of the coupled RANS-JeNo simulation capability will be implemented and used to perform optimization of far-field noise signatures for realistic nozzle configurations.

This approach to mesh generation has the potential to significantly improve performance and robustness, while retaining important elements of high quality meshes including boundary alignment, stretching, and element regularity. Clipped Voronoi diagrams also automatically de-feature the underlying geometry at the local resolution of the generating points, and can thus significantly impact the problem of CAD clean-up and defeaturing. The mathematical properties of Voronoi diagrams enable highly scalable mesh generation, since the global mesh is uniquely defined yet each individual cell can be constructed with only local information. Importantly the Voronoi paradigm reduces the problem of mesh generation to the much simpler problem of specifying the locations (point cloud) where the solution will be sampled. The actual mesh (volumes, faces, topology, neighbor connectivity) is simply a unique mathematical consequence of this choice. This dramatically simplifies control over local mesh resolution - an important consideration for automation and high-fidelity simulations. Additionally, the discretization of the boundary surface is independent from the near-boundary mesh resolution, allowing arbitrary coarsening or refinement relative to the local surface length scales. The impact of leveraging these benefits in mesh generation will be a dramatic reduction in the time and human interaction required to generate quality meshes for high-fidelity applications. Understanding solution sensitivity to the point cloud parameters is the technical objective of the current proposal. We will asses solution sensitivity with respect to three different aspects related to the spatial arrangement of the point cloud.

The tools would be suitable for eventual integration with the NASA Auralization Framework (NAF). The topic requires a set of modules to be delivered which will integrate with existing NAF infrastructure to efficiently find acoustic propagation paths in a complicated modeled urban environment and deliver them to the path traverser module.  Delivered modules will include a pathfinder module, a source module, and a terrain module. The pathfinder module will need to be capable of finding paths which represent all relevant physical acoustic wave propagation phenomena in the environment.  The primary acoustic phenomena to be addressed within the pathfinder module are specular reflection and diffusion, with the ability to add atmospheric refraction in the future. In addition to a pathfinder module, a method of integrating directional source radiation will be provided.  The source model will be fed through a bank of FIR filters arranged spatially, allowing for frequency dependent directional radiation.  Otherwise, the source model could be computed in the frequency domain, by computing the spectrum of each direction, applying to the spectrum of the source, and then generating the source audio via an inverse Fourier transform.  Relevant benefits and detriments of each material will be reported on during the phase I effort. An improved terrain model will be implemented as well, which allows for the storage of urban-scale complex environments.

The new software will also include auralization capabilities to enhance evaluation of community annoyance due to various acoustics characteristics beyond A-weighted sound pressure level.","The proposed effort directly supports NASA’s ARMD’s SIP strategic thrusts 3 (ultra-efficient sub/transonic aircraft) and 3B (NASA Vertical Lift Strategic Direction) by enabling accurate prediction and optimization of DEP aircraft noise characteristics and sources during the conceptual design phase.  As identified by NASA, the lack of this capability is a critical gap impeding the progress of current UAM vehicle development.","CDI collaborates with many UAM vehicle developers who have an immediate need for the proposed analysis capability to predict DEP aircraft noise in the conceptual design phase.  Commercialization to these customers would be concurrent with the SBIR effort.  The analysis will also be of great value to the DoD and major rotorcraft manufacturers in analyzing acoustic characteristics of future compound aircraft, like the SB>1 Defiant, V-280 Valor, AVX CCH, and Aurora Lightning Strike."

It focuses on techniques to ensure short-time-scale stability in power micro-grids, and optimization-based control at somewhat longer (~10-100 ms) time-scales for propulsion system and vehicle control, which is managed by a vehicle Energy Management System (vEMS). Fast optimization and model-based decision making are key to the approach. Experiments will be conducted with a hybrid power plant consisting of an internal combustion engine, an iron-less dual-halbach-array starter motor/generator, and a new 6-phase regenerative motor drive. The project is organized into three Technical Objectives: TO #1: Reconfigurable Component, Subsystem, and System Topology Models Reconfigurability is enabled at three levels in the vEMS-controlled system. At the component level, parametric models are used so that components in a new vehicle system or a faulted system can be configured with a parameter list. Subsystems are similarly configured. At the system level, the topology is reconfigurable because of technical conditions (incremental passivity) placed on each component to ensure that the assembled micro-grid is stable regardless of the interconnection. With stable short-time-scale dynamics, the vEMS uses component models to optimally manage interactions on the micro-grid. TO #2: Incremental Passivity with Application to a 1.5kW Regenerative Drive LaunchPoint proposes  to design a 1.5kW regenerative drive for the 6-phase starter motor/generator such that it is incrementally passive as seen from the bus. TO #3: Real-Time Optimal Control for Energy Management The project will make use of a recently developed tool, named TensCalc, that generates specialized C-code for real-time decision and control with up to a few thousand optimization variables/constraints.

UAM aircraft concepts must have control authority, turbulence rejection, and ride comfort as figures of merit at the forefront of the configuration selection process. However, the evaluation of handling qualities has traditionally been late in the design process when most of a vehicle's characteristics are established. Advanced design methods in early conceptual design are just recently adopting the use of physics-based aircraft dynamics models to identify handling quality metrics and educate the configuration down selection process. Attempts to extend those tools into unique VTOL configurations designed for the UAM market are not ubiquitous due to the increased complexity and diversity of VTOL concepts.

If the target specific power is achieved, this technology could increase the viability of turbo-electric airplanes for commercial air transport, leading to significantly lower carbon emissions and energy use in aviation. The key innovation is the use of high fundamental operating frequencies, and a mostly air-core electromagnetic architecture, to obtain high specific power in electrical machines and drives. The aerospace industry employs 400 Hz ‘ac’ to keep component weights low. Hinetics is planning to introduce products that push these frequencies up by an order of magnitude to 3-10 kHz fundamental. The machine is transformed from the traditional metal-intense design to a composite and silicon-intense design. The new architecture is projected to improve machine power density by a factor of two over current best-in-class machines, with simple self-pumped air cooling, while achieving 98% efficiency. Additionally, the radially thin geometry, with simple self-pumped air cooling, lends itself nicely to integration within a ducted turbofan.

This severely reduces the frequency at which such testing can be done, and the number of airfoils on which such testing  can be practically performed. To address these issues, IEM proposes the Low Profile Aerodynamic Testing Tape (LPATT) derived from and building upon millions of dollars in miniature wireless sensor research and patented and patent-pending technology and innovations. LPATT will be an ultra-thin, easily applied pressure and temperature  wireless sensor node (other sensing parameters possible) that can be applied in any location with minimal time and effort and NO modifications to the airframe of any kind, with minimal impact on airstream passage. LPATT will match or exceed current-technology measurement accuracy, be self-powered, will store all information onboard and be capable of either real-time transmission of data or of transmitting the data later on demand, and may be designed with 50 or more pressure sensors with high sampling rates. Data interface between LPATT will be accomplished using a Data Collection Interface System (DCIS) to collect, process, and transmit data to outside systems. The use of LPATT will drastically reduce the cost and time involved in wind-tunnel and flight test pressure sensing trials and may offer direct benefits in other areas such as providing the data for operation of performance adaptive aeroelastic wing shape controls in future aircraft designs.

The proposed system includes a Pixhawk autopilot with Ardupilot software that will be customized with propulsor health state variables and relevant autonomous directives such as limiting the throttle of an at-risk propulsor, a Jetson TX2 module embedded with ESAero’s proprietary fault detection algorithm, and data acquisition system with a suite of low-cost sensors that are to be installed throughout the aircraft. The IAC will be installed on an existing custom hexacopter test platform owned by ESAero and demonstrated in flight with simulated fault events at ESAero’s flight test facility in Oceano, CA. With generality as a key objective of the design, the IAC should be suitable for integration on a wide variety of aircraft requiring only minor modification. The IAC is expected to be a key enabling technology to safer operation of aircraft during flight testing and in-service use. Secondary benefits include Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and more efficient operation of hybrid electric propulsion systems.","An Integrated Autonomous Controller (IAC) with health state awareness (HSA) will be useful for flight testing at NASA by increasing system level health awareness. The algorithm itself is agnostic to the data type being analyzed and thus its applicability is not limited to specific system architectures.

This increase in interest, design, and integration has raised serious questions of safety and reliability for complex vehicle architectures that are expected to operate in dense urban environments. The ability to implement the proposed IAC with HSA will increase safety of the vehicle operating in environments where catastrophic failure results in high order damage and loss of life."

Some of these changes include electrode expansion, electrode ruffling, dendrite formation, internal gas formation, and internal density changes. A key characteristic of these changes is that most of them occur prior to any external measurable parameter variation, such as in terminal voltage, surface temperature, or mechanical surface strain. Therefore, detecting internal cell structural and mechanical changes early and with adequate resolution has several benefits, including the prevention of catastrophic accidents sufficiently ahead of time, and the gathering of additional information that can be used to more accurately assess the health and life of cells during operation. We propose a novel approach that simultaneously detects and corrects these internal cell changes early and using hardware that can be permanently installed externally on the surface of a lithium-ion cell. Our approach enhances the safety and prognostics associated with lithium-ion batteries, and its reconstruction capability has the added benefit of rejuvenating a cell to extend its life. Finally, the proposed solution will be implemented on small, low cost, and low power hardware to ensure its seamless integration to existing commercial cells and systems.","It is estimated that the proposed system can have a substantial impact in the following NASA projects: Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) project, Flight Demonstrations and Capabilities (FDC) project, Transformation Tools and Technologies (TTT) project, as well as the NASA X-57 prototype and other efforts where electric and/or hybrid-electric propulsion systems are being engineered at NASA.","Battery technologies are critical for renewable systems, such as solar, wind, and hybrid/electric vehicles.

However, the use of the existing procedures for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is expensive, slow and not scalable. Cost estimates for certification are around  $100-150 per line of code, which drives up cost significantly in any program. A new tool called Tracer is proposed to manage requirements, from the system-level objectives all the way down to software requirements and the corresponding code and test cases, enabling stakeholders and engineers to identify bidirectional impacts of changes to requirements or system code and test cases. Tracer accomplishes this by: a) leveraging modern software development best practices such as version control and review process for all artifacts in the process (requirements, test cases, etc., in addition to code) b) allowing for the entire process to exist within a single tool and platform that builds off of the the git-based systems that engineers already use for development. Taking the form of a lightweight addin for git, the tool facilitates generation of reports, generation of requirements traceability matrices, visualization of dependency trees, and various enforcements of dependencies and links. The enforcements are especially powerful in easing entry into the world of certified aerospace systems for new entrants to the industry. There are also extensive capabilities to enable rich and transparent cloud-based collaboration, enabling strong links between customers, regulators, performers, and other stakeholders. Current practices use separate often expensive tools for each part of the chain, with significant costly and error-prone manual overhead required in creating and maintaining links.

It also addresses the goals of the Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS) project by introducing software development best practices to aeronautics systems engineering and reducing the cost of certification - a significant barrier.","Tracer is intended for sale to manufacturers of certified systems, which may range from small UAS up to manned Part 25 aircraft. Licensed users will also include other stakeholders (e.g., FAA representatives in a certification effort, program managers owning requirements).

Although tedious manual piloting of multi-rotor aircraft can still allow for flights in these areas as modern multi-rotor platforms generally contain proximity sensors, very little work has been done to accommodate fixed-wing aircraft.  Many application areas of UAS demand the use of a vehicle able to cover a larger sampling area, such as trace gas emission observation over volcanoes, forest biofuel calculation, invasive plant specie identification, rock and mudslide mitigation, snowpack analysis and missions requiring high-resolution photogrammetry. This work proposes to employ state-of-the art sensors, control algorithms, and on-board processing to enable an entirely new regime of automated in situ sensing for UAS.  Specifically, although extensible to multi-rotor UAS, a subsystem will be created that allows for active navigation around obstacles and rugged terrain by fixed-wing UAS. It will be designed in a modular manner to allow for inclusion on a number of different platforms, but will be specifically targeted to be deployed on the mission-proven S2 UAS.

A successful TBO concept should provide benefits in the near term by using existing airline and FAA systems, while offering the pathway to greatly enhanced TBO capabilities in the mid-to-far terms. The analytical and data exchange framework proposed by Robust Analytics to develop and evaluate TBO alternatives builds from the understanding that different participants will possess superior information in selected areas. The FAA ground domain has the most complete understanding of total system traffic, weather, and constraints. Individual aircraft have superior, real-time information on flight performance capabilities, the airline operations center (AOC) acts as the information nerve center for the airline and possesses the most comprehensive understanding of the airline network and each flight’s role in that network, and is responsible for achieving the airline’s business objectives. One of the challenges for implementing TBO is facilitating the timely negotiations to determine trajectories that simultaneously meet airline business objectives and tight required time of arrival (RTA) for traffic management purposes. With multiple sources of uncertainty in flight operations, TBO concepts must be able to negotiate trajectory changes to satisfy multiple objectives while responding to uncertainties and constraints in the NAS. For Phase I, Robust Analytics will describe a detailed TBO negotiation process and use case; develop an architecture for exchanging the required data among the AOC, aircraft, and traffic flow management to facilitate TBO negotiations; and conduct a proof of concept demonstration.","Our Negotiator prototype provides useful capabilities to include in the ATD-2 and ATD-3 demos. We propose a solution to the trajectory negotiation process common to many dynamic flight operations. The architecture provides a platform for NASA AOSP research, able to test trajectory algorithms and negotiation protocols with a AOC-aircraft communications and application testing infrastructure. Negotiator applies to new concepts such as urban air mobility that will require trajectory negotiation.","Our concept would be a mechanism for generating near term airline cost savings; over time, it supports larger benefits from enabling more comprehensive TBO capabilities into the NAS. Our architecture would support more extensive trajectory negotiation in-flight, complementing current pre-departure trajectory negotiations such as CTOP. More generally, our design supports greater sharing of airspace constraints with operators, which has long been an objective of the airlines."

Only a small fraction of airports have surface surveillance and in almost every case coverage is limited to the airport’s movement area.  A solution is needed that can compensate for the shortage of surveillance and is economically feasible to deploy and maintain at any airport. The Airport Surface State Event Tracker (ASSET) provides improved awareness of surface traffic in the absence of surveillance, improving the efficiency of surface and airspace traffic management.  ASSET uses sensor data (e.g., location, velocity) from existing mobile devices (e.g., Electronic Flight Bags (EFB), cell phones) to determine aircraft surface state events (e.g., push back from gate, taxiing, takeoff, etc.) and improve departure planning, surface management, and arrival sequencing.","ASSET improves surface situational awareness for airports not covered by FAA surveillance.

Runway metering must also consider the composition of the queue. Just as an empty queue wastes runway capacity, a queue with no flights to a constrained fix wastes capacity at that fix. The FAA’s Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) has requirements to support controllers in managing the runway queue to maintain pressure on the runway and mile-in-trail departure restrictions. Assume a 50 miles-in-trail (MIT) restriction on departures to a fix, surface metering assigns Target Movement Area entry Times separated by 10 minutes, and one of those departures has an issue and is late; an entire slot at the constrained fix could be wasted. To avoid this situation, controllers currently manually front-load at the runway demand for each restriction. Automation that supports surface metering must preserve this ability. To manage both the queue length for a runway and the number of aircraft in the queue subject to a MIT restriction, the TFDM requirements allow multiple simultaneous metering programs, and handle the situation in which a flight may be assigned multiple, different TMATs, by exempting a flight from runway metering if it is subject to MIT metering. However, the currently proposed TFDM implementation, built on existing software, does not support multiple metering programs. Thus, there is an immediate need to develop algorithmic approaches for metering the taxi of departures subject to enroute flow programs, in addition to but with separate control from metering departures to the runway.

Our innovative approach is to combine the retrospective method (use historical TMIs and delays on similar days for next-day prediction) with the predictive method (use fast-time simulation of next-day’s weather, TMIs and resulting delays, based on the translated weather forecast) into a seamless ensemble. Until now, only the first part – historical analysis – was used for such predictions, and even then mostly short-range. However, AvMet has developed and validated a powerful weather-aware, superfast-time NAS simulator, DART, which can reproduce historically observed outcomes of a wide range of weather-impacted days with a good degree of accuracy and process a complex day of NAS operations in just over a minute. Our technology also has the potential to automate and accelerate similar-weather searches. This opens the door to an ensemble approach where both historical and simulation-driven forecasting methods are combined for next-day delay prediction and TMI recommendations. The methodology will be designed as a fully automated toolchain to work year-round, processing convective as well as non-convective (ceilings, winter weather, wind, etc.) weather impacts. It will use a number of innovative weather forecast translation, TMI simulation, and ensembling techniques. It will also use new and creative randomization methods to generate a range of potential scenarios based on next-day weather forecast. We believe that, by tuning the blend of retrospective and predictive ensemble methods, we should be able to utilize their strengths and mitigate their shortcomings, and demonstrate noticeably better predictive accuracy of this amalgamated ensemble vs. historical-only or simulated-only methods.","This SBIR will provide NASA with a new retrospective-predictive methodology for quantifying weather impacts on the NAS and for developing traffic management applications, as well as for understanding the role of each component in the overall ensemble. NASA’s own fast-time air traffic simulation models can be utilized as part of this ensemble approach. The innovative weather translation techniques, similar weather impact analysis metrics & computation methods may be of additional value.","For major airlines, airports or travel service providers, combining retrospective analysis with a predictive component driven by a NAS simulator will improve delay forecasting.

It is highly relevant to the NASA 2018 SBIR Focus Area 20, Subtopic A3.01 Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts, since it addresses the area of “achieving high efficiency in using aircraft, airports, enroute and terminal airspace resources, while accommodating an increasing variety of missions and vehicle types, including wide-spread integration of UAS and ODM operations” because noise can be a greatly limiting factor in determining efficiencies, due to the expected high frequency of ODM operations and the potential noise impacts on communities. Specifically, it is relevant to the RFP area of “concepts of emergent risks” because increased noise impacts are a risk to the system, and public backlash to ODM and e-VTOL noise impacts can thwart the concept and technology before it launches. There are three parts to the innovation: (1) the ability to calculate in near real-time the noise impacts at any location using both real-time and predicted flight operations and trajectories, (2) the ability to model the noise of conceptual e-VTOL aircraft, and (3) the development of people-focused noise metrics that consider the movement of people throughout the day. NASA’s Parimal Kopardekar, has stated on more than one occasion that noise is one of the top three challenges for UAM. UNIT provides noise results within a real-time environment to be used as input parameters into flight path optimization algorithms to minimize population noise impacts, thereby increasing public acceptance of UAM.  This capability is important because communities are highly sensitive to noise and have blocked change when they believe their rights have been inadequately addressed","The ATM-X Testbed sub-project can leverage our integrated UNIT software with the real-time Testbed simulations to analyze the environmental impacts of future UAM e-VTOL scenarios, as well as non-UAM scenarios and conventional fixed-wing and rotary-wing air traffic operations.

Safely achieving full autonomy and higher density in the NAS requires that the position of every aircraft in a given airspace be known to all participants in that airspace with a very high level of integrity.  GNSS  (including GPS) and ADS-B can provide sufficient aircraft-to-aircraft accuracy, but the inherent vulnerabilities of GNSS and ADS-B  to interference, jamming and spoofing require  that GNSS and ADS-B systems be independently validated for accuracy.  The ATCRBS (Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System), based on ground-based radar interrogation of transponders, provides redundant position information in many situations.  Where position information from both ADS-B and ATCRBS exists, it can be compared for purposes of verification and validation.)  Valid position information needs to be available real time for an autonomous system to provide safe navigation, particularly for collision avoidance.  .  This proposal will develop a flexible, multi-lateration system that easily integrates the ATCRBS capability of position information into modern avionics designed for ADS-B as well as transponders.  This allows redundant independent verification of the location all equipped aircraft in all airspace.   The proposed approach can effectively provide high integrity aircraft location information that can be used for navigation and T-CAS safety functions based on aircraft-to-aircraft ADS-B data, significantly reducing usage of the transponder spectrum.",Independent Validation of GPS and ADS-B will enable trusted use of  ADS-B and allow much higher density use of all airspace for UAS and  air transport vehicles.

Current airspace operations rely primarily on onboard human pilots to assess the severity of turbulence and respond appropriately.  The future air transportation system will have increasing levels of autonomy, and many operations will be conducted without a skilled human operator onboard.  Automated systems are thus needed to assess how turbulence is impacting an air vehicle and to respond appropriately.  Future airspace operations will also occur in different environments. In particular, dramatically expanded low-altitude operations, including operations in urban environments, will occur as concepts such as those for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) become a reality.  Much of the effort that has been devoted to turbulence monitoring and forecasting in the past has targeted commercial transport operations, especially high-altitude cruise conditions.  Turbulence in the urban canyon is driven by different physical processes, and it has different characteristics than high-altitude turbulence.  New models of turbulence need to be developed to support prediction of turbulence in low-altitude environments, including the urban canyon, and to perform onboard turbulence identification.   The proposed work will develop the Turbulence Modeling and Decision Support System for UAS, with a focus on very low altitude operations by future air vehicles.  It will include development of new model structures that capture the characteristics of turbulence in the urban boundary layer, the roughness sub layer, and the urban canopy layer.  It will include development of onboard approaches to identify turbulence levels, methods to predict turbulence, and decision making tools for both short term responses to turbulence and mission planning based on turbulence predictions.","The proposed technology will help to enable increasingly autonomous operations, directly supporting the goals of the UAS Integration in the NAS project started by ARMD in 2011, and the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) project begun in 2015.

Our approach builds off the existing knowledge base of airline operations, leveraging emerging technologies that enable autonomous flight. Our approach enables monitoring of vehicles systems and data, coupled with auto-upload of dynamic flight data required to support safe and efficient flight operation (e.g., change in flight plan, evolutionary new destinations, etc.). We build on our expertise in airline dispatch and software applications for air-ground integration. Our system adds to existing tools and software, providing an evolutionary pathway for the monitoring and control of multiple semi-autonomous and autonomous flights by a single operator. We propose and develop new functionality to accelerate this transition. Our vision aims to extend and enhance our current expertise to transition the functions of today’s airline dispatchers to future airspace and vehicle concepts.","Our research will support several NASA projects and milestones. For urban air mobility, we define the ground-based capabilities they require and offer NASA a technology solution to air-ground integration to support monitoring and control. Our prototype would be available to support UAM demonstrations during a Phase II period of performance. For system wide safety, we offer a design and prototype that could support a safe transition to autonomous operations.","In the near term, our research will benefit the developers and future operators of new urban air mobility and package delivery services as all of them need to implement a ground-based, dispatch operational control system such as we propose.

Loss of C2 and navigation links is a significant hazard even for current generation systems, and future systems that will operate with a high level of automation and autonomy, often without a highly-skilled operator onboard, will be even more susceptible to lost links.  NASA has identified “Critical system failure…including loss of C2 link, loss or degraded GPS” as a key safety-critical risk relevant to future aviation systems.The proposed research effort will develop tools to analyze RF link coverage and support decision making that enhances system safety by minimizing the likelihood of lost links.  The proposed tools will also enable intelligent responses to lost links that maximize the likelihood links are quickly and safely restored.  The approach builds on an existing commercial software tool for RF propagation analysis, adding features to address challenges unique to the operation of future aviation systems, specifically features to enhance the accuracy of RF propagation analysis at low altitudes and to compute time-varying satellite-based-navigation coverage maps.  Very low altitude operations play a significant role in future aviation system concepts, including UAS operations such as those envisioned to occur within the UAS Traffic Management framework, and emerging Urban Air Mobility concepts.  The proposed research would enhance RF propagation modeling capabilities near and below the tops of obstructions including buildings and vegetation.  The work will also build on risk-based path planning tools for UAS currently being developed by the team, integrating RF coverage analysis as an additional consideration in generating minimum-risk paths.","The proposed technology will directly support the goals of the UAS Integration in the NAS project started by ARMD in 2011, and the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) project begun in 2015. The proposed work will support NASA's emerging interest in Urban Air Mobility to provide a “safe and efficient system for air passenger and cargo transportation within an urban area”.

Verus Research has teamed with Georgia Tech and Penn State on this effort to propose VEREUS, the VErification and RE-planning for Unmanned aerial system Safety tool, which leverages a unified formal methods foundation to verify that multiple forms of risk do not exceed prespecified levels for given UAS trajectories, and to mitigate risks as necessary. The purpose of VEREUS is to automate as much of the trajectory safety verification and necessary re-planning as possible, in as rigorous a manner as possible despite the myriad uncertainties present in UAS Traffic Management (UTM), to decrease the burden on the UAS operator and future UAS Service Suppliers while improving safety, thus significantly increasing the number of UAS that can be managed by a single entity. To achieve this goal, we propose the following tool features: a) offline trajectory assessment to ensure compliance with risk and other Air Navigation Service Provider directed constraints, b) re-planning as required to meet any constraints initially violated, and c) real-time support to ensure continued safety as requirements and trajectories change online. At the end of Phase I, the applicability of formal methods for use in assessing risk to people on the ground, verification of trajectory constraint satisfaction, and re-planning subject to risk constraints will be established, and the building blocks for full development of VEREUS will be in place. VEREUS will ultimately be an integral tool for advancing NASA’s UTM efforts, ensuring safe, requirement-satisfying trajectories in an automated fashion.","VEREUS will provide direct benefits to NASA’s UAS Traffic Management (UTM) effort, as a tool used to approve and monitor UAS trajectories. The formal methods components of VEREUS will be available for immediate integration with current NASA UTM risk assessment frameworks. VEREUS can also serve as an interface between operators and the ANSP for all airspace systems that utilize 4D Trajectory Based Operations (TBO), thus aiding NASA’s NextGen TBO development and integration efforts.","VEREUS will ultimately transition to the private service suppliers that manage regional UAS operations. Further, both the FAA and the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research program are aiming for a future TBO system, and VEREUS will be applicable to their efforts. The military also relies on UAS operations, and must account for safety concerns. VEREUS can thus aid in verifying and enforcing risk constraints for DoD customers as well."

The Airspace Monitor combines data on weather, infrastructure state, traffic density, and aircraft positions and planned trajectories with predictive analytics on aircraft separations and conflict rates to infer the (hidden) risk state of the airspace. The Flight Monitor uses airline and aircraft-based data to evaluate potential aircraft risks from equipment state and certification, and the potential for pilot fatigue based on elapsed crew duty time and time of day. Our architecture can readily add real-time crew monitoring in future instantiations. Separating the airspace and flight monitoring modules offers a significant development and deployment benefit. All the data for the Airspace Monitor are publicly available and the module can be built and applied NAS-wide without restriction. All airline proprietary and personal data are contained within the Flight Monitor under direct airline control. The airline can access our airspace risk assessment monitor and combine it with its proprietary flight and personnel information to monitor its flights. Our Flight Monitor also offers the available infrastructure to expand into more detailed pilot and aircraft monitoring. We will demonstrate how our tool can integrate with airline operations decision support systems to provide a monitoring and alerting system for use by dispatchers in real-time. Our system will also provide for continuous data collection and storage, enabling follow-on trend and statistical analyses of flight operational issues, pilot fatigue, and anomalies by airline safety officials and NASA researchers.",Our FAAM prototype would provide a key component for meeting Real-time System-wide Safety Assurance milestone for terminal area safety margin monitoring.

These developments have introduced cyber-attack vulnerabilities which did not exist in older-generation avionics systems.  To counter the emerging threats and increased vulnerabilities, an ability to comprehensively and systematically assess aviation cybersecurity risks is needed.  Tools are needed to support the design of new aircraft systems as well as tools that can support routine inspections on an airframe-by-airframe basis. ATC-NY proposes SilverlineAN, an assessment management platform for aviation system-level cybersecurity.  SilverlineAN provides a principled, machine-readable record of both manual and automated cybersecurity risk assessment procedures and results for individual components/subsystems, computes system-level metrics, and facilitates re-evaluation throughout the system’s lifecycle. SilverlineAN aggregates individual component/subsystem results into a larger attack model, which can be used to assess system-level risk. The SilverlineAN tool can serve both as development tool and in a maintenance capacity. For example, during the development of a new avionics component under a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), the developing organization could test the the component for cyber-vulnerabilities using the SilverlineAN tool.  In a maintenance capacity, an AMT (Aviation Maintenance Technician) might use SilverlineAN to verify that an avionics installation or update on a particular airframe has not introduced any cyber-vulnerabilities.","SilverlineAN provides NASA with a capability to support ongoing aviation safety research. SilverlineAN can assess the cybersecurity and safety of integrated/advanced avionic systems; air-ground automation systems; and communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) links. SilverlineAN can also help NASA assess the cybersecurity and safety risk of future concepts that depend on interconnected systems, including Single Pilot Operations (SPO), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), and on-demand mobility.","SilverlineAN is an integrated platform to protect current and future aviation systems from safety impacting cyber threats. The trend in aviation is greater sharing of data between aircraft and ground facilities as well as between aircraft. SilverlineAN supports the increasing need for security assessments for airworthiness certification (e.g. DO-326A). SilverlineAN lets providers better manage interconnected system-level security during design, certification and throughout the system lifecycle."

Production of mission consumables from in-situ Mars resources is enabling and critical for human exploration of the Mars surface and for minimizing the number and size of landers and the crew ascent vehicle.To understand both the dust concentration before filtration as well as the effectiveness of dust filtration techniques used in ISRU operations, NASA is interested in a dust sensor to measure 0.1 to 5 micron sized dust particles in the Mars atmosphere acquired for processing.

This in-line particle concentration/size monitor is based on a variant of laser intensity attenuation.  The method is compact, low power, can be multiplexed to increase throughput and/or dynamic range, uses no consumable, and is independent of carrier gas, gas temperature and gas pressure.","The initial application of this proposed sensor, is for dust particle size and concentration measurements at the gas inlet of an ISRU system.

In the LSP, propanol is cooled to temperatures below -100 C, where it becomes an effective solvent for Mars atmospheric CO2. After absorbing 5 percent or more by mole CO2, the propanol is pumped to another vessel where it is heated to 30 C, releasing the CO2 at pressures of more than 1 bar. The clean warm propanol is then sent back to the absorption vessel, exchanging heat with the cold absorption column effluent as it goes. After the clean propanol is cooled to near the design absorption temperature in this way, a mechanical refrigerator is used to achieve the final temperature reduction. Advantages of the LSP are that it can operate continuously day or night without the need for mechanical vacuum roughing pumps, solid freezers, or large sorption beds, requires less power than other options, is readily scalable to high outputs, and that it stops all sulfur, dust, or non-condensable gases from reaching the ISRU reactor system. In the proposed SBIR Phase 1, an operating LSP will be demonstrated and its performance assessed.","The primary initial application of the LSP is to provide a reliable, low cost, low mass technology to acquire CO2 on the surface of Mars out of the local atmosphere at low power. Such a system can be used to enable human exploration of Mars, as well as a Mars Sample Return mission. The LSP is dramatically superior to current alternative methods of collecting Mars CO2 because its power requirement is much less. The LSP could also be used by NASA to reduce its own CO2 emissions.","The LSP could be used to separate CO2 from flue gas. The US coal-fired electric power industry is in trouble because its CO2 emissions exceed government guidelines. The LSP can solve this by providing an economical method of collecting pure CO2 from flue gas. Once separated the CO2 could be used to enable enhanced oil recovery, expanding US oil production while combatting climate change."

NASA has identified oxygen, water, and methane as the most critical assets that could be acquired by means of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Given that the Martian atmosphere is 95.9% CO2, atmospheric processing is the most feasible ISRU method of producing O2, H2O, and CH4. The MOXIE experiment is underway to demonstrate in-situ production of O2 for propellant and for breathing on Mars (Mars 2020 Rover). The gas produced by ISRU CO2 processing needs to be ""completely dry"" for cryogenic liquefaction, as traces of residual water can impede the efficiency of cryogenic storage and combustion, but commercial technologies for monitoring traces of water in ""dry"" gases are too bulky and complex for use in space or on Mars. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will develop a compact humidity monitor to detect low ppmv of water in oxygen and methane, designed to meet the requirements for space exploration and operation in combustible environments. The proposed monitor will incorporate a novel luminescent sensor element, which consists of a luminescent indicator dye highly sensitive to water vapor, immobilized in a polymer support. The optical technique is time-based, which gives it excellent reliability and accuracy, and avoids the drawbacks of intensity-based measurements. IOS has developed and delivered humidity sensors for NASA space suit development programs, demonstrating operation in oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases, and has demonstrated that it can monitor low ppm of water. In Phase I, we will demonstrate a novel sensitive element for detecting low ppm of water, focusing on sensitivity, measurement range, and minimal or no maintenance on long term missions. In Phase II, IOS will develop the complete monitoring system, which could also accommodate sensors for other gases of interest in ISRU units (O2, CO2…).","The most direct application for the proposed sensor would be humidity monitoring in ISRU systems for the Mars atmosphere. We anticipate initial infusion of this technology in ground demonstrators, and later in small scale ISRU systems such as the MOXIE experiment. The technology's suitability for miniaturization and multiplexing, and its capability of incorporating additional sensors will open opportunities for application in any Mars Atmosphere-Based or Regolith-Based ISRU program.","The humidity monitoring market can be divided into low ppm moisture monitoring applications (in the gas and petrochemical industries) and ambient relative humidity monitoring. We are already developing a low cost device for ambient humidity monitoring, adapting sensor elements initially developed for monitoring humidity in spacesuits. Transition of our technology to the low ppm moisture monitoring market will follow, and the proposed project represents an excellent opportunity in that direction."

The redox tolerant cathode material will reduce system complexity, tolerate flow upset conditions, and provide flexibility in space based systems without a man-in-the-loop. Solid oxide electrolysis stacks use nickel – zirconia composite cathode to reduce incoming oxidized species such as those available on Mars (e.g. carbon dioxide) to produce high purity oxygen.  The device can also operate on co-electrolysis mode where the atmosphere CO2 and water and other volatiles from extra-terrestrial soils can be processed together to produce oxygen and fuels such as methane for propulsion, regenerative power, and life support system applications. Present state of the art electrolysis stacks use a nickel-zirconia composite cathode. Nickel based electrodes are susceptible to oxidation by the feed gas (CO2 or steam) at the inlet conditions unless reduced species (carbon monoxide or hydrogen) are also present. This necessitates a complex, recycle loop that introduces a fraction of the product gases to the inlet. Prior attempts at developing an oxidation resistant cathode evaluated precious metal or ceramic oxides. They exhibited excellent stability in CO2 and steam, but the performance of cells was significantly lower relative to nickel based electrode. The proposed cathode material is expected to be stable in an oxidizing environment with little or no deleterious oxidation. This will allow a significant simplicity in electrolysis system design, facilitate the utilization of in situ resources to produce oxygen and fuels, resulting in the development of an enabling technology for future manned mission to Mars.","The proposed technology when successfully demonstrated will enable production of oxygen by electrolyzing Mars atmosphere CO2 and will co-produce carbon monoxide with a simpler system design.

This allows highly efficient conversion and storage of vast quantities of renewable energy in chemical and fuel form. The technology can also produce hydrogen from steam electrolysis at very high efficiencies.

These membranes are generally hygroscopic, subject to swelling in the presence of humidity or water. When restrained membranes undergo a hydration/dehydration changes, stresses are then generated which can lead to membrane failure. Given the harsh surface environmental conditions on the moon and Mars, more dehydration resistant and dimensionally stable PEM materials are highly desirable for better performance and durability and to allow for long term dry storage and delivery of ISRU systems. Giner herein proposes to create a reinforced proton exchange membrane using a low equivalent weight (EW) short-side-chain (SSC) ionomer and Giner’s Dimensionally Stable Membranes®™ (DSM) matrix support. In this design, the DSM support is filled with low EW SSC PFSA ionomers. With the added strength inherent in the DSM support, these PEMs can be made thinner and be impregnated with a high-acid-content low EW ionomer to improve the water retention and maintain excellent dimensional stability. Our proposed design has multiple advantages to address the dehydration issues for NASA applications and is expected to achieve improved performance and reduced cost. The water retention property will be greatly enhanced by using a low EW SSC ionomer compared to Nafion. The other associated properties, e.g. protonic conductivity, dimensional stability, wet-dry cycling durability, and freeze/thaw thermal cycling durability are expected to improve significantly as well. In addition, our design has a more cost effective fabrication and ease of scaling up than Gore-Select membrane using e-PTFE support and other nanofiber electrospinning methods.","The developed high performance reinforced proton exchange membranes can be used in the vapor feed electrolyzers, PEM fuel cells and regenerative fuel cells etc., which found broad applications in NASA, including but not limited to Lunar and space stations, satellites, high altitude aircraft.","This membrane material can be readily applied to fuel cells employed in vehicles, portable devices and remote installations. The unique properties of the supported membrane will also facilitate the commercialization of these technologies. The advanced membranes can also be used in applications including hydrogen filling stations, and chlor-alkali process etc."

Cavitation and other unsteady flow-induced phenomena in some components of liquid rocket engines as well as testing can induce not only high-cycle fatigue but also structure failure, and possibly extensive damages to these components. The proposed work seeks to deliver a robust computational modeling capability to accurately predict and model the transient fluid structure interaction between cryogenic fluids and immersed components to predict the dynamic loads, frequency response of NASA’s test facilities, and to substantially reduce the costs of NASA's test and launch operations. The key features of the proposed work are:  (a) Accurate and efficient unsteady cryogenic cavitation simulation methodology, and (b) A robust first principles based fluid-structure interaction (FSI) capability.  Both these methodologies will be tightly coupled within the framework of the Loci-STREAM code which is a Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver already in use at NASA for a variety of applications. This project seeks to further improve the current cavitation models within Loci-STREAM to achieve production status at NASA for time-accurate simulations of cavitating flows and at the same time integrate a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) methodology into Loci-STREAM. This will involve upgrading the current cavitation models in Loci-STREAM, improving the numerics of the solution algorithm from an efficiency point of view, improving coupling of the cavitation models and the FSI module with Loci-STREAM, and assessing the predictive capability for cases relevant to NASA.",,

This design is intended as a “drop-in” replacement for an existing valve used in rocket engine component testing. The operating environment, pressures to 15,000 psi and flow rates of 1,000 lbm/sec of Gaseous Nitrogen, have proved problematic for the existing valve designs. High cost of repairs and limited life has resulted in an increase in cost for testing. C-Suite is the NASA licensee of the valve, which was designed to resolve the issues created by the high pressure, flow, and acoustic vibration environment at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) rocket engine test stands.. This innovative design eliminates the valve stem and stem seals, as well as the need for conventional actuators, which are the frequent source of failures and fugitive, often toxic propellant emissions. The innovative valve is called ""Floating Piston Valve"" (FPV); it does not have any moving parts that are connected to the atmosphere and no adjustments are required. The flow path through the valve is all 100% axisymmetric, meaning that the forces generated by the flow through the valve create only radial forces that cancel, or create axial forces that either cancel or are controllable. The FPV's internal piston is balanced such that the seating force is immune to the pressure drop across the valve greatly improving seat wear and providing much longer, useful life without maintenance and refurbishment interruptions.  The FPV is simpler to manufacture (5 parts vs. hundreds of parts for comparable ball valves) and is expected to have far greater utility (600+ duty cycles vs. 20-30 duty cycles for comparable ball valves).  Finally, because there are no moving parts connected to the atmosphere, it will eliminate fugitive emissions, many of which are toxic and waste costly propellant chemicals.","The Floating Piston Valve (FPV) will replace the large ball valves used to control ultra-high pressure and high-volume flows of propellants and gaseous nitrogen at rocket engine ground test stands. Benefits of the FPV include (a) much longer onstream time, (b) lower total capital costs, (c) less expensive, faster refurbishment turnarounds, and (d) longer life between repairs.  The reduced downtime will drastically reduce expensive opportunity cost penalties associated with test delays.","The FPV has already proven successful as a superior pilot operated relief valve for a manufacturer of CNG and H2 tube trailers; additional high pressure uses for  ultra-high pressure, high-volume propellant flow control for the private spacecraft industry, pressure relief devices for CNG-powered vehicles, remotely operated, reliable supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) pipelines, and certain high-pressure applications in chemical, petrochemical and oil refinery operations."

The AMIS is based on use of novel materials for high-temperature operation and uniquely designed fiber optic sensors. The AMIS sensors can tolerate operating temperatures up to 1800 degrees C and achieve measurement errors within 0.5% for temperature sensors and 0.2% for pressure and strain sensors. In mass production, each additive-manufactured microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor will cost about $10. In Phase I RISL will demonstrate the feasibility of AMIS for in-situ measurement of temperature and strain by fabricating and testing a technology readiness level (TRL)-4 prototype, with the goal of achieving TRL-6 by the end of Phase II.","The AMIS will provide for NASA an in situ sensor suite capable of measuring temperature, pressure, and strain in high temperature (up to 1800°C) and/or high radiation environment to enhance proven, state-of-the-art propulsion test facilities. It can be incorporated into Stennis Space Center (SSC) rocket ground test facility to enhance Chemical and Advanced Propulsion technology development and certification. The AMIS system can also be incorporated into SSC’s Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Ground Test Exhaust Capture System for measurement of engine exhaust gas temperature and pressure. This development will support multiple NASA missions including human mission to Mars.","The AMIS can be used to replace thermocouples that are currently used for turbine engine exhaust gas temperature and pressure measurement.  It can be incorporated into the nuclear power plant for temperature, pressure, and strain monitoring of nuclear reactors to ensure safe operation.

The hydrogen embrittlement problems endemic to industries that require heavy use of hydrogen have been solved in various ways. Most of these solutions involve the careful development of alloys that are less susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Unfortunately, these alloys often require a sacrifice of some other highly desired material property, such as strength, hardness, ductility, etc. Coatings have also been attempted. However, these coatings and coating techniques have their own drawbacks, which include ceramic coatings that flake off after only a few use cycles and coating techniques that cannot deposit onto a finished part because they require line of sight during deposition. To better mitigate the very pressing hydrogen embrittlement challenge, Summit Information Solutions, Inc. proposes the use of a mature deposition technique that has not seen much use outside of the microelectronics industry. A thin film encapsulate will be deposited onto test samples of Inconel 718 and A-286 austenitic stainless steel. The coating material has a melting temperature in excess of 5500 °C, and is non-reactive with hydrogen. The coated samples’ properties will be tested, and the results will be compared to those of the untreated samples. Summit’s goal for Phase I is to show that the surface treatment is a robust layer at elevated temperatures. The extensive hydrogen embrittlement tests will be conducted in Phase II of the project.","The success of this feasibility study for a hydrogen embrittlement mitigation layer will have a wide breadth of NASA applications. Several NASA applications that will benefit from the development of this technology include test stand components for engine testing, long term storage of hydrogen in storage vessels, nuclear thermal propulsion applications on the newly developing NTP program, because our proposed surface layer also shows literature evidence of radiation protection, among others.","Hydrogen embrittlement is a challenge for all industries that require the use of hydrogen around metallic surfaces. The coating we are proposing has seen some initial use in the nuclear industry in reactor vessels. However, traditionally the individual parts must be coated and then joined. This produces seams that are left unprotected after joining. Our deposition technology will allow this already in-use coating technique to be utilized without the drawbacks of piecemeal coating of the parts."

In order to reduce cost and simplify service of infrastructure, automation of multiple processes is highly desirable. In this approach, Autonomous Control Technologies perform functions such as anomaly and fault detection, fault isolation, diagnostics and prognostics for critical components. There is a clear need for instrumented monitoring of critical seal components of the propellant delivery system, since a loss of propellant lines integrity can cause great damage, as learned from the Challenger accident, which was caused by a faulty O-ring. A team of physicists and engineers from AT-Tek will design, fabricate, and test an inexpensive elastomer seal with an embedded sensor that can be in-situ-interrogated by compact electronics built into the vacuum flange. The integrated “smart seal” package can self-monitor such parameters as compression and elasticity of the seal material, both of which are critical for preventing catastrophic seal failures.  Compared to previous attempts, AT-Tek’s novel approach will dramatically increase the sensitivity of the detection of critical seal parameters and realize a practical smart seal for the first time. The ultimate goal of this innovation is to integrate a smart seal into an autonomous propellant management infrastructure, thus enabling condition-based maintenance (not time-based) of critical elastomer seals for the first time. Another advantage of seal monitoring is ability to detect degradation of the seal before actual failure, with an option to adjust process parameters (pressure, temperature, etc) or bypass the degrading connection without aborting the process. This will minimize the risk of failure even if maintenance of degrading seal is not readily possible. If successful, the AT-Tek smart seal will form another smart asset integrated into NASA’s Autonomous Control Technologies system.","Ground Launch Operations (Focus area 16, H10.02):  This innovation introduces smart seals into the autonomous propellant management infrastructure under current NASA development to enhance safety and reduce costs of ground and payload operations. Life Support and Habitation Systems (Focus Area 6, H6.01, H4.01):   Smart seals for airtight barrier between the internal space of a habitat and an external environment,  applications in airlocks, docking systems in habitat structures and space suits.","Department of Energy Nuclear Power Plants:  Reduce risks poised by faulty O-rings in nuclear plants. Leak Prevention in Natural Gas Pipelines:   The seals are a frequent cause of leaks in pipeline valves; and smart seals are needed to address this deficiency.

This has helped NASA better understand man’s reaction to space by monitoring astronauts’ temperature, respiration, and cardiac activity. The proposed Dynamic Kinematic Recorder (DKR) is designed to measure the biomechanical vibration, impact and motion of astronauts’ head, neck, body and helmet.  Astronauts can be subjected to excessive vibration and shock during launch, re-entry or abort scenarios.  Biomechanical measurements in these conditions have unique challenges.  Safety of flight is essential and the proposed DKR is required to be an ultra-low power system that minimizes size and weight and runs autonomously. DTS has unique experience developing similar systems over the past 27 years, including work with NASA measuring crew biomechanics.  DTS has developed systems to measure the kinematic motion of rodeo riders, aerobatic pilots, ejection seat manikins, roller coaster riders, soldiers in combat, and most recently football players through a research project funded by the NFL.  All DTS systems are designed in accordance with SAE J211 recommendations. Recent technology advances in MEMS sensing and microprocessor technology now make it possible to deliver a relatively low cost, small, light and autonomous system to measure crew biomechanics.  Unique to this proposal is a technical breakthrough in angular sensing technology that reduces size and power by orders of magnitude.  DTS proposes to deliver a revolutionary prototype 6DOF Dynamic Kinematic Recorder that will have greater than 10-fold reduction in size and mass compared to existing systems.  This autonomous system would be small, ultra-low power and weigh less than 20 grams.","Due to its ultra-low power and miniature size, the development of the proposed Dynamic Kinematic Recorder (DKR) will allow for the monitoring of biomechanical linear and angular accelerations in applications where it was not practical to do so with previous solutions.  The DKR can be used to monitor astronaut exposure to vibration and shock, as well as monitoring seat or other spacecraft structures.",The Dynamic Kinematic Recorder (DKR) has wide application in other industries.  First and foremost is the measurement of head motion to help understand traumatic brain injury in sports and soldiers in blast and field environments.  Other applications include high value asset monitoring during shipping.  A DKR could be attached to the asset to monitor shock and vibration levels during transit.

Far UV sanitation is deceptively simple, yet it is a profound advance in disinfection that is applicable to any bacteria and/or virus. Far UV does not utilize environmentally challenging chemicals, does not inadvertently create super-bugs as antibiotics have more recently been shown to do and does not require water. Far UV is superior to existing legacy UV sanitation because legacy UV sanitation systems are ineffective at sanitizing objects that are exposed to UV-A (sunlight, fluorescent lights and other light sources) after sanitation and are a safety risk for direct human exposure. This means the legacy UV systems cannot sanitize food that requires post harvest handling in lighted facilities. Far UV is the first UV sanitation and the first to be safe for direct human exposure.

Also, wipes cannot easily disinfect produce with a lot of crevices, such as leafy vegetables or radishes.  Other disinfection methods investigated by researchers have included hydrogen peroxide and cold plasma, which both negatively impact food quality.  Chemical methods that produce toxic by-products or residues on the produce are unacceptable solutions.

An ozone generator diffuses safe levels of re-generable ozone into the wash-water stream for disinfection without noticeable reduction in food quality.  Optionally, a Pro-San® wash water solution provides an alternate disinfection method.  A self-cleaning mode reduces crew time needed for maintenance and increases long term reliability.  Pro-WASH™ operates across gravity regimes (0-1 g).

Cosmic-ray interactions within the lunar soil will yield secondary neutrons and protons, among other particles. The produced neutrons will travel within the soil, scattering off of materials such as hydrogen. Interactions with hydrogen will greatly reduce the energy of the neutrons, causing a measurable depression of epithermal neutrons. A measurement of the ratio between thermal and epithermal neutrons can therefore yield an understanding of the hydrogen content of the soil.  A previous collaboration between Radiation Detection Technologies, Inc. (RDT), Kansas State University (KSU), and Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has developed and produced an instrument which is capable of accurately measuring the hydrogen content of soil based on neutron emissions from the surface.  The TRL 3 instrument utilizes alternating layers of neutron moderator (HDPE) and solid-state neutron detectors, with each incremental detector layer more sensitive to higher-energy neutrons than the previous. The NES can effectively scan for water at the lunar surface from zero altitude, which allows for unmatched spatial resolution. Proposed in Phase I, existing computational models will be refined and validated using the existing NES in real-world measurements. The updated computational models will be used to design a space-worthy instrument that will serve the purpose of determining the moisture content of the lunar soil. An early feasibility study will be conducted to determine what weaknesses exist in the present design in terms of survivability of the instrument under the worst of lunar conditions. In Phase II, the proposed assembly will be developed to TRL 6, wherein a roving prototype will be built and tested.","A compact, low-power neutron energy spectrometer (NES) would accurately measure the radiation dose to astronauts. The proposed NES can measure neutron dose to higher accuracy than existing technologies, which are bulky (7-12 kg) and can suffer poor inaccuracy (>50%) because these instruments cannot differentiate thermal, epithermal, or fast neutrons from each other. A multi-channel NES would achieve improved accuracy by including neutron energy information and reducing weight.","The original NES was developed to replace aging neutron dosimeters used aboard nuclear naval vessels for the Dept. of Defense. Surveys of ships are conducted to ensure that radiation levels do not pose a danger to the crew. A handheld NES would provide more accurate feedback and be less burdensome to the operator. Similarly, an improved dosimeter is desired at the Dept. of Energy nuclear reactor locations, such as Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) facility, where operation of the reactor varies."

Texas Tech University (TTU) has experimented with variations on a membrane-aerated bioreactor since 2002.  Its most recent iteration, the rCOMANDR unit, is an aerobic process which treats space wastewater at a rate equivalent to that produced by 2 crew/day, achieving >50% conversion of organic nitrogen to NO2 and NO3 (NOx) and >85% removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with ~90% of NOx in the form of nitrite.  Effluent NH3-N:NO2-N is typically near 1:1. Pancopia has developed an alternative approach using a consortium of aerobic Nitrifiers with anaerobic Denitrifiers and anammoX (NDX), which was successful in removing 85% of ammonia and carbon.  A key element in this system, the anammox bacteria, oxidizes ammonia with nitrite at a 1:1.3 ratio to produce N2 gas, allowing the removal of nitrogen without oxygen or organic carbon requirement. This enables a greater overall removal of nitrogen in typically carbon-limited space wastewaters. As the focus of this Phase 1 SBIR, Pancopia proposes investigating the feasibility of a second-stage anammox reactor to remove most of remaining ammonia and nitrite from rCOMANDR effluent. Phase 1 criterion for assessing the feasibility of the proposed second-stage anammox process for removal of ammonia and nitrite is an average removal of more than 50% of ammonia and nitrite from rCOMANDR effluent in two of the three test reactors during the 4-week test period.",,

Water, along with oxygen and food, is a critical life sustaining factor. Shipping of water from earth for extended space missions is impossible because of the unwieldy nature of transport, both in terms of costs and logistics involved.  Thus recycling and reclamation is the only way to ensure that every drop of water counts. MMI will develop a photocatalytic capillary membrane distillation system for the reclamation of water from urine and other forms of impure water that are produced by human life in space.  When installed in a spacecraft/space station, this will reduce or eliminate the need to transport water from earth.  The incorporation of the photocatalytic unit to decompose the organic impurities in water will prevent fouling of the capillary membrane, thus enabling long term use of the reclamation unit during space travel.","Wastewater recycling/reclamation is crucial for successful long-duration space travel. Water available for recycling comes from three primary sources: humidity condensate, wash-water, and urine. The photocatalytic capillary membrane distillation system will be  integrated into Life Support and Habitation Systems of NASA that support Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems, Advanced Food Technology and Biological Life Support.","The water treatment unit can be used to purify drinking water supplied by public water suppliers as well as private bodies.

The general pharmacological properties of silver are based upon the affinity of silver ion for biologically important moieties such as sulfhydryl, amino, imidazole, carboxyl and phosphate groups, and these multiple mechanisms are primarily responsible for its antimicrobial activity. Silver can impact a cell through multiple biochemical pathways, making it difficult for a cell to develop resistance to it, and it can be precisely and efficiently delivered using controlled-release technology. An engineering approach is detailed that optimizes the epidemiological features of silver compounds in conjunction with the chemical and mechanical features desirable for long-duration space missions. Phase I builds upon three distinct engineering approaches to produce flow-through silver biocide delivery devices based on controlled-release designs that have multiple decades of success in process industrial applications. Phase II will consist of design optimization and extensive parametric testing to support on-site NASA tests and long-duration flight requirements. Phase II will also investigate a regenerate approach to maintaining device activity over multi-year operational lifetimes. The long-term results and benefits to the manned space program are high antimicrobial effectiveness, low toxicity, simple integration and operation into advanced life support systems, maximum operational life, and superior mass/volume efficiency compared to any other possible approach.","This technology is expected to be baselined for all future advanced space missions including Lunar and Mars bases, and vehicles required for transport to those destinations.

These failures require expensive and time-consuming maintenance and resupply, and the technologies are therefore limited to environments where these resources are available. Long duration spaceflight applications, such as extended stays at a Lunar Outpost or during a Mars transit mission, will increasingly benefit from water recovery hardware that is generally more robust and operationally sustainable over time, and that minimizes the impact of fouling and hardware failures. Our proposed water recovery concept takes advantage of the partial gravity on Mars or the lunar surface, while also being microgravity compatible. This will allow for a single water recovery system for both transit and planetary mission phases. This next-generation solid-state water recovery system for spacecraft will exploit a combination of advances in three areas of research, in order to manage wastewater recovery without rotating phase separators or chemical pretreatment. These research areas are:","The Nanophotonic Capillary Distiller concept can be applied to a wide spectrum of spacecraft fluid management systems, for both short-term use and long-duration missions.

The AOWG integrates steam reformation, and electrolysis to convert organic waste into water and a small amount of inorganic matter and oxygen products, thereby reducing transit fuel and tankage mass. The AOWG reduces risks associated with storing, handling, and disposing food waste and packaging, waste paper, wipes and towels, gloves, fecal matter, urine brine, and maximum absorbency garments in microgravity environments. The gasifier provides nearly complete conversion of feeds to valuable water and jettisoned gas with minimal losses and consumables requirements. The AOWG incorporates significant novel enhancements to previous state-of-the-art Trash to Gas (TtG) steam reforming technology including a feed preparation system, continuous feeder, and tar destruction reactor to produce clean water. The AOWG crew operation requirements consist of packaging wastes in a manner similar to the ‘football’ preparation methods currently used in state-of-the art TtG systems but are not limited to this preparation method. The actual operation of the AOWG is largely automated and requires minimal crew intervention. The proposed Phase I AOWG will be developed with a focus on achieving the maximum waste mass reduction simultaneous with water production using feeding, materials handling, and ancillary systems geared to microgravity operations. These concepts will be integrated into a flight ready Phase II design, which will simulate a microgravity environment necessary to operate the AOWG through startup, steady operation, and shutdown. This progression of development will lead to implementation in advanced human space missions.","AOWG system is key for human space exploration, converting organic crew wastes into clean water, a small mass of sterile inorganic residue, and clean gases suitable for venting from the spacecraft. The AOWG is targeted toward minimizing overall transit vehicle mass, which minimizes mass requirement for propellants and tankage. Waste mass reduction with water recovery is critical for life support and to reduce overall flight costs.","AOWG has applicability for terrestrial energy recovery, fuel synthesis, and chemicals synthesis from renewable resources, agricultural wastes, municipal wastes, and other organic-containing wastes including paper and plastics. These organic-containing resources can be processed by AOWG methods to produce syngas, which can be further converted into methanol or other fuels and chemicals using Fischer-Tropsch or other catalytic synthesis processes."

These new suits will require decreased mass and volume, improved functionality, and excellent reliability. More power is required than today’s suit can provide. The battery pack will be the main source of power and weight and needs to provide an energy source for life-support functions, communications, system health status, and other needs. In addition, the battery must operate safely under harsh conditions of extreme temperatures, mechanical injury, and tolerate radiation. NOHMs Technologies is proposing to develop ionic liquid based hybrid electrolytes for safe, high energy density, high voltage, and high power batteries for space suit applications. NOHMs will develop a safe electrolyte for LiCoO2 that prevents thermal runaway and allows LiCoO2 to be charged at a higher voltage resulting in higher capacity. Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (Li-ion) are promising energy storage options for space applications. When charged to 4.2V LiCoO2 delivers 140 mAh/g specific capacity, which is only 51% of the theoretically possible (272 mAh/g) based on the crystal structure and allowable Li-ions it can host. To extract the unutilized capacity from the LiCoO2, one has to electrochemically activate the cathode by charging to a potential > 4.5 V vs Li/Li+. It has been shown that the high voltage charging of LiCoO2 results in 28% increase in delivered capacity and 4% increase in the nominal voltage. However, conventional Li-ion battery electrolytes are not stable at such high voltages and complementary development of electrolytes that are stable at these voltages are needed. In this Phase I, we will design electrolytes with functional ionic liquids and co-solvents to enable a high voltage, thermally stable and electrolyte formulation for traditional LiCoO2 cathode materials.","Initial NASA space-based applications include space suit power and EVA applications which will be supported by a space suit manufacturer. Additional NASA applications are satellites, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and other electric flight programs.","Non-NASA commercial applications will include UAS platforms, satellites, and submarines. As battery lifetimes are increased to exceed current Li-ion technology, then larger commercial applications such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems will be addressable with this technology.

The innovation offers an attractive alternative to other designs for which integration with launch vehicle and lander/habitat structures is less than seamless, cleaning, deployment, and environmental effects can be an operational bottleneck, and structural support may depend on the terrain. The webbed array is a fundamentally new hierarchical tension-compression paradigm with a compression ring suspended from an elevated central platform with lanyards, and a network of catenaries and webbings connecting it to the hub.  The webbings support the actual array surface which constructed of flexible PV surface strips.  For stowage, the webbings, catenaries, and surface together wrap onto a rotating drum in the central hub, with the compression ring gradually collapsing and the suspension lanyards reeled in.  Stowage is compact and holds the sensitive PV surface in the tight embrace of mechanical parts from all directions. The surface structure is slack when deployed with cross-slopes and gaps for self-cleaning, which is further assisted by dynamical excitation by winds.  Elevation above the terrain is natural.  Integration with the piece of heavy base equipment anchors the array down to resist winds.  Sun tracking is possible.  Adaptive operation permits partial or full retraction when needed for protection or to control risks in special events (e.g., tornado / dust devil updraft).

MotionPort will use the Compact Telescoping Surface Array (CTSA) concept, developed by NASA Langley, for the example model. Simulations will be run to demonstrate the capability of simulating dust accumulation on the deployed solar array. Two active dust removal concepts will be simulated:  1) High velocity winds will be applied to determine required wind velocities and orientation to successfully remove dust, and 2) A tilt and shake mechanism will be added to the solar array model to mechanically tilt and add vibration to the structure to ‘shake’ off the dust. The CTSA will be modeled in the RecurDyn multibody dynamics software, considering the deployed configuration and a sampling of operating configurations. Simulations of dust particles will demonstrate the rate of dust accumulation on the surface of a solar array. An example of this type of simulation is shown in the image. Dust particles were simulated blowing past a rectangular plate with a reduced gravity. Simulations will be used to determine the effect of tilt angle of the solar array on dust abatement. These simulations will be built upon to demonstrate the ability to simulate removal of dust using a high velocity wind. The results will be compared to available data. Co-simulation with RecurDyn and the Particleworks SPH CFD software will simulate the use of a tilt and shake mechanism to remove dust. Simulations will test the efficiency of dust removal as a function of magnitude and frequency of the shaking mechanism. A custom application will be developed to automate repetitive steps such as: simplification of the mechanical model, parameter management, and file management. The simulations results, lessons learned, and user information will be documented.","The processes and best practices developed in this project will result in a proven platform simulation methodology that can be expanded to many projects. NASA engineers will be able to plan and conduct simulations of dust deposition and removal for solar array, antennae, and imaging devices. Mission applications include Martian and lunar bases. Tasks to automate tedious steps in the simulation allow NASA and NASA contractor engineers to efficiently apply these methods.","This platform methodology will be commercialized for use by manufacturers and integrators of terrestrial solar arrays. While is it not difficult to test and measure dust accumulation on terrestrial solar arrays, it is difficult to replicate the test conditions precisely such that the effect of making a change to the solar array design on dust accumulation is determined. This activity results in more support for the maintenance and enhancement of dust accumulation/removal simulation capabilities."

Future NASA missions will require new technologies to further space exploration and delivery of high mass loads. Of particular interest is the development of reusable hot structure technologies for primary structures exposed to extreme heating environments on atmospheric entry vehicles. A hot structure system is a multifunctional structure that can reduce/eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system. Thus, there is a need for the development of new technologies to support the realization of low-cost, durable/reusable hot structures applicable to atmospheric entry vehicles.  A key barrier is the requirement for the lightweight form to not only carry mechanical loads but also accommodate high temperatures (1000-2200°C), severe transient heating, and temperature gradients through the thickness.  Novel materials and associated fabrication processes are needed to balance the demand for structural cohesiveness with desired thermal properties required to protect structure interiors.

The long-term objective of this proposed work is to heavily leverage prior preceramic precursor based insulating materials development, and revise processes that can be used to realize hot structure systems.  The PhI effort will focus on assessing candidate processes and SiCN precursor formulation to create relevant load-bearing, insulating structures, then demonstrating technical feasibility by producing and testing hot structure samples.

In the near-term, application of hypersonic research and technologies is likely to be on enhanced defense systems, but this could eventually expand to include improved access to space capabilities that would directly benefit NASA. Hypersonic vehicle nose tips and leading edges require high thermal shock resistance combined with bending strength at a high angle of attack. Due to their high specific modulus, high fracture toughness and thermal conductivity, good thermal shock resistance, and excellent high temperature strength, advanced carbon/carbon (C/C) composites are considered as structural materials for atmospheric entry vehicles. C/C composites have densities in the range 1.6–2.0 gm/cm3, much lower than those of metals and ceramics, and can significantly reduce hypersonic vehicle component weight. During reentry into the atmosphere, a vehicle nose tip and leading edges can encounter extreme convective and radiative heating loads with the very high temperatures. Unfortunately, C/C composites start to rapidly oxidize above 700° which restricts their engineering applications in air. Multiple concepts of oxidation resistant coatings are currently in development for carbon/carbon composite protection. Most of the coatings are based on silicon carbide in combination with different refractory compounds.

Our proposed system, Anomaly Detection via Topological fEAture Map (AD-TEAM), will leverage a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based architecture to produce high-resolution clusters of nominal system behavior. What distinguishes AD-TEAM from more common clustering techniques (e.g., k-means) in the ISHM-space is that it maps high-dimensional input vectors to a 2D grid while preserving the topology of the original dataset. The result is a ‘semantic map’ that serves as a powerful visualization tool for uncovering latent relationships between features of the incoming points. Thus, beyond detecting known and unknown anomalies, AD-TEAM will also enable space crew to semantically characterize the clusters discovered. In doing so, personnel will better understand how faults propagate throughout a system, the transitional states of subsystem degradation over time, and the dominant features (and their relationships) of subsystem behavior. In addition to analyzing single subsystem datasets, we also propose to cross-correlate subsystems in order to capture the cascading effect of faults from one subsystem to another, as well as discover latent relationships between subsystems.  Such analysis would significantly aid in the maintenance and overhauling activities of NASA’s deep-space missions.","One transition target is Orbital ATK, which has expressed interest in AD-TEAM as a potential integration into their ISHM systems. Orbital ATK has been chosen for innovation under NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) program, so a partnership presents opportunity for integration into a real NASA space technology.

Redundancy is often thought of in terms of hardware; however, functional, analytic, and information redundancy strategies should also be considered. Modeling sensor information is invaluable for diagnostics and critical path analysis. A total system approach is an efficient means of prognostics as well as identifying the time of failure. However, fidelity and resolution must be considered in both approaches. There are compounding errors as the subsystems are aggregated in a component model. Sensors themselves introduce a point of error and require due consideration of size, weight, and power (SWaP). Signal processing, machine learning, and data mining techniques are common approaches in ISHM to improve the accuracy of alerts for known issues and an ability to identify latent and unknown failure conditions. Such techniques are not limited to ISHM. They are also used in fraud detection, image processing, medical diagnostics, and other domains. Our innovation draws from the domain of electrical power systems with the application of non-invasive load management (NILM) models for load disaggregation. NILM is a means of extracting and analyzing discrete end-use system components from an aggregate energy signal. NILM evolution has run parallel with the developments in signal processing, machine learning, and data mining for feature extraction, classification, and action. A NILM approach for managing habitat subsystems allows for optimization of the number of sensors, mitigating points of information failure and the constraints of size, weight, and power while providing analytical redundancy to hardware systems. We submit that the application of disaggregation analytics is an innovative ISHM technology that supports NASA missions.","When NILM algorithms reside on a SSE device, the device becomes a component “smart sensor”. The reduction in the number of sensors mitigates sensory overload and aids in alarm management without compromising the crew’s ability to respond to emergencies. The use of NILM analytics and smart sensors is not limited to spaceflight or extra-terrestrial operations. The methodology can be applied in building management systems for facilities to reduce cost of operations.","There are a limited number of NILM disaggregation applications and none that integrate ISHM as a feature. NILM tools, in conjunction with smart meters, could provide information to improve equipment design, building simulation, and construction, utility operations, and policy decisions. These would benefit residential and commercial consumers with greater efficiencies and lower costs. A reduction of only 0.01% would have yielded $3.2BM in savings in 2016 (Energy Information Administration data)."

Current approaches are mostly tailored to evaluating independent systems but do not necessarily scale well to problems requiring a system-of-systems approach. Furthermore, current approaches are not well suited to evaluating metrics such as system resiliency. Due to extended mission duration and distance, a new paradigm is entering the space mission design area which involves systems that change over time (either by changing the system capabilities, repairing the system, or resupplying the system). This adds complexity to the mission, and uncertainty regarding the system performance.

Accordingly, ATanalytics, in collaboration with The Center for Reliability and Resilience Engineering (CRRE) of The B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences at UCLA proposes to develop a methodology and toolkit for assured resilience of autonomous systems (ARAS).  The central part of the ARAS methodology consists of two gap fillers: (1) an ontology-driven database supporting resilience engineering activities and resilience modeling, and (2) a resilience assessment and optimization employing a Hybrid Causal Logic (HCL) based software platform for resilience engineering support.  The database includes resilience engineering principles, archetype mission scenarios, and metric meta models.  With the HCL-based resilience assessor, a high-level model at the top layer enables resilience metrics to be defined at the mission-scenario level (or CONOPS level) and be subsequently mapped to the lower-level models to capture system specifics.  Our innovation will be a significant step forward to resilience engineering standardization since (i) the database (a knowledge hub) and resilience models will be onboard resources enabling both design-for-resilience and onboard decision making for resilience assurance, and (ii) the HCL metrics-in-the-loop methodology is inherently generalizable for different levels of system abstraction, life-cycle, and mission phases.","Excellent NASA application opportunities exist for the ARAS methodology and engineering tools.  In particular, the results from this effort are most applicable to two types of space missions.  One type is robotics missions such as NASA Europa Clipper mission to Jupiter’s frozen moon.  The other type is crewed missions to which ground support for fault management is not practicable due to the unacceptable transmission delay of commands from the earth, such as the future Moon-To-Mars missions.","The ARAS methodology and its tool implementation will have a wide application domain.  One example type of application is military vehicles, such as fighters, long-range missiles, UAVs, and UGVs.  In addition, our ARAS methodology and tools are highly applicable to self-driving automobiles and civil aviation industries of which safety ratings are the key.

The Strategic Technologies for Autonomy & Resilience Tools (START) project will demonstrate the associated technologies the company envisions integrating as a toolkit within a modular framework for designing and enabling resilience for autonomous systems. The team proposes to use an incremental and modular development approach, permitting capture, modeling, and assessment of uncertainty throughout the process. A spiral development approach, beginning with architecture design and proposed approach feasibility will permit maximal reuse of incremental toolkit development artifacts.  Accompanying the toolkit will be a set of defined metrics for resilience which enable the quantification of success, including improvement over baseline and enabling the computational optimization of contingency configurations. The end product, accompanied with a Bayesian inspired overlay for uncertainty management offers a novel concept enabling  design for resilience and risk assessment in the face of possibly unforeseen and previously not encountered situatioy. Resilience leverages thoughtful design, intimate knowledge of inherent component properties, and system capabilities. Operational resilience incorporates understanding of mission goals and condition awareness, along with anticipation enabled through possibility modeling and simulation within an aware, intelligent framework to yield a best fit solution in dynamic situations. While maximizing on a central goal, the system will track and prioritize the optimal solution across multiple facets of sustainability, future outcomes, and mission success. Prior relevant work in autonomy, robustness assessment, systems reliability, health management, and agent-based systems will inform the research and development effort.","Automated contingency management for space exploration and advanced systems health management for electrical power represent the key areas to be demonstrated during the proposed Phase I & Phase II projects.

We have significant experience in all of the required technologies and have already integrated them into a general MAESTRO architecture designed to be easily applied to all spacecraft subsystems. The eventual, ultimate goal is the ability of astronauts and a semi-autonomous, intelligent onboard system to easily manage all spacecraft operations through the development of MAESTRO, which can easily interface to the various systems of a variety of spacecraft. MAESTRO must be sufficiently powerful, general, and computationally efficient and be easily adapted by developers.  This will be accomplished using open standards, clearly defined open interfaces, use of Open Source software, and leveraging several previous NASA investments. The Phase I research goals are to explore the various spacecraft subsystem domains, elaborate the AI techniques useful for subsystem characterization, diagnosis, and replanning/rescheduling/adaptive execution/safing, prove the feasibility of these techniques through prototype development, and develop a complete system specification for the Phase II MAESTRO system.","Because it will be an open system that other developers could use to create intelligent spacecraft operations management systems, many MAESTRO applications can be quickly developed.  Since MAESTRO is specifically designed to easily interface with Diagnosis, Adaptive Execution, Planning, and Scheduling engines, developers will have their choice.

TRACLabs has designed and prototyped such an agent called a cognitive architecture for space exploration (CASE) that incorporates a procedure development system known as PRIDE that allows for variably autonomous execution of both crew and robotic procedures, an automated planner that plans and re-plans the execution of procedures to achieve overall mission goals, an ontology data management system that makes system states available to all the components, a process manager to manage the use of distributed computing resources that support the CASE components, and a natural language dialog system to allow the crew access to any part of the architecture.

The agent must have a suite displays and interaction modes that can update the users’ situation awareness and recommend courses of action without undue cognitive load on the users, particularly the intra-vehicular activity user, or IVA. Therefore, this proposal seeks to investigate, design and test a canonical interaction protocol for CASE, called a flexible agent-based communication for exploration (FACE) that will include natural language dialog and active graphics, provide a consistent presentation of the current situation to the IVA, rapidly assess anomalous situations so as to focus the users’ attention on the key facts of the situation, recommend courses of action for correcting anomalous situations and provide for variable autonomy and user override of any autonomous operation.","After Phase II, the FACE protocols and software components will be available for exploration systems development and testing.

Since plastics are inherently low in strength, additive manufactured plastic currently cannot compete with metallic parts.

GeoComposites will develop composite feedstocks and associated deposition parameters to meet the requirement set by NASA for an ultimate tensile strength of 200 MPa. For a high strength part, it is not just sufficient to have a high strength feedstock but also a FDM facility that allows for the part build as dictated by the feedstock. GeoComposites proposes to demonstrate a combination of feedstocks for high strength parts. The part build will be performed with a dual nozzle FDM machine. The first feedstock will be created by extruding the mixture of a thermoplastic matrix with an optimized distribution of compatible chopped fibers. Continuity between the interlayer fibers will provide high bond strength between layers. The layup will combine this feedstock with continuous High Strength High Temperature (HSHT) fibers. Mechanical and outgas testing will be performed to demonstrate compatibility with NASA requirements. In addition, we propose to analyze ISS accommodation of FDM equipment capable of printing structural parts on the ISS using the developed feedstocks.

The proposed small business innovative research is a feasibility study of an in-situ inspection unit that can be added to an existing additive manufacturing (AM) tool, such as an FDM (fused deposition modeling) machine, providing real-time information about the part quality, and detecting flaws as they occur.  The information provided by this unit is used to a) qualify the part as it is being made, b) to providing feedback to AM tool for correction, or to stop the process if the part will not meet the quality, thus saving time, energy and reduce material loss.  The approach is based on multi-parameter imaging technique that can detect flaws in real-time for each AM print layer, such as dimensional deviation, micro-structured defects, wide gap between print lines, and determine surface finish, to name a few.  Using multi-parameter approach provides measurement redundancy, maximizing likelihood of detecting defects that may otherwise be missed using a single parameter sensing approach, and avoids false readings. During this research study, AM parts will be tested with the proposed approach both on a bench-top as well as while being printed in an AM tool. The predicted results will be compared to actual flaws.  Current and future unit size requirements, component specifications, speed, accuracy, output parameter and specifications will be determined, and adaptability to current and future ISM systems will be established. Observed defect parameters will be correlated to known values, thus enabling prediction of part performance/material outcomes, and the approach will be demonstrated into a ground based AM systems. Successful completion of the Phase I feasibility study will meet the subtopic requirements by demonstrating the in-situ quality control approach for in-ground AM systems, which has high extensibility to ISM, and results in correlating and predictive material outcomes.","For NASA applications, the proposed innovation will be used for quality control for in-space manufacturing (ISM).

Unfortunately, we still do not possess ample understanding of low-g fluid phenomena to assure performance and avoid system failure. Though inadequate fluid system design can lead to disastrous consequences, for the most part, and for life support systems in general, precious crew time is consumed by the repair and maintenance of life support equipment. Long-duration space flight missions to the moon, Mars and other planetary bodies will require hardware that is less prone to failure and significantly more robust than the current state of the art. To prepare for the future during the ISS era, we propose to develop and deliver a simple, yet profound, two-phase flow testbed for use on ISS. The facility will be deployed for the exhaustive measurement, demonstration, and qualification of inertia-visco-capillary two-phase flows—flows critical to myriad low-g fluids conduits, devices, and systems (fuels, coolants, and water processing equipment for life support). Our approach is uniquely tailored to achieve high data rates of both engineering and scientific value in a safe, fast-to-flight, low-cost experiment constructed substantially of flight qualified COTS components. Our two-phase flow data objectives are expected to be highly complementary to the NASA GRC research and NASA JSC life support applications, focusing on the critical performance impacts of container/conduit geometry and poor wetting conditions common to many fluid systems aboard spacecraft. Additionally, our 'low-tech' approach to experiment design and data collection greatly increases the rate and breadth of microgravity two-phase flow research returns to NASA with concurrent reductions in overall program risk.","The primary data to be collected is of both short- and long-term interest to NASA as it supports the development of a wide variety of systems including air revitalization, water recovery, water management, habitation, waste water treatment, condensing heat exchangers, and other contaminating systems such as plant and animal habitats, laundering and hygiene, food rehydration and dispensing, and others. Highly wetting systems relevant to coolants, cryogens, and propellants may also be addressed.","Data is expected to have a direct impact on commercial aerospace system design for a wide range of critical systems including life support, thermal management, water management and others. The phase separating devices will be qualified in an operational environment generating discrete flow products and design guides that can be integrated into existing and future systems."

It is important both as a way to potentially produce high value materials such as some drugs that can be created more efficiently in the microgravity environment as well as a way to demonstrate that Lunar and Martian outposts can manufacture some of their own needed supplies on-site.  Multiple prior experiments have been developed to demonstrate the manufacturing of specialized materials onboard ISS, including infrared ZBLAN optical fiber that avoids internal crystallization effects in microgravity, and parts produced through 3D printing. The objective of this program is to develop an ISS experimental package to demonstrate the onboard production of photovoltaic cells and arrays. NanoSonic would develop electrospray techniques compatible with the microgravity environment for the direct and complete printing of large-scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and arrays.  Unlike ink jet printing that sprays liquid drops of ink that would spatially wander in microgravity, electrospray methods use high voltage to rapidly accelerate materials onto charged substrates so no release of liquids occurs.  PSCs have been developed rapidly during the past five years to currently exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) greater than 20%. Electrospray printing of PSCs would allow the rapid, low cost manufacturing of large area and mechanically flexible and stowable solar array fabrics, and their fabrication onboard ISS would demonstrate the production of materials that are needed in space.  Through the Phase I SBIR program, NanoSonic would work through a subcontract with Professor Shashank Priya, a leader in the development of perovskite solar cell technology at Penn State University, and informally with aerospace engineers at a major U.S. aerospace company to consider onboard ISS experimental system requirements.","NASA would use the developed automated module onboard ISS to demonstrate the manufacturing of electronics in space. This would support the development of commercial manufacturing in space and demonstrate the production of electronics away from earth. NASA could use high efficiency solar cells produced onboard ISS in future missions that require increased electrical power, including fixed space platforms such as the Deep Space Gateway or outposts on the surfaces of the moon or Mars.","Flexible, low cost, highly efficient PSCs would have application in PV fabric-based tents, backpacks and vehicles, as an alternative power source in remote locations along rural highways or recreation areas off the grid, and as a replacement for rigid rooftop and backyard PV structures that provide lower PCEs. Low-cost electrospray additive manufacturing units could be used by industry, researchers and individuals to make their own photovoltaic fabrics and arrays and other electronic devices."

The next step in the industrialization of LEO is the formulation of base materials, such as specialty glasses, that can be refined into higher value products in microgravity. The Glass Alloy Manufacturing Machine (GAMMA) is an experimental system designed to investigate how these materials form without the effects of gravity-induced flows and inform process improvements for commercial product development. While focused around creating fluoride glass preforms, the system can also be used to melt a host of glass compositions, experiment with different dopants, and start the process of creating larger and higher quality glasses aboard the ISS. The initial system development focuses on remelting glass materials originally created on the ground and quantifying differences with ground control experiments. However, MIS plans trade studies to find more complex glass experiments, such as processing the constituent powders into samples, containerless processing, varying gravity levels, and other experiments which can only be performed on the ISS platform.","Exotic optical fiber can be used in many different applications such as lasers, spectroscopy, high-grade sensors and other items that NASA and the Department of Defense could use.

Advanced Space proposes developing the means for flying spacecraft in an orbit that remains below 10 km altitude for weeks or months, opening the door to breakthrough scientific investigations. The proposed work will study an innovative system that may be used to achieve Sustained Low-Altitude Lunar Orbital Missions (SLALOM), enabled through autonomous onboard GNC capabilities and the use of Flash LIDAR. The proposed study explores the dynamics of SLALOM, performs navigation analyses, evaluates maneuver planning methodologies, and researches how unique innovations in spacecraft autonomy can transfer operations from the ground to the spacecraft. Skimming the lunar surface autonomously with a spacecraft that remains below an altitude of 10 km is a challenging proposition that requires an entirely new approach to spacecraft navigation, maneuver design and execution, and spacecraft autonomy. SLALOM, with the requisite breakthrough improvements in guidance, navigation, and control technology, allows new scientific investigations such as the direct sensing and/or capture of lunar particles naturally lofted by the complicated dynamics of the lunar exosphere. The benefits of the proposed innovation in spacecraft autonomy extend naturally to other airless bodies where sustained low-altitude orbits are mission enabling. These include, among others, the scientific and commercial exploration of asteroids and the Martian satellites Phobos and Deimos. While these applications are compelling, Advanced Space identifies the Moon as an ideal proving ground for this technology for many reasons, not least of which is to take advantage of the wealth of geodetic reference data generated by previous missions and the desire for low-altitude, high value scientific investigations identified by the lunar science community.","SLALOM makes possible the direct sensing or sampling of lunar regolith that has been lofted from the surface via interaction with solar UV radiation. In this way, a large number of sites of interest may be directly sampled using the same spacecraft: a capability far exceeding the reach of a rover or lander. Further, such low-altitude orbits allow remote-sensing measurements of unparalleled resolution, both at the Moon and other airless bodies such as asteroids and other natural satellites.","Commercial interest in the exploration of airless bodies has grown significantly in the past decade, particularly as a means of identifying and extracting valuable space resources. The ability to operate autonomously at very low altitudes is enabling not only in the accuracy of measurements that can be collected, but also in the ability to operate a fleet of exploration space vehicles economically with a streamlined ground support footprint with minimal human interaction required."

NASA and commercial entities are in need of advanced methods that allow for rapid analysis of complex trajectory optimization problems, so that the most informed decisions with regard to mission design can be made at an early stage in the planning process. This includes having a solver that can intelligently search the large problem space, do so quickly, and with a great enough level of fidelity to ensure that the trajectory can be continued to a flight fidelity level. Advanced optimization tools for the LT multi-body problem do not currently exist, yet this regime is seen in numerous mission designs. During Phase I, CUA will combine recent ad-  vances in global optimization, such as hybrid optimal control frameworks and intelligent heuristic global solvers, with robust and efficient local optimization and medium-high fidelity modeling of launch vehicles, spacecraft, and engine modeling to advance DyLAN to fill the aforementioned needs. Phase I efforts will include parallelism, both for personal computers and large compute clusters, to reduce run-time. Lastly, in Phase I, an automated export capability of solved solutions to NASA’s flight fidelity solver GMAT will be  implemented; thereby providing an efficient global optimization capability to GMAT for multi-body, which does not currently exist. The aforementioned capabilities will be demonstrated with select test problems by CUA. DyLAN is the next logically tool for a mission design team that current uses NASA’s EMTG for interplanetary and GMAT for flight fidelity solutions.","DyLAN addresses an existing preliminary mission design problem that currently requires a human-in-the-loop; extremely inefficient and mission limiting. DyLAN will meet NASA’s Technology Roadmap goals of advanced modeling and simulation tools that allow for expanded solution spaces enabling new design concepts while decreasing cost with higher fidelity, efficient simulations. DyLAN goes beyond these goals by connecting NASA EMTG and GMAT into a highly productive and maintainable design toolchain.","DyLAN’s early demonstration proves that commercial entities (e.g. a.i. solutions, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, the Aerospace Corporation, KinetX Aerospace etc.) using DyLAN for bids on science/defense missions, or as contractor to NASA for multi-body problems (libration point, resonance transfer, departure/arrival) will possess a strong advantage over competition.

As Gordon Moore originally predicted in 1965, the density of transistors, clock speed, and power efficiency in microprocessors doubled approximately every 18 months for most of the past 60 years. Yet this trend began to languish over the last decade. A law known as Dennard scaling, which states that microprocessors would proportionally increase in performance while keeping their power consumption constant, has broken down since about 2006; the result has been a trade-off between speed and power efficiency. Although transistor densities have so far continued to grow exponentially, even that scaling will stagnate once device sizes reach their fundamental quantum limits in the next ten years. Due to this stagnation, processors, like those used for NASA’s navigation, communication, and telemetry systems, lack the scaling necessary to push space exploration further.  A more energy efficient architecture/technology is required in order to increase the information bits per unit energy, and push processors architectures pass the thermal limits currently preventing increased speeds.  Photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platforms provide a solution to this emerging challenge.  PICs are becoming a key part of communication systems in data centers, where microelectronic compatibility and high-yield, low-cost manufacturing are crucial. Because of their integration, PICs can allow photonic processing at a scale impossible with discrete, bulky optical-fiber counterparts, and scalable, CMOS-compatible silicon-photonic systems are on the cusp of becoming a commercial reality.  More specifically, Neuromorphic Photonics allow for the benefits of PICs to be merged with the benefits associated with non Von-Neumann processor architectures allowing for increases in both speed and energy efficiency.","Neuromorphic photonics provide significant speed and efficiency increases with numerous potential applications.  For NASA missions, neuromorphic photonics opens up a lot of potential in general purpose processors used for navigation, long-range communications, RF signal processors, and other systems used for spacecraft control.  Neuromorphic photonic processors would have far reaching effects on most digital and analog electronic processes involved in NASA missions.","In the commercial and defense market, neuromorphic photonic processors have the potential to revolutionize computing and help push microprocessors beyond constraining thermal limits.  This would allow for increased speed and energy efficiency in high performance computing in research and other demanding environments and RF signal processors for telecommunications.  Moving past the Von-Neumann efficiency wall while increasing processing speeds has the potential to revolutionize modern computing."

Antimonide-based Type II Superlattice (T2SL) infrared (IR) detectors have made significant advances in the past decade. The interest in this technology stems from (1) the ability to tailor the T2SL bandgaps across the IR region and (2) the manufacturability of T2SL structures using III-V foundries and horizontal integration schemes.   NASA researchers have been involved with efforts to develop T2SL IR detectors for a variety of space-related missions, both in communications and sensing. We propose to complete a fundamental feasibility study leading to a prototype of a single pixel, field programmable, SWIR photodetector. This detector will use antimonide-based T2SL materials as the absorber. This detector will operate at relative high temperature (above 250 K). Most uniquely, this detector’s voltage bias can be programmed to operate with either high dynamic range or high sensitivity. High dynamic range uses a low voltage bias (<1 V) and operates the detector in a standard PIN configuration. High sensitivity uses a high voltage bias (20 to 30 V) and operates in the linear amplification region of an avalanche photodiode (APD). The detector is engineered for high signal-to-noise operation in both modes. The user or the control software can adaptively trade off dynamic range versus sensitivity on the fly and in response to measured characteristics of the scene (for example, photon flux or noise conditions). This detector will work ideally with an emerging generation of readout integrated circuits that will control the voltage of pixels selectively, leading to a focal plane array (FPA) that can algorithmically decide the operational mode of each pixel. Because the band structure of T2SL materials is designed, we will be able to engineer a detector that meets all of these targets simultaneously.","The proposed detectors will address: Free space, satellite-based optical communication with a high operating temperature, high speed photodetector.

The narrow spectral linewidth of the atomically sourced biphotons makes them compatible with direct interfacing with downstream atomic systems, opening vast new vistas in the potential for long-range QSC and quantum networking. A second direction that further pushes the state-of-the-art in highly-coherent quantum optical systems for QSC is our second proposed device that provides efficient storage and recall of single-photon states. The single photons are stored in a coherent collective excitation of a cold atomic ensemble and can later be retrieved when the downstream QSC system is ready. Together, these devices represent a dramatic step forward in the quality of commercially available QSC hardware components. Nevertheless, the parallel development of the devices will be highly efficient due to their shared reliance on identical underlying cold atom hardware. These devices (and potentially several other related quantum optical devices) will be different laser and optical packages wrapped around an identical vacuum system for production of atomic ensembles with extremely high optical density. Phase I will demonstrate the underlying atom ensemble hardware and will complete system-level designs of the proposed QSC hardware components.","Quantum communications provides provably secure transmission of information, something that can’t be ensured in any other way. Thus, the future of ground-space and space-space communication will be performed over quantum links. The Chinese MICIUS satellite has paved the initial path in the direction of employing quantum protocols for secure communications. The innovation proposed here would provide part of the necessary package for NASA to return to the fore-front of secure space communications.","Implementing and utilizing quantum communication technologies (QCT) is of great interest to companies and governmental entities that transfer highly sensitive information as part of their operations (such as government agencies, financial and research firms, medical companies, stock trading services, etc.). The benefits provided by the proposed technology position it well for rapid integration into existing quantum communications applications."

The key technological innovation is the use of liquid crystal to tune the etalon.  While this type of etalon has been in use for many years, a development effort is undertaken to reduce the time it takes to tune a LC etalon over a free spectral range from a few milliseconds (current state of the art) to 100-500 microseconds (proposed).  The primary application of this technology is integration into a space based lidar (light detection and ranging) system, particularly in differential absorption lidar (DIAL) systems.  DIAL is one of the most powerful active remote sensing techniques due to its spatial and altitude resolution, measurement precision, and insensitivity to surface emissivity.  As such, it can be used to monitor spatial and temporal changes of minor molecular atmospheric constituents in the lower troposphere.  The filter is designed for observing water vapor from orbit.  An accurate assessment of global water vapor distribution is key to more precise modeling of climate feedback from clouds and improved weather forecasting.","The primary application is the provision of fast frequency tuning for space based lidar systems.  However, the proposed tunable etalon can be modified for use in on-orbit hyperspectral imaging systems or high speed dynamics sampling.  A promising non-lidar application is micro-scale sampling of atmospheric winds or measuring the O2-A band emission to determine temperature profiles at high temporal cadence.","Non-government applications include use as a spectral sensor for narrow spectral signatures with applications in the oil and gas markets, both exploration and leak and pollution detection.

The goal is an injection seeded laser system with two closely spaced (~100-200 µs), 600 mJ pulses at 50 Hz that is an innovative synthesis of both new and recently developed Fibertek technologies. The primary application of this dual pulse system is for use as a pump laser in Differential Absorption Lidar systems that require one pulse that is in resonance with the molecular species being detected and one that is off resonance. For the pump laser we will develop, the two pulses need to be closely spaced in time so they sample essentially the same atmospheric aberrations. These performance goals exceed the requirements for pulsed lasers in the 20 Hz to 100 Hz repetition rate range with energies greater than 100 mJ that is identified in the 2018 SBIR subtopic S1.01, Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies. The combination of high pulse energy, dual-pulse injection seeded format, and pure conductive cooling makes these state of the art design goals. This technology could be the pump source for optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and other wavelength converters needed for lidar based remote detection of key of atmospheric gases including methane, ozone, and water vapor. The design will advance the state of the art in laser performance by decreasing the size by 2x and increasing the efficiency by over 80% in a purely conductively cooled package needed for space-based applications compared to other recently developed systems.","Two major limiters of lidar remote sensing systems are the size and power consumption of the laser transmitter.

The Er:YAG development will advance the technology of a space-based wind lidar system by focusing on developing a compact, efficient diode pumped transmitter that is conductively cooled.  Current efficient 2µm systems are pumped by fiber lasers to take advantage of the high brightness source, but this tends to increase the packaging foot print.  To maintain long pulsewidths >100ns, the 2µm systems cavities are typically greater than 2 meters in length.  By working at higher repetition rates (500Hz or above) than are typically targeted in 2µm systems, Fibertek will take advantage of the long storage time of Er:YAG to maintain efficient operation, while operating at longer pulse lengths in a shorter cavity (with respect to Ho:YLF systems of similar pulse lengths) due to the low gain of the Er:YAG.  Fibertek’s approach will be based on an Er:YAG resonator operating at 1645nm and resonantly pumped by high brightness semiconductor laser diodes.

(OO), in collaboration with University of Texas (UT) at Austin and the George Washington University propose a novel 2D TCC-VCSEL arrays monolithically integrated with a surface-normal slow-light photonic crystal (PC) waveguide array that are vertically built in one lithography layer.  Unlike conventional thinking where the waveguides in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) are always built parallel to the substrate, which will require 64 lithographically defined waveguide layers to provide a 64×64 phase array. Due to the slow light effect, this system provides the required phase shift larger than liquid crystal with 30 µm interaction length while maintaining the pixel (emitter) to pixel separation small enough to cover the total field of view (FOV) of 180˚× 180˚, and the instantaneous field of view of 0.05˚.This will significantly increase the yield rate to the final targeted 98% since we have only one primarily defined lithography layer rather than a 64-layer approach without sacrificing the performance metrics.  The steering of the laser beam can be realized through two different means: (1) electro-optically controlled through carrier perturbation or refilling the hole with EO polymer and (2) through thermal tuning which provides the needed phase shift of each element with the sweeping speed of >100 KHz. The key claims are the following:1. Engineering the PC waveguide slow light device where the group index perturbation Δng can be significantly increased to 170-200, which will provide a much shorter waveguide length needed to steer the beam. 2. The unequally spaced design is capable of providing the side-lobe suppression up to 35 and 50 dB, respectively as required in phase I and phase II.

These include SATCOM and radar applications. High efficiency is particularly important for airborne applications, such as UAVs and fire control radars, where the prime power is limited. SSPAs used in E-band (71-76 GHz) satellite-based downlink transmitters would benefit from this technology. Other applications include satellite-to-satellite constellation communications links at 60 GHz."

Through this proposed SBIR project, VDI seeks to extend the performance of high-quality harmonic mixers to frequencies up to 5 THz; with the primary goal of meeting the requirements of planned and future NASA missions. This effort will focus primarily on second and fourth harmonic mixers which will use advanced circuit designs and fabrication technologies to maintain low conversion loss while also reducing the complexity of the local oscillator source.","The primary applications will be studies of planetary atmospheres, heliophysics and radio astronomy. Of particular importance is the study of water chemistry on planets and moons.

These sensors could also be used in upcoming missions such as Saturn’s moon to study atmospheric makeup.  On earth, humidity and temperature sounding is conducted near several absorption lines to determine key parameters of the atmospheric state, including moisture content, temperature, and barometric pressure. Using neural networks, these parameters are retrieved from raw sensor data at a small number of discreet frequencies near the absorption lines. To improve retrieval accuracy as well as predictive ability of weather models, a large number of closely spaced frequencies, i.e. hyperspectral sensing should be implemented. Such approach is also helpful in RFI mitigation and sensor calibration. As such, under the current program PSI will develop a hyperspectral microwave photonic radiometer concept capable of acquiring a hundred or more detection frequencies simultaneously on a ~1GHz channel spacing. We leverage microwave photonics to convert the RF signals up to optical frequencies, where they are readily manipulated with low loss and wide bandwidth using optical components. We survey available elements, such as prism, diffraction grating, or arrayed waveguide grating, to implement the dispersive function. Under a previous NOAA Phase II SBIR, PSI delivered a frequency agile microwave radiometer that could be tuned across the entire V-band with ~ 1K NETD at 2GHz bandwidth and 100msec integration time. This sensor, however, performed measurements in serial fashion by sweeping a local oscillator. Under the proposed effort, we will adapt our existing V-band hardware to perform these spectrally resolved measurements simultaneously. We will demonstrate an 8-channel system with 3 GHz frequency spacing, which can be scaled to larger channel counts in a straightforward manner.","The hyperspectral radiometer can be employed in passive sensing of microwave radiation from earth and other celestial bodies for weather data, atmospheric composition and dynamics.  Active operation is a straightforward extension for radar applications where range data is useful. Implemented in a phased array, spatially and spectrally resolved signals can be realized, with high gain beam forming readily achieved, an advantage for communications and telemetry applications.","Low attenuation of mmW radiation enables sensors to “see-through” many visual obscurants.  Applications include: Marine navigation in dense fog, aircraft landings in adverse weather, emergency response vehicle operation in poor weather or smoke, monitoring highways for traffic safety, surveillance and target acquisition in inclement weather, non-intrusive portal security and stand-off frisking."

A good example of their usefulness is found in high frequency local oscillator systems. These systems typically comprise a lower frequency oscillator driving a cascade of frequency multipliers. Standing waves arise due to impedance mismatches between the highly tuned components. This in turn gives rise to dips or even nulls in the output of the multiplier chain. The standing waves are often mitigated with complicated impedance matching techniques that are implemented on a case-by-case basis at a great cost in time and money. By using suitable isolators, the standing waves could be suppressed at a fraction of the time and cost. The high insertion loss of these components renders them unsuitable for use in most MMW systems. The typical insertion loss of a WR-6.5 isolator (110-170 GHz) is more than 3 dB. The problem is worse at higher bands. Micro Harmonics Corporation has recently developed a revolutionary new line of isolators with significantly reduced insertion loss. Our WR-8 and WR-6.5 isolators have a measured insertion loss of less than 1 dB over most of the waveguide band. By April of this year, a full line of low-loss isolators covering bands from WR-12 (60-90 GHz) through WR-3.4 (220-325 GHz) will be available. Many NASA instruments are designed for use at cryogenic temperatures. However, cryogenically rated isolators are currently unavailable at frequencies above 40 GHz. Isolators designed for room temperature operation have poor isolation at cryogenic temperatures due to changes in the ferrite properties. The isolators must be fundamentally redesigned for cryogenic use. We propose to develop high-frequency isolators optimized for cryogenic temperatures that exhibit significantly reduced loss and improved isolation and bandwidth making them useful for many of the instruments now being developed for NASA missions.","Isolators are useful in a wide range of NASA systems including the heterodyne receivers used in Marvel, VESPER, MACO and SIRICE. They find potential application in the local oscillator (LO) chains for the high-resolution heterodyne array receivers at 1.9 THz used in the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and the Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory (STO-2) and the 4.7 THz multiplied local oscillator source for the observation of neutral oxygen.","Isolators are broadly used in scientific instruments for plasma diagnostics (ITER), chemical spectroscopy, biomaterial analysis, and radio astronomy. There are applications in military systems such as compact range radar, imaging systems, covert communications systems, and chemical and bio-agent detection systems. There are applications in biomedical systems for the real time analysis of skin diseases, portal security scanners, high frequency data links and industrial process control systems."

Currently, most submillimeter-wave array systems utilize a single pixel both for space as well as ground applications. While these approaches are workable for the near-term, they will become unsustainable as pixel count is increased. In addition, the shear mass associated with large count heterodyne arrays based on single waveguide block per chip approaches can be a challenging task. In this project, we present a 3D wafer level integration of this technology using low cost aligned direct wafer bonding at low temperature of 2000C. This wafer level integration may decrease 50-100x in both volume and mass, hence reduces thermal gradient. As of today, most of the gain fluctuations in this device are coming from thermal gradients. By reducing the size and mass of the radiometer, the thermal gradients, these devices will be able to be used in balloons, landers, overs, and any other place where a complete remote chemical laboratory might be required. In order to realize this high-performance device, the alignment requirement for wafer level interconnect in millimeter arrays needs to be very tight, close to 300nm or better. It depends on feature size of the interconnect at the wafers. The wafer alignment needs to be optical before bonding two surfaces using alignment marks on both side of the wafers. The bonding needs to be performed in a hybrid nature (Cu interconnect with oxide in the same layer) i.e. Cu/Cu, SiO2/SiO2 Cu/GaAs oxides. at Phase I, We will conduct a feasibility study to develop an algorithm for advanced alignment <300nm.

The combination of low cost, compact size, and miniscule power consumption offers an attractive replacement for expensive, bulky, and power-hungry photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). SiPM laboratory setups typically include a bench full of heavy test equipment. The associated cost, size, weight, and power (c-SWaP) of this additional equipment present many practical challenges to the deployment of SiPMs, particularly in airborne and space missions. Many applications benefit from a large tiled array of SiPMs. However, a large SiPM array presents a challenge in proper signal conditioning and handling large volumes of data. The key to solving this challenge is a complete read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) that takes the quantized analog signal from the SiPM array and converts it into useful digital data for the user. This ROIC not only manages the SiPM array data but does so in a manner that significantly reduces the associated c-SWaP from a benchtop solution, a key requirement for practical SiPM deployment. The ultimate goal of this proposal is a fully integrated ROIC that interfaces to a SiPM array and is readily adaptable to both airborne and space deployed systems. The objective of Phase I is to develop the requisite components of a ROIC for photon counting and to assemble these components into a single channel of the ROIC. A test chip will be developed in Phase I to mitigate the risk of subsequent phases. This test chip will contain the relevant ROIC components, as well as a single channel of the ROIC, and will be designed, laid out, fabricated, and characterized in the Phase I effort.","Potential NASA applications primarily center around LIDAR, which is expanding into a wide variety of uses.

This proposal identifies a transformative new approach for X-ray detection using ion-sensitive nanomaterials. Recent work has shown that certain nanomaterials are extremely sensitive to ionized gas molecules, which enables them to detect even individual ions. These sensors can be utilized as a core element within an ionizable gas-filled volume that responds strongly to X-Rays. This project proposes to develop self-standing X-Ray detector elements with higher quantum gain with reduced power consumption compared to conventional X-Ray detectors, without sacrificing readout speed and miniaturizability. This development will be carried out by an optimization of the ion-sensing core nanomaterial, the sensing geometry, and the ionizable front-end gas volume architecture. These optimized materials and architectures will be combined with low-power fast readout electronics at the back-end to form self-standing X-Ray detector elements. This project will combine the state-of-the-art in materials science, physics, detector technology, and electrical engineering to address an issue of enormous scientific importance and technical value. The successful development of such a detector element will enable the project to move into phase II, where prototype solar X-ray detectors with small independent pixels (< 250 µm) and fast read-out (>10,000 count/s/pixel) over an energy range from < 5 keV to 300 keV will be developed. This technology will have the reach to influence a number of NASA missions beyond Solar observation, such as deep-space imaging and navigation. It will also have a huge potential for commercial applications in industrial testing and process control, medical diagnostics, and advanced scientific research in materials science and beyond.","The proposed work will eliminate high-voltage requirements and reduce power consumption, reduce payload, and  enable nanometer size pixels.

We propose a two-fold change in the state of the art of thin film EUV and x-ray filters, using Al-Sc alloy in place of Al and adding Au nanoparticles to polyimide. Al-Sc alloys show smaller grain sizes that should translate to increased strength and decreased optical/IR transmission, even for alloying fractions <1% that would not noticeably impact the x-ray spectrum. Surface plasmon resonances (SPR) in Au nanoparticles allow tunable absorption peaks for optical thermal control and baking. Since SPRs effectively enlarge the absorption cross section of nanoparticles, we expect to achieve a narrowband visible optical depth of ~0.2 with an x-ray transmittance of >95% (nanoparticles only). We lay out a fabrication and testing plan to push these technologies from TRL2 to TRL4 by the end of Phase I by demonstrating heating of doped films, optical and infrared density of alloyed films, and beamline measurements of x-ray transmittance and density of constituent species in integrated Al-Sc/doped polyimide filters.",This work targets the requirements of large-format thin film filters for high-energy observatories. Increased strength and optical density for metal layers and non-contact thermal control will improve the state of the art of optical and infrared blocking filters and contamination blocking filters. Increased strength of Al via alloying also improves its usefulness as a window in low-pressure differential laboratory gas cell experiments to characterize aerosols and model planetary atmospheres.,"Increased optical/IR density and thermal stability afforded by alloying Al is directly applicable to IR-pumped high harmonic generation laser experiments, free electron lasers, synchrotrons, and x-ray instrumentation and metrology tools where pure Al is the current standard. Inertial confinement fusion experiments have a need for resonant absorption of doped polyimide, where pre-heating lasers can remove polyimide layers in the microseconds prior to a shot."

The outcome of this project will be a large-format visible-blind CMOS UV/EUV photon-counting sensor with accurate photon-counting capability. The novel sensor will provide some capabilities that are not available with other high-sensitivity detectors, such as accurate photon-number-resolving, zero dead time, low voltage and power requirements, high spatial resolution, and room temperature operation. These features will benefit multiple future NASA missions such as the ESA-NASA Solar Orbiter, Large UV Optical Infrared Survey Telescope (LUVOIR), and the Habitable Exoplanet Mission (HabEx). The core of QIS is the specialized CMOS photon-counting pixels, called “jots.” With our patented innovations, jots can accurately count photons without the use of avalanche gain or cooling. The technology was validated in a 1Mpixel prototype. The accurate photon-counting capability was demonstrated with ultra-low read noise and dark current at room temperature. When combined with the existing advanced back-surface passivation techniques and band-pass filters developed for CCDs and standard CMOS image sensors, a visible-blind QIS with high quantum efficiency in UV/EUV wavelengths can be produced. The ultimate goal of the project is to produce a QIS for high-performance visible-blind photon-counting in the UV/EUV spectral region. The effort in Phase I can provide critical guidance for the prototype design in Phase II.  The anticipated results are (1) a detailed manufacturing plan for combining the future QIS products with the advanced back-surface passivation techniques, (2) an optimized jot designed for higher quantum efficiency and less cross-talk especially with short photon absorption depth, and (3) a preliminary plan on modifications required for the radiation hardened detector and circuit design.","The applications include a wide range of astrophysics studies.

The curvature will improve measurement quality and volume utilization by allowing the detector to conform to the physical geometry of the instrument. For example, an instrument may view the space environment in 360 degrees of azimuth with cylindrical symmetry. In this case, a cylindrical MCP may be used to exploit the instrument housing geometry to simplify either direct particle detection, or detection of secondary electrons that provide timing signals. Where secondary electrons must be detected, the compatibility of the curved MCP with the instrument geometry may be used to shorten electron flight paths, and consequently reduce high voltages needed to steer secondary electrons to their MCP target. Additionally, continuous, curved MCPs can relieve structural mounting complexity and the consequential vibration mode complexity. The MCPs will be made by bending glass capillary arrays, then applying thin films to provide the functionality of a microchannel plate electron multiplier. This two-step approach makes possible nearly any shape for an MCP. Another benefit of this approach is that the microchannels will always have the same angle relative to the surface normal at any location. This will make the detection efficiency the same for all particles with normal incidence at any location on the MCP. A similar approach can be used for simple, lightweight collimators. Microchannels can be oriented perpendicularly to the surface, and the curve made to fit the symmetry of the entrance system. A carbon foil may be added to the surface of the collimator to provide a secondary electron for timing measurements. Although the cylindrical nature of the microchannels introduces some specular reflection from the interior of the channels, this approach offers the benefit of mechanical simplicity and light weight for a collimator application.","The curved MCP or collimator may be used in any spaceflight particle detection instrument, to improve volume utilization and measurement quality. These are instrument-enabling benefits for instruments in the CubeSat scale, as well as instruments in mass-constrained deep space missions.","The curved MCP may be used for terrestrial mass spectrometers, cylindrical beam monitors, or MCP-photomultipliers for compact cylindrical geometries, in which flight path uniformity from source to detector is critical for photon timing."

Specifically, we have targeted environmental samples from Ocean World bodies with water and ice (i.e., Europa, Enceladus and Titan), but this module may be adapted for other environments where there is a need to detect trace amounts of organics and biomolecules as NASA continues to search for extant and extinct life throughout the solar system.","The INSPECT technology, once completed, can be adapted for selective monitoring of terrestrial chemical levels. This will be important for environmental monitoring of groundwater near crude oil deposits and pipelines, or used to monitor the spread of pollutants associated with hydraulic fracturing. The INSPECT device could also be adapted to monitor pharmaceuticals in waste or drinking water which are becoming more abundant in densely populated areas."

Numerous NASA programs and experiments are directed to measuring these effects.  In-situ measurements are critical for supporting satellite-borne instruments.  While research aircraft carry the best in-situ instruments, the aircraft and instruments are too expensive to provide sufficient coverage.  Anasphere is developing a suite of low-cost, balloon-borne instruments that can quantify all three condensed phases of water in clouds: supercooled liquid, liquid, and ice.  The first two instruments have been developed and are used around the world.  This project is directed to developing the ice water content (IWC) sensor to complete the trio.  Addition of an IWC sensor will yield a suite of instruments that can be used for measurements of all cloud types including mixed-phase clouds. In Phase I, an IWC sensor which is a derivative of the preceding successful instruments will be developed.  This will entail the development of a suitable ice collection medium and associated calibration equations.  Supporting work to be completed will include optimizing Anasphere’s icing wind tunnel for pure ice particle conditions.  Phase I will conclude with the new IWC sensor being operated in the icing wind tunnel.","The primary NASA applications are found in two programs: the Earth Observing System through CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System experiment), and the Radiation Sciences Program through FIRE (First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Regional Experiment).  The instruments, by virtue of being inexpensive balloon-borne payloads, will enable greater spatial and temporal coverage in support of validation and verification efforts related to these experiments.",Other agencies (especially the Department of Energy) are engaged in radiative transfer research and will be key beneficiaries of this technology.

The formation of ice in the atmosphere depends on the nature and abundance of ice nucleating particles (INP), and has major implications for precipitation and cloud properties. Observational capabilities are required to advance understanding of INP, and there is a substantial gap between current needs within NASA and existing instruments. This project develops a new commercial instrument for airborne INP measurements based on the continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) concept. The CFDC approach involves exposing sampled aerosol in a region between two ice-covered walls and measuring ice crystals that form. In Phase I, we seek to test new wall materials necessary for wider-spread use and commercialization of the CFDC technology. Wall materials used in current versions of the CFDC require frequent cleaning, chemical treatment, and re-assembly, which makes its use by NASA prohibitively costly. Tests proposed include characterizing the thermal and other properties of the proposed wall materials, assessing their performance in terms of INP measurement sensitivity when applied in a basic laboratory configuration, and evaluating their longevity and stability necessary for use in a sustainable measurement platform. An evaluation of the test results will identify a suitable wall material for future development efforts would be the of Phase II, which has the deliverable of producing a prototype INP measurement system suitable for autonomous operation onboard research aircraft. The project directly addresses the NASA need for measurement capabilities to support current satellite and model validation by providing an instrument capable of measuring ice nucleating particle concentration in an airborne deployment, as identified in subtopic S1.08, In Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Earth Science.","By supporting this project, NASA would obtain airborne INP measurement capabilities that would support model validation and airborne science program field campaigns, similar to those discussed in the ROSES-2018 solicitation. Suitable platforms include the DC-8, P-3, C-20A and G-V. Relevant campaigns include any that include a focus on aerosol-cloud interactions, similar to FIREChem, NAAMES, ORACLES, ARISE II, CAMP2Ex and potentially those funded by the currently open EVS-3 solicitation.","Domestically, agencies with an interest in measuring INP from aircraft include the Department of Energy ASR/ARM, NOAA CSD, and NSF/NCAR atmospheric chemistry programs. Foreign government organizations include the UK MetOffice (BAe-146) and German DLR (G-V).

Traditionally, cryocoolers for such applications have been Stirling or pulse tube refrigerators. These cryocoolers, although effective, are heavy, bulky, inefficient, and may cause vibrations. A high-performance solid-state cryocooler based on thermomagnetic cooling via the Ettingshausen effect can be lighter, smaller, vibration free, and use less power than the alternatives. Historically, the practical development of the Ettingshausen coolers was discouraged as they required a magnetic field difficult to reach by traditional ferrite magnets. However, recent rare-earth permanent magnets can produce the required field reliably. We propose an Ettingshausen cooler consisting of advanced permanent magnets combined with a novel semiconductor heterostructure predicted to significantly enhance the efficiency of the solid-state cryogenic cooling in a compact size. The Phase I work will demonstrate the preliminary materials properties and the design required to achieve cooling power larger than 0.2‑0.3 W in 30-35 K temperatures ranges for the rejection temperature of 150 K, while consuming less than 5 W power.

This proposal addresses the need for remote detection and classification of trace concentrations of organic compounds on the surfaces of Ocean and Icy Worlds including Europa, Enceladus, Titan, as well as other cold worlds.  Mars 2020 SHERLOC conducts vibrational spectroscopy at standoff about 6 cm due to low cross-sections about 108 to 1010 times lower than fluorescence. At temperatures below 160K, the ability to measure vibrational information of organic compounds with vastly increased cross-sections, equivalent to room temperature fluorescence or greater, was demonstrated in the publication in 2011 by P.V. Johnson of JPL and others.  They showed that low temperature fluorescence exhibits resolvable vibrational bands that provide structural details such as the arrangement of methyl groups and the presence and variability of functional groups.  This enables detection at far greater standoff distances and lower concentrations with anticipated limits of detection from below 1 ppb at standoff distances of 10’s of meters to about 1 ppm at 10’s of kilometers.

The Phase II effort will be focused on developing and demonstrating the RITOC instrument in terrestrial settings at distances up to 100 m, bringing RITOC instrument TRL up to about 3.","The RITOC method and instrument has a broad range of potential applications for NASA for measuring the type and distribution of trace organic chemical and biological materials on surfaces from small to medium size fixed landers. rovers, and potentially on low altitude flyby instruments of Ocean and Icy Worlds.

This subtopic focuses on new technological developments that are needed for exoplanet direct imaging, and specifically identifies wavefront measurement and control technologies as a key need. The core subject of this proposal is to develop a technology that is identified as critical in this subtopic: small-stroke, high-precision deformable mirrors and associated driving electronics. The solicitation specifically calls for a “Deformable, calibrated, collimating source to simulate the telescope front end of a coronagraph undergoing thermal deformations.” The proposed DM would have complementary uses for both simulating the front end of a coronagraph (as a surrogate for its primary) and precisely compensating wavefront errors in the front end of an actual coronagraph. High-precision deformable mirrors have applications relative to multiple NASA needs. Commercialization opportunities in astronomy and space science include both space telescopes such as the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) telescopes.  The DM architectures to be developed in this project also have commercial applications in non-government markets, including space surveillance and biological microscopy.

(MIS) proposes the construction of large baseline structures, 15 meters or greater, for infrared space interferometry missions by autonomous in-space manufacturing and assembly. This enables the deployment of large primary trusses unconstrained by launch load or volume restrictions that meet science requirements for the high angular resolutions (less than 0.3 arcseconds) necessary to detect planets near bright stars and measure individual objects in star clusters. In this Phase I effort, MIS investigates the mass, performance, and mission planning benefits of in-space manufacturing for structurally-connected interferometers (SCI).MIS is the leading developer of manufacturing technologies in the space environment. Utilizing technologies derived from Archinaut, a NASA Tipping Point 2015 award winner, large infrastructure can be manufactured on orbit and enable a multitude of missions. Optimast is a self-contained, scalable machine for producing microgravity-optimized linear structures on-orbit, developed as a product application of the Archinaut technologies. MIS has developed Optimast to a TRL-6 with successful thermal vacuum testing of extended structure manufacturing in 2017. Adapting the MIS Optimast technology to produce long baseline structures with low thermal expansion materials enables simultaneous structural fabrication and positioning of the optical subsystems to the required absolute (static) and dynamic (thermal deflection and oscillation) tolerances. An Optimast-SCI baseline structure thus provides superior absolute position control over traditional deployable structures at much lower cost, mass, and integration complexity and eliminates the parasitic mass from hinge mechanisms and traverse rails.","Long baseline interferometry is necessary to provide the sub-arcsecond angular resolution and high spectral resolution for collecting spectral data on protostellar disks, finding protoplanets hidden in dust fields, and resolving questions about how galaxies merge. The Optimast-SCI technology is also applicable to the development of large deployable antennas, manufactured structures for large backplanes and other spacecraft systems, and structurally-connected interferometry in other wavelengths.","MIS has preliminarily identified opportunities for Earth remote sensing and space situational awareness for large optical interferometers in Earth orbit. Depending on the customer requirements for spatial resolution, target resolution, and imaging wavelength, MIS plans to consult with industry partners and further develop concepts for structurally-connected interferometers intended for commercial applications."

A challenging requirement on the opto-mechanical system is that of wavefront error stability on the order of 10 pm RMS per wavefront control step (~10s of minutes).  Goodman Technologies proposes a purposefully engineered 2nd Generation structural-grade “RoboSiC-S” to provide the degree of passive athermality required by the HaBEX, LUVOIR, eLISA, and LISA missions, concomitant with low areal density (4-5 kg/m2) and the ability to perform active precision adjustment. The combination of 3D/AM allows the manufacture of high structural efficiency pyramidal, tetrahedral or Kagome truss sandwich core configurations, honeycomb cores, or  lattice cores. Clever core design provides the additional stability benefit of cryogenic damping.  RoboSiC-S, at 298K, is predicted to have 12X and 2.5X better steady state stability, respectively,  than Zerodur® and M55J/954-6 (using the composites cryo-CTE). The average value of the CTE for the JWST M55J/T300/954-6 composite over the 25-150K temperature range calculated from measured Backplane Stability Test Article strains is -0.3 ppm/K (V1 tubes) and -0.125 ppm/K (spanner tubes). For comparison, RoboSiC-S has predicted a CTE of <1 ppm/K from 20-180K, and near-0 CTE (0.027 ppm/K) from 20-60K.  In addition to 3D/AM, electrical conductivity of RoboSiC-S allows precision threaded holes and bolts to employ a “bolt-together” approach such as was used for the composite mirror backplane of the JWST.  Ultra-fine ¼-80 bolts with 0.25mm pitch threads can be used as positioning actuators for hinged components to provide stable, athermal, and precision alignment.  We plan a well-designed project to demonstrate a deployable primary mirror with backing structure, hinges, latches with stability to picometers, areal density of 4-5 kg/m2, and packaging efficiency of 7 deployed/stowed diameter.","The New Worlds Technology Development Program teams, and the various COR and PCOS STDTs require affordable, low areal density and ultra-stable opto-mechanical structures.

The ability to print near-net shapes in silicon carbide will increase design freedom and reduce production cost/time. This research will therefore have significant impact for space exploration. This development effort will generate new knowledge about the additive manufacturing of silicon carbide and enable the production of silicon carbide mirrors. Unlike existing processes, such as hot pressing, slip casting, or polymer binding, the new approach to be studied does not rely on: 1) high temperatures/pressures within a mold; or 2) a polymer binder that serves as the preliminary support structure until it is removed by sintering. Rather, sodium hydroxide will be applied to silicon carbide powder in a powder bed, liquid binder-jetting process. The sodium hydroxide will oxidize the silicon carbide to form an amorphous silica layer. When heat is added, this amorphous layer will crystallize to form a network of connecting rods and plates between the adjacent silicon carbide grains through secondary crystal growth. This crystalline silica network will serve to reduce the porosity while increasing the density and strength. This represents a transformative step forward in additive manufacturing that is applicable not only to silicon carbide, but can also be extended to other material systems. The supporting oxidation and crystal growth modeling efforts will enable a deterministic approach to process parameter selection.",The work proposed in this effort can have a direct effect on NASA's potential LUVOIR and HabEx missions.

Telescopes used for astrophysics, exoplanet, and planetary studies require picometer stability over several minutes to hours. Building large support structures with picometer level stability is a challenge with currently available materials due to their brittle nature in the case of Zerodur and ULE or their requirement to have tight thermal control in the case of SiC or carbon fiber composites. ALLVAR Alloys offer a new material solution for thermally stable structures. They exhibit negative thermal expansion and can compensate for the positive thermal expansion of other materials to stabilize a telescope. The ultimate goal of this work is to create an ultra-stable ALLVAR Alloy metering structure manufacturing process. Bars with low thermal expansion have previously been made by welding ALLVAR Alloys to commercially available Titanium alloys, but their dimensional stability over thermal fluctuations is above the pm stability limit. This Phase I project is designed to better understand the individual stability of the titanium and ALLVAR Alloys and to evaluate hydroxide bonding for mounting mirrors to ALLVAR in preparation for pm level stability tests. The Phase II project would run full scale pm level stability tests in an effort to evaluate the relaxation manufacturing steps and understand how welding the ALLVAR Alloy to titanium may affect the material’s stability.","A new material with picometer stability can potentially improve support structures for optic systems critical to NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, like LUVIOR or HabEX.

Low reflective coatings (with reflectivity of ~0.1% or less) in the broad spectral range (visible- near infrared) have to be developed. These black coatings should also withstand aggressive space environments and launch conditions with marginal impact on their adhesion and optical performance. A promising candidate with an outstanding diffuse absorptance is chemically vapor deposited layers of carbon nanotubes. However, these coatings are typically grown by expensive and thermally based techniques and can be difficult to apply to 3D structures. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, efficient and scalable manufacturing process for the deposition of durable, low reflectivity CNT black coatings based on the use of pulse and pulse reverse electrophoretic deposition. This technology will enable the conformal deposition of CNT black coatings on complex shapes and sharp edges on commonly used spacecraft materials such as aluminum and titanium substrates. In Phase I, Faraday will develop an electrophoretic bath formulation and manipulate the pulsed electric field parameters to deposit dense, vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes onto test substrates, and characterize the deposited coatings to show the potential of achieving the desired reflectivity of 0.1% or less, monitor the thickness uniformity and morphology and demonstrate the potential for durability in severe launch conditions. Finally, a preliminary techno-economic will be completed to show the potential to reduce the cost of existing processes while maintaining required optical properties.

The foldable panel array eliminates the costly honeycomb panels and hinge mechanisms associated with rigid panel array systems, providing a significant system level cost reduction. The innovative solar array consists of a highly-manufacturable single-piece thin laminated panel with solar cells bonded directly to the panel using standard cell laydown processes.  The solar array folds upon itself for stowage in a flat-package configuration and is protected for launch with a proprietary packaging technique.

EMI shielding for wire and cables is an attractive opportunity for weight reduction. However, with the advent of highly reusable next generation space vehicles, wiring must be not only light weight, but also strong and robust, capable of withstanding extreme conditions, intense vibration and long lifecycles. It is important that wire weight reductions do not come at the expense of mechanical strength or EMI shielding effectiveness.  DexMat is developing a novel and highly conductive Carbon nanotube (CNT) EMI shield product that will allow for significant weight reduction without compromising mechanical strength or shield effectiveness. CNTs are advancing as the most promising solution for reducing the weight of spacecraft wires.  The shielding effectiveness of CNT materials is comparable to that of heavy metal braids, but at a fraction of the weight.  Compared to a copper wire with the same diameter, a CNT fiber has 6 times higher strength, more than 6 times lower density,  and at least 25 times higher flexure tolerance, essential qualities for conductors in aerospace applications. Under this Phase I project, DexMat will develop CNT shielding braid (made from CNT yarn from Dexmat) that can potentially increase the mechanical strength of CNT tape used as a primary EMI shield. These CNT braids will be of different thicknesses and area coverage, to augment the performance and product appeal of CNT tapes. Additionally, DexMat will begin to conduct the first accelerated aging tests to determine the impact on mechanical strength of shielding made with CNT tapes, CNT yard braids, and hybrid CNT tape/braid combinations.","The first planned product to contain DexMat technology is lightweight CNT cables. CNT cables combine high strength, electrical and thermal conductivity with low density, making them ideal for aerospace applications where weight reduction is a priority, including reusable next generation space vehicles and satellites. Given the tremendous costs associated with satellite launches, NASA and the aerospace industry will see substantial savings from our CNT-based wire.","DexMat CNT technology has applications in the military aircraft and commercial aviation markets, to effectively reduce weight of aircraft and satellite designs.  For a single-aisle aircraft, a 1% reduction of in weight can lead to a net cost savings of $240K-$1.6M per year in use. For larger aircraft, the savings can reach $2.4-5M. Additional applications include wearable electronics, eTextiles and bioelectronics."

The proposed PPU solution adopts advanced GaN power MOSFETs and PCB based planar magnetics technology to enable high switching frequency operation. Reduced headcount of magnetics, semiconductors and associated driver integrated circuits will allow for significant size reduction of all passive components to support ultra-high power density designs. This innovation will further miniaturize HET PPUs from today’s state-of-art by an anticipated 30% in volume and mass, with cost reductions exceeding 50% versus SOA solutions. The unique advantages of the proposed system can be summarized in three parts. First, the system utilizes a novel single-core multi-port circuit topology which integrates all the PPU subsystems through a single stage power conversion using a single multi-winding transformer. This significantly reduces system volume, weight, and cost. Second, the power flow control for each subsystem is fully independent regardless of power stage sharing. Each subsystem has its own phase shift control to regulate the desired output voltage and current. Third, the proposed PPU circuit topology is essentially a soft-switching DC-DC converter which can ensure zero-voltage-switching operation for all the switching devices. The proposal adopts the advanced GaN power MOSFETs and PCB based planar magnetics technology to enable high switching frequency operation, which supports a 30% size reduction of magnetics and other passive components in the high-efficiency and high-power density design.

The small size is enabled by our Radiation Hard By Design (RHBD) commercial CMOS ASIC. This results in 4X smaller size, 4X lower weight, and 20X lower power vs. state of the art IRUs, (e.g. MIMU, NGC SIRU).

Additionally, an investigation will be performed to select materials and construction methods that ensure long-term survival in the corrosive cloud-top environment.","Beyond the obvious NASA application of a mission to Venus there are some other uses of the technologies developed here that will garner interest in other NASA missions. The three main pieces that will have wider interest is the autonomous dynamic soaring, the compact deployable aircraft, and survivability in toxic air. These capabilities will be applicable on Earth for hurricane sampling UAS missions, severe storm sampling, and measurement of volcanic plumes.",Other agencies beyond NASA would greatly benefit from a system that could harvest energy thought dynamic soaring and provide lengthly observations above ridge lines and severe convective storms.  NOAA would benefit from such a platform for both hurricane observations as well as fire weather observations.  The USGS would receive valuable data from a platform able to provide lengthy observations of volcanic emissions.  Additionally the NWS could use the platform to feed their ensemble forecasts.

The transmit Ka-band frequencies of NASA TDRSS satellites go up to 27.5-Ghz and are adjacent to the commercial Ka-band satellite frequencies starting at 27.5-Ghz, so this single Ka-band flight terminal will be able to tune to both the NASA TDRSS and commercial Ka-band satellite frequencies. This Ka-band flight terminal will be shown to have a lower size, weight, and power (SWaP) to the existing NASA Balloon satcom terminals. A relatively low-cost 2-dimensional electronic beamforming antenna will be tested for its capability to point a high-gain antenna beam at the existing commercial or TDRSS Ka-band satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) as the terrestrial balloon is moving slowly in relation to those GEO satellites. Testing will also be performed on the ability of this same beamforming antenna to point at and track existing O3b middle Earth orbit (MEO) and TeleSat and SpaceX low Earth orbit (LEO) Ka-band satellites that will be moving much faster relative to the balloon. The performance of this Ka-band flight terminal will change dramatically from 10-Mbps to 1-Gbps depending on which Ka-band satellite and which satellite beam in which GEO, MEO, or LEO orbit the balloon's terminal decides to access. Software defined radio (SDR) waveform firmware and flight radio hardware will be tested through a channel simulator that uses software to simulate a moving NASA Balloon successfully closing satcom links through satellites with different link characteristics. Beam to beam handovers, frequency channel interference mitigation, and the different Doppler shift compensation needed for the different GEO, MEO, and LEO orbits will be tested in these simulations of the SDR firmware and hardware.","NASA Terrestrial Balloons currently use a TDRSS satellite communications terminal and an Iridium satellite communications terminal for balloon communications.At present, NASA is limited to data rates of 150-Kbps using the TDRSS S-band communications service. The 10-Mbps to 1-Gbps data rate of the proposed Ka-band terminal would be a 100 to 10,000 times improvement. The proposed Ka-band terminal at under 10-kg could probably be added to these balloons without replacing the other terminals.","The low size, weight, and power (SWaP) of the proposed Ka-band terminal at under 10-kg should make it attractive to the market for over 100,000 commercial (not consumer) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) sold each year that would like high data rate satellite communications of payload data when these UAV aircraft are out of range of their ground stations. With different software defined radio (SDR) firmware, much of this same Ka-band terminal hardware could be used in the automobile market."

This capability will provide quantitative test data to inform balloon design efforts, as well as enable real-time monitoring of material state during flight.  Existing technologies include wired or wireless electrical or fiber-optic strain gauges, impractical to implement on a thin membrane; photogrammetric techniques that require multiple cameras, detailed knowledge of nominal balloon geometry, and significant post-processing computation; and exotic optical techniques that are unsuited for large scale, dynamic balloon testing and flight.  We will develop a completely novel measurement system based on an optically-interrogated thin-film elastomer strain gauge that will provide sensitive, real-time, two-component strain measurement in balloon gores.  A large number of the low modulus, thin-film sensors distributed across the balloon will be interrogated remotely at high frequency with a single camera that can be mounted on the payload.","Given the high cost of payload launch, NASA often develops lightweight technologies.  These include membrane systems such as balloons, solar sails, inflatable booms, and parachutes, along with thin structures such as solar panels, spacecraft skins, and pressure domes. In each case, our novel low modulus, remotely interrogated strain gauge will be of value for both testing and development along with in-service control feedback and health monitoring.","Because of its unique properties such as low elastic modulus, ease of application, and remote interrogation, we anticipate that this novel sensor will have a broad array of applications.  It will find commercial use in testing of flexible structures such as sails, balloons, tents, and architectural panels.

We are proposing to research and develop a new high-performance, single-stage, multiple-output aerospace grade POL converter that reduces total size/weight costs of supplying POL voltages by up to 50%.

The importance here is that a SIMO converter can furnish many independently regulated POL outputs using a single power stage, eliminating all but a one inductor across multiple POL supplies. The proposed SIMO converter approach presents a multi-output converter topology that, while eliminating the need for multiple magnetic components, can provide numerous fully-independent, well-regulated outputs with industry leading electrical performance.","By removing a key size/weight obstacle with a high specific power/very high efficiency, HighRel solution, the proposed research may be pivotal for enabling transition of a wide range of NASA science missions including higher Earth orbit missions and deep-space missions such as Europa and Jupiter missions to CubeSats SmallSat/CubeSat platforms.","The high radiation tolerant WBG switching converter developed will be directly relevant to many non-NASA applications such as mobile devices, commercial drones, internet of things devices, microcontroller systems, wireless devices, high density power systems, small signal regulators for larger systems.

Based on an acousto-optic illumination engine, SLIM consumes only 10-20W of power, weighs less than a kilogram, could fit in a shirt pocket, and uses space-proven components without moving parts to rapidly generate and precisely control laser illumination patterns. Through modifications of SLIM hardware and algorithms, MARVIN enables triangulation-based wide-field active 3D imaging of nearby scenes with mm-scale resolution at distances up to 10m even in the presence of full sunlight, as well as multi-beam time-of-flight (ToF) cm-resolution ranging and Doppler velocimetry at distances of hundreds of meters, or potentially even further.  MARVIN can switch between the two modes simply by moving a lens. MARVIN computes each range point in parallel and independently, is robust across a wide range of ambient lighting and albedos, and is computationally simple, increasing rover autonomy day and night, and eliminating traverse and science operation down-times due to uplinks and heavy computation required by stereo vision.  MARVIN can be used as a faster, more robust, high-precision primary range sensor for landed or close-proximity robotic exploration of planets and small bodies including Mars, Ocean Worlds, asteroids, comets, and planetary moons. The proposed effort includes further feasibility and commercialization studies, algorithm development, noise and performance analysis, and a basic proof-of-concept lab demonstration of MARVIN in the near-infrared. We will also evaluate the use of telecom-wavelength sources and detectors to further improve MARVIN SNR for operation in sunlight and on icy bodies such as Europa.  We believe the proposed effort will advance MARVIN from TRL2 to TRL3.","In addition to enhancing planetary rover mobility, MARVIN could aid instrument arm positioning and serve as an agile and versatile sensor for spacecraft landing and proximity operations, including on future human missions to Mars.  An asteroid orbiter like Psyche could use MARVIN for attitude control and to map topography.  As a landed science tool, MARVIN could be used to characterize geological surfaces and with telecom wavelengths, identify ice composition on Europa or detect water on Mars.","Due in part to agile illumination control, tolerance to a wide range of lighting conditions, high throughput, no moving parts, as well as low size, weight, and power requirements, MARVIN and SLIM technologies could also prove transformative for a number of applications on Earth, including robotic simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM), aerial surveying and landing systems, as well as autonomous car navigation.

While space robots for satellite servicing have embraced the use of robotic tool changers, planetary science robotics systems have historically avoided the use of tool changers, because traditional tool changers use complex mechanical latching mechanisms with many exposed moving parts, which are often mechanically unreliable in dusty environments. To solve these problems, and enable planetary science missions to switch from using massive, complex, and bulky multi-tool turret designs, Altius proposes the development of an Electropermanent Magnetic Tool Changer, which has no externally exposed moving parts. This proposed EPM Tool Changer concept uses a solid state switchable magnetic latching system to hold the tool to the tool changer, and non-contact power and data transmission. And while it is not in the scope of the proposed Phase I/II effort, this tool changer design can also enable the use of a contactless mechanical tool-drive coupling system, enabling mechanical tool drive without exposed moving parts on either side of the interface. During Phase I, Altius will work with NASA planetary science robotics teams to identify and document system requirements, and then Altius will design, build, and prototype the magnetic connection system and the wireless power/data transfer systems. This testing, which will include preliminary dusty environment testing will raise the TRL of the power/data version of the EPM tool changer from TRL 2 to TRL 4, enabling a flight-grade prototype of the power/data EPM Tool Changer to be designed, built, and qualified during Phase II, raising the system to TRL 6, where it is mature enough to be integrated into future NASA and commercial missions.",,

Contamination Control and Planetary Protection requirements focus on both forward and backward contamination from such bodies where a number of acceptable processes have been developed for sterilizing spacecraft hardware and sample return materials. In particular for backward contamination control, NASA has shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide is an effective method for sterilizing samples and surfaces. However, for long duration exploration missions, stored hydrogen peroxide solutions lose their efficacy. To ensure an effective vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization process for return trips, Skyhaven Systems LLC proposes to produce and optimize a novel reactor system that can produce 750 ppm vaporized hydrogen peroxide using only water and DC electrical energy. With this approach, surfaces and sample return materials can be effectively sterilized during sample collection using a NASA approved sterilant.","This vaporized hydrogen peroxide system is directed towards NASA’s needs for contamination control and planetary protection. Integrating this peroxide generator into sterilization system will enable an effective sterilant to be produced for long duration missions where stored hydrogen peroxide is not feasible. Further, the oxygen and water breakdown products from the sterilization process can be reclaimed  minimizing expendable losses.",Commercial opportunities for the hydrogen peroxide generator may be directed toward medical equipment sterilization.

We propose to leverage past observations of the ability of electrospray ionization to capture and concentrate polar or polarizable trace species without damage, and combine that knowledge with recent discoveries in developing a hypervelocity ice-gun for NASA studies aimed at ice grain capture simulations. The phase I effort will focus on using the ice gun we created under prior NASA support, and add a cold plasma curtain to pre-charge an incident ice grain, and then add a novel electrospray element that we believe will enable in-situ organic analysis capability previously unattainable on board a spacecraft using existing NASA mass spectrometer hardware. Incident ice grain impacts into aerogel create a rearward plume of water vapor that may contain a high percentage of trace organic species. Using a cross-current electrospray source, these species may be charged to form multiply charged ions capable of being interrogated in-situ using a mass analyzer, while preserving aerogel impact samples for a return mission. This proposal endeavors to address one of the major concerns in any particulate impact-capture mission, is the potential loss of valuable samples entrained in aerogel. In addition, the long flight time back to Earth results in significant potential discovery delays. With the proposed technology, NASA can now perform in-situ organic analysis of incident ice grains in near real-time, and have impact samples retained for a return mission for additional study on Earth.","The applications of the proposed technology for NASA include the means to employ mass spectrometry in more applications than has been the case in the past, because with the creation of multiply charged ions rather than singly charged species, existing mass analyzers can be employed to look for the presence of organic molecules, without increasing analyzer upmass, size, or power requirements.","For Non-NASA applications, the technology being offered in this proposal include the potential for new methods of ambient pathogen capture and soft ionization for mass spectrometric analysis. In addition, other applications may include non-organic polar molecule charging suitable for thin layer deposition, chip fabrication, and other semiconductor uses."

LACROSS will conduct these analysis in-situ, directly on icy samples collected from the plume during fly-throughs. Thus, LACROSS addresses five of the six Technologies solicited by subtopic S4.06. LACROSS’ sample collection & management system utilizes an innovative architecture to a) collect particles using an angled-wall collector an b) analyze them in-situ, without the need for sample processing and concentrating. The collector funnels ice particles into plasmonic aerogel (Stardust heritage), where particles bury and slow down to a stop. The plasmonic aerogel enables ultra-sensitive (1 nM) SERS measurements of all particles that intersects the focus plane. LACROSS’ innovative approach to sample capture and analysis enables unprecedented in-flight sample collection and measurements of material freshly injected into space: in-situ chemical identification and quantitation of complex organic compounds, including pre-biotic compounds (e.g., amino acids); biomolecules (organic biomarkers such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid polymers); minerals; salts; volatiles. LACROSS will be a substantial technological leap with respect to existing or proposed sampling and/or analysis systems of Enceladus plume in the following key aspects: (1) it utilizes an innovative architecture to capture and transfer ice particles from plumes directly to a sensor that requires no moving parts, actuators, sample handling; (2) the multiplex integral-field SERS imaging approach features augmented science returns and reduced technical complexity relative to existing and proposed planetary Raman spectrometers; (3) LACROSS minimizes the resources and complexity required to capture and concentrate a sample and perform key investigations required to understand the habitability of Enceladus.","LACROSS improves measurement capabilities of hypervelocity particles in Ocean Worlds plumes, comet comas, and upper planetary atmospheres. It simplifies the process of sample collection and analysis with a single, stream-lined instrument. LACROSS increases the sensitivity of planetary Raman spectroscopy to at least the nM range, which enables new and innovative scientific measurements that can replace complicated, risky sample collection and processing systems.","LACROSS may be adapted to measure the concentrations and concentration gradients of pollution/greenhouse gases, particularly those from the utilization of fossil fuels and aromatic volatile organic compounds in-situ, and in real time. LACROSS plasmonic aerogels could capture gases during atmospheric fly-throughs using unmanned aircraft (balloon, UAV) and analyze them on the fly.

The method improves upon previous methods and allows for variable fluid properties including specific heat ratio and Prandtl number. In addition, the method increases the traditional Mach number limit of LBM from 0.2 to 3.0 allowing for the method to simulate transonic and supersonic phenomena. The Phase I project will investigate the accuracy and speed of the method with respect to existing NASA solvers including NASA OVERFLOW and NASA FUN3D. The LBM solver will be written in serial and in parallel using NVIDIA’s CUDA to allow for GPU use. Future work is discussed to improve upon the method and to incorporate the method into NASA solvers such as NASA LAVA and NASA Cart3D.",NASA applications include incorporating the method directly into NASA solvers such as NASA LAVA and NASA Cart3D. LBM is well-suited for Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Cartesian grids which both solvers utilize. Low-Mach LBM is already implemented in NASA LAVA which will allow for the proposed compressible LBM to be easily integrated. The method can be used to simulate loads and acoustics on experimental subsonic/supersonic aircraft and helicopters that NASA is interested in.,"An in-house 3D solver can be developed using existing AMR frameworks to enable a commercial product. The solver can be used to simulate commercial subsonic/supersonic aircraft and helicopters.

Such I/O operations are often a serious bottleneck for large scale simulations, resulting in I/O bottlenecks that significantly degrade overall performance. There are existing HDF5-based solutions similar to what we propose here. However, these solutions are either one-off implementations or implemented for specific computing environments, or both, and thus do not have the broad applicability that a general HDF5 solution would have. With its proven record for scalability, HDF5 is the data store of choice for many of the most important applications at NASA, the DOE, and other high-end computing (HEC) facilities. Thus, an HDF5 based solution would become available immediately, with minimal modification, to many existing applications, and would be extremely easy to adapt in support of future applications. H5 Hermes directly addresses the objectives of the solicitation. It will accelerate the integration of current and future high-end computing systems and data stores by enabling I/O processing to keep up with the demands of increasingly high-resolution simulations on massively parallel systems.  Thus, H5 Hermes helps achieve four of the five objectives of solicitation S5.01, namely to: H5 Hermes will also improve the ability to efficiently retrieve many pieces of related data from very large cloud-based data stores. This is another NASA priority, though not part of the S5.01 solicitation.","A wide range of NASA applications use HDF5 or one based on HDF5, such as netCDF4 and CGNS.

The automated deep learning tool performs a spatial–temporal analysis of multiple InSAR images, to yield a high fidelity estimate of the deformation of the topography and estimate of atmospheric water vaper when a recent Digital Elevation Model is also known. There are existing methods used by earth science experts to detect and mitigate the atmospheric anomaly that effects the time of flight of backscattered radar, either from multiple InSAR images or when integrating other sources of elevation or meteorological observations or models.  The automated image reconstruction algorithm will minimize a loss function, an inferred empirical error based on a large sample set, rather than the heuristic or incompletely modeled statistical algorithms currently employed, through a three-step process: first detect the regions affected by the atmospheric anomaly, and then second without a-priori knowledge use a generative network to reconstruct the interferogram or deformation map without the atmospheric effect, and use another network to train the loss function to evaluate the generator’s result and adjust its internal parameters. This type of approach has not been implemented for InSAR imagery, but has been applied to similar image processing problems and generalized to other tasks. This tool is meant for big data analysis of very fast revisit InSAR that covers the entire globe. Lynntech and SMU-Earth Science propose to develop and validate this approach for developing a new image processing tool in Phase I , while developing the deep learning enhanced fidelity InSAR toolkit in Phase II and III, raising the TRL from 2 to 4 within the Phase I work plan and planning for testing on relevant datasets in Phase II.","This technology would be useful to many Earth science and meteorological applications involving changes in terrain, ecology and the weather.  Digital elevation models can be produced and updated in near real-time. Ground level deformations due to various processes could be monitored on almost a daily basis. Also highly fidelity spatio-temporal analysis of fast revisit InSAR data to track changes in the Earth’s surface and atmosphere would help in the zenith dry delay correction of GPS signals.","Regularly monitoring changes in the ground would be useful in disaster prediction and recovery (e.g. mudslides, flooding, sinkholes), evaluating the settling of infrastructure, preventing property damage and is also vital to land management strategies. Estimating atmospheric water vapor would assist in nowcasting. InSAR imagery can be useful in decision making in a wide range of applications.

These approaches will allow for an order of magnitude improvement in the frame acquisition speed of existing detectors at a high compression ratio with no loss of resolution, while at the same time permitting them to overcome object obscuration and radiation damage phenomena in excess of existing technologies in this area. To accomplish these goals we propose to develop new hyperspectral sensors that intentionally omit pixels that will be recovered using model based compressive sensing.  This provides the ability to selectively acquire a small number of pixels in an existing imaging array to form the complete image with no loss of image resolution or fidelity (or the ability to select an even smaller number with an acceptable loss of resolution). In addition, the algorithms that will be developed can adapt to the form of key image types using machine learning, so that the number of pixels can be reduced further, or that the pixels used for the image can be adaptively changed to avoid obscuration/damaged pixels. This type of imaging system has significant benefits for imaging/detection across a whole range of NASA programs and missions for recovery of damaged equipment or scenes, image enhancement, data compression or using novel designs with reduced pixel densities.  This imaging approach will also automatically compress all images obtained by the level of sub-sampling used to form the image, reducing transmission and storage costs significantly, even without using additional lossless data compression before transmission.","This technology can be applied to both existing hyperspectral imaging systems and those being developed. The approach can be applied to both division of time and division of space systems, maintaining resolution while reducing capture time and noise. Additional applications are available in robust data compression for storage and transmission over long distances. This approach also provides fault tolerance, system recovery and image enhancement for fielded imagers with lost pixels.","Commercialization will come in two forms: enhancement of existing technologies which can leverage CS, and through selling custom-made imaging systems as build in functionality.

One such application is land cover classification and the construction of crop type maps. These maps serve as critical inputs in performing environmental and agriculture monitoring tasks, for instance in case of NASA’s Land Cover Land Use Change (LCLUC) program. Current popular approaches use deep learning models for remote sensing and utilize a single date image for classification purposes. However, to identify specific land cover classes such as crop types reliably, multi-temporal images are usually required. Use of a multi-temporal-images-based approach presents challenges that include the need to leverage heterogeneous data sources with multiple scales (spatial and temporal), multiple spectral bands, continuous and point-based coverage and incorporating domain knowledge to DL models To address these challenges and to create an end-to-end deep learning system for crop type classification and characterization for stakeholders to use, we propose to develop DeepRES - an Open Source Deep Learning Platform for REmote Sensing Data. The DeepRES learning network will use multi-temporal multi-source satellite data (EO and SAR), the state-of-the-art in deep learning (Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks), scientific data management and visualization products, and Kitware- and community-developed open-source tools such as Girder, TensorFlow, and GeoJS. DeepRES will benefit stakeholders that are not domain scientists by giving them access to cutting-edge algorithms and benefit data scientists by letting them develop and fine-tune their models using cloud-based infrastructure.","Main results of the project will be beneficial for two major NASA programs, Land Cover Land Use Change (LCLUC) and Earth Observations for Food Security and Agriculture Consortium (EOFSAC). The project will add an arsenal of classification methods based on deep learning for remote sensing which will improve quality of classification maps. It will also provide insight into data, by helping identify which features are the most relevant to particular land/crop type classes.","The applications include 1) construction of highly accurate crop maps for agricultural trading companies to better assess agricultural markets 2) Atlas of cropping systems, which is useful to inform policy-makers and to improve visibility of the subtle differences in farm practice across the landscape 3) early warning systems in food security 4)  crop quality maps and crop yield estimation for stakeholders (large agriculture businesses, hedge fund managers,  farms)."

It allows the engineer to represent the system in a comprehensive computer model allowing for better traceability, tracking, and information consistency. The vision and promise of MBSE is one where systems models and analyses are tightly integrated in an automated, collaborative, easily accessible and secure framework. However, the current state-of-the-art falls short of this promise due to a significant gap between MBSE tools and its integration with analysis tools. Phoenix Integration proposes to develop and prototype a framework that would help realize the vision and promise of MBSE. This prototype framework will be web-based, utilizing existing tools and frameworks already deployed and being used at NASA. This will be done by leveraging available existing technology as well as commercial products currently under development. At the center of the framework is the connection between No Magic Teamwork Server and ModelCenter® MBSE. Teamwork Server is a web-based MBSE collaboration platform, while ModelCenter® MBSE is a next generation MBSE analysis integration tool currently being commercially developed at Phoenix Integration. This framework will be connected to distributed or high performance computing resources for quick analysis execution, as well as a continuous integration server for automated execution in response to a model change. In addition to being able to interact with the systems model through a web environment, the user would be able to execute the associated analyses and workflows using information from the systems model. Automatic requirements verification can be performed through automated analysis execution whenever a change in the systems model is detected. Results can be displayed on a web-enabled dashboard, together with interactive charts and plots to help visualize results and data.","These capabilities will directly benefit ongoing and future NASA projects and initiatives, such as Mars 2020 and Europa Clipper missions, the Team X and related collaborative design teams, as well as all future science missions.

Some FM issues show up during the mission, which have led to a range of outcomes from near to actual losses of science data and near-losses and actual losses of spacecraft. Addressing these issues requires much better understanding of a system’s FM design and the relationship of the design to the resulting system behaviors. A first step in achieving that improved understanding at reasonable cost is the Modeling and Visualization of the FM architecture for system designers and operators. The work proposed here aims to enable FM architectural Modeling and Visualization. Architectural models are a critical step for future work to implement FM metrics across the entire FM architecture, from state estimation through control of system states and behaviors. This modeling and visualization significantly enhances the ability to qualitatively and quantitatively understand a system’s FM design, which in turn enables more effective trade studies of different design and operational options that better grasp FM completeness and complexity. Qualtech Systems, Inc. (QSI), in collaboration with Dr. Stephen B. Johnson, President of Dependable System Technologies, LLC (DST), plan to develop techniques and the concomitant software modules for enabling FM Visualization and Design Assessment in QSI’s TEAMS® (Testability Engineering And Maintenance System) Toolset to address FM metrics for failure response/recovery, and will be linked to ongoing efforts to implement FM Metrics and to overall system autonomy, but targeting SMD science missions and their unique goals.","The proposed technology will allow NASA to better plan and execute future Science Missions.

The IMFSD covers FM requirements definition, and design specification, analysis, validation-and-verification (V&V), and documentation, enabling the connection of the associated processes and models to the corresponding elements of the host space system model-based design. The integration of FM development life-cycle processes is achieved by means of a “design development, documentation, and assurance case” (D3AC) logic structure hosted within the IMFSD software platform, which provides active connectivity among all elements of the FM design, and with the evidences produced to demonstrate compliance with concept-of-operations (ConOps) and requirements. In view of expected spacecraft-autonomy evolutions for which expanded FM operational capability and analytics will be needed, the IMFSD, in addition to established FM models like Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), includes, or links to, logic-dynamic models – e.g., Dynamic Flowgraph Methodology (DFM) and Markov Cell-to-Cell Mapping Technique (Markov-CCMT) – that can extend FM analysis into the time-dependent-logic domain. Other potentially applicable state-of-the-art models from the field of machine-learning, like Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Logic (FL, and Influence Diagrams (ID), are also evaluated for evolutionary inclusion in the IMFSD.

They are believed to be the primary cause of major geomagnetic storms. Predicting in advance whether observed CMEs hit the Earth and carry geo-effective magnetic fields is a long-term priority for the CCMC located at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and other groups within NASA as well. Such predictions are very challenging, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are considered as the most promising tool for achieving them. Our proposed interactive and highly automated MHD modeling framework, CORHEL-AMCG, will allow users to routinely model multiple observed CMEs in a realistic coronal and solar-wind environment. CORHEL-AMCG will be significantly more accurate than existing routine models, by accounting for the complexity of pre-CME configurations, the slow initiation of CMEs, and their interaction in interplanetary space. These advances will make CORHEL-AMCG extremely useful for the broader scientific community and constitute a major step towards  operational space-weather forecasting. A prototype of CORHEL-AMCG (for modeling single CMEs in a simplified coronal environment) will be available upon completion of Phase I and will be delivered to the CCMC for testing. The proposed work is directly relevant to NASA's NSWAP activities, as it will ""provide increased understanding of the fundamental physics of the Sun-Earth system through modeling"" by developing a tool that will allow researchers of the solar and heliospheric research communities to routinely model CMEs. Specifically, it will contribute to NASA's Research-to-Operations/Operations-to-Research (R2O/O2R) responsibilities in that it will aid the ""preparation and validation of existing science models in preparation for transition to operations"" and provide ""ideas for future models tied to space weather forecasting needs"", as stated in subtopic S5.06 of the Fiscal Year 2018 SBIR/STTR Research topics.","Routine CME-modeling tools currently tested at the CCMC (EEGGL and CORHEL-CG) have several limitations (simplified pre-eruptive state, unrealistic CME initiation, no interaction of CMEs). Once fully developed, CORHEL-AMCG will overcome these limitations and thus provide a more realistic and accurate framework for the routine modeling of CMEs. This will be of useful not only for the CCMC, but to other groups and efforts at NASA's Heliophyics division as well.","Accurate forecasts of CME impacts are of grave concern to many government and commercial entities. For example, NOAA provides space-weather information to a range of aerospace and infrastructure customers, and the Air Force closely monitors space weather for the military. The fledgling private launch services industry, such as SpaceX, may also wish to establish forecasting capabilities.

Heat pipes currently provide a highly conductive passive heat transfer solution, but traditional heat pipes are cumbersome to interface to the Stirling engine and radiator panels and difficult to bend to proper configurations.  While the current state-of-art is able to handle the heat load, NASA has identified deployability and thermal interfaces as focus areas for future thermal radiators.

Roccor’s thin, flat FlexCool heat pipes can interface to flat surface with low thermal resistance, provide improved radiator fin efficiency, and are simple to bend.  FlexCool will also be coupled with ROCool highly conductive (k>1,000 W/m-K) flexible blanket materials that uses proprietary processes to laminate pyrolytic graphite into a composite radiator material The overarching Phase I objective is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed heat pipe/radiator, and conduct a preliminary design-analysis-fabrication loop for a 200-watt panel capable of meeting the requirements for Sunpower’s current 80W Stirling engine technology.

The proposed programs will drastically reduce both the mass of the shielding and the amount of shielding necessary to protect power and control electronics.  Moreover, it enables flexibility of adding additional fission power sources in a manner that maximizes overall conversion of power generator outputs to maximum usable power, even if one unit degrades or fails.  The new solution approach leverages two decades of previous work for the US Navy in extremely high specific power controllers and power systems and recent efforts for the Army in extremely high efficiency power conversion.

However, in a microgravity environment, acquiring vapor-free cryogenic liquid propellants from supply tanks and then transferring them to receiving tanks of a rocket engine is very challenging. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a robust, lightweight cryogenic screen channel Liquid Acquisition Device (LAD) with a novel configuration that is assembled by Creare’s unique fabrication processes to reliably maintain the pore structure of the screen near its bonding joints with its support frames. Creare’s configuration also provides mechanical support for the screen to withstand launch vibrations. The novel configuration significantly increases the screen area compared to existing screen channels for the same size and mass. Creare’s LAD also significantly reduces the liquid holdup inside the screen channel. These features together significantly increase the expulsion efficiency of the LAD. In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through designing, fabricating, and testing a proof-of-concept screen channel at cryogenic temperature. In Phase II, we will build and demonstrate a laboratory-scale liquid acquisition device and deliver it to a NASA research lab for further evaluation.","The proposed screen channel technology will enable reliable spacecraft refueling in a microgravity environment. The resulting lightweight LAD will enable reliable cryogenic propellant transfer at high expulsion efficiency, and thus reduce cost of space missions.

The magnetic circuit components constitute more than half of the thruster mass.  To produce low-mass thrusters, the design of the magnetic circuit needs to be optimized. The advanced magnetic alloy (AMA) is the material of choice for the ferromagnetic parts of an HET's magnetic circuit.  In addition to its superior magnetic properties, the AMA is also thought to be compatible with reactive propellants such as iodine.  Currently, traditional machining is employed to fabricate these ferromagnetic parts.  This results in removal of nearly 80% of the expensive bulk material which then goes unused.  Additionally, traditional machining can cause unwanted deformation on thin parts, reducing the production yield.  In Phase I, Busek and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) propose to study the feasibility of 3D printing AMA magnetic circuit components.  Our team will consider suitable additive manufacturing (AM) processes, including ebeam/laser AM processes, and a binderjet process with suitable binders.  We will evaluate test coupons printed by ORNL by measuring their relevant magnetic properties and comparing them to those made using traditional machining methods.  Additionally, we will apply relevant heat treatments to 3D printed test coupons and then re-measure their magnetic properties. The results will be compared to those made using traditional machining methods that were subjected to identical heat treatments.  Based on the Phase I results, the best AM process will be down-selected to print a magnetic circuit component for the Busek 200W HET, with the goal of integrating it into the thruster in a potential Phase II program.",HETs enhance in-space maneuverability and payload capacity and are enabling for many NASA missions.  The ability to quickly manufacture complex geometries will allow for more flexibility in the design of the HET magnets.  AM will allow for more complex parts to be created and further optimization of the magnetic field which in turn will improve thruster performance.,Improving the technique in fabricating HET magnetic circuit components will make Busek’s HET product more desirable to potential industry partners for flight missions.

It is easily stored in a compact volume on a spacecraft as a solid (greater than twice the storage density than pressurized xenon), which negates the need for a large pressurized tank.  This, combined with its low cost and lower ionization energy, make iodine an ideal propellant for a smallsat electric thruster system.  Busek currently is developing a line of gridded Radio-Frequency (RF) ion thrusters that utilize iodine as a propellant.  In addition to their small size, the thrusters are low power and are compatible with solid-storable propellant iodine.  This makes the BIT thruster line a mission-enabling technology for situations where volume and mass are highly constrained.  The current generation of BIT thrusters use the BRFC-1, an RF-ion cathode to provide the neutralization current.   The BRFC-1 consists of a miniaturized BIT-1 thruster, modified to extract electrons instead of ions.  This cathode realization has three main limitations: Power processing complexity, feed system complexity, and reduced system Isp (due to the need to flow propellant to the cathode that does not generate thrust).  We propose to develop a photocathode that will produce a current to both ignite and neutralize the Busek line of RF ion thrusters that is highly efficient and iodine compatible.  A photocathode emits electrons when struck by an incident light beam.  This cathode, when combined with an efficient UV light source, is predicted to significantly decrease the power requirements of the BIT thruster line while drastically improving Isp due to its propellantless operation.  The proposed work will measure the quantum efficiency of specially-fabricated photocathodes before and after iodine exposure to evaluate their potential as an RF thruster neutralizer technology.","A void exists for miniature thruster systems capable of delivering km/s delta-V for MicroSats.

Acoustic emission (AE) signals and impact shock generated by MMOD impacts can be detected by an array of inexpensive, replaceable, wireless surface sensor units affixed to the external surfaces of the spacecraft or space structure. However, due to the complexity of interpreting the AE signals, the determination of impact location and severity of consequent damage is greatly complicated by variations is structure geometry, sensor location, and sensor state. We propose to develop advanced Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) classifiers using empirical and model-generated training data to detect the occurrence of MMOD impacts, determine the location of the impact site, and classify the severity of consequent damage. Through accurate estimation of the severity of the damage, appropriate maintenance actions can be performed. Phase I will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of the approach on simple metal structures designed to approximate Whipple shielding and low velocity impacts. Phase II will more fully develop the approach and extend it to more complex geometries, composite materials, and hypervelocity impacts.","For large space structures, such the International Space Station or the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway, long mission lifetimes mean significant accumulation of damage from hypervelocity MMOD impacts over time. Detection and localization of impacts and assessment of damage to these structures by DLNN algorithms based on acoustic emission and impact shock signals can improve system resiliency by providing astronaut crews with critical information to isolate damaged modules and implement repairs.","As AE sensors become more cost-affordable, they will be deployed more widely. There are significant opportunities for using adaptive dynamic DLNN-based algorithms to detect impact events and assess consequent damage that can work with a wide variety of different structures (e.g., COPVs). Rapid identification and assessment of impact damage will improve system reliability and increase mission lifetimes while decreasing maintenance costs."

As an example, the Orion TCS uses HFE-7200 liquid (-138°C pour point) in the radiators, and PGW in the manned cabin. These loops interface through a shared heat exchanger that is external to the manned vessel to ensure that the working fluid for the external loop cannot leak into the manned cabin.

This technology satisfies NASA’s needs as described in SBIR topic Z2.01; NASA is interested in advanced heat exchangers and coldplates that leverage novel manufacturing techniques to minimize structural mass and provide a good thermal performance, corrosion resistance, a reliable 3-year minimum life not contaminated by microbial growth, and whose coating does not impact the life support water recovery system. COSMIC is intended to replace the Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA) slurper and water separator ORU. Currently the ISS CCAA CHX, slurper, and water separator are intended to condense/remove excess moisture from cabin air. Issues arise because slurper behavior is dependent upon a liquid film wetting the CHX and slurper. This behavior requires a hydrophilic surface.

The proposed system consists of two pressurized vessels: a primary vessel charged with a consumable fluid in a saturation state (ammonia) and a secondary vessel filled with compressed gas. The main role of the compressed gas is to help ammonia vapor venting into a higher-pressure environment than the vapor pressure that corresponds to the cooled electronics temperature. Through venting a mixture of consumable vapor and compressed gas to the Venus ambient, a significant amount of evaporative cooling (primary) and Joule-Thompson cooling (secondary) can be achieved, which not only will keep the electronics temperature cool but also provide heat guarding by collecting and removing the incoming heat leaks from Venus environment.

The TCS in crewed vehicles must maintain a relatively constant environment temperature for a wide range of external thermal environments (low earth orbit, trans-planetary coast, and planetary surface operations). The sink temperature may vary from approximately 70 K to 230 K. Recent researches investigated and presented potential of heat rejection capability from the morphing composite / shape memory alloys (SMA) radiator. The SMA radiator employs such temperature dependent SMA materials to passively morph the radiator shape and thus adjust the rate of heat rejection to a wide range of vehicle requirements. Nonetheless, utilizing SMA materials faces many disadvantages, including low actuation frequency, sensitivity of material properties in fabrication, residual stress’s developed in thin films, and nonlinearity of actuation force. Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) proposes to develop a novel vapor-pressure-driven variable view factor radiator as a thermal control system component for spacecraft. Similar to SMA radiator mechanism, the radiator folds into a tear drop shape to minimize the view factor when cold, and opens up to maximize the view factor when heated. However, the proposed device instead utilizes vapor pressure inside a hollow curved panel to change the shape of the radiator.

The program will demonstrate the feasibility of modeling, designing, optimizing and manufacturing of such an adaptive radiator.","The variable view factor radiator developed by this program can be used for both military and commercial satellites that experience large variations in power or the heat sink.

The MMC fabric is able to be applied like traditional composite panels (i.e. multiple plies at different orientations) allowing for a tailorable reinforcement material that can be placed in the direction of the loading axes. By using a selective reinforcement additive manufacturing approach, the MMC fabric can be placed strategically within areas of high-stresses and only in these areas allowing for cost savings and weight reductions due to the need of less of the base material in these locations.

Some examples of these structures are launch vehicles (present and future), crew vehicles, surface habitats, robotic explorers, or cryogenic tank structures.","Non-NASA applications include aircraft, ground vehicles, and aluminum ship designs. Commercial aircraft will benefit by utilizing MMC Fabric selective reinforcement concepts to reduce weight. The automotive market will benefit from MMC fabric by utilizing it in components such as aluminum and magnesium castings or flywheels for hybrid vehicles. The commercial aerospace industry could also incorporate the MMC fabric by using the material in launch vehicles and satellite components."

In this program, ultrasonic thermometry methods will be adapted to enable real time, temperature measurements during a friction stir weld, FSW.  While FSW it has been successfully used at NASA-MSFC in the robust joining of thinner panels of aluminum alloys, the production of high quality welded joints in thicker panels or higher melting temperature materials remains challenging.  Knowing and controlling the temperature is essential to optimize the process to ensure the production of repeatable, robust components.  Using sensors attached to the stir weld tool, precise time-of-flight (ToF) measurements of ultrasound propagating through the weld zone will be used to estimate temperature.  This temperature measurement made in the weld zone is non-intrusive and does not influence the thermal transport.  Temperature data can be obtained at data rates as high as 1 kHz with the precision of a few degrees Centigrade.

Three complimentary key innovations will be realized in this project (two in Phase I and a third in Phase II) by combining and improving two current technologies.  The first is the integration of Fringe Pattern Projection Profilometry (FPPP) into the SLM process.  FPPP is the first profilometry technique that can capture high resolution dimensional measurements of the entire SLM build platform, in situ and nearly instantaneously.  This facilitates direct dimensional measurement and validation of every single layer, and post-process 3D models (built from the measurements) for the digital twin.  By capturing all dimensional information (including residual stress induced distortion) the FPPP sensor will provide a unique set of data for calibration of AM modelling software, which is the second key innovation. The FPPP data will identify defects in layer morphologies that can be used to train unique integrated computational adaptive additive manufacturing (iCAAM) feedforward modeling tools (distortion is predicted and compensated for with the build strategy before the build starts).  In most simulators, the layer thickness is assumed to be constant and perfect, but it is not. FPPP data will quantify the true variability present in layer thickness as the part is built.  Access to this information will allow more accurate calibration of the model so final part distortion can be virtually eliminated.  In Phase II the model will also be inverted and turned into a fast-feedback lookup table for further tuning the build process to compensate for suboptimal layer morphologies that may arise, which is the third key innovation.  The result will be a combination of hardware and software tools that eliminate distortion and capture critical information for the digital twin.","The technology is applicable to the Space Launch System (SLS), which is currently building components for the RS-25 rocket engine.  Feedforward control can also avoid waste of time and cost associated with failed builds for several other rocket nozzles currently built with NASA SLM systems. Other applications include CubeSats and small deep space engine components that need to be distortion free.",DoD need improved SLM for flight critical aerospace components.  The medical device industry needs better validation for SLM processes in order to pass FDA scrutiny before parts can be used commercially.  The feedforward technology could be readily implemented by any commercial SLM supplier that builds critical components which require validation.

The deliverable will be a practical surface finishing procedure that is amenable to commercial industrial scale-up.

Structural health monitoring (SHM) provides numerous benefits to future NASA missions, including increased reliability, reduced maintenance cost, and increased mission safety. Made In Space (MIS) has developed a suite of Structural-Health Aware Fault-Tolerant Engineered to Respond (SAFER) materials through an active Phase I STTR project to provide SHM capabilities. MIS has successfully demonstrated the SAFER materials through lab testing. The next step in the development of these materials is a demo in space, including exposure to the LEO environment as well as exposure to stimuli representing loading cases. MISSE-FF provides a platform for in-space characterization of the SAFER materials. MIS has developed an innovative Space Exposure for Structural-Health Aware Materials Experiment (SESAME) to expose the SAFER materials to the combined effects of the LEO environment and cyclic loading. SESAME is an active experiment intended to integrate with the sample deck of the standard MISSE Sample Carrier. SESAME is an innovative MISSE-FF payload for exposing and testing candidate materials for structural health monitoring on future space exploration missions. SESAME uses standard MISSE-FF power and data interfaces to simplify integration of the active experiment into existing ISS infrastructure. Space exposure is critical for further development of candidate structural health monitoring materials that will be used in future missions. The materials being proposed for SESAME testing have unique material properties that may be affected by space exposure. Fully characterizing the effect of space exposure will help manufacturers and designers better use these smart materials for greater impact on future space flight missions.","Active monitoring of spacecraft is beneficial to NASA for human flight missions. Launch incurs a large amount of stress on all parts constituting the spacecraft, and operations in orbit also result in loads on the spacecraft. Using the SAFER materials further developed by SESAME to monitor the spacecraft can identify where structures or parts of the spacecraft are weakened, allowing for repair or reinforcement. SESAME contributes to mission resilience and positively impacts future missions.","A similar application to NASA spacecraft are various aerospace vehicles used by the DOD. The USAF has many critical parts on aircraft and spacecraft could benefit from further development of SAFER materials by SESAME. The USN could benefit from applying SAFER materials to ships and submarines in various high pressure, high stress locations. The commercial sector could apply SAFER materials in the same manner as NASA and DOD by using the materials on vehicles and pressure vessels."

In addition, ceramic based Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) are being applied to rocket engine components such as combustion chambers, injector face plates, and nozzle extensions to allow higher temperature propellants to be used, which results in increased performance.  Similar TPS/TBC applications can be proposed for space habitat structures, CubeSats, and satellites for thermal management against solar radiation heating. All of these systems reply on the low thermal conductivity and emissive properties of the ceramic topcoat to minimize heat transfer. However because of the thermal expansion mismatch between the ceramic topcoat and underlying metallic structure, special care must be taken during joining.  Geo-Plasma has developed innovative Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques that allow the gradual transition from a metallic substrate to the low thermal conductivity ceramic topcoat.  This graded composition allows the joining of materials with large thermal expansion mismatch by eliminating the concentration of thermal induced stresses at a planar bond joint.  To optimize the use of these materials for spacecrafts such as the Orion crew capsule, Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), space habitats, satellites, and CubeSats for extended duration missions, the effect of the space environment on these advanced coating systems must be determined.  Therefore, Geo-Plasma proposes to develop advanced thermal protection coatings using these advanced AM methods, and then use the MISSE-FF to test the coatings in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).","Potential NASA applications for this technology developed through Phase II include protection of humans and electronics in aerospace transportation vehicles, space transportation vehicles, large space structures, such as space stations, orbiters, landing vehicles, rovers, habitats, and nuclear propulsion.","Potential non-NASA customers include SpaceX, Boeing, Orbital-ATK, Lockheed, Bigelow Aerospace and other aerospace companies.

By using form factors compatible with existing launch architectures and available autonomous assembly technology, the Apeiron Space Integration System enables a wide variety of platform configurations to be cost-effectively and rapidly deployed by a variety of existing launch vehicles. For example, Apeiron can create a LEO Small Payload Station from the excess capacity on a single EELV flight. Flights carrying ESPA rings launch on average every two months. The Apeiron system is capable of seeding Small Payload Stations in every orbit these flights reach.

This work will require the development of analytical models for different rover configurations and different terrains. These models will give insight into the RNM capabilities of current NASA rover configurations, design considerations for future NASA rover configurations, and requirements for controllable RNM actions. Useful RNM actions will also be explored by considering the impact on NASA missions as well as their feasibility on current NASA rovers. Control strategies will then stem from analytical model research and RNM action definitions. Locomotion controls verification and validation will be done in simulation and on real NASA rovers in the field. Phase I will involve the research and development of the analytical models that inform RNM actions, control architecture conceptualization, and the implementation of a set of RNM actions both in simulation and on at least one NASA rover. Meeting these objectives will form deliverables that directly benefit NASA as well as mark significant progress in the overall project objective of enabling RNM actions for improved mobility, better scientific investigations, and new rover functions.","The proposed robotic innovations will aid NASA will enable new concepts for missions to the Moon and Mars.

More than just remote sensors, they will be expected to manipulate their environment in a complex and useful way - carrying objects, using tools, and assisting the crew with various physical activities.  NASA has been developing world-class dexterous end effectors for years. Unfortunately, developing software to fully utilize such hands is very challenging.  Grasping strategies tend to be highly dependent on object models and localization, or reliant on a good connection to an operator.  As any of these deteriorate, even simple grasping of known objects becomes unreliable.  The environment or the object's intended use can influence how to grasp it.  The best way to pick up a tool will depend on whether it is to be transported to another location, handed to a crew member, or used as a tool. Previously with NASA, TRACLabs developed robot control software called CRAFTSMAN that includes trajectory generation, simple action-sequencing capabilities, and a method for parameterizing, encoding, and visualizing task descriptions.  CRAFTSMAN supports robot-independent task descriptions, but grasp strategies are still robot-specific open-loop waypoint sequences, subject to the problems listed above.  In this work, we propose to extend CRAFTSMAN to handle grasping as a task-informed behavior, using sensor data and object models when possible to identify grasp sites.  This new system, called ADAMANT (ADAptive MANipulation for Tasks), will help an operator to determine the best option for acquiring an object.  The result will be a robot grasping interface that is more intuitive to use than current technology and will produce more robust robot behavior.  This will reduce the cognitive load on remote robot operators by eliminating the need for run-time manual adjustments.  By removing the details of grasp strategy from high-level planning, the design of action sequences will also become easier.","This work is immediately applicable to NASA robots such as Valkyrie, SPDM, and Resource Prospector. Future NASA robots will perform autonomous repair tasks on satellites or the Deep Space Gateway, and caretaker robots will maintain dormant facilities. Robots will also assist humans with tasks such as habitat construction or geological exploration. The proposed system will greatly improve the capabilities of these robots and the interfaces that support them.","TRACLabs has an existing R\&D partnership with major automotive suppliers to integrate CRAFTSMAN into their plants. The first installation went live in September 2017 and operates continuously. The proposed research will be immediately applicable to their stated goals of deploying flexible workcells world-wide.

Busek’s BET-300-P thruster is under active development as a precision reaction control system (RCS) which will provide orders of magnitude improvements over state-of-the-art alternative attitude control systems (ACS) for CubeSats and small spacecraft. The low inertia of CubeSats combined with vibrational disturbances and resolution limitations of state-of-the-art ACS presently limit precision body-pointing and position control. Busek’s electrospray thrusters aboard the ESA LISA Pathfinder (NASA ST-7) spacecraft, recently demonstrated control of a proof mass location to within ~2nm per root Hz over a wide band. The BET-300-P, enhanced by exploitation of its high-speed dynamic response in this program, seeks to extend that success to small spacecraft platforms. Passively fed electrospray thrusters are highly compact, including fully integrated propellant supplies, and are capable of ~100nN thrust precision with 10’s of nN noise. Thrust can be accurately throttled over >30x, up to a scalable maximum of 10’s to 100’s of uN.  While typically operated in largely continuous states they are unique in that emission can be electrically stopped/started at ms time scales. Thus, extremely low impulse bits may be achieved over very short durations, permitting throttling from <0.1uNs up to 100’s of uNs. Realization of this fundamental capability of the technology is presently limited by control circuitry. The proposed work seeks to study and overcome these limitations with a new control methodology. These traits, combined with >800s specific impulse, and thereby low propellant mass could enable these systems to replace traditional reaction wheel ACS and high-propellant mass cold gas systems; enabling milliarcsec control authority for CubeSats versus the present arcsec level SOA.","Ongoing NASA mission studies include the BET-300-P for attitude control, formation flight and positioning of small spacecraft.

CHPPS is designed for high-value science missions which require high specific impulse, high reliability, and radiation tolerance.  CHPPPS includes a low power Hall Effect Thruster (HET), a hollow cathode for neutralizing the ion beam, a propellant management system, and a power processing unit (PPU).  The system is highly modular and appropriate for 12U – 27 U CubeSats in terms of size, mass, and power.  CHPPPS may be as small as 4U, depending upon the fuel load and specific component selection.  Thrust will be 3-8 mN, depending on the power supplied (60 – 135 W) and peak specific impulse will be >1100 s.  The thruster will be fueled with xenon or with game-changing iodine, which stores as a solid at very low pressure and much higher density than xenon.  The use of iodine significantly decreases spacecraft dry mass, and dramatically decreases propellant volume.  The impact of switching from xenon to iodine is most significant for volume limited spacecraft like CubeSats.  Whether the thruster is fueled by xenon or by iodine, the ion beam will be neutralized by a hollow cathode flowing noble gas.  The thruster will be powered by a compact, radiation tolerant power processing unit (PPU) previously developed for NASA and Air Force applications.  ACS may be provided by cold gas thrusters fed from the noble gas storage system.  In Phase I, the system design will be detailed and studied.  Work will include a proof of concept hardware demonstration at relevant power levels.","The proposed system would propel a small earth orbiting or interplanetary spacecraft, targeting 12U and 27U CubeSats and small satellites.  Applications include orbit raising and lowering, compensating for drag at low altitude, de-orbiting a spacecraft at EOL, changing orbit inclination and phase, NS and EW station-keeping in GEO, and constellation deployment and maintenance.  The system also enables a low cost demonstration of HET magnetic shielding with iodine propellant.","The integrated system will be actively marketed spacecraft platform providers, targeting CubeSats and small commercial buses.

This can lower trip times to any location in deep space with trips to 100 AU taking less than 10 years. This is less than half the time any current chemical, electric, or solar sail propulsion can do. The propulsion system can be scaled from CubeSats to full size exploration (Discovery Class) mission spacecraft.   E-Sail propulsion repel the protons from the solar winds to push the vehicle.  Much of the E-Sail technologies have been matured from recent NASA funded tests and studies.  Parallel efforts in Europe are also maturing the concept.  The highest risk element of the E-Sail are the tethers used to create the electrostatic field that repels the protons that propel the spacecraft.  Deployment and control of these tethers presents a serious challenge. This effort will develop high fidelity simulations and demonstrate deployment of up to 16 km long tethers.  This risk reduction effort will allow a technology demonstration of the E-Sail in the 2021 time frame.  Technology demonstrations are required to move the propulsion system forward.  Ground based testing will reduce much of the risk of the remaining technologies but the tether deployments which have been a challenge require innovated testing approaches to reduce the risk and to develop techniques and control strategies to reduce the deployment risks",The E-Sail technology is scalable from small CubeSats to Discovery class missions allowing the exploration of our solar system by large numbers of CubeSats. The E-Sail with a network of tethers could provide mining missions to the asteroid belts.  Since the propulsion system is propellant-less the spacecraft can be re-directed at any time. Missions to one of Saturn moons could be redirected to another moon once the initial mission was complete.,The resulting tether deployment system enables E-sail propelled systems to explore the asteroid belts in much shorter time frames than any other technology.  The ability to survey and return to a particular asteroid allows commercial miners to narrow the potential targets for mining.  The ability to redirect the spacecraft allows surveys to new potential mining sites on other asteroids.  Development of higher fidelity tether models and knowledge will also benefit other low earth tether missions.

It is composed of two major components. The first being a booster structure and the second being a liquid rocket engine that uses a thermodynamic cycle that is a combination of two common cycles. Furthermore, the engine is actually fairly simple when compared to modern liquid rocket engines, thereby making it less expensive and having more inherently reliably. The booster uses hydrogen peroxide and kerosene. This is a dense propellant combination that allows the booster to be made out of relatively inexpensive materials yet still have a high propellant mass fraction. This reduces cost. The booster will use four fixed rocket engines (non-gimballing) that are angled slightly so that pitch, yaw and roll control can be achieved simply by throttling the engines differently. This eliminates the need for a gimbal mount, hydraulic actuators and related componets, flexible propellant feed lines and separate pressure tanks. Furthermore, with the use of dense, non-cryogenic, hypergolic propellants like hydrogen peroxide, all cryogenic compatible components (which are expensive), insulation and the entire ignition system may be eliminated. The engine combines a gas generator with an electric pump fed design. It switches from one cycle to the other at the optimum time of flight allowing better performance than an engine using only one of the cycles exclusively. It would use the gas generator mode for liftoff and early in the flight as it can provide high power output at the cost of less specific impulse efficiency. By switching to a closed electric cycle doing boost the engine can then provide higher specific impulse with less thrust, which is acceptable because the booster will have consumed much of its propellant and is lighter. The combination of this booster and engine allows for a much simpler and reliable launch vehicle.","NASA could use this vehicle for rapid replenishment of failed satellites. Due to its use of non-toxic, non-cryogenic propellants it can stand by and be available to launch quickly. Since the system would be cheaper to operate many missions that currently cannot be justified could be possible. For example, sending inspector spacecraft to look at damaged operating satellites is currently not justifiable since building an entirely new spacecraft is more cost effective.","For commercial operators it would both reduce cost and increase reliability. Due to its simplicity it could reduce wait times. This means that many commercial endeavors, like nano-sats and constellation maintenance, would become potentially profitable. Current launch systems are just too expensive to make these business models work. It also opens up the possibility of launching new spacecraft to inspect and/or remove dead spacecraft from orbit as an economically viable business model."

The system provides autonomous guidance and control and stage/deployment sequencing. It also uses customizable subsystem packages to enable carrier vehicles to provide services currently unavailable to small satellites, such as delivery of multiple satellites to multiple orbital planes, long-duration carrier vehicle operations, delayed deployment of spare satellites until they are needed to replenish a constellation, hub-and-spoke rendezvous and proximity, and communication relay. Consolidating these capabilities into the carrier vehicle allows for simpler satellite designs with more of the size, weight, and power devoted to the payload. For launch vehicles requiring an autonomous flight safety system, Tyvak will assess simultaneous processing of safety-critical and non-safety critical algorithms using a real-time operating system running on a single dual-core or multi-chip processor. This could reduce size and weight, or increase redundancy without weight penalty. Tyvak will also evaluate a flexible modular design configurable for single-string or redundant architectures. Compared with existing launch and carrier vehicle avionics, TEMPO drastically reduces cost, size, weight, and power by leveraging Tyvak’s small satellite and launch vehicle avionics technologies, such as the advanced lightweight GPS metric tracking unit Tyvak is developing under a NASA Tipping Point contract. This technology is scheduled to undergo three sounding rocket certification flights within the year. TEMPO effort will culminate in a system-level PDR that will define the system architecture. Successful completion of the PDR will pave the way for a follow-on effort to take the system to TRL 5-6, and eventual flight demonstration.","TEMPO is an excellent fit for developers striving to both expand the small launch vehicle market and develop a small, maneuverable upper stage capable of long duration and multi-satellite delivery missions.  The NASA TROPICS program is a potential benefactor of such an upper stage – reducing the number of launches and time it takes to populate the required constellation. TEMPO’s proximity operations capability will enable missions such as satellite maintenance, refueling, and ISS inspection.","TEMPO has extensive government and commercial utility. Many planned DoD and commercial projects using small satellites require a large number delivered to orbit to form the constellations necessary to complete their mission or close their business case. Companies such as HawkEye 360, Black Sky, PlanetiQ, Planet, and others can benefit from a launch platform that can deliver satellites totaling over 500kg to specified multiple orbits or spaced out in the same/similar orbit on a single launch."

HyperSciences uses our proven, existing and patented Ram accelerator-based launch architecture and in-ground launch site based at Spaceport America to launch payloads at greater than Mach 5. This cost-effective launch vehicle enables cheap access to high altitude and space, providing on-demand launches. One novel feature of the Ram accelerator is a fully tailorable G-load profile with length and simple gas propellant selection. Because of the loads experienced during launch minor G-load toughening of existing payloads are only required, as a result a new class of tough, low-cost payloads will emerge to be able to be flown on this system. The reduction of cost and the ability to have on demand launch services will further strengthen and accelerate the developing small satellite and hypersonic test vehicle market. Some of the key innovations in this technology which allow the impulsive launch are:",Payloads could be flight tested on board the launch vehicle prior to being integrated into larger launch system. Exposure of the payload to the moderate g-loads of the impulsive launch would provide for an effective test of payload robustness. The  mass driver can be readied for launch in a matter of minutes which would provide game- changing responsiveness in satellite launch. The lifetime of satellites could be reduced because the cost & time to launch a replacement satellite would be very low,"By reducing the cost of building and launching satellites, satellite-based internet and communication everywhere on the planet would become more feasible. Many Nano or Micro satellites in orbit would also have many benefits in the arena of video monitoring, defense, agriculture, etc. The barrier to space access will be lowered both from an economic and a technological standpoint."

Part of the work performed in this SBIR will help in determine the potential savings for future engine development programs, currently projected at 10x for injector build cost savings which require face cooling. PermiAM will enable increased design simplicity for AM injectors and reduced development costs through improved face cooling and improved combustion stability. A full scale proof of concept ground test will be demonstrated by the end of Phase II, with the subscale demonstration during Phase I to meet the subtopic requirements.","PermiAM material is aligned with NASA Technology Roadmap needs TA1.2, TA2.1, and TA12. Masten is currently focusing on the propulsion elements of PermiAM with direct applicability to small satellite launch vehicles, upper stage engines, and planetary landers.  For SLS, the RS-25 and RL10 use a coaxial injector with Rigimesh face. As AM build volumes increase it will be possible to replace the expensive and complex rigimesh injector with an AM version to lower the cost of heavy lift space access.","For aviation it may be used to improve the performance and reliability of commercial jet engines. Current jet engine combustion chamber designs use bypass air and baffles to keep instabilities under control and prevent the walls from overheating.  PermiAM would allow the more even application of cooling air, better boundary layer performance, and reduce instabilities. Masten would also explore markets in rocketry and is open to license PermiAM to other rocket engine manufacturers."

The modular engine will use an array of digitally controlled electric pump fed thruster modules which produce about 2,400 lbf-thrust each.  Power to the modules will come from a centrally located gas-generator powered turbogenerator or a high performance battery pack. The variable speed motors used to drive the pumps could allow for elimination of propellant mixture ratio control valves, gimbals, and bellows.  The 2,400 lbf-thrust modules can be configured to deliver almost any thrust combination desired by the propulsion stage prime, foregoing the need to design and develop an expensive purpose built engine. FTT’s primary goal will be to substantially reduce the cost of the pump which has a direct linkage to the overall propulsion system cost.","NASA Applications for the technology include low cost, cryogenic electric pump fed maneuvering thrusters, in addition to low cost booster and upperstage engines as well as Space tug applications where the reusability and safety offered by an electric pump fed engine can be applied.  Other applications include pumps for cryogenic thermal management systems to be used in future hybrid electric aircraft.","Commercial Applications for the technology include low cost Nano/Micro launch vehicle propulsion systems requiring pump fed rocket engines in the 2,400 lbf thrust class and above based on customer needs.  Spin-off technologies from the high power density cryogenic electric motor development is planned for insertion into FTT’s hybrid propulsion and compact high power density power generation for both military and commercial aerospace applications."

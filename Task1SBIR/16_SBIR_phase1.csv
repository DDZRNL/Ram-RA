16-1 A1.01-7107,,Structural Efficiency - Aeroelasticity and Aeroservoelastic Control,"Distributed Sensing, Computing, and Actuation Architecture for Aeroservoelastic Control","Prioria Robotics, Inc.","606 Southeast Depot Avenue, Gainesville, FL 32601 - 5320",(352) 505-2188,Mujahid Abdulrahim Ph.D,mujahid.abdulrahim@prioria.com,"606 SE Depot Ave, Gainesville, FL 32601 - 5320",(352) 505-2188  Extension :116,Christopher Jacobs,christopher.jacobs@prioria.com,"606 Southeast Depot Ave, Gainesville, FL 32601 - 5320",(352) 505-2188,3,5,"This proposal introduces an approach to aeroservoelastic control that provides enhanced robustness to unmodeled dynamics.  The core of the approach is a processing element, designed by the embedded-systems expertise at Prioria Robotics, that provides measurement and signal processing and even control commands from localized stations throughout a structure.  An architecture is formulated that utilizes these distributed elements to provide information about the adverse aeroservoelastic effects, such as frequencies and damping and even mode shapes, to modify control commands and achieve desired performance characteristics.The research team has extensive expertise in the analysis, simulation, and flight testing of aircraft with novel configurations, including flexible wings, morphing aircraft, and reconfigurable designs.  The proposed innovation is applicable to a wide range of aerospace applications including stratospheric UAVs and manned transport-category aircraft.  The architecture enables closed-loop aeroservoelastic control or open-loop aeroelastic measurements and can be retrofit into an existing airframe and flight controller or integral to the design of a new aircraft.The Phase I objectives of the current proposal include the conceptual and initial design of a novel architecture for aeroelastic control.  Initial effort involves requirements generation for the scalable architecture and dynamic simulation of a representative UAV wing.  The architecture is implemented in hardware using modifications of existing electronic and airframe components.","A successful outcome of the proposed research would result in a modular hardware system that can be retrofit onto existing NASA manned and unmanned aircraft to provide open-loop structural mode sensing for experimental flight tests or operational flights.  The combination of the high-bandwidth distributed aeroservoelastic control elements with the computational capability of the central processor permit on-board modal estimation which could be telemetered to a ground control station to aid in decision-making during envelope expansion flights.  In such a use case, the ACEs would be used as sensing and processing elements without an actuator component.  Use of low-cost components in the design reduces overall system cost and allows the system to be used on non-recoverable aircraft.  In such cases, the onboard aeroservoelastic processing alleviates need for high-bandwidth telemetry or recovery of flight logs from terminated aircraft.  Instead, the system can telemeter low-bandwidth structural mode shape information in real-time to both improve situational awareness of the flight crew and for post-flight data analysis.NASA could integrate the distributed ASE control architecture into new aircraft as part of the primary flight control system.  Use of the distributed control effectors could leverage the significant control authority benefits without requiring engineers to re-solve the control allocation, sensing, structural mode analysis, and communication bandwidth problems.","The ASE control architecture can be licensed to aircraft manufacturers with prototype aircraft at any stage from conceptual design to final certification.  Open-loop measurements on early prototype aircraft can help guide decisions on required structural stiffness versus increasing weight and lost endurance.  Flight tests can yield improved data which helps prevent over-designing structures at the expense of performance.  These tests are facilitated with modular instrumentation and processing that minimizes the burden of mechanical and software integration.Flight tests of unique aircraft configurations such as the high-altitude, long-endurance Global Observer are usually hindered due to structural response uncertainty.  That program required extensive instrumentation in the form of individual strain gauges and accelerometers distributed throughout the wing and airframe structure.  Wiring for these raw sensor measurements were routed through the wing and resulted in a substantial cable bundle and routing complexity in the conduits near the wing root.  Additionally, the number of available sensors was limited by the interface capability and speed of the data acquisition system.  A large array of sensors sampled on a single device result in temporal errors due to simultaneous sampling limitations.  Large aircraft with numerous sensors may find difficulty identifying structural modes accurately due to the phase misalignment of sensors.",Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Command & Control; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Man-Machine Interaction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling

The traditional approach has been to build stiff structures for suppressing aeroelastic effects. However, the increase in computational technology has enabled a careful analysis of aeroelastic effects, and design of lightweight structures. However, a direct CFD-CSD coupling is still too expensive to be used for control simulations and design. To address this critical need, IAI is developing reduced order models to capture the necessary physics, while enabling much more efficient computation. Our RACA approach will systematically study ROM technology and develop the appropriate methods for our particular application of interest � supersonic low-boom aircraft. We will develop a full-fledged aeroelastic analysis framework as well, to provide simulation-based verification results. The ROMs developed will then be used for control system design and demonstration of adaptive control technologies for advanced flexible aircraft.","The proposed body of work addresses a critical need in NASA�s repository of tools and techniques to develop high performance and supersonic civilian aircraft: a reliable physics-based simulation testbed to test different unconventional and advanced aircraft designs. NASA has been extensively investing in aeroelastic research, through programs such as Active Aeroelastic Wing (AAW), X-56A Multi-Utility Technology Testbed (MUTT), and Aeroservoelasticity (ASE) project in the High Speed Program. The ASE project in particular, has been focusing on development of aeroelastic modules for supersonic aircraft, and will directly benefit from this research. X-56A has also been looking to augment its controllers to incorporate aeroelastic effects, and will be interested in RACA. Moreover, other programs at NASA that are looking at lightweight aircraft configurations will also be able to use RACA in their design and control simulation efforts.","Other government agencies, such as Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) have also been investigating aeroelastic concepts in collaboration with NASA and industry. The AAW and MUTT programs are specific examples of the above. Moreover, aircraft manufacturers interested in advanced aircraft development are increasingly facing the challenges of high aspect ratio, flexible wing aircraft. To design and reliably develop associated controllers for such aircraft, they need tools to allow rapid analysis of concepts across the entire flight envelope. RACA will provide the industry with such a capability. Moreover, the aeroelastic analysis capability could also be integrated in design frameworks for flexible aircraft design. Lockheed Martin has also been investigating the low-boom supersonic demonstrator, and its aeroelastic properties are yet to be understood. RACA is going to directly address this concern as well.","Aerodynamics; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Two types of aerodynamic reduced order models will be developed; the first is the Neural Network nonlinear ROM  that can provide the aerodynamic feedback forces due to structural deformation and the second is a nonlinear Volterra-kernels-based gust ROM that provides the aerodynamic forces due to gust excitation.  Once developed, this nonlinear aeroelastic solver will be integrated into the Nonlinear Dynamic Flight Simulation (NL-DFS) system in Phase II to perform flight dynamic simulation including nonlinear aeroelastic and nonlinear rigid body interaction effects, which can be used to predict the gust loads, ride quality, flight dynamic stability, and aero-structural control issues. In addition, the nonlinear aeroelastic solver developed can be a standalone code for rapid static/dynamic aeroelastic analysis.  With the utilization of the FUN3D generated nonlinear aerodynamic (ROM), this nonlinear aeroelastic solver will be computational efficient for accurate flutter analysis, gust loads analysis and limit cycle oscillation analysis.",A flight dynamics simulation capability with an added nonlinear aeroelastic solver is still unavailable. NASA has been working for many years towards achieving a software package that would accurately predict the interaction between flight dynamics considering airframe structural flexibility in closed-loop with flight control laws. The proposed NL-DFS is aimed at providing an expedient multidisciplinary nonlinear flight simulation tool to perform an efficient flaw debugging for advanced control laws as well as to promote a physical understanding of the in-flight observed dynamic behaviors due to evolutionary designs.

Physics-based, reduced-order models (ROMs) will be developed and demonstrated with data from CFD models of the X-56, an experimental aircraft that NASA and the U. S. Air Force are using to test systems for flutter suppression and gust-load alleviation.  Extended range and low fuel consumption through lightweight materials and large wing spans (high lift-to-drag ratios) are the drivers in next-generation aircraft like the X-56, but these attributes create challenges in maintaining flight safety, ride quality, and long-term structural durability.  The development of flight controllers that can actively manage aeroservoelastic effects (body-freedom flutter, control reversal, gust loading) without compromising safety and aerodynamic performance is a key objective of both the X-56 Program and the proposed project.  Through the proposed technology, nonlinear, aeroservoelastic ROMs can be coupled to other components of a flight simulator (six-degrees-of-freedom flight mechanics models and control software) to improve the fidelity of simulations that support controller design for a wide range of operating conditions.","The commercial product to be developed is an engineering tool for modeling aeroservoelastic dynamics in highly flexible air vehicles.  The software will use data generated by high-fidelity aeroelastic CFD models to construct computationally efficient ROMs for all phases of the development process from early concept trade studies to flight testing and aircraft certification.  Flexible, lightweight vehicles with high lift-to-drag ratios are an emerging market, promising reduced take-off weight, greater range, and lower fuel costs.  However, lightweight, flexible designs present safety challenges (flutter, divergence, control reversal, high gust loading, structural failure, fatigue), requiring innovative flight control systems to effectively manage aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instabilities.  The proposed technology will enable the design and testing of new controllers for highly flexible aircraft through accurate, low-dimensional aeroservoelastic models capable of real-time predictions.  The project is directly applicable to NASA's X-56 program and to related, follow-on programs initiated by the agency.","The proposed project will focus on the experimental X-56 program with much broader potential applications relating to flutter prediction and suppression, gust load prediction and alleviation, and active/adaptive aero-structural control.  The modeling technology will enable advanced flight control required in highly flexible, lightweight aircraft.  These new types of extended-range air vehicles have numerous civilian and military applications including drones for reconnaissance and law enforcement. NASA's Advanced Air Transport Technologies (AATT) Project explores and develops technologies and concepts for improved energy efficiency and environmental compatibility of fixed wing, subsonic transports, applicable to a host of future, commercial aircraft operating in the Next Gen airspace.

Typical engine nacelle installation clearances, however, limit liner depth and prevent further improvements in low frequency noise reduction using these conventional approaches.The proposed innovation addresses these limitations via a low-profile, tunable acoustic liner for modern aircraft engines capable of significant noise attenuation at lower frequencies than currently achievable.  The innovative approach lowers the resonant frequency and enables significant reductions in cavity size and volume.  Significant net weight savings is achieved due to the large reductions in cavity volume (via corresponding decreases in cavity wall surface area).  The end result is lower frequency noise attenuation with simultaneous reductions in liner depth and weight.The proposed innovations provide the following benefits for acoustic noise reduction:?  Optimum absorption of sound at frequencies half of those achievable with  currently available technologies ?  Decreased liner depth?  Decreased liner weight?  In-situ, automatic tunability for optimum absorption under different engines and engine conditions.?  Broadband operation through MDOF performance and individual impedance tuning","In February of 2010, the Aeronautics Science and Technology Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) released their biennial update on the National Aeronautics Research and Development Plan.  In this report, the Energy and Environment R&D Goal #3 was stated to ""Advance development of technologies and operational procedures to decrease the significant environmental impacts of the aviation system"".  A key element of reaching this goal was identified as the reduction of aircraft noise. Specifically, the report identifies a 32 dB target cumulative reduction in aircraft noise for the next generation aircraft (N+1), a 43 dB reduction for N+2 aircraft and a 25 year goal of 62 dB cumulative reduction for N+3 aircraft.

A comprehensive approach to reducing noise from any flow is predicated on a clear understanding of noise sources, i.e., the turbulent flow itself.  Although much has been discovered in the last several decades about the connection between turbulence and noise, the heuristic element of the analysis has prevented the development of breakthrough noise mitigation technologies. For example, it is known that larger structures are responsible for shallow-angle noise, and the formation of shocks at supersonic speeds results in a new mechanism of noise production due to the passage of turbulent structures, However, the precise mechanism by which this transformation occurs is not known.  High-fidelity datasets that capture the above phenomena whether from simulation or experiment are increasingly accessible, and need to be harnessed in better ways.  With this in mind, analytical tools must be used and developed to extract the most useful information from the data.  Tool such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, Stochastic estimation, Wavelet decomposition, Empirical Mode Decomposition, Dynamical Mode Decomposition and Doak?s decomposition have been shown to be useful for extracting such information.  At present however, different practitioners use these tools differently, which makes the task of assimilating the data very difficult.  The goal of the present effort is to develop a user-friendly software suite that unifies these advanced techniques to provide a standard approach.  The development will be integrated with testing by exploring noise sources in ongoing experimental and computational rectangular and an axisymmetric multi-stream jet campaigns.","The Technical Objectives presented in this proposal are directly addressing the A1.02 Quiet Performance subtopic description by characterizing fundamental noise sources for subsonic and supersonic three-stream engine nozzle. The understanding of these fundamental source can then be exploited to help designers develop quieter propulsion systems.

The proposed project aims to develop two novel modules to the existing suite of tools for CS acoustic measurements:   (1) A continuous-scan beamforming (CSBF) tool for arrays located in the mid to far field to perform source diagnostics in low-SNR wind tunnel environments., and (2) An azimuthal modal decomposition tool for near-field arrays having partial azimuthal coverage, enabling acoustical holography without full source enclosure.  The first module will enable small-aperture beamforming (BF) arrays to adopt the CS method, resulting in reduced maximum sidelobe levels and higher-quality BF images that approach the theoretical limits associated with the theory. The second module will enable CS near-field arrays that avoid the requirement for full coverage, greatly simplifying the array coverage requirements and making acoustical holography systems more practical in testing facilities. In Phase I, ATA will demonstrate feasibility of the methods through application to existing acoustic measurement data sets. In Phase II, the methods will be optimized and rigorously validated through experiments using small-scale turbofan engine models. Ultimately, we will transition these methods to NASA and industry stakeholders for adoption in relevant facilities.","As part of Strategic Thrust 3: Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles, in the Strategic Implementation Plan issued by the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), NASA establishes noise improvement margins (relative to the FAA Stage 4 noise limit) of −32 dB, −42 dB, and −52 dB, for N+1, N+2, and N+3 future aircraft technology generations, respectively.

Multiple NASA research centers operate wind tunnels that support aeronautical acoustics research, including the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnels at NASA Ames, the 14' x 22' subsonic tunnel at NASA LaRC, and the 9' x 15' LSWT and five others at NASA GRC.","Community noise exposure continues to be a significant issue near airports, confining growth and impacting quality of life and health of those affected. To counteract growing exposure, ever more stringent noise standards are expected to be implemented by regulatory agencies in the certification of aircraft. These standards are predicated on the discovery of new technologies aimed at reducing aircraft and engine noise. Further noise performance improvements will likely be asymptotic, with incremental improvements resulting in only modest noise reduction. Thus, innovative measurement technologies to better identify and diagnose noise sources within the aircraft and engine are necessary, particularly for the subscale-size test articles and low-SNR environments of wind tunnel testing.

In Phase I, we propose design, fabrication and testing of two fluidic methods of pulsing the fuel � one method is driven by a fluidic oscillator and a second method by a vortex diode using an externally triggered pulse for phase controlled pulsations. In Phase II, based on the obtained performance characteristics and the customer needs, we will down-select the best of the options for further development.",The fluidic fuel flow modulator developed in this project will enable NASA GRC to evaluate the device in its specially designed characterization test rig for suitability in using it for active combustion instability control. The device will also help in the development of suitable control algorithms by NASA for implementation in actual jet engines. The fuel flow modulator can also be used to mitigate combustion instabilities in liquid fuel rockets as well - thus making the technology available for space launch vehicle design.,"The market need for fuel modulators for active control of combustion instability in lean-burn combustors runs in millions both for aircraft engines as well as land-based gas turbines for power generation. In addition, there is a demand for such modulators for active control of reheat buzz in the military airplanes with afterburners.

Most imaging methods fail to provide this capability because noise from multiple scattering buries the signal needed to acquire a useful image. Solutions to this problem are expensive, difficult to implement, and not ideal candidates for field experiments. The proposed innovation combines digital holography and picosecond, optical gating to limit the amount of optical noise sufficiently to enable high resolution, 3D imaging, effectively generalizing existing pseudo-ballistic imaging systems that have been used for imaging through dense particle fields. Storing the complete wavefront in a hologram enables use of a wide range of optical diagnostics methods including image processing and interferometry to improve image and information quality. The result is a new sensor concept that will be extremely useful in the experimental study of dense sprays and other particles fields, providing a detailed, instantaneous look at the structure and position of all of the particles as well as density field information in a large three dimensional sample volume. Moreover, the system can record dynamic information at high frequency.","The tool developed in this research can provide data in combustion research that is not currently attainable with other methods and therefore can have an impact on future aircraft engine combustor designs. The system is applicable in studies requiring fuel air ratios, particle size and number density and refractive index gradients in the gases surrounding the particles.","The resulting tool can enhance combustion research in commercial engine development leading to lower emission, control instabilities and may have commercial applications in other gas-turbine based industries (such as power generation and industrial burners).  The modeling and results can be and will be employed in current and future hydrocarbon rocket engine designs (improving combustion efficiency, ignition, stability, etc.).",3D Imaging; Image Analysis; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Image Processing; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics)

The proposed method is based on sensitive electric charge measurement on soot particles of specific mass, which was selected via Lorentz force. Through extensive investigation on soot emission from internal combustion engines over the past four decades, it has been well known that engine soot particles are usually charged. Counting particle charge at specific mass could lead to the determination of both total particle count and mass. Currently commercially available electrometric measurements on charged particles suffer from rapid signal drift, which limits its applications on soot emission measurements. In our proposed design, an amplitude modulation scheme is included to eliminate the influence from signal drift and also improve detection sensitivity. The proposed soot mass distribution monitor will be less than 50 pounds in weight and consume approximately 300W electrical power. It will also be capable of being remotely controlled and operating under vacuum condition. Since most of the components are commercially available, total cost of the proposed device could be less than $30,000.","The primary NASA need for this technology is to measure soot particle mass distribution from aircraft engine exhaust. At present, particle mass distribution is calculated from particle size distribution, which is measured by the Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS) and Scanning Mobility particle Sizer (SMPS) techniques. Both techniques provide information on particle count at each electrical mobility diameter. To calculate particle mass distribution, an assumption of particle density becomes necessary. Since engine soot particles are intrinsically fractal aggregates, their densities are complex function of particle size and compositions. Obtaining the particle density information requires sophisticated measurement instrumentation. The proposed soot mass distribution monitor will directly measure particle mass distribution, from which total particle count and mass could be determined. In the past, NASA has funded a number of field measurement programs such as EXCAVATE, APEX, UNA-UNA, and AAFEX that focus on the measurement of black carbon emissions from civilian aircraft engines.","We expect that the soot particle mass monitor developed under this program will significantly benefit the scientific community interested in characterizing soot particle mass from a variety of internal combustion engines.  The ability of one instrument to measure particle charge at specific mass will enable continuous measurements of particle mass distribution that can be directly used to determine total particle count and mass.  In combination with an electrical aerosol charger, either with a radioactive source like 85Kr or non-radioactive source like corona discharge, this instrument will provide a direct measurement on particle count and mass simultaneously for any particles or aerosols. This measurement technique could be applied to ambient aerosol monitoring, PM emission detection, and particle manufacture process.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Manufacturing Methods; Pressure & Vacuum Systems"

These airfoils enhance the lift characteristics at subsonic speeds but suffer due to flow separation over the deflected flap surface. During cruise at transonic speeds, the shock induced separation results in drag penalty and structural fatigue. Traditionally, high-lift airfoils employ multi-element flaps to eliminate flow separation during takeoff and landing but at the cost of increased mechanical complexity and aircraft weight. Active flow control (AFC) has the potential to mitigate flow separation and enhance performance. The objective of proposed study is to design, develop, validate and implement a closed-loop, high-bandwidth active flow control technique. The technique will be based on high-momentum, resonance-enhanced unsteady microjet actuators and implemented on an NASA-EET high-lift airfoil configuration. Under the proposed program we bring a team of experts with the requisite knowledge and tools needed for successful development and implementation. We will deign and build a high-lift airfoil to suit the FSU polysonic wind tunnel for testing at high subsonic and transonic speeds (Mach 0.3 - 0.9). We will implement and demonstrate the applicability of Adaptive Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control (SBMPC) to control flow separation.","The proposed development of a closed-loop, high-bandwidth active flow control technique using high-momentum, resonance-enhanced unsteady microactuators will help achieve NASA?s objective to build an energy efficient and environment-friendly fixed-wing transport aircraft. The proposed AFC method is an on-demand, and closed-loop technique is capable of improving vehicle performance and adaptive to the flight changes. The actuators proposed are simple, energy-efficient, high-bandwidth, reliable and robust.

In Phase I, we propose to optimize the geometry for stable operation with high momentum output, and minimum streamwise length. Scaling studies will be conducted for the best design to obtain scaling laws for scale-up to full-scale. We will also develop concepts of actuator arrays with integrated plenum chamber.

The result is that an arc plasma can be produced, with a Lorentz force that creates a plasma disc (similar concept to a cyclotron). The thought behind this concept is that the thermal actuator authority provided by the plasma arc is coupled with an induced swirl component into a boundary-layer flow, which will enhance mixing and allow flows to remain attached in high adverse pressure gradients. Effectively, the proposed actuator would function like vortex generators that one could enable or disable on command.  This subsystem demonstration will pioneer a family of devices to address a notoriously difficult problem in active flow control.","The anticipated benefits of the proposed cyclotronic plasma actuator are improved actuator authority and improved effectiveness for low-speed and high-speed flows, when compared to traditional dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators.  Additional benefits are anticipated for alleviation of turbulent separation through 3D mixing mechanisms, similar to passive vortex generators.  It is anticipated that this mixing mechanism will also provide an improvement in operational efficiency, or reduced power requirements, for the proposed actuator, as compared to existing technologies.  The proposed innovation also has the benefit over passive devices, as control authority can be provided on-demand and it does not produce undesirable parasite drag during high-speed cruise.  Additionally, the actuator has no moving parts and does not require the heavy infrastructures and mechanical complexities associated with high-pressure air storage.","The use of the cyclotronic plasma actuator also has potential to lead to significant reductions in drag and fuel burn for commercial aircraft through improved control surface effectiveness and high-lift performance, allowing the weight and size of aerodynamic surfaces to be reduced.

The proposed work will focus on low-speed canonical flows that introduce challenging physics, e.g., separation, transition and turbulence onset/progression, vortex/viscous interactions, merging shear layers with strong curvature, juncture flows, etc.. The extension of our proposed methodology to compressible flows has already begun and will be pursued in Phase II and beyond. The VorCat implementation of the gridfree vortex method is particularly attractive in this case since it efficiently represents near-wall vorticity producing motions while at the same time capturing the dynamics of the shed vorticity without numerical diffusion. An accurate and well resolved accounting of the boundary flow is crucial for controlling separation and other complex phenomena while unsteady free vortices are responsible for producing sound, downstream wing/vortex interactions and a range of other important phenomena. A number of previous published studies have established the unique benefits and accuracy of the VorCat vortex filament method. These include computations of ground vehicle flows, isotropic turbulence, shear layers, coflowing round jets, and boundary layers. Additional validation studies have been conducted in such applied settings as wind turbines, rotorcraft and particulate flows. Collectively, these results establish the effectiveness of the vortex filament scheme in capturing the flow structure and statistics for complex flow fields in a way that has not been duplicated by alternative grid-based methodologies. In the realm of vortex structure the VorCat approach has opened up a window into the dynamics of flow organization that is forcing a reassessment of some of the principal ideas concerning the physics of turbulent flow (J. Phys., 2011).","This project brings to NASA a means for circumventing the persistent limitations of traditional turbulence modeling and simulation techniques that have delayed or prevented progress across a spectrum of innovative flow technologies. In particular, unlike RANS modeling, VorCat requires no ad hoc model adjustments that must be fine tuned to the peculiarities of individual flows or extensive three-dimensional grid development that often requires a posteriori refinements to reduce numerical diffusion and/or capture missing details of detached vortices. Unlike grid-based schemes, VorCat readily accounts for natural transition to turbulence without the use of special forcings. With VorCat, the door is opened for NASA to more freely pursue design innovations without heavy reliance on corroborating physical tests. Some particular examples where VorCat can have high impact both for NASA and global aerospace industry include aerodynamic efficiency and drag reduction through innovative active flow control mechanisms, aeroacoustics and structural analysis that relies on accurate CFD input data, vehicle design optimization, safety studies, and flows containing complex physics, turbulent mixing and heat transfer. When the compressible Vorcat version is developed and validated, possibly with the addition of more physics, it will be applied to compressible flow problems such as found in transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flow regimes.","Vorcat, Inc. has been very active in the commercial, non-NASA markets both in the US and abroad. Vorcat's focus in the commercial markets has been on reen/renewable energy applications, such that include the simulation and assessment of innovative hydro- and wind turbine concepts, the design, analysis and optimal placement of wind turbines in a wind farm and aerocoustics analysis of wind farms; Applications in the automotive market include aerodynamics (and aeroacoustics) analysis and optimization of automotive shapes, simulations of automotive subsystems (HVAC, under carriage flows); Helicopter applications - both in the commercial world and DOD - include safety studies (landing on moving objects, hovering in the vicinity of obstacles, etc.), providing data to flight simulators for complex landing and hovering settings, etc. Pollution and chem/bio warfare scenarios which include turbulent mixing, particulate transport, collection of chemical agents by UAV, etc. There are numerous other commercial market niches where we can step in once this NASA project is completed.","Aerodynamics; Analytical Methods; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

A compelling capability to accurately calculate lift for high lift configurations such as the NASA EET geometry and the DLR-F11 geometry.  Generally, there is an upper limit on lifting surface incident angle past which potential flow solvers such as FlightStream can no longer accurately predict the lift due to flow separation.  Furthermore, FLightStream does not currently have the functionality to include features for delaying flow separation such as blown flaps.  The inclusion of a pressure difference rule has indicated great promise for using FlightStream ultimately to predict maximum lift coefficient given a reliable model for the separation.  This adaptation of FlightStream to ""CLmax"" calculations is not broadly applicable because of the required empiricism based on discrete pressure points on a wing for a limited number of configurations. For the proposed work, separation criteria will be developed based on a more fundamental physics based analysis driven by surface vorticity rather than limited correlations to surface pressure.  This approach will involve three phases of effort.  The first phase of the effort will involve simply predicting whether or not flow separation has occurred on the wing to a significant enough level to affect lift.  This will give rise to a simple ""CLmax"" calculation.  The second, more advanced phase will identify the flow separation line on the wing based on a maximum allowable vorticity value, and the third phase of the effort will include the release of vortex filaments along this line of separation, resulting in a highly advanced approach for high lift prediction.  This effort will be supplemented by blown flap functionality, robust weight estimates for the high lift system and a high lift system design optimization capability.","Research in Flight proposes to assist in dramatically improving the tool set available to the NASA aircraft design community by providing an expansion to the lower order, high fidelity tool set to enable the analysis of high lift configurations.  The primary NASA goal for transport aircraft, reducing fuel burn, leads to novel and interesting configurations, some of which do not fall within the conventional design space.  Some of these configurations are innovative with regard to fuel burn but must be evaluated for the limiting flight conditions such as a range of takeoff and landing scenarios.  For some of these high lift conditions, the flow is separated on at least a portion of the lifting surfaces.  For the attached flow conditions, some  preliminary design level tools are available for estimating lift for example but for the configurations which are separated, there are no good lower order options for reliably determining maximum lift.  The expansion of the high lift analysis capability already available with FlightStream will substantially improve the efficiency of the NASA transport design team and thus lead to the consideration of more novel concepts and ultimately better recommendations for aircraft design methodology.","Commercial airframers conduct extensive preliminary design level studies using lower order tools.  The more reliable and diverse these capabilities become, the more efficient the design process becomes.  The commercial manufacturers also are required to consider hundreds of flight conditions for certification purposes.  Often these flight conditions can only be evaluated with even rudimentary levels of accuracy using very advanced and computationally expensive CFD methods, wind tunnel tests or even flight tests.  This pushes the discovery of potential problems into the detailed design or even testing phase, at potentially great expense.  The earlier in the process that the high risk flight conditions can be accurately analyzed, the more efficient and less expensive the design process becomes.  Boeing spent a reported 8 billion dollars on the certification of the 787 transport aircraft.  Reducing this cost is absolutely critical to the future of US leadership in commercial aviation.  The proposed improvement to FlightStream will offer the commercial users the opportunity to much more reliably predict high lift flight conditions at the preliminary design level using a lower order but ever higher fidelity tool and thereby saving substantial time and resources.  Research in Flight has sold copies of FlightStream in the commercial transport market and in the UAV market.  This success is expected to accelerate with added capability for this low order, high fidelity tool.","Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Support"

The current 3.5.1 release currently contains significant gaps when assessing handling qualities for a particular configuration forcing the engineer to rely on historical methods with limited applicability to advanced technology design concepts with unconventional configurations.  In the proposed effort, ESAero will develop an integrated workflow within the OpenVSP suite for quantitative assessment of handling qualities enabling the engineer to explore new design spaces with unconventional configurations.  Along with this workflow a set of pre-requisite tasks to improve the system modeling capabilities will be completed as well.  These efforts include: improving flight control surface modeling, improved mass properties representation for generic components, a new aerodynamic trim solver, a new vehicle dynamics model calculation, and a new parameter sweep capability to tie geometry to quantitative physics base handling qualities.  These efforts will also lay the ground work for follow on studies of high lift aerodynamics and closed loop flight control.  The proposed efforts are designed to complement the existing and active OpenVSP and VSPAERO development efforts.","To date, the results of Dr. McDonald's NRA efforts have culminated in the release of OpenVSP 3.0 in 2015. This capability is ?open? in the sense that it can be downloaded, free of charge, for use from the OpenVSP website (www.openvsp.org). Therefore, the commercialization strategy for this effort is straightforward. There is a significant need in NASA for geometric aircraft conceptual design tools such as this, especially ones that consider unique geometries. The ESAero team proposing this work is in a unique position because the addition of Dr. Rob McDonald and Dr. David Marshall to ESAero and a subcontractor, J.R. Gloudemans, all brought on to support OpenVSP development under the AFRL Phase II SBIR, are critical to the best path for immediate commercialization and use. Providing these much needed improvements in an open format is beneficial to the entire industry, but especially NASA. In the current budget environment, there isn?t much money available for those users to purchase additional tools. ESAero knows this from direct experience with their hybrid-electric tool development in MATLAB; NASA customers have had trouble obtaining MATLAB licenses, which are very modestly priced. All funding awarded during this effort will be put towards improving OpenVSP 3.0 and associated tools to meet the integrated workflow for quantitative assessment of handling qualities objectives; no licensing fees are required or foreseen at this time.","The results of this effort can also be added and taught to the user community at the OpenVSP workshop, which takes place every year in August. ESAero agrees to provide the updates to OpenVSP 3.0 proposed here in an open format to benefit the user community, aerospace industry and especially the government customer. Previous versions of this tool are already in use at NASA, the Air Force, industry, including Boeing Research & Technology, and multiple aerospace universities (Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, MIT, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, etc.), as it has been downloaded thousands of times. The items proposed here also help meet the desires of the AFRL Aerospace Systems Directorate (specifically RQVA).  OpenVSP improvements and associated tools are intended to further develop and progress the vehicle analysis and design capability within AFRL which in turn supports contracted development efforts.  Such tools and improvements proposed here could have a direct involvement with future programs of record, including 6th generation fighter (F-X), Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B), and next generation trainer (T-X). This ?openness? leads to industry and government engaging ESAero and the team, as the partial developers, for support, tool modifications, or just outright engagement to exercise the tool on a customer?s behalf.  This Phase I effort will only solidify the ESAero team?s expertise in the conceptual design discipline, broadening the companies reach and bringing in new customers.","Aerodynamics; Development Environments; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Programming Languages; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)"

This includes a proliferation of small UAS that will operate beyond line of sight at altitudes of 500 feet and below. A myriad of issues continues to slow the development of verification, validation, and certification methods that will enable the safe introduction of UAS to the NAS. These issues include the lack of both a consensus UAS categorization process and quantitative certification requirements including the definition of UAS handling qualities. Because of a lack of quantitative data, attempts to address core problems thus far have failed to achieve consensus support. Currently the UAS arena includes traditional airframers, established UAS manufacturers, academic institutions, and many newcomers such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook that see UAS as a means to other commercial ends. The program described herein does not propose to address the entire verification, validation, and certification problem, but instead to address the important need to define UAS handling qualities in both remotely piloted and autonomous operations with an end product being the UAS Handling Qualities Assessment Software System, a toolbox that will guide UAS stakeholders through a systematic evaluation process. The process begins with classification. Because of the wide variety of vehicle types and size there cannot be a one-size-fits-all set of requirements. Given an appropriate classification, missions are next considered wherein they are broken down into specific task elements. These mission task elements are then used to identify specific criteria that predict handling qualities analytically and test demonstration maneuvers that verify handling qualities in flight. Feasibility of this process will be demonstrated in Phase I with existing physics-based UAS analytical models and flight test data.","First, this proposal directly supports the NASA Air Vehicle Technology topic that 'solicits tools, technologies and capabilities to facilitate assessment of new vehicle designs and their potential performance characteristics' and as specifically called out under Topic A1.05 Physics-Based Computational Tools - Stability and Control/High Lift Design Tools, the 'definition of handling qualities for unmanned aerial systems.' Beyond these specific NASA goals, NASA issued in 2014 a new strategic vision for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). From this effort came six new strategic thrusts. Of these thrusts, several involve the safe expansion of global air operations and are therefore directly related to the safe integration of UAS into the air space. The specific thrusts include 'safe, efficient growth in global operations,' 'real-time, system-wide safety assurance,' and 'assured autonomy for aviation transformation.' This proposal also supports NASA's Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP) of which the UAS Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) Project is a direct application.","In describing the growing UAS market, Teal Group reported that the worldwide UAS market spending will increase from $6.4 billion in 2014 to $11.5 billion in 2024. The Teal Group article also states that 'Our 2014 UAV study calculates the UAV market at 89% military, 11% civil cumulative for the decade, with the numbers shifting to 86% military and 14% civil by the end of the 10-year forecast.' The STI-Mitchell Aerospace Research team sees a strong demand for the advancement of UAS handling qualities capability on the military side where the Air Force and Navy have long been looking for a path forward in this area. The team sees this demand expanding to the growing commercial market, particularly on the small UAS side, as the FAA continues to open up the NAS to new UAS applications over the coming months and years.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Teleoperation"

The RIPCoRDD system is designed such that it will result in absolutely no increase in weight, power consumption, or volume of the rotorcraft.  The core of the RIPCoRDD device is a unique, distributed, fiber optic strain sensor which provides spatially dense strain measurements (every 1.25-5 mm) within the composite structure of the blade, coupled with a ground based installation of Luna?s proven instrumentation.  During Phase I Luna (with guidance from a rotorcraft OEM partner) will demonstrate the ability to detect and characterize damage which occurs in sample composite structures.  During Phase II Luna will mature the technology to TRL6 by testing the system in a complete rotor.  Commercialization will focus on transitioning the technology first to OEM manufacturers for non-destructive inspection applications, followed by deployment to rotorcraft end users for lifetime monitoring and diagnostics.","The Rapid In-Place Composite Rotor Damage Detection (RIPCoRDD) system directly addresses elements of the NASA technology development roadmap (topic 15.5).  While the proposed technology is broadly applicable to a range of applications within NASA projects, there are some for which the proposed work is especially relevant.  One specific program which has called for rotor health maintenance is the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project.  In addition, the advanced composites project is actively seeking new technologies which can help in the rapid inspection and characterization of composite material health.","Rotorcraft play a key role in numerous areas of modern life, from life-saving medical transports, to enabling access to remote locations, to military use.  The performance capabilities of composites (strength to weight, non-catastrophic failure) have driven their use in the weight sensitive designs of rotorcraft.  Due to the complex structure of composite materials there is a potential for hidden damage internal to the blade which shortens lifetime while being difficult to detect.  By enabling true condition based monitoring of these rotors, the useful lifetime of rotor blades can be extended, lowering total cost of ownership.  In addition, this technology can be expanded into a host of non-aeronautical applications, such as wind turbine health monitoring.","Air Transportation & Safety; Characterization; Composites; Contact/Mechanical; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Structures"

One of the key barriers it faces to the widespread use of VL vehicles within the National Airspace is the cost of maintenance on the vehicles to keep them safe and reliable. Qualtech Systems, Inc (QSI) in collaboration with Lockheed Martin - Mission Systems and Training (LM-MST) seeks to address these maintenance challenges by fielding a predictive Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) solution leveraging a diagnostic reasoner TEAMS-RDS (Testability Engineering And Maintenance System Remote Diagnosis Server) and prognostic algorithms. CBM+ involves inferring, tracking and forecasting of system degradation based on state awareness acquired from monitored data through fault detection, isolation, identification, diagnosis and prognosis techniques and to proactively plan maintenance actions to improve system availability and safety. QSI-LM's CBM+ solution will furnish the ability to keep the vehicle health status continually ahead of an advancing failure accumulation through a predictive maintenance strategy geared towards replacement-while-in-operation before the ensuing failures render the VL vehicle inoperable. Diagnosis will focus on current health state identification through detection, isolation, root cause analysis and identification of faults that have already occurred, while prognosis will leverage the current health state identification and forecast performance degradation, incipient component failures and probability density (or moments) of remaining useful life (RUL) or Time to Maintenance (TTM) or Time to Failure (TTF). It is anticipated that the CBM+ solution will leverage the currently existing communication capabilities between the aircraft, the pilot and ground-support personnel in a seamless and automated manner.","NASA's current vision to enhance the level of autonomy for vehicle health management and mission planning makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. The proposed technology, aimed at increasing operational uptime through the use of predictive CBM techniques, and the software tool for supporting its implementation will allow NASA to better plan and execute future Science Missions. The technology can be leveraged to support safety in complex systems, such as NASA's long-duration missions in space science and exploration. This technology can also be applied to autonomous and hybrid/ full electric systems with a vertical lift capability designed for a variety of civil missions. It is envisioned that the technology will also be able to readily operate as part of NASA's next generation Mission Control Technology allowing NASA to utilize the continuous health assessment and mission satisfiability information from the tool for improved mission execution while improving safety, mission success probability and the overall operational uptime of the VL Vehicle.","Among the other agencies FAA's NextGen program is the most obvious commercialization target for this technology. We envisage the proposed technology to be of significant interest for to DoD Future Lift Vehicle (FVL) program and being network-ready with support for modern web technologies can readily be available as part of the NextGen System Wide Information Management (SWIM) technologies. Apart from the FAA, US Air Force, US Navy, and commercial aviation (e.g., Boeing, Airbus) are the potential customers for the resulting technology. The development of the various interacting technology components for PHM enabled CBM can be easily directed towards mission assurance and will be of direct interest to large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets are potential targets as well. QSI expects to leverage its relationship with manufacturers of these systems, such as the Lockheed Martin's K-MAX (unmanned cargo helicopter) for which QSI is involved in providing a PHM solution for commercialization of the proposed technology. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems.",Analytical Methods; Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Fusion; Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); Diagnostics/Prognostics; Knowledge Management; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Simulation & Modeling

Currently, the only means available to generate this data are physical testing which is time consuming and expensive, and simplified computer models- either lumped parameter models or 2D models.The most advanced current computational model of drive systems with surface and crack damage can only be deployed on stand-alone computers. The existing contact algorithm relies on shared memory between CPUs, and quickly saturates memory bandwidth. We propose innovative modifications to  the algorithm so that models may be efficiently deployed on very large clusters of computers connected by high speed networks. These changes will make possible realistic time-domain 3D modeling of drive systems with surface and crack damage.","1) Condition Based Monitoring: The primary application of this work for NASA, is as a tool that can be used for creating, testing, and fine-tuning condition-monitoring strategies for rotor craft drive systems. The distributed contact analysis will enable dynamic analysis of full drive system models, both in a healthy state as well as with various kinds of damage. Both surface damage as well cracks can be studied.2) Life Estimation: Current component life prediction tools are constrained by the limited accuracy of simplified dynamic stress prediction methods. The proposed work will, make it possible run very accurate simulations under dynamic conditions. 3) Dynamic Factors: The proposed work will enable NASA to compute accurate dynamic factors for use during the design evaluation stage of gear boxes. These dynamic factors can be used to account for steady state dynamics, as well as for transients caused by short duration events.","1) Vibration Prediction in Time-Domain: To date, only frequency domain based vibration calculations with linear models have been commercially available. But Time-domain models are necessary to correctly include contact and kinematics induced non-linearities. Having the fast contact solver will allow very realistic drive system dynamic models, to run in the time domain.2) Impact Dynamics: It will be possible to make predictions for survivability of drive systems subjected to transients caused by short duration events such as a load spikes. This is an important consideration in the wind-turbine and off-highway equipment industries. Modeling these transient dynamics can only be done in the time-domain. A fast contact solver will allow realistic prediction of these effects.3) Automatic optimization: Access to a very fast solver will make it possible to run fast static analyses inside the optimization loop of a commercial general-purpose optimizer. It will be possible to optimize metrics such as gear contact patterns, transmission error, and stress while automatically varying the surface modifications and other design parameters.4) Manufacturing Error Studies: Each manufacturing error has a unique probability distribution. A very fast solver will enable Monte Carlo type studies of manufacturing errors with realistic random distributions.

A well-established approach to this bleeds a portion of the compressor discharge air to flow through and over turbine parts. As engine compressor pressure ratios continue to increase, the temperature of this compressor discharge air also increases, to the point that the cooling air itself needs to be cooled. Micro Cooling Concepts is involved in developing a concept for a heat exchanger co-located/integrated near the point of fuel injection in order to provide cooled cooling air. The main advantages of this concept are the minimization of the amount of heated fuel between the heat exchanger and fuel injector tip such that the fire danger from leaking tubing is eliminated, and the ease of delivering cooled cooling air to the secondary air circuit. Additionally, the modular concept distributes the heat exchange function, allowing for easy replacement of an individual heat exchanger module. For this program, high temperature materials will be used for fabrication using Micro Cooling Concepts' laminated foil construction approach. This effort supports the NASA goal of improving aeropropulsive efficiency through reduced fuel burn and increased cycle temperatures, specifically by enabling very high turbine cooling effectiveness.","A reduction in the temperature of available cooling air would provide additional heat sink, thereby enabling use of higher combustion temperatures. The benefits of such a concept include reduced fuel burn and the accompanying reduction in CO2 emissions, in alignment with NASA's goals, with accompanying minimal fire risk. This technology would be applicable to any NASA air-breathing fuel-based propulsion systems where available cooling air temperatures are currently too high to reach the desired performance goals.","The ability to provide cooled cooling air with minimal fire risk offers a compelling value proposition to turbine manufacturers and their clients. A major engine manufacturer has interest in incorporating the proposed concept into future civil and defense gas turbine engine products that currently show benefits from fuel-cooled cooling air.

With no foreseeable alternatives, advanced gas turbine propulsion will continue to power future subsonic transport aircraft. As a result, engine manufacturers are devoting significant effort to increasing fuel efficiency and pushing engines toward higher fan bypass ratios (BPRs). With fan speed already limiting allowable fan sizes, higher BPR requires new, smaller engine cores. However, component efficiency tends to decrease with decreasing size due in part to enhanced tip leakage and secondary flows. Many of the existing technologies designed to mitigate losses associated with these flow structures have only been investigated in conventional machines, under steady approximations, and/or in single components or stages. Also, they often address only a particular loss mechanism in a given flow structure. The proposed SBIR project innovates on existing mitigation strategies from a practical, holistic perspective to generate novel aerodynamic devices tailored to improve the efficiency of multi-stage, small-core turbines while also accounting for their inherently unsteady nature. The proposed devices, including tip leakage control and endwall treatments for secondary flow control, will be designed by accounting for each loss mechanism in the targeted flow structure and the device's influence on the unsteady flow field in the current stage and upstream and downstream stages. Successful designs will ensure increases in component efficiency also increase engine overall efficiency by avoiding offsetting reduction in loss in one stage with increased loss in another. In Phase I, numerical simulations will be used to devise and characterize feasible loss mitigation technologies. This foundational work will provide justification for comprehensive analysis and experimental evaluation of the most promising concepts in Phase II.","Strategic Thrust 3: Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles in the ARMD ""Strategic Implementation Plan"" establishes specific efficiency levels for subsonic transport aircraft. Key to obtaining these ambitious goals will be development of more efficient, higher-fan-BPR engine architectures, which because of physical limitations on fan size will require more compact engine cores. This need motivates the Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) Project's Technical Challenge (TC) 4.2 to investigate materials and concepts for a ""Compact High OPR Gas Generator."" By developing solutions for mitigating tip leakage and other secondary flows in small-core engine designs, the technologies to be developed in the proposed effort have the potential to make substantial contributions toward realizing the aircraft engine architecture and fuel efficiency targets set forth by NASA. The proposed effort will also be aligned with the objective of TC4.2, developing OPR 50+ gas generators without affecting noise or component life, and well timed with the goal of achieving TRL4 technologies by 2019. In particular, NASA's Compact Gas Turbine Sub-Project has awarded NRA contracts under TC4.2 to Pratt & Whitney and General Electric to begin developing high-pressure compressor technologies and loss mitigation methods. ATA intends to engage both organizations in the performance of the envisioned project to investigate technology transfer opportunities.","The turbomachinery efficiency improvements that may be realized by the envisioned aerodynamic devices (blade tip geometries, rotor casing, and/or endwall treatment) will provide ubiquitous benefit to nearly all turbomachinery applications. In addition to aircraft propulsion applications, the technologies could enable reduced fuel consumption and carbon emissions for a wide spectrum of Brayton-cycle power-generation applications. Secondary applications with similar increasing demands on efficiency include auxiliary power units (APUs), industrial power generation, and turbine-electric transmissions such as those on ocean vessels. Because the tip leakage mitigation mechanisms may have applicability in both the compression and turbine stages of these products, numerous derivative applications may be possible.","Air Transportation & Safety; Atmospheric Propulsion; Generation; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

The fan duct heat exchanger decreases the temperature of the 15% to 20% of compressor discharge air used to cool the High Pressure Turbine(HPT). Reducing the HPT cooling air temperature reduces the amount of cooling air needed for HPT cooling, and reducing vane and rotor blade cooling improves engine Specific Fuel Consumption(SFC). Fuel burn is adversely affected by any added engine weight due to the heat exchanger. Fan duct air is much colder than compressor discharge air, and can be used as a cold sink for cooling the HPT cooling air. Parametric analyses will be done to determine the SFC reduction as a function of cooling air temperature decrease. Pressure losses for both sides of the heat exchanger will be part of the analyses. The fan duct heat exchanger has large pressure differentials between the high pressure compressor discharge air and the relatively low pressure fan duct air. Structural analyses will be done for the heat exchanger to determine heat exchanger weight.","The proposed work advances  the NASA Aeronautics program goal of reduced fuel burn by using a fan duct heat exchanger.

However, shrouding rotor blades increases centrifugal stresses, and metallic HPT rotor blades are typically unshrouded in order to maximize stage output. Ceramic Matrix Composite(CMC) blades weigh much less than metallic blades. Shrouded CMC blades have lower centrifugal stresses than unshrouded metallic blades. The fuel burn reduction from an increase in stage efficiency due to shrouded HPT blades will be determined. The fuel burn reduction due to the higher temperature capability of CMC blades will also be determined. Cycle efficiency improvements from shrouding HPT rotor blades will increase for future engines. The HPT blade aspect ratio will decrease as engine Overall Pressure Ratio(OPR) increases. Future HPT blade aspect ratios may be less than half of current aspect ratios. While the absolute clearance may decrease in future engines, the relative clearance is likely to increase.

A variety of drag reduction techniques have shown promise and are under investigation, including both active flow control and surface microstructure concepts. Experimental verification of the performance of any drag reduction technique, however, can be challenging. Drag forces are generally significantly smaller than lift and side forces. Furthermore, drag reduction techniques are operating on components of the model, and therefore, a model mounted drag balance is required to evaluate the performance of the drag reduction technology. Further complicating the measurement is the fact that active flow control requires that high pressure air or electrical power be passed through the model mounted balance without impacting the measurement. Over the past 10 years, ISSI has developed an optical sensor for measurements of skin friction known as Surface Stress Sensitive Film (S3F). S3F has demonstrate good sensitivity to skin friction while maintaining very high common mode rejection between the pressure and skin friction forces. ISSI has recently designed and built a prototype drag balance based on this sensor. The balance design is structurally similar to a traditional balance, employing four pillars S3F as the active elements. Rather than monitoring strain in the pillars, as is done with a traditional balance, the vertical and horizontal deformation of the pillars is monitored and these displacements are converted to forces and moments. Preliminary results on the prototype balance indicate that forces smaller than a mili-Newton may be resolved, and there is no measureable coupling between the drag force and the normal or side forces. Development of a force balance technology that can be integrated into a model and measure small changes in drag would be of significant value for the development of energy efficient flight.","The objective of the Phase I and Phase II program is to develop an experimental tool that can be used to measure aerodynamic forces in a variety of bench-top settings, on model components in wind tunnels, and eventually into flight testing. The development of this balance is viewed as an enabling technology for the development of drag reduction technologies, an area of active research at NASA. Specifically, one current focus of NASA research is the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program and evaluation of drag reduction technologies is a key component of this program. A successful program will enable the design, construction, and deployment of custom balances that can be used in for this research. Reduction of noise using acoustic liners is a goal of the Subsonic Fixed Wing project at NASA. Evaluation of drag induced by these liners would benefit from the proposed balance. Finally, ongoing research between NASA and Boeing on the ecoDemonstrator seeks to evaluate drag reduction panels in flight. A balance design that could be deployed for flight testing on small samples of such a material would facilitate early stage evaluation of these drag reduction technologies.","The objective of the Phase I and Phase II program is to refine the elastomeric balance design, characterize the performance of the balance, and evolve the model mounted balance concept into a productive research tool. The result should be an experimental tool that can be used to evaluate drag reduction technologies in a variety of bench-top settings, on model components in wind tunnels, and eventually into flight testing. This device should be a valuable tool for the evaluation of a variety of drag reduction technologies. It is noted that this balance design may have applications outside of the aerodynamics community. Balances for hydrodynamics research into issues such as drag reduction of ship models, sedimentation and erosion around bridges, and biomedical research on insect locomotion have many of the same challenges as aerodynamics research. A balance design that allows high common mode rejection between channels and can be easily tuned for a particular application would be of value in those applications.

The development of fast and noninvasive instrumentation and measurement capabilities that can readily be integrated into the extreme environments is one of several major technological challenges associated with the design, building, and operation of these complex test environments.  Accurately mapping velocity flow fields-undoubtedly one of the most critical parameters-remains a significant challenge.  In addition, spatially and temporally resolved measurements of other flow parameters such as density, pressure, and temperature are of paramount importance. This proposal offers an integrated package of truly cutting-edge, multidimensional, seedless velocimetry and multi-flow-parameter diagnostics for wind tunnels and ground test facilities.  The concepts and ideas proposed are ranging from proof-of-principles demonstration of novel methodologies using 10-100 kHz-rate nanosecond (10-100 nsec) duration burst-mode laser sources for measurements in realistic tunnel conditions. The proposed high-repetition-rate Rayleigh scattering which is suitable for any wind tunnel testing involving various gases is a state-of-the-art technique for analysis of unsteady and turbulent flows.","Improvement of high-data-rate multi-dimensional, multi-parameter diagnostics will have wide application in NASA large ground test facilities.  These test facilities play an integral role in the design, development, evaluation, and analysis of advanced aerospace technologies and vehicles. Cutting-edge optical diagnostics and modeling tools are proven to be instructive and will be the basis of such new developments in these fields.  The advanced diagnostic toolkit developed under this SBIR project will be instrumental to fully investigate multiple flow parameters relevant to subsonic to hypersonic vehicles as well next generation airplane engines, and hence will be an invaluable asset to NASA and to the nation.","The advanced noninvasive diagnostic toolkit proposed under the current program will be a significant step forward in using cutting-edge laser technology to address a variety of diagnostics challenges in multiple government and industrial applications.  A major beneficiary besides NASA would be DOD test facilities developing advanced systems such as aircraft engines. The increasing cost of fuels as well as the cost associated with offsetting pollutant emissions requires engine manufacturers to implement onboard nonconventional combustion strategies and diagnostics for existing systems as well as to develop improved engine designs.  Being able to apply well-developed laser-based diagnostic tools in laboratory could be a game changer for commercial users and manufactures of engines.  The impact areas may include aircraft engine manufacturers, stationary power plant operators and owners as well as automotive design engineers.","Aerodynamics; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Ultraviolet; Visible"

To address this need, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Plenoptic Attitude Monitoring (PAM) system, which utilizes a dual plenoptic imager to extract attitude information. The innovative dual plenoptic design utilizes one plenoptic imager to analyze and correct for turbulence effects introduced by airflow around the model, while the second imager extracts the attitude information from the model itself. This system is capable of providing real-time measurements with a high angular resolution of better than 9 arcsec. As an analytical imaging based system, PAM may also be placed in any location that provides it with a view of the model under test, thereby ensuring compatibility with existing monitoring technologies and enabling protection from wind tunnel temperature and pressure conditions. The compactness of the design also minimizes setup and calibration time, thereby fully compatible and reducing the impact on wind tunnel operations. During Phase I, POC will design and demonstrate the feasibility of the PAM system using a low-speed wind tunnel and modeling for higher wind speeds. By the completion of Phase II, POC will demonstrate the PAM system in subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnel tests and finalize the design for production.","The primary application of the PAM system will be for model attitude analysis in wind tunnels, enabling improved analysis of model design. With minor modifications, PAM can also be incorporated into land- and aircraft-based observation platforms, which will enable real-time analysis of flight systems under actual flight conditions. This will enable wind shear analysis of aircraft and spacecraft and also provide for a predictive flight path program based on the changes in position and attitude.","Non-NASA applications include military applications of the PAM system after modifications for installation in aircraft. PAM's ability to be incorporated into a predictive flight path program will enable it to rapidly forecast the flight path of an enemy aircraft or missile, thereby improving the response time for countermeasures. Commercial applications of PAM include civilian wind tunnels and the ability for physical analysis when it is necessary to eliminate external factors from the imagery. This includes shock analysis, tests of tensile strength for new materials, and rapid characterization of objects in motion to be incorporated into physics-based simulations.",Attitude Determination & Control; Image Analysis; Interferometric (see also Analysis)

These systems have high power requirements and only protect certain areas of the aircraft; thus such technology is not considered for next generation vehicles as it will greatly diminish the allocation of power for other vital components. The accumulation of ice on an aircraft (airframe or engine components) results in a drastic decrease of performance (decrease in thrust and lift, increase in weight and drag). To this effect, Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI), proposes to develop a thin-film coating that will combat dynamic icing conditions with a two-part solution; in which the top layer coating consists of a smooth superhydrophobic coating to combat the supercooled water droplets and a base layer that consists of a smooth silicone elastomer to reduce ice adhesion strength from possible ice nucleation. Phase I efforts will be primarily dedicated towards developing and synthesizing the hybrid thin-film coating and evaluating its ice adhesion strength, coating durability, and surface morphology. Phase II efforts will build upon the results of the Phase I findings and incorporate the material/coating into NASA�s constructed vehicles such as UAVs, manned aircrafts, and next generation aerial vehicles (N+2).","The hybrid thin-film coating developed in this proposed Phase I effort can be incorporated into NASA�s Sensor Integrated Environmental Remote Research Aircraft (SIERRA), whose key mission is to perform remote sensing and atmospheric sampling of isolated or inaccessible regions on Earth. Furthermore, the proposed innovation will also benefit manned aerial vehicles such as the P-3 Orion and next generation aerial vehicles (N+2 or N+3) that are being jointly developed by NASA and Boeing. The proposed technology will be primarily used on the leading edge of the aerial vehicle, other structural and airframe components that are susceptible to ice accretion, as well as engine components.","The proposed hybrid thin-film coating has many commercial and industrial applications such as the aviation, communications, shipping, power generation and transmission, construction, and alternative energy industries. The proposed hybrid thin-film superhydro/icephobic coating can be integrated into communication towers, satellite dishes, trains, outdoor heavy machinery, commercial aircrafts, windmills and solar arrays, power lines, maritime vessels, and bridges.","Air Transportation & Safety; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Nanomaterials; Polymers"

In Phase I, we will develop a cellulose nanopaper base layer for the storage and replenishment of our functional fluid to dramatically extend its useful life. Methods for increasing cellulose nanopaper strength and elasticity, and improved control of porosity will be explored. The resulting icephobic composite prototype will be tested for performance under simulated icing conditions in an icing wind tunnel.","Our proposed technology has broad applicability across NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) and is especially relevant to the Airspace Operations and Safety Program and Advanced Air Vehicles Program. When fully developed, our technology can provide continuous, lightweight, rain-erosion resistant icing protection without adding manufacturing complexity or affecting payload for fixed and rotary wing vehicles.  Our proposed technology is also in close alignment with NASA's Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) research. By mitigating the hazards of flight into icing conditions, our technology will dramatically increase options for flight path, range, altitude and duration of unmanned missions.","Icephobic coatings have numerous potential commercial applications within civil aviation, rail, wind energy, maritime transport, and logistics industries.

The state of the art active deicing method on leading edges involves either an electrical, pneumatic or vibration induced debonding of accumulated ice. With the advent of icephobic nanocoatings, there have been attempts to develop a durable passive anti-ice coating. However, success to date has been limited. The state of the art can be advanced if anti-ice coatings can be made more durable, and are made to function synergistically with active de-icing techniques. The advantages are reduced power consumption, improved service life of mechanical components, lighter electronics and extra protection in case of failure of active device. Working in collaboration with a manufacturer of low power ice protection systems for commercial and military aircraft, we propose in Phase I to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating a durable anti-ice coating with an active deicing device. The proposed program builds upon NEI's core competency of introducing desirable functionalities into engineered coatings. The anti-ice/deicing performance will be tested at our collaborator's icing wind tunnel. The objective of the Phase II program will be to further refine the coating composition and coating deposition process, as well as the configuration of the baseline active deicing device so as to deliver a working prototype of an integrated ice protection system that combines a passive anti-ice coating and an active deicing device.","The proposed integrated deicing system directly supports NASA's continued interest in inflight icing hazard mitigation technology for aircraft. Existing and next generation aircraft, including N+2/N+3 aircraft as well as vertical lift and unmanned systems, will benefit from the technology as it will help enable all-weather operation, reduce weight and lower power consumption. The baseline active deicing system, upon which the proposed technology is based, is already being used on several commercial and military aircraft. Success in the proposed effort will advance the capabilities of the active deicing system. It will also serve as the basis for future deicing systems that incorporate a passive coating working in conjunction with an active deicing system.","Ice accretion on aircraft structures is a common aviation danger. Under non-icing conditions air flows smoothly over the airfoil and creates lift. Ice buildup on aircraft?s leading surfaces disturbs laminar airflow, leading to increased drag and decreased lift. Consequently, aircraft icing degrades performance and controllability and significantly increases pilot workload and aircraft fuel consumption. The proposed anti-ice nanoscale coating has the potential to drastically reduce the ice adhesion and/or prevent ice accumulation on surfaces in inclement weather conditions. The coating technology being developed in this program can be applied to military and commercial aircraft. Additionally, the coating can also find use in satellite dishes, transmission lines, wind turbine blades, communication towers, and train cars.

Super polishing aluminum slurry and pad technology has been used in preliminary tests to polish aluminum airfoils to rms surface roughness levels to 100 nm and below.  An aluminum surface polished to 10 nm surface roughness exhibited a 73% reduction in temperature adjusted ice adhesion strength at 1.7 psi.  Designed experiments on polishing will be conducted to optimize the surface roughness that yields the lowest ice adhesion strength.  Subsequently, the TiN erosion/corrosion coating will also be super polished after deposition to equivalent low surface roughness levels.  The manufacturing process can be optimized for time and cost efficiency.

Whether these procedures are for system check-out, experimental set-up, data collection, or operating the test article, following appropriate procedures and auditing the results of these procedures brings rigor and repeatability to the experimental process. Typically, test procedures are written in Microsoft Word or Excel and then printed out. Data entry is done by pen and pencil with little to no data captured electronically. This increases the error rate in procedures and reduces efficiency. A cloud-based test procedure system provides procedures via web browsers on tablets or laptops and guides the user through the procedure step-by-step.

Because these cameras track and capture flight tests occurring multiple kilometers away, the imagery collected is often degraded by the atmospheric turbulence between the camera and subject. In the summer of 2015, EM Photonics delivered the ATCOM TM-1, a rack-mountable system that is capable of taking a live HD-SDI video from a NASA long-range tracking camera, enhancing that video in real time, and outputting the resulting video in the same format; however, the current approach still requires user configuration to achieve the best results.The focus of our work in this project will be on both automating system configuration to adjust automatically to changing system and scene parameters, as well as improving human factors related to operator's use of an inline video processing solution. The former requires research on methods for estimating turbulence and determining motion in complex videos with significant distortion and warping. In the course of this project, we will develop technology in four primary areas, each of which are useful in themselves but with the ultimate goal of including them as features in the ATCOM TM-1 system currently used by NASA AFRC.","Our work will be broadly applicable to any group that collects long-range imagery for monitoring, scientific study, or surveillance applications.

These tools will provide further enhancement of videos collected there allowing for observation of additional detail in the subjects imaged. It will also include software to automate the current image enhancement system, reducing the burden on the operator of interacting with it and thus freeing them up to focus on their other responsibilities during flight tests.The image enhancement tools developed here can be used in two ways during rocket launches. First, since observation cameras must be placed far from the launch pads, our technology can assist in range clearance to allow for observation of additional details on vehicles prior to launch. Second, they will provide additional detail on rockets as they fly to provide more information to ground crew.Additionally, the software we develop can also be used in the study of objects in space from ground cameras. We can mitigate the atmospheric effects given a clear picture of objects of interest.","The technology developed in this project will have applications at other federal government agencies as well as in the private sector. From a federal government perspective, these tools can be used to monitor secure facilities including sensitive government buildings and nuclear stockpiles. Our technology can reveal additional details on the subjects being monitored. They can increase the effective range of cameras placed at the border. Customs and Border Patrol has shown an interest in this technology for helping catch drug traffickers. Local government and regulatory agencies may also be interested in in monitoring wildlife around power-generation facilities including solar farms and land and sea-based wind turbines, primarily for their effects on local bird and other animal habitats.Within private industry, we have had discussions with camera vendors that would like to incorporate this technology directly into their hardware platforms once the algorithms have reached a sufficient state as to not require operator interaction.

The RTA system monitors key critical parameters to determine if errors in the experimental controller are potentially driving the vehicle to unsafe flight conditions.  If such conditions are ensuing, the RTA system activates mitigation strategies to bring the aircraft back to a safe state.  The main efforts in Phase I are: (1) develop the RTA system in a desktop simulation environment using a challenge problem with a specific advanced control system applied to a specific flight test vehicle that is of interest to NASA Armstrong, (2) integrate the RTA system into a NASA flight test experiment processing environment, (3) generalize the RTA design approach, and (4) prepare for SUAS Phase II flight tests by designing a flight test article and flight test experiment plan.  The unmanned, small scale Phase II flight test will lay the groundwork for larger scale Phase III flight test in manned aircraft at NASA or other test facilities.","The developed technologies will help advanced NASA AFRC flight testing efforts by providing trusted, automatic safety monitoring and mitigation measures.  This will ease the burden on the flight test pilots from continually monitoring for unsafe conditions, which can often occur faster than a human pilot can recognize and react to in the first place.  This added level of protection will also allow expanded flight envelope testing of more complex, advanced control, guidance, mission management/planning systems, and other onboard support technologies, such as vehicle health monitoring.","The developed technologies will help advanced flight testing efforts of DoD services, such as the Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as defense agencies, such as DARPA, as well as commercial airline services.  Other potential opportunities in commercial markets will be in unmanned systems applications.  There is substantial interest in unmanned systems that can think on their own and react to unforeseen events without the need for human control and intervention.  More commercial companies continue to see the benefits of such tools in helping to deliver their products, manage construction of equipment, process hardware, perform automated tasks, etc.  Such unmanned platforms range from airborne vehicles, to unmanned ground vehicles, to robotic applications.  Errors, breakdowns, faults and unforeseen characteristics will be commonplace when utilizing these types of advanced autonomy, and there is critical need for runtime protection that can provably bound the behaviors of these unmanned, autonomous systems to avoid unsafe conditions or costly accidents.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Process Monitoring & Control; Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Space systems have become increasingly complex where the development of each system may be geographically distributed across organizations and subsystems.  When performing an integrated flight test, the main problems that must be addressed are test orchestration and measurement/data acquisition.  The main issue with both areas typically arises from the fact that each system component may employ various disparate interfaces which may be in addition to the direct interfaces used during flight.  Effective flight tests will also likely involve the integration of multiple simulations and other test equipment to provide inputs and feedback for real-world scenarios.  The proposed innovation is a scalable architectural software framework known as the mREST Automated Test Environment (MATE) which addresses the technical issues commonly associated with flight testing, measurement, and data acquisition by providing comprehensive flight test orchestration and data measurement/acquisition capabilities in both centralized and distributed environments.   MATE has the potential to significantly optimize current flight test methodologies without levying new requirements on each test element.  The proposed software framework is based on the mREST Architecture and Interface Specification  which is a specific implementation of a RESTful web-services architecture  that resulted from research and prototyping efforts performed by METECS for the Johnson Space Center (JSC).","The MATE software has the potential to greatly enhance existing flight test orchestration capabilities at NASA.  Any facility which requires integration and testing of hardware and/or software elements would benefit.  In addition, development of web-based user interfaces would be streamlined for any MATE element or system.   Systems that utilize common NASA components with existing web-based interfaces such as LabVIEW, the Trick Simulation Environment, and/or EDGE graphics have a greater initial potential for implementation.  Other applications that have potential for NASA are:1. Remote data monitoring2. Integrated test automation and orchestration3. Simulation monitoring and control4.

The proposed chemical sensor probes will be a new class of on-board engine instrumentation for real time monitoring of engine and bleed air system operation in flight.  Sensor arrays developed by MEI have been demonstrated for ground tests usage to quantify composition of critical constituents in turbine engine exhaust products, e.g., CO, CO2, NOx, O2 and HC (unburned hydrocarbons).  There currently is no flight capable instrumentation for real time measurement of high temperature gas streams from engine bleed air or the turbine exhaust.  Ground test demonstrations with high temperature capable (500 to 600 (deg) C) solid-state chemical microsensors have shown the potential value for engine health monitoring and detection of engine faults or abnormal operations from ingestion of high moisture levels or particulate from volcanic emissions.  The development of flight qualified engine sensors which can measure key chemical species will enable a new level of aeronautical vehicle health management.","This proposal targets the improvement of NASA's ground and flight test aeronautics testing capabilities. Potential end users within NASA include ground test facilities such as Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR) and Flight Loads Laboratory (FLL), as well as flight facilities such as AFRC with both piloted and unmanned systems.  Real-time, in-flight data regarding combustor condition and emissions species can provide a previously unavailable test capability for NASA.  Monitoring of bleed air for contaminants and fuel backflow is also an area of interest.The sensor probe systems proposed in this project are aligned with the next step testing which has been proposed for the VIPR program.  Potential VIPR 4 or 5 activities could include measurements of the bleed air and engine exhaust using on-board chemical sensors.  Presently no such sensors exist and they would need to be developed along the lines proposed in this project.","All commercial passenger aircraft manufacturers are highly interested in sensors for monitoring bleed air quality to avoid exposure of harmful or noxious gases to passengers and crew.

A new damage identification technique is proposed from which damage in composites such as delamination and impact-related defects can be detected.  The proposed technique utilizes the pitch-catch Lamb wave signals obtained from an FBG sensor and piezoelectric actuator network, without the need of baseline signals from the pristine condition.  The project goals include designing an ultra-high-speed/high resolution, small footprint FBG sensor and piezoelectric actuator network plus an FBG interrogator, constructing a system model, fabricating a test platform and developing signal processing algorithms to identify and measure Lamb wave signals in the presence of a quasi-static background strain field.  The system model will demonstrate proof-of-principle, and the test results will provide proof-of-functionality of the proposed sensor system as a measurement method for damage identification in composite structures.  The methodology proposed by IFOS includes using advanced signal processing algorithms.  IFOS and its collaborators in this project will develop a Phase II plan that includes a development and integration strategy, potential demonstration opportunities, program schedule, and estimated costs.","The primary application of this technology meets NASA�s requirements for improved measurement and analysis techniques for acquisition of real-time, in-flight data used to determine aerodynamic, structural, flight control, and propulsion system performance characteristics.

The safe operation of UASs in the National Airspace (NAS) will require the vehicle to equipped with sophisticated avionics and flight software. The cost of verifying the flight software required for safe operation is a tremendous barrier to the growth of the technology. Windhover Labs intends to port NASAs Core Flight Software (CFS) to a UAS platform, and use new techniques and tools to lower flight software verification costs. This will provide a safe platform for UAS technology expansion. Windhover Labs intends to extend the existing safety critical pedigree of CFS to UASs. We will develop all the UAS platform specific applications and integrate them into a UAS avionics package. Windhover Labs will certify the CFS framework so application developers need only focus on the verification of their applications. With the basic UAS platform certification taken care of, UAS users can focus on their specific needs like precision agriculture, aerial survey, product delivery, etc. CFS is built around a software bus which allows for straightforward addition of this application specific software. Windhover Labs will also create an embedded test agent. This agent will provide an automated test engine that has access to all the application interfaces. This embedded agent provides an interface and execution platform for application developers to write effective verification tests. Innovative ground control software will enable automating the execution of these tests and the collecting of necessary verification evidence. The CFS framework is a perfect fit for powering the future of UASs in the NAS. Windhover Labs believes that providing this safety critical flight software framework and verification tools tailored for that framework lowers the technology barrier so many new UAS applications can be brought to market affordably.","NASA Commercial Applications and research would greatly benefit from a certified version of CFS for UASs. NASA already has significant in-house expertise in creating CFS applications. With a UAS enabled version of CFS, NASA researchers could more easily use UASs to safely fly their payloads and perform their research. With the embedded test agent and accompanying ground software, NASA would be able to verify their applications quickly and efficiently, reducing the number of defects that escape to the field and lowering the cost of their test programs.","The Non-NASA Commercial market for UASs is ready to explode. Many potential application developers cannot currently overcome the barrier to entry that is presented by safety related concerns. With a safety critical flight software framework in place, they can focus on their problem space without needing extensive flight software experience. A precision agriculture company can focus on their sensors and data processing functions rather than worrying about how the vehicle can safely fly in the NAS. A delivery company can solve the problems associated with mechanizing their delivery process rather than how to get the vehicle to fly safely from source to destination. A certified CFS is to UAS as iOS is to the iPhone. CFS can enable application developers to create solutions that stand on the shoulders of a rock solid platform without having to ascend the learning curve associated with the platform specifics. The Non-NASA market would benefit from the embedded test agent and ground software in the same was that NASA would. Efficient test programs reduce the number of defects and allow for more testing at a lower cost. Thorough testing is the key to the expansion of UASs in the NAS.","Air Transportation & Safety; Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Command & Control; Computer System Architectures; Development Environments; Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Operating Systems; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems); Verification/Validation Tools"

Operation of SUAS may be highly automated, but human oversight is still required to provide a last line of defense against failures, especially those due to errors in the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) system.  Oversight of the systems is appropriate because the Verification, Validation, and Certification (V&V/C) activities required to achieve a high software Design Assurance Level (DAL) typically have not been conducted for these systems.  In some cases this is because the GNC systems contain elements such as adaptive and learning capabilities that make V&V/C with existing methods difficult or impossible, while in other cases the issue is primarily cost, which can be prohibitive especially for small, low-cost systems. Barron Associates proposes development of automated monitoring capabilities that can assume the low-level monitoring responsibilities currently allocated to humans, enabling safe UAS operations with reduced human oversight.  To develop these automated capabilities, the team will build on a rigorous Run-Time Assurance (RTA) framework developed by Barron Associates.  Goals of the research effort include (1) building a safety monitor based on the rigorous theory of the RTA framework to enforce geo-fence boundaries for arbitrary vehicles, including fixed-wing vehicles, (2) rapidly advancing the TRL of the technology with a Phase II program that culminates in flight demonstrations, and (3) demonstrating that the RTA framework is a practical and powerful basis that can be used to enable reduced human oversight for a wide range of operating scenarios.","The proposed technology is closely aligned with several current NASA research areas. One example is the Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management (UTM) effort, one of the stated goals of which is to ""enable safe and efficient low-altitude airspace operations by providing services such as...dynamic geo-fencing"". The proposed research effort will provide a highly assured geo-fence enforcement capability that can readily accommodate dynamic boundaries.  The system will also be able to provide rapid feedback when a specific boundary change will lead to a geo-fence violation given the current vehicle states, and an estimate of how long it will be before the vehicle can comply with the new boundary. The proposed research effort would also complement work such as the SAFEGUARD effort at NASA Langley, which is developing independent monitoring hardware and geo-fence enforcement capabilities.  The proposed work will complement NASA efforts by providing rigorously defined switching boundaries and a robust maneuver capability to guarantee fixed wing-aircraft remain in the geo-fenced area without unnecessarily constraining maneuvering near the boundary. The proposed technology also offers potential value as a safety system for NASA's research flight test activities.","The non-NASA commercial applications of the proposed technology are enormous. By August 2015, the FAA had issued over 1000 authorizations to operate UAS through the Section 333 Exemption process, and in just the last two weeks of January 2016, the FAA issued over 80 additional authorizations. This demonstrates that the UAS market is already substantial and is growing very rapidly. UAS operators need effective technologies, such as that currently proposed, to ensure a high level of safety.  The rapidly increasing number of organizations offering commercial UAS services also means that cost competition is likely to be intense, and operators will have to be efficient to be successful.  With the cost of vehicles and the operating cost per hour already fairly low, especially compared to manned aircraft, reducing labor costs is a compelling strategy for providers of UAS services to remain competitive. The proposed technology will help to reduce labor costs by reducing the required level of human oversight, allowing a single human operator to conduct operations with a focus on mission management, rather than requiring two people, one to manage the mission and one to maintain eyes on the vehicle and provide backup control. Ultimately, the proposed technology will help to enable one operator to control multiple vehicles and conduct beyond line of sight operations, for enhancing efficiency and operational flexibility.",Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Verification/Validation Tools

They could perform difficult and dangerous tasks such as fire fighting, border patrol, and search and rescue, and dull tasks such as surveying crops. The elimination of a cockpit and pilot makes UAS operation attractive from an economic standpoint. In addition, much of the technology used for autonomy could benefit manned flight as a pilot's aid to help in tasks such as landing on an offshore oil rig. Open questions remain, however, about how unmanned autonomous aircraft can be safely incorporated into the NAS. UAS operating in the NAS must (1) sense and avoid other vehicles and follow air traffic commands, (2) avoid the terrain and land safely without operator intervention, (3) react to contingencies such as engine-out and lost-link scenarios, and (4) be reliable (by FAA airworthiness standards) and cost-effective. The current approach for UAS integration relies on radio links and the operator's acuity to direct them safely. Lost links, however, are unavoidable. UAS must have the capability to make their own decisions based on information available via databases and any information discovered by onboard sensors. Near Earth Autonomy proposes to develop technologies and capabilities leading to fully autonomous systems that are able to discover and adapt to unpredicted changes in their environment, and yet still accomplish the mission, with minimal or no human involvement. This proposal focuses on developing an Autonomous Contingency System in the form of sensors and computer software that will enable UAS of the future to be operable safely in the NAS. Additionally, the proposal addresses how the technical challenges can be met and how the technology developed can be shown to be both trustworthy and commercially viable for general aviation.","Near Earth envisions the initial NASA market to be primarily units for testing and validation at both the system level and at the aircraft level. The autonomous capabilities that Near Earth proposes will contribute to NASA's testing and validation of the technologies and concepts for UAS operations in the NAS. Additionally, Near Earth's autonomous technology will provide an enhanced capability, enabling more comprehensive UAS flight-testing for NASA's collaborative efforts with the FAA to accommodate UAS operation in the Next Generation Air Transportation System. As the autonomous flight capabilities mature and are integrated into aircraft, they will be of direct use to NASA in their flight testing of ground-based air navigational aids and guidance systems located in remote areas, such as Antarctica. Near Earth's autonomous technology will enable greater utilization of UAS in other NASA areas, particularly for experimentation and testing in NASA?s various research centers.","Government agencies, both military and civilian, will comprise a much larger market for the technology. The commercial sector will eventually be the largest market sector. A recent market analysis in Composites World magazine, drawing on work from both the Teal Group and AUVSI, indicates a global military market of approximately 57,000 UAS, with about 19,000 for the US military services--primarily in the reconnaissance and attack configurations, with growing utilization of utility and cargo configurations. Additionally, the analysis forecasts a commercial market of as many as 160,000 unmanned aircraft, most of which would be in the public safety and precision agriculture segments.",Intelligence; Perception/Vision; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors)

In the case of an unmanned air vehicle, this level of intelligent risk minimization is unavailable. Moreover, low-weight and low-cost design objectives for unmanned aircraft have resulted in a lack of propulsion and control redundancy, as well as unreliable communication links and an associated increase in incidents due to engine failure, control failure, and lost link. Safe integration of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) will require an onboard capability for unmanned aircraft to accomplish the complex observation, understanding, and decision making that is required without assistance from a human operator.  An advanced system capable of perception, cognition, and decision making is necessary to replace the need for a dedicated expert operator to ensure safety to persons, vehicles, and structures on the ground during UAS forced landings. Deployment of such a system would enable multiple UAS to be supervised by a single operator without compromising safety.The Self-Directed and Informed Forced Landing system emulates the continuous decision making process of a human pilot by assimilating available information and constantly reevaluating the plan.  Robust, onboard guidance and control maximize the capability of the impaired aircraft while executing the current plan.  The system considers current vehicle capability, wind estimates, landing site and route risk, as well as the uncertainty associated with these factors. Also, system design decisions have been, and will continue to be, weighed against current and near-future verification, validation, and certification requirements.","Widespread commercial use of UAS requires the safe integration of UAS into the NAS.  Associated NASA research programs with a focus on achieving multi-vehicle operation and autonomous operation with less human oversight are application areas that directly benefit from the proposed system. The system directly addresses the Integrated Aviation Systems Program's focus area of ?high level machine perception, cognition, and decision making? while also supporting the focus area of enabling ?humans to operate multiple UAS with minimal oversight.?  Specifically, the system will enable UASs to plan and execute forced landings that minimize the risk to persons and property on the ground.  This technology is applicable to all classes/tiers of UAS including those in low-altitude airspace and those in high-altitude Class A and Class E airspace. Deployment in low-altitude airspace is directly applicable to near-term interests in Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM).  Application to larger atmospheric research UAS and unmanned reusable launch vehicles follows maturation of the technology on small and mid-sized UAS at lower altitudes.","In order to safely fulfill their rolls in government and commercial sectors, UAS will need to meet performance expectations for mission completion, reliable operation, and safe coexistence with other aircraft in the national airspace. The proposed system will address this need and increase the reliability, safety and autonomy of a UAS. Government agency UAS applications include: (1) Department of Defense military and intelligence-gathering operations, (2) FBI and local law-enforcement operations in urban areas, and (3) Department of the Interior land management oversight. In the private commercial sector, applications include the rapidly growing use of UAS for remote inspection and photography as well as future uses including package and medical supply delivery.  The proposed system will interface with a widely used open-source auto-pilot software suite to provide direct access to a significant market of current small UAS users.

Envisioned missions often involve executing several different activities, sometimes simultaneously, where agents (Unmanned air, sea surface, or ground vehicle) must coordinate and interact with each other to perform the requisite tasks. Agents within these networked teams are usually heterogeneous, possessing different resources and capabilities, and some agents are better suited to handle certain types of tasks than others ? this leads to different roles and responsibilities within the mission.  In other scenarios, independent vehicles, each with their own goals, must operate in the same space without interfering with one another . Ensuring proper coordination and collaboration between different agents is crucial to efficient and successful operations, motivating the development of autonomous planning methods for heterogeneous networked teams. Reducing the necessity for perfect communication is also critical.Since operations involve dynamic environments, with situational awareness and underlying models changing rapidly as new information is acquired, so planning strategies must be computationally efficient to adjust solutions in real time. We propose to develop the Tool for Collaborative Autonomy (TCA) that will provide an automated planning capability that routes assets to optimize overall airspace utilization (e.g. in traffic management scenarios) or operational effectiveness (e.g. in cooperative scenarios), and to ensure spatial and temporal deconfliction/synchronization of the team under dynamically changing environments while considering cost factors (e.g. fuel and time), available resources and network constraints.","The proposed Tool for Collaborative Autonomy (TCA) will enable scheduling and deconfliction for civilian low-altitude and Unmanned Aircraft System operations. TCA will replace or augment pilots performing dangerous and/or high precision tasks. Crop dusting, aerial firefighting, agricultural monitoring, and environmental disaster relief involve complex routing of vehicles at low altitudes in communication constrained and uncertain environments. Using TCA for these applications has the potential to save lives and increase productivity. TCA will also be applicable in the areas of multi-satellite missions, multi-aperture telescopes. Using TCA, multi-satellite missions can be performed, involving clusters of satellites performing in a ?fractionated? spacecraft architecture; a group of navigation capable inspector satellites can provide an external inspection solution to Earth-escape vehicles, like Orion capsule; and multi-aperture telescopes can provide improved optical performance and better coverage of multiple task areas by providing a flexible reconfigurable system.","The proposed Tool for Collaborative Autonomy (TCA) will also find applications in the burgeoning package delivery domain in which heterogeneous air and ground robots retrieve and deliver packages from base locations to delivery locations. This domain is complicated due to uncertainties and constraints, including decentralization, no online communication between robots, partial and noisy observability of packages, and probabilistic distributions of delivery times. Optimal or near-optimal solutions cannot be found in these situations by standard task allocation and planning algorithms; this will be a key goal of TCA. In addition, it will enable infrastructure surveillance, agricultural monitoring, micro-scale wind model development in urban environment, transport-related applications such as automated parking garages and autonomous vehicles, mining-related applications such as automated mine vehicles and mine sensing. TCA will be of great significance in warehouse management systems, in which large numbers of cooperative mobile robots that perform a majority of the physical tasks.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Navigation & Guidance; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Sequencing & Scheduling; Simulation & Modeling; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

There needs to be a way to control multiple UAV teams with minimal human oversight.  The proposed innovation builds on and combines several technologies we have developed to create an architecture and set of software methods that will achieve this goal, significantly advancing the state of the art.  The proposed innovations are based on our NASA-funded Aurora planning, resource allocation, and scheduling framework, which has proved optimal in many, many diverse domains, including UAV scheduling; a Probabilistic RoadMap Planner (PRMP) to plan detailed real-time UAV routes to rapidly satisfy and optimize a large number of simultaneous constraints and objectives; the asynchronous consensus-based bundle algorithm (ACBBA) for UAV-to-UAV task negotiation; and the concept of a play (from sports) represented using behavior transition networks (BTNs). The ultimate goal of this proposed effort is to allow intelligent UAV team coordination and control in an intelligent, predictable, and robust way, with little cognitive load on the human users.  This will require intelligent real-time planning, role allocation, negotiation, and detailed path planning and, when communication is not possible, autonomous, intelligent, adaptive behavior by the UAVs.  In Phase I, we will develop the required AI techniques to automate all aspects of intelligently executing, recommending, and/or automatically selecting appropriate plays, robustly assigning roles and planning routes, and adaptively executing each role, robustly and predictably in environments with varying levels of uncertainty.  We will design the ultimate system and, to absolutely prove its feasibility, prototype all aspects of it in Phase I on *actual, physical UAVs*.","Although, as requested by the NASA topic, SCOUT focuses on greatly reducing the cognitive burden of controlling UAV teams, the technologies, since they implement a degree of autonomy and because they are not specific to aerial vehicles, would be useful for any NASA mission involving teams of unmanned vehicles of any kind in any location.  These could be a team of unmanned spacecraft inspecting the outside of the ISS or any other future NASA facility in space or a combination of UAVs and UGVs on the surface of Mars or another planet or moon, or unmanned subsurface vehicles in the ocean of Europa or another moon.  Autonomous science oriented missions would share similarities to the Search and Rescue and other Search-oriented missions discussed in the proposal.","There are a large number of non-NASA commercial applications for the SCOUT technology, as evidenced by the explosion of civilian UAVs.  Examples include remote sensing, disaster response, agriculture, search and rescue (in the wilderness, in the ocean, in urban areas during disasters, inside buildings during fires or other severe problems), wilderness fire-fighting to find hot spots, crop reconnaissance to find problems (such as over/under watering, disease, pests, too much or too few nutrients/fertilizer), surveying networks looking for problems (roads/bridges, electrical distribution, water, oil, or gas pipes, etc. across large outside areas or within buildings/factories), looking for fugitives, and SWAT team and other rapid responses to terrorist, mass shooter, or large scale kidnapping incidents.  And, of course, new applications will be discovered all the time, and new ones enabled by SCOUT itself, autonomous UAV teams requiring little human oversight.  There are also many DoD applications for SCOUT.  Army and Marine small unit leaders using SCOUT could utilize a variety of manned and unmanned organic assets to accomplish a variety of tactical mission tasks, including autonomous exploration of indoor environments.  The proposed techniques are applicable to all four services.  Because the techniques are very general, any tactical ISR, weapons effects, exploration, search, or route-planning application would benefit.",Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Sequencing & Scheduling

The FAA has made new rules that restrict small consumer and commercial UAS from operating beyond line of sight and over 500 feet in altitude but present day UAS controllers do not enforce these rules in hardware, and manual pilots cannot assure compliance with present day small UAS controls.  Furthermore, while many UAS have GPS awareness, they have virtually no awareness of potential collision events.We propose to develop and demonstrate a collision safe and FAA rules enforcing UAS controller technology and make it available widely for consumer UAS licensing for low cost. Small outdoor UAVs for surveillance, small payload transport, and other applications are readily available in the commercial market and are remaking the lower altitude airspace.  These units navigate through direct teleoperation within line of sight of the operator and controller.  Some units also include GPS navigation so that they can accurately station-keep or move to a predetermined location and altitude.

Successful training is required today because more information gathering and decision making must be done manually, which requires training in the fundamental principles and objectives of traffic management. Successful training is required in NextGen due to the increased reliance on automation.Given the multitude of input channels and actors that must be included in an environment for comprehensive training of Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs), it would be too costly and too complex to attempt a full-scale human-in-the-loop simulation or table-top exercise that includes the direct participation of all of these entities. In this research, we will study and prototype effective techniques and technologies to allow virtual and/or constructive simulation of key components of the TMC's environment to achieve a significant step forward in the state of the art of TMC training. The proposed innovation and focus on this research is called the COMprehensive Environment for TM Training by Simulation (COMETTS).NASA's recent research thrust in the Shadow Mode Assessment using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART NAS) provides an important step toward, and platform for, research in simulation-based training for the controller and TMC workforce. Such research holds the potential to significantly improve the transition of technologies from NASA to the FAA and onward to fully successful implementation and acceptance by the end users. This proposed effort will leverage SMART NAS to conduct research, development, prototyping and evaluation of advanced simulation-based TMC training.","As this innovative concept is directly related to the air transportation system, the most appropriate application of the concept and prototype will be further research on operational improvements in the US ATM system. This concept for simulation-based TM training can be applied by NASA across many concepts and technologies to enhance the technology transfer process and end-user acceptance of NASA-developed capabilities. By considering the training process as a core part of the research on advanced ATM decision support tools and procedures, NASA can optimize concepts and capabilities to facilitate training in the operational environment. NASA can use the COMETTS environment to perform research specifically on ATM training associated with new tools, to further improve the FAA's deployment process of new capabilities.In regard to technology transfer of the COMETTS concept to the FAA, Mosaic ATM has provided significant support on numerous projects in the successful transfer of NASA research into the operational inventory of the FAA. Our approach to this technology transfer is to provide support for the transfer process, but to remain within the direction of NASA and the FAA at all times. Using this approach, the research is properly recognized as NASA technology, and the FAA receives in-depth support from an organization that already knows the details of the technology.","The simulation-based training concept described in this proposal can also be used by airlines and other Flight Operators for training of their dispatchers and ATC coordinators. Collaborative Decision Making in ATM requires a detailed understanding of terminology, operations, tools and constraints amongst all participants. Through a broad use of the COMETTS concept across both FAA and Flight Operator participants, CDM can be enhanced.The simulation-based training concept has extensive applicability across numerous other fields including military, emergency response, security, power plant operations, process control, and many other areas. The ability to simulate unstructured interaction with virtual/constructive participants is at the cutting edge of current market needs in many of these fields.

The innovation is intended to aid stakeholders in their analysis of current trends and future concepts, and to show its utility we propose using the toolkit to investigate the Trajectory-Based Operations concept, in particular how the future state of the NAS as predicted by the federated models will be different with TBO than without it.  NASA is interested in enhancing system capacity by using existing aviation assets more efficiently or by expanding capacity through new technology or smart infrastructure planning.  One aspect that is key to this idea is the involvement of the stakeholders, in particular the airlines and the traveling public.  Stakeholder involvement is key to many FAA programs, and stakeholders are often represented during NASA programs.  Increasing stakeholder involvement, and including the traveling public in some of the projects, will help focus NASA research energy towards high-impact areas that are likely to result in earlier concept implementation.In addition, NASA is interested in using existing models more effectively, allowing past investment on models to yield future returns.  The proposed PQL is a large step in that direction. The proposed SWIFT program enables answering  vital questions about existing projects as well as providing the stakeholder involvement to enhance new projects.  The concept is to integrated existing models and insights from social media into a web-based tool that allows stakeholders (including NASA) to ask and answer �what if� questions about various topics easily and conveniently.  The insights provided by the answers will help guide stakeholder decision making.","Within NASA, the immediate application is as a useful user interface for the SMART-NAS system.  Imagine a researcher being able to access SMART-NAS from his desktop and generate a useful result from otherwise complicated and hard-to-use models.  Imagine what a game-changer it would be if FAA analysts could run a system-wide study using the NASA-developed ACES model with a few clicks of a button?  In the meantime, the PQL statements provide a useful common language in which different analysts from different organizations, using both publicly-available as well as proprietary models, can communicate.  A user from the FAA�s Technical Center using their SIMMOD program can generate a PQL statement describing their use of SIMMOD in a way that an analyst at NASA Ames Research Laboratory, who is skilled in ACES but otherwise unaware of SIMMOD, can understand.   In other words, the researcher at the Tech Center has, in a few short lines of text, described completely to the researcher at Ames what s/he is doing with SIMMOD.  The Ames researcher should be able to replicate that analysis within ACES (assuming that the analysis is based on features that are available in both models, even if implemented entirely differently).  In other words, the SWIFT system, with  its embedded PQL, allows communication between researchers to occur in a manner heretofore difficult, if not practically impossible","Outside of NASA, we imagine that desktop analysis engines would become commonplace in the future.  Database systems will be extended to include whole models to populate tables, and predictive querly languages like PQL will become a standard.  In the future, fast-running (or even slow-running) models will be invoked through web-formatted PQL statements much like extant data can be easily accessed from a desktop using web-generated SQL statements.  Data mining, which for now relies on existing data to predict future trends, will be extended to include model-based future predictions to create future data for which future trends will be uncovered.  Data mining both past and predicted future data will be a burgeoning field that will extend the scope and reach of analysts.Is this vision too far-fetched?  That beyond NASA, a system such as PQL will become standard and open the door to new horizons?  We believe that this vision, if anything, is too restrictive.  The explosion of computing technology in the future, with the advent of qbit-based Quantum Computers, as well as the under-exploitation of computer technology today, will provide a new platform on which future analysts will be able to conduct research in ways currently unimaginable.

The proposed WSG would address this shortfall by enabling creation of adjustable and meteorologically realistic scenarios comprised of observed (�actual�) weather and associated forecast uncertainty for relevant NAS impacting weather phenomena. We design the WSG to work with NASA�s SMART NAS to further its mission of delivering an evaluation capability that allows NextGen and beyond-NextGen C&T to be assessed and developed under realistic live/virtual/constructive weather conditions. Finally, this research provides guidance to NASA researchers or other users of testbeds, such as SMART NAS, on how to tailor weather scenarios for maximal effectiveness in experiments and demonstrations.","The core application of this work furthers NASA�s goal to deliver an evaluation capability, critical to the ATM community, allowing full NextGen and beyond concepts to be assessed and developed.

To fully utilize the variety of Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) concepts planned for the NAS, some of which utilize advanced aircraft capabilities for implementing trajectories, an air traffic controller (ATC) must be able to simultaneously support a variety of TBO concepts using different aircraft automation systems to fly the desired trajectory. To accomplish this, the ATC needs automation support to simplify the inherent complexities of using a variety of different TBO concepts and trajectory implementation strategies and provide the controller with the tools needed to execute the desired trajectories, maintain situational awareness at all times, and support off-nominal situations. As depicted in Figure 1, IMMA (Integrated Multi-Mode Automation) provides the automation to simplify the inherent complexities of using multiple TBO concepts by focusing the controller interactions on common core functions (e.g., the initial clearance, compliance monitoring) that all TBO concepts must support. For example, monitoring compliance for an aircraft using speed/path to control delivery time at a metering point is different than monitoring compliance for an aircraft executing Flight Interval Management (FIM) which maintains a time-based spacing interval with another aircraft. Using IMMA, the controller doesn't need to track compliance differently for the two different implementations because the automation accounts for the difference and simply informs him if an aircraft is out of compliance.","The strategy is to use these technologies to create standard products for sale in a standard, packaged form to government and civilian customers domestically and internationally.

Aircraft without ADS-B Out capabilities, ranging from commercial or general aviation aircraft with failed transponders to adversarial aircraft deliberately operating without required transponder equipment, will continue to exist within the general airspace and pose navigational hazards and tactical threats to SUAVs. Nokomis proposes to adapt its ultra-sensitive RF sensor system, called Hiawatha, to provide an unsurpassed trajectory management and anti-collision avoidance capability.  The Hiawatha system provides flight-tested state-of-the-art ultra-sensitive RF detection, identification and geo-location performance.  Nokomis will develop a system-level design of an anti-collision system to aid in trajectory management and safe traffic flow of autonomous UAV operations capable of meeting the SWaP requirements for incorporation into a representative SUAV payload platform.  The RF-based traffic management and anti-collision avoidance system will be capable of monitoring the entire spectral range from 30 MHz to 3 GHz, while providing the necessary detection, identification, and locating abilities from all angles while operating in a non-interfering manner with other potential payloads. Specifically, Nokomis will demonstrate system sensitivity including long range detection and identification of representative UAV emissions, system geo-location and contact bearing capabilities, Doppler-based bearing and range to aircraft, and design Trajectory Prediction and Avoidance System and efficient Traffic Flow System for maintaining aircraft spacing. The Phase I effort proof of concept demonstrations will focus on a demonstration of the Hiawatha airborne system, detection, identification, and location of relevant targets using existing AoA algorithms, and existing source classification algorithms.","In addition to the nearly 102,000 flights in the air across the United States today, in the near future UAVs and drones will start making up increasing segments of the aviation traffic in this country.  Aircraft without ADB-D Out capabilities, including malfunctioning and 'non-cooperative' aircraft will continue to exist within the general airspace and pose navigational hazards and tactical threats to SUAVs.  These 'non-cooperative' aircraft could range from commercial or general aviation aircraft with failed transponders to adversarial aircraft deliberately operating without required transponder equipment.  The ability for UAV to detect, identify, and track these aircraft to ensure safe operation and trajectories in traffic will become of increasing importance. The Hiawatha aircraft anti-collision system will provide a tool for trajectory managements and efficient traffic flow, especially for preventing collisions in case of transmitter failure or non-cooperative traffic.  In addition, the Hiawatha aircraft anti-collision system can aid in operations during approach or in dense traffic areas by providing range and bearing of nearby aircraft to maintain spacing during approach.  The passive nature of the system allows for the detection of non-cooperative or disabled aircraft, while the low cost and small size of the system allow for integration on various platforms.","The Hiawatha anti-collision system can be applied to a variety of UAV and drone applications in which way-finding or obstacle avoidance is necessary.  For drones used in agricultural applications, the system can be adapted to help the aircraft avoid electrical towers and other obstructions near fields.  Further applications can use beacons to provide location points for the tracking and way-finding of UAVs on long distance per-mapped routes beyond user control.  The system can also be reconfigured as a ground-based detection, identification, and tracking system of UAVs or other platforms, providing information about a region of airspace for space operations such as UAV and balloon launches. In addition, the automobile industry is expanding exploration into the development of fully automated vehicles.  This technology represents a distinct capability for potential anti-collision avoidance systems that are not reliant upon inter-vehicle communications.  The automotive semiconductor market represents a potential $37.3 billion market for insertion at approximately the time that this technology would be ready for transition.","Air Transportation & Safety; Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Acquisition (see also Sensors); Data Processing; Electromagnetic; Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

Transportation modes are usually studied separately as if not interacting, although they are intrinsically coupled through passenger transfers; in fact, the failure of one mode disrupts the entire passenger journey.  In this effort, we gather specific passenger location data from individual passengers and aggregate data on passengers, both airside (within the terminal) and landside (within the airport and outside the airport) to build a better estimate for the expected time of departure for an aircraft at an airport gate.

As a result TMIs are often inefficient and there is a lot of variability in their application across similar situations. NASA's 'Similar Days in the National Airspace System (NAS)' research addresses this issue, but, the research tools produce not a single recommended TMI choice but an array of choices, with the final decision again left to the manager's intuition. The proposed SBIR research provides a capability for down-selecting to the most effective TMI choice by developing a what-if analysis functionality for exploring multiple TMI options by realistically simulating NAS-wide operations under the influence of individual TMI options. This what-if analysis capability achieves accurate modeling of NAS traffic flows under uncertainty by creatively integrating two innovations. The first is a traffic flow modeling framework for enabling fast and accurate simulation of individual aircraft transits through the NAS network. This traffic flow modeling framework, which we call the Hybrid Traffic Flow model combines desirable features of trajectory-based models with aggregate traffic flow models to allow fast, near real-time NAS performance evaluation under multiple candidate TMI options. Each option is evaluated under multiple scenarios to capture the whole range of possibilities as per the underlying real world uncertainties,. The second is Bayesian Networks for modeling variations caused by underlying NAS uncertainty factors with explicit encoding of human reasoning behind multiple influencing decisions (e.g., Center MIT restriction impositions, airline cancellations), this enables realistic traffic demand and capacity forecasting for feeding the traffic flow model-based TFM evaluations.","The proposed technology provides NASA with a what-if analysis TFM tool for use in its SASO research program (especially the Autonomous TFM sub-project) for the purpose of evaluating different TFM algorithms of varying levels of autonomy.The proposed what-if analysis capability can also be used by NASA's Airspace Technology Demonstration-3 (ATD-3) researchers as a testing platform for candidate rerouting strategies recommended by rerouting technologies such as MFCR, ORC, and DRAW being developed at NASA. Our what-if analysis capability provides a credible V&V platform for proving the operational feasibility and benefits of the reroutes recommended by NASA's DSTs.The proposed BN-based uncertainty models can be integrated into NASA's SMART-NAS Test Bed to provide a much needed capability to simulate propagation of delays across the NAS network along with the involved human controller actions in multiple Centers, without the need for large number of humans to staff positions in human-in-the-loop simulations.After adding computational speed enhancements via distributed processing, NASA's FACET can be used as the prediction engine for what-if analyses, instead of the Hybrid Traffic Flow model. Thus, the proposed technology could enable a FACET-based TFM what-if analysis DST, the only required capabilities, external to FACET, would be the user interface and BN models, which can be integrated as wrappers around FACET.","A direct post application for the proposed technology is as a what-if analysis DST to be used at the FAA ATCSCC, the FAA Centers and at airline Flight Operation Centers (FOCs) for supporting NAS-wide what-if analyses while planning and negotiating potential TMI actions under a Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) operational paradigm. An ideal FAA enhancement effort, where this proposed TFM DST capability can reside, is the Strategic Flow Management Application (SFMA).Moreover, BNs based prediction of likely future scenarios can be further expanded to other flight-domains in aviation (e.g., surface-terminal-en route traffic prediction, passenger movement prediction, aircraft turnaround time prediction, safety precursor detection under uncertain pilot/controller intent) and outside aviation (e.g., road traffic prediction, aircraft engine health monitoring, monitoring pilot actions for safety assurance).Another application is as a post-operations evaluation tool for the FAA, the airlines, and international ANSPs. In this application the users operate the what-if analysis platform using historical data on the last day of operations to playback the operations by making appropriate manipulations to the actual implemented decisions (e.g., model a GDP with a higher program rate than the one actually implemented) to understand whether they could have managed the operations better as compared to what they actually did.",Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction

Automated software will extract observed light positions to generate aircraft position and attitude data relative to the landing site. This precise navigational guidance will be provided to the pilot or to another control system for use during approach and landing. In Phase-I, the concept will be developed in detail, including selection of lighting sources, operating wavebands, imager technology, and frame rates.

Our focus is on technology development to increase the safety and efficacy of the commercial UAV air transportation system.   The goal is to improve autonomous and safe UAV operations for the first/last 50 feet (and beyond) under diverse weather conditions.In particular we focus on a UAV electronics package to provide the following system solution: a) BVLOS communications; b) track/locate; c) sense/avoid; d) long endurance flight; e) long range command/control; f) remote imaging and g) first person video.   The solution we propose has a reasonably clear path to regulatory approval for spectrum and flight certification.First and foremost, the regulatory agencies need to be satisfied that the industry is safe.   To be safe we need to develop autonomous [and semi-autonomous] concepts that can be scaled into today's airspace operations.   Second, there are still features missing from a whole product solution.   The commercial world invests in productivity improvements - anything less is simply too much work for the potential customer.  We believe that it is possible to design/build a small, relatively inexpensive UAV that can a) reliably and ubiquitously communicate it's location vector; b) avoid obstacles; c) fly for more than 2 hours; d) do hover and horizontal flight; e) be commanded even outside of terrestrial radio line of sight; f) send back targeted high resolution images and g) (maybe) provide first person video.   We suggest in the interest of time-to-market, an initial focus on semi-autonomous UAV flight instead of full autonomy.  Semi-autonomous flight permits a human in the loop for unusual events and extraordinary situations that are difficult to plan (like the first/last 50 feet).  Fully autonomous flight is likely not worth that substantial incremental investment.","There are many applications for Government use of the BVLOS technology.   We outline just a few.Secret Service:The movement of the President is a very complex operation.   The process becomes quite challenging when the President moves in the public space as it is difficult to control all access.   UAV's can be a meaningful advance to this problem.   It would be quite valuable to have UAV's cross the sky at low altitude above the public space to provide real-time, actionable visibility of activity on the ground below.Environmental:   NOAA and the Department of the Interior would like to send UAV's into rural spaces to understand better weather, environmental changes and wildlife count.   UAV's provide a wonderful vehicle for this research as the landmass is enormous and access is often limited.Border Security:   Unauthorized movement around any border can be inexpensively patrolled by BVLOS flights.Transportation Infrastructure:Buildings, bridges, roadways' can be explored and imaged at distance via BVLOS UAV's.Search & Rescue:A BVLOS UAV can search far more area, faster and cheaper than by humans.","There are many applications for commercial use of the BVLOS technology.   We outline just a few.Infrastructure Inspection:   There are many large asset-based operations [rail, pipeline, refinery...] in which periodic observations are mandated by statute.   These assets need to be inspected regularly.Many of these companies have thousands to tens of thousands of miles that are today inspected monthly by manned aircraft.This inspection can be done far less expensively by UAV's.  But, the savings cannot begin until we make BVLOS flight safe and approved.Videography:A UAV is a valuable new platform for capturing scenes in movies and real-time news.Agriculture:A UAV will be an important asset for pest control, monitoring plant health and vegetation efficiency.The UAV can fly at low altitude over the farm and provide real-time agricultural health reports (which due to their ease and periodicity) become quite actionable.Mapping:   A UAV can be used for mapping of areas that are challenging to access.Package Delivery:   UAV's can provide quick and expedient delivery of small packages.","Air Transportation & Safety; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Coding & Compression; Image Capture (Stills/Motion); Intelligence; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Man-Machine Interaction; Perception/Vision; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

This service addresses the gap of HITL testing that is currently limited to small regions of airspace and few airports with a small number of controllers and pseudo-pilots.

Agents are defined as either human, computational, or hardware that can act on information.  Information that can flow to an agent is filtered based on priority.  This protects human agents from information glut and information overload and reduces bandwidth requirements on communications channels.  Agents react to the presented information by accepting it, discounting it, or querying the system for more information.  All decisions and actions are recorded and modeled by the system in order to verify correct and efficient processing of information.The proposed system will operate independently of flight deck systems but will have access to required information sources.  It will not impose an additional monitoring responsibility on the flight crew except for when safety issues surface.  At that point, the flight crew's attention is captured and then predefined, prioritized information is presented in a selected format.The proposed system consists of the major software components: the Metadata Workbench, the Condition Monitor, and the Notification Terminal.  The Metadata Workbench is used to identify all agents, roles, conditions of interest which trigger information flows, and information with associated context and priority.  The notification mechanism, the information flow's destination, and the format for reporting information along with justification is also defined by the workbench.  Condition monitors serve as the interface between information-producing systems and notification terminals.  Conditions of interest along with all information metadata are deployed to the condition monitors.  The notification terminal receives prioritized information and presents the information in the predefined format.","Monitoring high-reliability systems where human agents must be in-the-loop to handle events.  High-reliability systems are rarely expected to experience adverse events.  However, when the events do occur, information overload can result.  The human operator must be able to come up to speed on the situation as quickly as possible without being overloaded.  The decisions and responses may not be optimal or may even be deficient.  The proposed system will prevent information overload by presenting the most important information first.  The proposed system can also monitor operator responses and compare them to expected behaviors.Decision support in an environment where information glut exists.  The availability of information is increasing at an exponential rate.  The proposed system can filter this information by performing such tasks as assigning priorities, coordinating information flows, and defining how information is presented.  The proposed system can also integrate information from multiple sources, repackage the information, and present the information in a more abstract form.  It also allows linking of information producers with information consumers in a uniform, integrated manner.Monitoring rogue behavior.  Models of expected behavior can be compared with agent actions.  Actions are monitored in the context of an explicit intent consistent with all agents.

As NASA, FAA, and industry introduce new technologies, concepts, and vehicles into a growing and evolving national airspace system (NAS), the need for monitoring of an increasingly complex, congested, and more automated system becomes greater. RSSA will develop risk models, methods, computational solutions, and prototype monitoring systems to move risk identification and mitigation from weeks and months to real-time.The preliminary RSSA technology roadmap identifies the need for real-time NAS-wide status monitoring but does not describe how this information would be provided or used to assess real-time changes in safety risk. Our proposal aims to demonstrate how to accomplish those objectives and quantify risk for normal safe operations and degraded states, thereby accelerating RSSA milestones. Our approach enables real-time estimates of NAS risk and can also provide valuable insight into assessments of new technologies and procedures. FAA interest in this capability offers the potential for an FAA deployment platform by integrating the state-dependent risk models with an existing FAA safety analysis and monitoring tool, the Integrated Safety Assessment Model (ISAM).","The NASA aeronautics mission directorate (ARMD) has defined a set of six thrust areas, with real-time system-wide safety assurance (RSAA) as one of the new additions in 2014. This thrust area was added in recognition of the need to demonstrate the safety of air traffic technologies developed by ARMD, during demonstration and test as well as during normal NAS operations. The FAA has tried to develop a forward-looking, prognostic safety analysis capability for many years with limited success. Our concept offers a strong start to the RSSA need to implement tools to provide for state awareness for all elements of the NAS. We go much further by integrating real-time safety monitoring with the state awareness capability. In addition, our concept, when coupled with analytical efforts currently underway, accelerates the target of providing analytical insight from weeks to days in the 2025 timeframe.Our concept applies to the following ARMD thrust objectives for RSSA:� Accelerate the detection and prognosis of systemwide safety threats � Substantially improve the ability to gain insights and develop mitigations from the growing amount of available aviation system data� Dramatically improve safety assurance within the next decade, by reducing the time to analyze, identify, and mitigate safety risks from what can now take months down to days","With its System Safety Management Transformation program, the FAA since 2010 has tried to develop models to analyze the safety impact of NextGen and move toward real-time safety assessment. One of their identified gaps has been the lack of infrastructure status and the ability to incorporate that information into their risk models. Our model responds directly to that requirement. Our approach builds on current and planned FAA availability and maintenance management systems, thereby minimizing additional investments by either NASA or FAA.",Air Transportation & Safety; Analytical Methods

It is helpful to imagine NAS as a system of systems where each system loosely interacts with the other. Under this paradigm, an aircraft is a system, so is an airline and as is an airport. Automating safety assurance for each of these systems would involve monitoring an array of sensors each with a different time cycle and reporting characteristics and processing enormous amounts of data. Given the complexing of NAS, it is unlikely that any one tool could provide a solution. Instead, a number of tools each monitoring a smaller, more manageable part of the NAS, all the while sharing information with each other, seem more promising. In the future these tools would ensure airborne separation assurance, track Air Traffic Control (ATC) guidance conformance and ensure safe ground operations. DAAS is an architecture to support these very needs. It forms the basis of a network of smaller, more focused, safety assurance tools that share information and data through a central Big Data repository that is mined using advanced machine learning algorithms.","Researchers at NASA will find the tool useful for exploration of new concepts. DAAS will allow them to experiment with different concepts of operations for interval management, fuel management, route planning, conflict avoidance and mitigation planning, and separation standards. NASA could couple the tool with advanced NAS-wide simulations platforms like SMART NAS to evaluate other technologies in presence of automated separation assurance. The researchers could use this tool to investigate minimum aircraft performance requirements to ensure safe operations. Finally, a network of DAAS based tools could provide the basis for investigating the risks in complete automation of safety.",DAAS can be used by airlines to plan the best routes in presence of congestion by using it to answer what-if scenarios.

ARCA builds on recent advances in probabilistic (Bayesian) network modeling and the rapid expansion of big data capabilities. The application of ARCA that we propose to develop, ARCA-A, performs safety analyses of approach clearances based on multiple sources of relevant real-time data, such as real-time aircraft data, weather data, past and current operations data, and crew data. ARCA-A provides intelligent risk assessment of clearances over the lifetime of the operation, from planning to clearance delivery. As it matures, ARCA can play a range of roles at increasing levels of autonomy and authority. Initially, once it has trained to the level of generating insight, it can be used to identify hot spots in the NAS or in a region (specific areas, procedures, aircraft types, or times of day when risks increase) on a daily or weekly review basis. Next, it could be deployed to air traffic managers, dispatchers, or other users with real-time operational oversight. With further integration, it could optionally display real-time informational warnings on ATC displays, flight displays, or dispatcher screens. Eventually, ARCA could play a foundational role in automated clearance selection and delivery. For research purposes, in this project we propose to design and begin development of a specific ARCA-A application. The primary focus of the research will be core algorithms, information integration, performance, and feasibility. ARCA is a promising new concept that represents a major step forward in aviation safety from static, forensic, manual methods toward real-time, prognostic, automated capabilities, the end result of which will be safer and more efficient operations.","The Automated Real-Time Clearance Analyzer (ARCA) could be a Real-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance (RSSA) component in NASA's SMART-NAS project within the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (ASOP). ARCA could also be an element of future NASA concept systems (simulations, prototypes, research studies) for ATC, ATM, flight decks, and/or flight operations centers. ARCA could evolve into any or all of the following: a decision support tool for controllers or pilots, a real-time monitor for flight dispatchers, or an aggregator for useful periodic reporting (by airport, runway, time period, etc.). SBIR Phase I focuses on the essential design and proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II will create a working prototype capability incorporating multiple sources into a real-time analysis of a potential approach clearance. This prototype and derivatives of it could be instrumental to NASA RSSA research, exploring both real-time safety concepts in general as well as specific decision support automation. Beyond core algorithm research and development, we envision ARCA expanding its reach into real-time information access using big data technology and becoming integrated into end-user systems. We expect ARCA capabilities to be synergistic with NASA research in these areas.","Potential commercial applications of the Automated Real-Time Clearance Analyzer (ARCA) include future systems for Fleet Operators, ANSPs (such as the FAA), and the flight deck. Fleet operators have a unique and powerful interest in operational safety. ARCA-A technology would give them a tool to continuously analyze approach procedures and the associated risk levels. This in turn can inform very impactful decisions, such as what procedures are planned, requested by pilots, and supported by the operators. In the near/mid-term,ARCA could give operators or ANSPs an initial capability to start assessing, flagging and tracking risk factors associated with the approach clearance. The FAA could start looking at trends NAS-wide in approach clearance risks (e.g. what areas and procedures are highest/lowest risk) and evaluate ARCA technology as part of ATM/ATC real-time decision support tools. ARCA could also be adapted to the flight deck to intelligently assist pilots. In the far-term picture, ARCA lays the foundation for approach clearance automation (e.g. automation generates and delivers context-appropriate approach clearances with human supervision). As real-time safety is a concern for all aviation stakeholders, ARCA capabilities are relevant to multiple future commercial applications.",Air Transportation & Safety; Data Fusion; Data Processing

We noticed that simply wetting the material, mixing it thoroughly, and drying it (in vacuum or air) at ambient temperature causes it to bond into solid, very hard rock, and we could control the hardness by the amount of water mixed into it before drying. On Earth when making bricks from clay we need to fire them in a kiln at temperatures as high as 1300⁰C to make them hard. Apparently simple air or vacuum drying of these minerals can substitute for the kiln effectively, making it easily hard enough for construction in the space environment.Carbonaceous asteroids are not the only place in space where clayey regolith can be used for construction. Recently, scientists have shown that Mars has abundant clay deposits all over the globe.  The minerals on Phobos appear similar to those in a certain type of carbonaceous asteroid including phyllosilicates (the type of minerals that include clays), so apparently Phobos may have abundant clay minerals, too. This suggests construction by low-temperature vacuum drying is possible on those bodies. It is not possible on the Moon, however, as there are no phyllosilicates on the Moon.","It is important to develop methods for construction in space with local materials, because this reduces the cost of space exploration, provides material for spares and repairs, and makes missions more flexible and effective. The path to crewed Mars expeditions is particularly mass intensive, and a barrier that could be lowered through use of space resources.Structures made from regolith will provide radiation shielding for the crew while working on the Martian surface or Phobos, as well as micrometeoroid shielding for the habitat module, and key thermal insulation. In addition, clayey regolith on asteroids or Phobos can be converted into heat shields for re-entry into Mars' or Earth's atmosphere. Clayey regolith on Mars can be converted into landing pads to enable many-ton, human-tended landers to descend safely. It can be made into pavers or slabs for dust-free work zones on Phobos or Mars, or for roads on Mars, where ISRU operations are occurring. An asteroid can be converted into a Mars Cycler spacecraft by 3D printing with its bulk mass.","DSI is developing end-to-end technology pathways for prospecting, mining, and processing asteroid and other space resources into finished products, primarily to serve in-space markets.  Current plans envision HarvestorsTM loaded with NEA resources entering a High Elliptical Earth Orbit (HEEO) with its perigee above geosynchronous orbit where additional processing would be conducted.  While HEEO provides good access to geosynchronous orbit, the use of heat shields fabricated from space resources to enable aerobraking down to low Earth orbit would be an efficient alternative to expending significant propellant for the orbit change. Asteroid mining will focus primarily on the iron, nickel, chromium and cobalt that will be utilized for in-space applications. However, delivery to terrestrial markets of by-products such as platinum group metals may become more profitable if entry heat shields are made from asteroid regolith. There are also terrestrial opportunities for this technology. A 3D printing architecture that turns unavoidable clay shrinkage into an asset while drying makes 3D printing with clayey terrestrial regolith a viable technology. This will have commercial application in regions where cement is expensive or not locally available.",In Situ Manufacturing; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Resource Extraction

Bulk or modified regolith can be combined with a binder as a concrete aggregate to form a construction material that can be extruded into bricks or slabs for structures, shelters, landing pads, roads, and shielding. With this goal in mind, researchers at Luna have identified a polymer concrete formulation based on urea-formaldehyde (UF) that can be pressed into high compressive strength interlocking bricks suitable for construction. Luna�s binder system can also be produced in-situ from feed gases identified by NASA (N2, H2, CO2) while generating O2 and water.

Instead of paying to move each spare part, structure support, radiation shield and utensil (along with a wide range of other products) from Earth to Mars extraterrestrial in-situ resources (sunlight, CO2 and H2O) can be converted into polyethylene.  A wide range of products including water bottles, thin films, bags, high pressure pipe and at almost any shape could be produced using additive manufacturing.  Polyethylene is also a candidate for radiation shielding due to its high hydrogen content.TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) proposes to develop a plastics manufacturing plant via in situ resource utilization.  The plant consists of (1) a solar powered gas generation system to produce CO and H2 from indigenous CO2 and H2O, (2) a micro-channel olefin synthesis reactor that converts the synthesis gas (CO and H2) to light olefins, (3) a polyethylene synthesis reactor, (4) a reformer for processing unreacted gases and by-products back into more synthesis gas feedstock.   In Phase I, we will focus on demonstrating the viability of two of the key sub-systems: (1) testing a proprietary TDA catalyst in a micro-channel syngas-to-olefins reactor at small scale, and (2) refining a small scale polyethylene synthesis system that converts the range of products from the olefin synthesis process into polyethylene and other co-polymers.  We will design a 5 kg/day polyethylene production plant, using lab data and performance specifications provided for existing systems such as the electro-chemical CO2 reduction to CO, hydrolysis for conversion of H2O to H2, and reformer technology for converting unreacted gases back to synthesis gas.  Phase I will produce a detailed design of this system, including an estimate of the weight and volume.","The mechanical properties of the polyethylene can be tuned by selecting the catalyst and process conditions to provide feedstocks suitable for a wide variety of products via additive manufacturing, including radiation shielding, structures for habitat or infrastructure, thin films, tubing, fittings, housewares and many others.  Since polyethylene is a thermoplastic, scraps and pieces at the end of their lifecycle can be shredded and re-melted for reuse in the additive manufacturing equipment.  Using in situ resources to make these plastics products will significantly reduce the launch weight and cost for missions to the Moon and planets.","The proposed synthesis gas-to-olefins process will find immediate industrial use.  Polyethylene is one of the most produced chemicals with single plant producing as much as 2 billion pounds/year.  The production of ethylene, which is the feedstock to these plants, from synthesis gas rather than naphtha or ethane cracking provides a cost-effective alternative (i.e., the synthesis gas can be generated by well-established natural gas reforming), allowing low cost abundant domestic natural gas to be used as a feedstock to a value added chemical.","In Situ Manufacturing; Polymers; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

Carbothermal reduction also co-produces oxygen at yields on the order of 20 percent of regolith feed mass when integrating downstream processes to recover and recycle carbon. Many of the EMP products can be prepared in a fashion suitable for casting or additive manufacture methods and have broad application in support of advanced human space exploration. The EMP methods are based on minimal reliance on Earth-based consumables; nearly all of the gases and reagents required for processing can be manufactured from Mars in-situ resources or can be recovered and recycled for applications using Moon or asteroid resources.","The primary application of EMP is for production of iron, silicon, and magnesium metals as well as refractory metal oxides and byproducts including phosphors and oxygen from Mars, Moon, or asteroid in-situ resources for manufacturing in support of advanced human space exploration. The EMP product suite includes many useful materials that will expand exploration and colonization capabilities while substantially reducing the costs and risks of bringing supplies from Earth. Many EMP product streams are suitable for use in advanced casting or additive manufacturing methods to allow for efficient use of resources.","One potential terrestrial EMP application is the production of high-grade silicon metal or ferrosilicon. The hydrogen-enhanced carbon monoxide disproportionation method employed in the EMP system enables high rates of carbon deposition onto pure silica in the absence of a metal catalyst. Direct carbon deposition from CO generated during carbothermal reduction integrated with RWGS-electrolysis modules would reduce the purchase of carbon for the process while significantly reducing overall carbon emissions compared to current practice. In a closed-loop system including reverse water gas shift-electrolysis, silicon or ferrosilicon manufacturing could be accomplished with virtually no carbon emissions.The EMP techniques have additional potential for the processing of lower-grade ores and feed stocks including residues and wastes. As higher-grade ores on Earth are more-difficult to find and mine, feed costs for existing technologies rise.

In support of future habitation activities on Mars, it is desired to process this high Martian concentration of carbon dioxide to ethylene, a chemical precursor that can be used to subsequently produce plastics including polyethylene, propylene, and polypropylene for building structures. Additionally, ethylene can be readily converted to ethanol and subsequently to sugar, nutrients that support biohabitation. Toward this goal, Reactive Innovations, LLC proposes to develop an electrochemical micro-channel reactor that can convert carbon dioxide to ethylene. The modular architecture of the micro-channel reactor enables the system to be scaled to increase throughput while the small feature sizes of the reactor enhance thermal and mass transfer processes increasing the ethylene yield. During this Phase I program, the electrochemical reactions will be optimized to convert CO2 to ethylene maximizing the yield and rate. Single channel and multiple micro-channels will be produced using a new fabrication process that produces channels on the order of 100 microns wide. Characterization of the micro-channel reactor operating conditions will be conducted while producing ethylene to aid in scaling the process to larger production rates. Conversion of ethylene to polyethylene plastic will subsequently be demonstrated.","Mars is the ultimate destination of NASA's human exploration program where the goal of using resources at the site of exploration will reduce launch mass and cost, and enable new missions not possible otherwise. Processing the carbon dioxide to ethylene in a compact modular micro-channel reactor will provide a valuable chemical that can further be used to produce habitat structures and equipment as well as ethanol and sugar nutrients for life support.","The conversion of carbon dioxide to ethylene can help reduce the concentration of this green house gas on earth while providing a valuable chemical feedstock.

Successful completion of these experiments and subsequent scaling and process refinement tasks will result in an updated ISP3 process design for Phase 2, raising the TRL of ISP3 from TRL 2 to TRL3.

This will raise the system TRL to 5.","In addition to long-term applications of ISP3 for producing HDPE for manned missions and colonies on places like Mars and Venus, Altius and its partners have developed a concept for demonstrating the ISP3 system on the International Space Station, for producing limited quantities of HDPE filament for the Made In Space Additive Manufacturing Facility, leveraging waste materials already on-board the ISS. This waste material source would likely be available on most other crew-tended space facilities, enabling the production of HDPE filaments anywhere humans go in the Solar System.","Three potential Non-NASA applications for ISP3 are:1- Production of HDPE on non-NASA space facilities, such as those planned by Bigelow Aerospace.2- Production of small quantities of HDPE for 3D printers on military submarines.3- Production of small quantities of HDPE for 3D printers using natural gas feedstocks at remote locations such as military forward operating bases, and research facilities in remote regions such as Antarctica.",In Situ Manufacturing; Lasers (Machining/Materials Processing); Polymers; Process Monitoring & Control; Processing Methods

SAS will provide NASA with an analysis of the historic and current trending of the launch vehicle to ground and launch vehicle to payload interfaces.  SAS will accomplish this by leveraging its extensive knowledge of domestic and foreign launch vehicles (traditional and ?new space?) and their associated launch sites.  In leveraging this data, SAS will identify candidates for possible standardization, and where candidates are not available, will develop preliminary concepts for considerations of becoming standards.  As part of the preparation for this effort, SAS has engaged a robotic and autonomy control company (outside the space industry) to advise SAS on new innovative autonomy technology and its applications for developing non-standard approaches to processing and operating spaceflight vehicles.","In the space industry, development of common interfaces and modularity allows the development of servicing systems for the launch vehicles and payloads to be outside the confines of their respective designs and facilities.  This has the potential of producing a large economic value.  This development moves such systems upstream in the process and allows the creation of support service companies focused on servicing the space industry.As terrestrial development continues, extraterrestrial operations benefit.  In developing the architecture for off-planet operations, this modularity (and its robotic connectivity) allows these extraterrestrial modules to be similar to their terrestrial counterparts and to operate remotely, or even autonomously.","In the chemical industry, SAS has identified certain segments suffering similar circumstances related to inconsistent interfaces.  With the space industry closely resembling the chemical industry (especially with fluid commodities), the chemical industry can also benefit from this effort.Another industry that could benefit from this effort is the energy industry.  There are many similarities with the space industry, especially when considering the severe environments and high-risk ventures involved.  We have identified aspects of this industry having similar issues when systems interface with one another.The electric car industry is becoming viable and as such, it is ripe for developing standard interfaces as it matures.  This industry has yet to determine the interface requirements for recharging all electric vehicles in a common manner.  Similar to the space industry, they are in a parochial stage where the driver must use equipment produced by the builder of the electric automobile.",Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Deployment; Launch Engine/Booster; Machines/Mechanical Subsystems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Structures; Surface Propulsion

A significant portion of the pre-launch processing involves integration with other flight systems, general ground support equipment, and test equipment.  The process of interfacing this equipment has historically been a source of numerous delays and unplanned work prior to launch.  The proliferation of different interface types, designs, and manufacturers only serves to increase the difficulties associated with pre-launch integration and testing.The development and adoption of improved, standardized interfaces holds the potential of reducing the cost and complexity of the testing and launch processing processes and could provide eventual benefits to autonomous servicing in future space missions.  In-space and surface servicing of multiple types of spacecraft becomes more feasible if a common interface approach can be developed and widely adopted.In 2012, METECS developed the mREST Architecture and Interface Specification  and began developing software prototypes that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the standard for the automation of testing in flight laboratories at the NASA/Johnson Space Center.  This specification and the associated software became collectively known simply as ""mREST"".The proposed innovation is to expand on the mREST foundational work to design an interface standard that can be utilized to solve the issues associated with test and launch operations.  This will be accomplished by first doing research into the specific issues that typically arise during the pre-launch process and identifying areas where the existing mREST specification should be expanded and/or refined.","The mREST interface specification has the potential to greatly enhance existing flight test and processing capabilities at NASA.  Any facility which requires integration and testing of hardware and/or software elements would benefit.  In addition, development of web-based user interfaces would be streamlined for any mREST element or system.   Systems that utilize common NASA components with existing web-based interfaces such as LabVIEW, the Trick Simulation Environment, and/or EDGE graphics have a greater initial potential for implementation.

X-ray imaging of material flows in detonation fronts and combustion through protective housings has many important aerospace, industrial and defense implications. First HyperV will design, construct and test, in conjunction with UAH, a single fiber coupled X-ray scintillator pixel. Silicon Photo-multipliers will be investigated to maximize channel properties for the accepted cost and desired scalability. Next we will develope an X-ray imager of at least 16 pixels for observing X-ray backlit material flows based off of the single channel experiments. A camera performance of at least 2500 frames at 10 Megaframes per second with at least 12-16 bits per pixel will be targeted. X-ray emission from backlighter will be shone through a rocket motor and projected onto a scintillator. The optical emission from the scintillator is then observed by a fiber imaging grid. The imaging grid would then couple light to a bank of amplified SiPM pixels with integrated analog gain and data acquisition.  HyperV has already demonstrated as part of previous work a two clock domain technique for using slow cheap micro-controllers to manage high time resolution data acquisition over long record-length with a low cost digital backend. HyperV has also demonstrated that this back end can be used to observe SiPM as well as photodiode detectors.  We propose now to extend these techniques observe X-ray induced emission of scintillator materials for performing time resolved imaging of X-rays. This small scale imager would then be used to observe material flows in rocket motors in the UAH X-ray laboratory as a demonstration of the diagnostics capability.","Rocket Motor Design:X-ray imaging can penitrate smoke and protective casings, allowing the combustion of propellants and exhaust plumes inside a rocket-motor to be imaged. High time resolution imaging of X-ray back-lit events can provide critical insight into the rocket motor dynamics. Investigation of Turbulence: For stochastic events, or dynamic events in devices too large to accumulate event evolution over many shots, the development of a deep record length imaging system for X-ray collection would be a huge advantage over single shot and burst shot imaging systems presently employed. Harsh Environment Testing: By minimizing the complexity of the imaging head, a replaceable, irradiateable imager head could be constructed  for deployment in harsh environments. Filtered X-ray Imaging:  Adding energy bandpass filtering only increases the flexibility and power of this diagnostic. Time Resolved X-ray Spectroscopy: By observing the output of an X-ray spectrometer it may be possible to record time resolved X-ray spectroscopy","Combustion: X-ray information on the evolution of fast material flows that previously had to be aggregated over many shots, will now be recorded in a single shot. This allows shot-to-shot variant dynamics like turbulence and turbulent mixing to be resolved, and reduces the resources required, especially in large devices where shots are at a premium. Plasma Physics: X-ray imaging is important to plasma physics. Imaging of fast events in Z-pinches and implosions is absolutely vital to achieving the goals of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF).Tomography: A low cost high time resolution camera allows 4-D X-ray tomography, which would be an advance in observing complex flow evolutions in nozzles, manifolds, and detonation fronts.Fast Material Augmentation: This is a general tool for time resolved X-ray imaging of fast material augmentation or displacement. Laser sintering, deformation, and detonation flows could be resolved, allowing for optimization of these industrial applications.",Detectors (see also Sensors); Filtering; Fuels/Propellants; Image Analysis; Image Processing; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Radiography; Spacecraft Main Engine; X-rays/Gamma Rays

The development of advanced ground test technology components and systems that are capable of enhancing environment simulation, minimizing program test time, cost and risk and meeting environmental and safety regulations is focused on near-term products that augment existing state-of-the-art propulsion system test facilities. Thus improved capabilities to model and predict component behavior in harsh ground test environments are needed for enhanced facility design. In particular, components such as valves, check valves and chokes that are subjected to high pressure, high flow rate cryogenic environments will experience potentially damaging two phase flow effects such as cavitation. Robust cryogenic cavitation models for real fluids equations of state in the presence of mixed supersonic/subsonic flows are demonstrated to deal with poor solution convergence and numerical instabilities. The proposed innovation leverages modifications to the local preconditioning formulation of the Roe flux with a barotropic equation of state and uses a representative component flow problem to demonstrate the effectiveness of enhanced modifications to the cryogenic liquid tabular equation of state. Instabilities arising from the single temperature assumption in the two phase mixture equation of state, which must often be evaluated by extrapolating data too far from the saturation curve, are eliminated with a nonlinear temperature limiter that precludes non-physical behavior, such as imaginary mixture sound speeds. The result is an efficient, robust cryogenic cavitation model suitable for application to propulsion systems ground test facility component design and analysis efforts.","This technology will provide NASA with an efficient, robust cryogenic cavitation modeling and prediction tool suitable for application to propulsion systems ground test facility component design and analysis.  The research product will provide enabling engineering and scientific technologies to predict complex cryogenic flow problems, reduce ground test facility costs and overall system risk while increasing test productivity.  Potential enhancements include improved treatment of evaporation and condensation rates, turbulence/cavitation interaction modeling, liquid/vapor thermal interface effects, variable transport properties, expanded thermodynamic databases and extended model validation.  The proposed cavitation modeling tool is also applicable to hydrogen inducers, impellers and pumps operating at high vapor fraction.","The growing trend toward coupled multi-physics analyses is opening significant new markets as more difficult problems can be addressed using advanced computational techniques.  The ability to robustly model complex cryogenic flows with cavitation will allow the commercial aerospace and defense industries to improve design and development of new products and streamline ground testing.  Our analysis software can also be applied to marine propellers, boiler feed pumps and refrigerant systems.  The basic architecture of the modeling framework can remain the same while new plug-in modules are developed to address different physics and design requirements.","Actuators & Motors; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

When a rocket motor/engine is ignited at low altitude its convergent/divergent nozzle experiences significant impulses across the nozzle; these impulses are known as ""ignition side loads"" (ISL).  The ISL duration ranges from a few tenths of a second for small nozzles, to as long as several seconds for very large nozzles.  These large-amplitude ISLs are transient, chaotic, and develop during the chamber pressure rise when the over-expanded nozzle is partially empty. The ISL peak amplitude in large rockets can be as high as 70% of the nominal thrust.  The ISL has caused problems in most rocket engine development programs, from pulling off engines from gimbals during their testing, to causing cooling engine lines cracks, knocking off instrumentation, and a large variety of other ISL related issues.  ISLs are also experienced during hot staging of launchers and missiles. The current models for predicting ISLs result in very conservative estimates for the TVC actuators and nozzle throat structures, and impact negatively on development schedule, cost, and engine weight.The proposed work for Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of eliminating for the first time the ISL by developing a set of methods and procedures that will show by CFD simulation how to effectively reduce the ISL to a negligible level.  The innovation consists of a set of devices installed precisely within the nozzle that stabilize the flow during the start up pressure rise and thus eliminate the ISL.  These inserts are present ONLY during the brief period of rocket ignition and chamber pressure ramp-up.  Once the rocket chamber reaches the nominal pressure in a short time, they ablate away and the nozzle configuration geometry returns to the intended high performance design.  By implementing this innovation, the ISL risk is eliminated altogether, thus greatly simplifying engine/motor development.","This program has been organized assuming that the first user of this technology will be solid rocket motor boosters and engines used in a launcher such as Orion, but its results can be applied without much additional effort to other liquid propellant engines and motors they are ignited at low altitude from Earth.ASEG has already probed the market and the interest of aerospace agencies in eliminating the ignition SL, and has had a very favorable response.  This program has been organized assuming that the first user of this technology will be in NASA engines, but its results can be applied without much additional effort to other liquid propellant engines, as well as solid rocket motor boosters.  During the feasibility demonstration Phase I, Government agencies and propulsion prime contractors will be approached to brief them on the technology under development and the on-going results.  A potential partner will be identified to join the program in Phase II, when the tools for the design and implantation of the inserts will be developed and tested in the simulator.  In Phase III, the industrial partner will assist ASEG in testing the technology as a piggy back to an on-going engine development program.  This industrial partner could be hopefully a NASA testing facility, a prime, or a combination of both.An agreement between Phase III partner and ASEG will be arranged for design of the inserts, their fabrication, and licensing to other industrial firms.","Commercial SectorElimination of SLs on launch vehicles.  The SL elimination devices can be retrofit.  They can be installed on boosters, as well as on launchers using cryogenic propellants.

The method is laser-based and has the potential for standoff distances in the tens of meters, so optical components can be a safe distance from the hot gases. The diagnostic does not require flow seeding, works over the full temperature range, and covers the full range of velocities of a typical rocket engine. The method, hydroxyl tagging velocimetry (HTV), has already been successfully demonstrated on a small rocket engine. The proposed effort will adapt this technique to large engines by minimizing the effects of beam attenuation and beam steering due to turbulence and developing a robust beam delivery and detection system. Because OH molecules survive at high temperatures for appreciable lifetimes, it is anticipated that the HTV technique will work in even the highest temperature rocket plumes. The proposed diagnostic will provide measurements not obtainable by current methods and will enable experimental data that can be used for validating computer models of rocket engine performance.","NASA?s goals of returning humans to the Moon and sending humans to Mars and beyond present exciting challenges that will require significant advancements in propulsion technology.

This novel imaging system will include a compact, single camera/single focal plane array camera and end-to-end image processing software to produce, high quality, low noise, high-speed video not currently possible with today's technology. The compact cameras will be compatible with existing SSC camera housing, as all acquired imagery will be stored off-camera to prevent loss of information in the event of a mishap. The system will be able to record entire test sequences at 250 fps lasting up to 45 minutes. Most importantly, the system will produce XHDR (>120 dB dynamic range) HD format imagery so that relatively dark test cell infrastructure and test article hardware will be visible alongside exhaust plumes that may also contain hot molten debris with brightness levels approaching that of the sun. Because the imagery will be calibrated, the system will also provide engineering information such as color temperature and particle trajectory velocities. Geometric calibration will enable multiple properly positioned cameras to provide accurate 3-D XHDR image products. Rocket engine certification ground testing requires clear visual high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for NASA during rocket engine certification ground testing. This need is particularly true in the event of a mishap, when investigations into the underlying cause ensue. The cameras in use today at SSC have significant limitations including plume saturation, rolling shutter image wobble, camera geometric distortion, and no off-board storage, which makes it nearly impossible, in catastrophic situations that result in the loss of a camera, to obtain critical information.","Compact, color, high-speed, extreme high dynamic range (Color-XHDR) video recording that can produce calibrated, engineering-grade video to accurately record high energy events, such as rocket motor firings, at close range, without image saturation will have significant value to NASA SSC.

In addition to the facility at SSC, other NASA Rocket Propulsion Test (RPT) and NASA launch facilities namely Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Glenn Research Center (GRC) Plum Brook Station and White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) will benefit by using this technology. This technology can also be incorporated into other NASA missions including both terrestrial and planetary exploration. Since, for example, there is relatively no atmosphere on Mars, there is limited diffuse scattering and dark shadows become visually darker.  This effect increases the dynamic range of the scene making it an ideal target application for our technology. Similarly, our technology could be used to uncover the mysteries surrounding the extremely bright saturated spots captured by NASA?s Dawn mission on the dwarf planet Ceres.","Compact, color, high-speed, extreme high dynamic range (Color-XHDR) video recordings that can produce calibrated, engineering-grade information to accurately record high energy events, such as rocket motor firings, at close range, without image saturation will have significant value to defense-based facilities that actively test propulsion systems and perform launches. These include the USAF Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base as well as Vandenberg Air Force Base.

In addition to rocket propulsion, other application areas that would benefit from our imaging technology including robotic welding and 3-D metal printing where bright-dark contrast become extreme.Another potential application is small area UAV remote sensing and mobile mapping. Our compact technology approach will enable our imaging systems to be flown on small UAVs. We have spoken to imaging and mapping companies developing technology for strip mining where deep shadows produce extreme contrast. Routinely mapping mining areas is important for managing a site and to maintain safety. Mobile mapping from moving ground vehicles is limited by the dark shadows produced in many landscapes.

Improved TA tools that can better manage and visualize TA results have the potential to mitigate these shortcomings. Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate a system for Task Analysis Data Processing and Enhanced Representations (TAPER). TAPER will: (1) manage TA data through a modern web service-based data management framework that enables scalable storage, querying, and access to TA data between teams; (2) enable import and export of TA data that supports multiple forms of model development, including cognitive simulation, through a model representation engine; and (3) provide visualizations of TA data models tailored to the unique information needs of different users. Meeting these requirements will dramatically improve TA-supported collaborative design and development in large-scale engineering efforts.","We expect the full-scope Task Analysis Data Processing and Enhanced Representations (TAPER) to have immediate and tangible benefit for NASA.

We will extend through a representative and targeted Requirements Analysis of the NASA Task Analysis process by incorporating the innovations developed under TAPER. Implementing these tools will enable scientists conducting TAs, engineers performing system design, and operations specialists developing procedures throughout the engineering process. TAPER's data management and model import services will also enable more effective testing and sharing of TA models when combined with novel TA model visualizations that support scientists, engineers, and operations specialists.

However, long duration missions present numerous risks to crew health and performance. Human exploration missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) will present additional challenges. These missions will require technology solutions for crew health care to address physiological, psychological, performance, and other needs in-situ, e.g., self-sufficiency, since real-time medical support from the earth, and emergency evacuation will not be available. Onboard personal health-tracking tools for health monitoring, health risk assessment and management will be needed for the crews in order to predict his/her future health conditions. Therefore, missions beyond LEO will require a new generation of capabilities and systems, which will be built upon existing capabilities and incorporate technologies yet to be developed. Lynntech proposes image-based photoplethysmography, in combination with, smart machine-learning algorithms which will primarily utilize onboard high-quality video cameras. The proposed system will: (1) constantly monitor vital physiological signs data, (2) ensure their acceptability,  (3) identify their unusual or abnormal patterns, (4) perform diagnosis and prognosis, as well as, (5) provide necessary risk mitigation and medical intervention options to maintain crew performance optimal and sustained throughout the mission.","The proposed technology will utilize onboard technologies (e.g., high quality video cameras, infra-red sensors) to passively monitor NASA crews while they are on exploration mission beyond low earth orbit. This technology will not only monitor vital physiological parameters, but also will provide risk mitigation strategies and required medical interventions. This will especially helpful in situations when there is not be any real-time communication with the ground control, and emergency evacuation is not feasible. The proposed technology can also be used in the International Space Station to monitor crew health, and make them aware of any abnormal pattern, as well as, provide risk-mitigation strategies. This will help ISS crews to stay in good health during their mission.","The passive vital signs monitoring technology to be developed in this project will play a crucial role in healthcare industry.

Ultrasound is a diagnostic and treatment technology that currently fulfills mission medical capability support on ISS and is planned to accompany future deep-space missions. The Flexible Ultrasound System (FUS) is a new platform that is currently being developed by NASA and research partners to support this mission role. We propose three specific aims for this project proposal for methodological development utilizing the FUS platform:1.)

This proposal goes far beyond an incremental increase in imaging capability and offers a path towards providing the full range of radiographic imaging - 2D, digital tomosynthesis and even half (180?) or full (360?) computed tomography (CT) ? to cover routine and emergency imaging needs in space mission environments.  The source is comprised of sections, each designed for a specific range of x-ray imaging or analysis functions.   In the starting design, each section is close to one of the sidewalls of the source, which is shaped as a rectangular box and made primarily of aluminum nitride ceramic (AlN) sheets.   Each AlN sidewall has a window that allows the x-ray flux to exit the source.  The window can be a hollowed out section of the sidewall or a thin strip of low Z material (glass, BeO, etc) fritted, fused or brazed into or over a window aperture in the sidewall.  Thin strips of metal can be placed over the windows for beam filtration.   Each window will output flux from one or more rows of spots (x-ray pixels, or xels) on the metal anode inside.  Systems comprise one or more of these sources and flat panel x-ray detectors, with several system modes configurable using the same source and detector.","MPXS would provide greatly enhanced imaging capabilities for the dental and limited MSK imaging of current interest to NASA.   MPXS systems would go beyond the capabilities currently planned by enabling 3D/tomographic imaging, which will be particularly useful in MSK imaging and could be useful in some dental imaging.  In addition, MPXS can be used for a much greater number of medical conditions of interest to NASA, particularly head and neck injuries, several conditions requiring imaging of the chest area and dual energy X-ray osteoporosis imaging.  The specific gaps the proposed work addresses are 4.02 (We do not have the capability to provide non-invasive medical imaging during exploration missions) and 3.03 (We do not know which emerging technologies are suitable for in-flight screening, diagnosis, and treatment during exploration missions).  Although not a focus in Phase I, MPXS can also be used for applications such as 4.27 (We do not have the capability to sterilize medical equipment during exploration missions).  Sections of MPXS sources can be configured for x-ray sterilization.  Other applications could include sources for a range of instruments NASA uses on space missions, including XRF and XRD.  The sources carried on board for imaging applications could be used for sample analysis both on spacecraft and bases and perhaps even during excursions.

MPXS sources will be sold to other developers, particularly at universities in medical schools, a number of which have asked for our resources as they are developed.  They could be sold at $75K range to these developers for a good business line.

This is especially challenging when one considers that common aerospace structures are made from such disparage materials as aluminum, titanium and steel alloys, as well as carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (cfrp) and carbon-nanotube reinforced polymers (cnrp) that are seeing increased applications at NASA.  Further the structural environments can be quite complex, including compound curvatures and/or multiple layers that are fastened together, with potential damage being located in each of the multiple layers.To address this need, Victor Technologies has developed VIC-3D(R), a comprehensive eddy-current modeling code for solving forward and inverse problems in nondestructive evaluation (NDE).

The goal of the project is to develop methods of shearographic loading of the samples, and use the penetrating THz pulses to detect the subsurface deformation of the defects in the differential THz images with better contrast than traditional THz imaging.   In a ""kissing"" disbond there is a region where the two sides of the material are not adhered, but the space between the two sides are essentially in perfect optical contact.  When the space between the two interfaces is so optically ""thin,"" the reflections of the THz pulses from the top and bottom surfaces cancel each other out.  The defect signature is only weakly detectable compared to when the spacing is greater than the minimum THz wavelength (approx. 50-150 microns), the shearographic loading will microscopically deform defects, changing the small THz reflections in the loaded vs. unloaded state. The differential images should subtract all background clutter and highlight the microscopic subsurface distortion of the defects under loading.","Time-domain terahertz reflection imaging is a proven NDE technology for imaging sub-surface features, flaws, and defects within space flight structures such as thermal protection systems (ablative resin honeycomb, TUFI, SOFI), inflatable space habitats, composite overwrap pressure vessels, radomes, and other dielectric components.  THz pulses (0.1 to 3 THz) penetrates these materials, and can be used to generate sub-surface images.  THz NDE can detect voids, disbonds, and damage such as tearing and micro-meteorite impact.   Material examples include Kevlar, Zylon, and other non-conductive polymer matrix composites.  Differential THz imaging should improve the detectability of defects in each of these applications.","Time-domain terahertz gages are used in industry to measure the thickness of multi-layer sheet materials such as plastic film, insulation, foam sheets, roofing, paper, and other similar products that are extruded in presses.  THz gages are used to measure the thickness of aerospace coatings, when dry or wet. The proposed differential imaging method and shearographic loading techniques should enhance the detectability of interfaces and delaminations in the manufacturing of these materials.

Technologies are required that enable flaw detection on atmospheric and space flight vehicles during deep space missions, hypersonic flight and reentry in harsh environments including high temperatures, combustion, high vacuum, high pressure, vibration, turbulence and cryogenic space conditions. Accurate strain gage readout at high and varying temperatures also requires temperature sensing for calibration. The prior art technologies of making strain gages and thermocouples have distinct limitations in direct application/integration to large 3D parts, cost, weight/resolution/feature size and operation to high temperatures. Direct-write printing has established itself as an enabling technology for production of both circuits and sensors on 3D and flexible surfaces that could not otherwise be fabricated with conventional techniques. This project will develop the specialized inks and deposition techniques necessary to implement additive manufacturing of hardened ultra-high temperature, lightweight strain gages and thermocouples with low profiles suitable for thin components. Fully integrated and modular sensors and arrays can be implemented for NDE and SHM of complex parts and hard-to-address locations that were previously out-of-bounds. Hardened inks may be applied by a variety of additive manufacturing techniques directly onto three-dimensional components or on high temperature substrates that can be adhered to complex components by refractory joining. High temperature stable strain gages will be proven feasible in Phase I to a Technology Readiness Level of at least 3. Phase II work on readout technology will focus on wireless techniques to take data remotely at high temperatures and on embedded components.","The successful development of high temperature sensors opens new ways to control and monitor thermal and structural loads in high temperature environments. These situations are very critical for the performance of propulsion systems as well as hypersonic and space vehicles. Printed high temperature sensor technology allows the placement of sensors on difficult-to-access areas, on surfaces with single or double curvature, and on places where current technologies are too bulky such as thin blades or thin parts. Furthermore, thanks to their light weight, the proposed printed ultra-high temperature sensors can be deposited on multiple points, creating sensing arrays to monitor large areas without imposing a weight penalty on the system. This is an excellent value proposition for NASA where every ounce counts. NASA applications for integrated high temperature structural health monitoring sensors are extremely varied for both atmospheric and space systems. Some potential applications for the proposed technology include turbine engines, combustion monitoring, rocket nozzles, hypersonic structures, reactor components, pressure vessels, thermal protection systems for reentry, thermal management for space structures, integration of sensing elements on or within 3D printed ceramic structural components and lifecycle management of reusable spacecraft.","Qi2 has a long history of supplying nondestructive evaluation tools and services to the petrochemical industry. Structural health monitoring (SHM) needs in high temperature environments are currently underserved in refineries, furnaces and other facilities that operate at temperatures up to 1000 C. Such locations are at risk for deformation and failure from creep rupture, creep fatigue at welds, creep fatigue cracking at bends, overheating and environmental attack, e.g., nitriding. Currently examination of such locations requires taking the facility off line for dye penetrant or radiography tests. In situ structural health monitoring would improve up time and minimize catastrophic failure.Qi2 has an ongoing project for smart sensing of the exterior of aircraft. One significant gap in the current sensing scheme is the jet engines, which are outside the temperature range of current sensors. The proposed high temperature sensing technology will be also  be useful for incorporating strain and temperature sensors in hypersonic aircraft as desired by the U.S. Air Force.

The PRAXI system is based on a novel approach for 3D Compton-based structural imaging, which requires only a small number of images for 3D data reconstruction.  These new features enable PRAXI to achieve 10x faster operating speed, smaller form factor, and smaller weight, compared to Compton imaging tomography (CIT), previously developed by POC. The proposed PRAXI system will allow noncontact, single-sided inspection of various spacecraft structures (such as micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shields, pressure vessels, inflatable habitats, and thermal protection systems), either for in-space NDE or for on-ground material development and quality control. In Phase I POC will demonstrate the feasibility of using the PRAXI system for NDE of spacecraft components by fabricating and testing a TRL-4 prototype, with the goal of achieving technology readiness level (TRL)-6 by the end of Phase II and delivering the prototype to NASA.","The primary NASA application of the proposed PRAXI system is a compact NDE system that can be used for in situ nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of the integrity of spacecraft components and structures, with the capability to provide reliable, high-resolution assessment of the location and extent of damage within multiwall pressure vessels, batteries, thermal tile, thermal blankets, micrometeoroid shielding, International Space Station (ISS) radiators, and other aerospace structural components. Additional NASA applications include NDE of lightweight spacecraft materials used in the development of advanced aircraft and spacecraft, such as porous ceramics, carbon-carbon composites, metal honeycomb layers, fiberglass, Kevlar, and aluminum alloys, providing accurate identification, localization, and measurements of all types of internal and surface defects.","The commercial applications of the PRAXI system include its use for in situ NDE/NDT of large-area nonuniform multilayer aluminum/titanium/composite structures with complicated geometry (and combined textile polymeric, ceramic, and metal matrix composite structures as well) in aging and modern commercial aircraft, spacecraft, light marine vessels, and any application requiring defect detection for multilayer ceramic, composite, metallic, and plastic nonuniform structures.",3D Imaging; Ionizing Radiation; Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Quality/Reliability; Radiography

The unique property of microgravity of improving glass composition properties originally discovered by NASA scientists will be utilized for commercial and cost effective manufacturing of optical fibers with unique properties that would benefit a wide range of applications down on Earth. With high value of optical fibers per unit weight the goal of the development is to drive the expansion of space capabilities through commercially attractive and profitable manufacturing on orbit. The Phase I development will be focused on defining the path for implementation of manufacturing capability on board of ISS. The Phase II will lead to demonstration of the complete hardware and software solution for fiber production in orbital flight environment.,"The key value of the volume manufacturing capability on the orbital platform of ISS through the proposed effort is the unique opportunity to kick start the commercially driven expansion of the humanity in space through the profit based utilization of the abundant resource of microgravity for material processing.  The developed logistics, infrastructure, and operational experience of remote orbital manufacturing will be critically important for sustainable orbital presence and further expansion of in-space science and technology. The approach will leverage existing ISS facilities to extend NASA leadership in facilitating commercial space exploration. The resulting new glass materials with wide transmission range from ultraviolet to midwave infrared and optical fibers will set the platform for novel optical devices and systems for remote sensing and communications as well as novel fiber laser systems with high standard of safety, reliability and affordability.","The opportunity to expand the highly reliable and efficient all-fiber laser sources into ultraviolet and midwave infrared spectral regions will dramatically widen the range of applications for industrial fiber lasers. The new applications will include environmental and health diagnostics, plastics processing, 3D printing and many others. The defense and security industry will benefit with improved detection of harmful substances and airplane protection from proliferating heat seeking missiles.

The proposed system will accomplish this task through the utilization of a two-stage filament melting process whereby a metallic filament is first heated to Curie temperature through induction and then deposited on a build platform where it is fused to the previous layer by exposure to a low energy laser.  This new unique process is known as Sintered Metal Printing with Laser Exposure (SIMPLE). Induction heating is not entirely new to Fused Deposition Manufacturing (FDM). There has been recent research into the integration of an induction coil into the ""hot end"" of a plastic filament FDM printer. The induction coil surrounds the metal nozzle, known as the ""hot end"" and inductively heats the nozzle when an AC current is applied. The nozzle then heats and melts the plastic filament allowing it to be extruded onto a platform where a part is formed. The use of induction heating, when printing with a metal filament, is similar but the induction coil heats the wire filament directly as it passes through its center. This system offers faster melt times resulting in faster feed rates, lower mass resulting in quicker more accurate printer head movements and lower overall power consumption.  Conceptually, the wire filament will not be heated to melting but heated to the Curie temperature and laid as a hot filament on the build platform. To gain adherence between deposited layers, a low energy laser is used simultaneous to the layering process to heat and fuse adjacent filament layers.","Government customers will initially be from NASA, where it should be of keen interest to the Advanced Exploration Systems division and to scientists seeking to take advantage of ISS materials science research opportunities through NASA Research Announcements. Through its Space Act Agreement, its IDIQ contract and its role as a CASIS implementation partner, Techshot will offer both the SIMPLE equipment and the associated services required to conduct materials research and processing in microgravity aboard NASA vehicles.","In parallel, Techshot will market SIMPLE to federal government agencies beyond NASA. The company has established excellent relationships with several branches of the Department of Defense, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the National Science Foundation. Besides space-based commercialization, Techshot's business model includes the terrestrial commercialization of technology by the maximization of the company's IP assets, many of which have been derived from the SBIR program. In essence, Techshot's terrestrial commercialization strategy is to secure patents for technologies with the greatest potential for commercial success, then form start-up companies to which the technology is licensed.

ERASMUS will enable these goals by providing a technology suite which is both a trash recycling unit and a microbial sterilizer.  The ERASMUS technology suite contains a plastics recycler, dry heat sterilizer, and 3D printer that accepts previously used utensils, trays, and food storage containers, sterilizes these pre-used materials, recycles them into food grade 3D printer filament, and fabricates food contact safe 3D printed parts.

The MEMS-based instrument would be suitable for monitoring indoor aerosols in spacecraft cabins such as the ISS and would offer significant improvements over legacy solutions including reduced form factor and lower power consumption.The system utilizes a hybrid detection technique to monitor aerosol sizes from 50 um to 10 nm.  For PM smaller than 2.5 um, the systems employs the thermophoretic deposition of particulates from a sample stream onto a thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonator (FBAR), and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of an electronic oscillator.PM larger than 2.5 um (including lint and fibers) is optically measured with a novel detector configuration.  The proposed technique is suitable for both spherical and non-spherical aerosols.The Phase I project will design, prototype and test key modules of the instrument, simulate and analytically model device behavior, develop interface and control electronics, and develop novel techniques for aerosol sampling and handling.AMI's proposed monitor is portable, offers an intuitive user interface, requires minimal maintenance, and can maintain calibration for extended periods of time.  The platform requires no volatile working fluid, operates in low gravity, and offers the ability to log data for longer-term indoor air quality surveys.","The proposed aerosol sensor could be used to improve and study the air quality on the International Space Station.   The technology could complement work done with the NASA Dust and Aerosol Measurement Feasibility Test (DAFT) and Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment (SAME-R).AMI's aerosol monitor could be used for novel, low-weight airborne sensor platforms in unmanned aircraft.  Applications include atmospheric measurements of aerosols and collection of air / ash samples from volcanic plumes.  Such measurements might complement Lidar and Doppler radar data taken with the Aerosol, Cloud, and Ecosystems (ACE) project.Because of the MEMS sensor's inert physical-chemical properties, the instrument functions over a wide-range of harsh temperature, power, and pressure conditions, can withstand high radiation and impact stress, and also operates without gravity.  The sensor is suitable for deployment on planetary and lunar missions, and for operation in other crew exploration vehicles.  It could be useful for balloon or surface based measurements of the atmosphere on Mars or Titan.","PM is one of the leading global risks for morbidity.  There is an urgent need for inexpensive devices that monitor PM pollutants such as diesel exhaust, combustion sources, environmental tobacco smoke, power plant emissions, and nanoparticles.

ORFOM is an orbital scientific payload that will be capable of optical fiber draw in zero gravity onboard the ISS, and specifically ""ZBLAN"" fluoride glass fiber which is capable of transmission from ultraviolet (UV) to mid-wave infrared (MWIR). When produced on Earth, ZBLAN glass fibers exhibit excessive loss due to crystallization; however, this crystallization can be suppressed in zero gravity. Low down-mass and the high value of low-loss ZBLAN fiber make it an ideal candidate for commercial ISS utilization. During Phase I, we will design and assemble a prototype fiber draw system that will have the size, weight, and power (SWaP) to fit into a NanoRacks ISS payload bay. We will also demonstrate a novel fiber draw process using an in-situ coating and a method to start the fiber draw from a preform that can be used in zero gravity. In Phase I, POC will develop a compact Technology Readiness Level (TRL)-4 version of the ORFOM, and formulate a preliminary Mission Plan, which will be implemented in Phase II. We will also explore commercial applications such as rare-earth-doped fiber for fiber lasers.","The primary NASA application of the proposed ORFOM module is commercial product development and manufacturing onboard the ISS. Such commercial utilization of ISS capabilities will ensure continuous expansion of critical manufacturing capabilities on orbit. In combination with up/down-orbit delivery of materials, commercial development of ZBLAN optical fiber manufacturing will serve as a backbone for evaluation and implementation of the next-generation of manufacturing capabilities onboard the ISS. The resulting ZBLAN optical fiber product of ORFOM will have unique optical transmission, from UV to MWIR, which can be utilized in NASA's remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, atmospheric monitoring, and environmental monitoring applications. In addition, ORFOM's rare-earth-doped single-mode ZBLAN fibers will make possible a new generation of high power, high efficiency eye-safe lasers for remote sensing and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems.","The commercial applications of the ORFOM low-loss ZBLAN fiber will include infrared countermeasures for protection of military and civil airborne platforms from heat-seeking missiles, eye-safe fiber lasers for medical, industrial, and military applications, and next-generation optical communications. The immediate need for MWIR laser sources will be addressed through the active ZBLAN fiber manufacturing on orbit, which would allow fiber laser manufacturing for the mid-IR spectral range. Low-loss MWIR transmitting fibers will enable fiber energy delivery for emerging quantum cascade lasers for remote optical sensing and material processing applications, thereby expanding overall industrial capabilities in process control, safety, and environmental monitoring.

Rocket engine combustion chambers require a very complex geometry, consisting of acylinder of varying diameter, with a variable wall thickness, and integral complex coolant passages in the wall These chambers must be capable of withstanding high internal chamber pressure and high pressure fluid within the passages without suffering mechanical failure from hoop stress or coolant passage blowout, while also undergoingintense thermal stress from the extreme heat transfer levels. Levels of fit and finish are very high to minimize turbulence both in the combustion chamber and the coolant passages. The inner walls of the chamber must be extremely thin, and are held to very exacting tolerances, yet are usually machined into the outside of a chamber.The large number of discrete operations, high tolerances, multiple materials, and most often distinct vendors for each step lead to very high cost and long manufacturing lead times for these components.If a bimetallic UAM printing process can be demonstrated successfully, the cost of combustion chamber fabrication could drop by 10-100X and significant time and cost can be saved from engine development programs. This would be in line with the goals of NASA's Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion initiative, which is aimed at reducing costs by 50%.

These systems are more fuel efficient than chemical rockets and much lighter.  This results in an enabling technology for long duration space flight (e.g. Mars) and the feasibility of multiple short duration flights (e.g. cargo trips to the moon). Additional benefits include limiting exposure of personnel and equipment to harmful radiation.,"The proposed technology will find applications in automotive, aerospace, and military for wear resistant, corrosion resistant, or increased durability of their products.Items such as enhanced life drill or milling bits, improved armor, higher safety levels and corrosion protection in autos are a few examples of where the technology can be applied","Fasteners/Decouplers; Fuels/Propellants; Metallics; Processing Methods; Space Transportation & Safety; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation)"

A critical aspect of the program is to develop a robust, stable nuclear fuel.  One of the nuclear fuel configurations currently being evaluated is a cermet-based material comprised of uranium dioxide (UO2) particles encased in a tungsten matrix (W).  Recently, hot isostatic pressure (HIP) and spark plasma sintering (SPS) processing techniques have been evaluated for producing W cermet-based fuel elements from powder feedstocks.  Although both techniques have been used successfully to produce W cermet fuel segments, the fabrication of full-size W cermet elements (>20) has proven to be difficult.  As a result, the use of W cermet segments to produce a full-size W cermet fuel element is of interest.  However, techniques for joining the segments are needed that will not lower the use temperature, damage the UO2 particles, or compromise the nuclear performance of the fuel.  For these reasons, joining of the segments using braze or weld techniques is not desired.  Therefore, diffusion bonding techniques will be developed during this investigation for producing full-size nuclear fuel rods from W cermet segments.  To promote diffusion during solid state bonding, different refractory metal interfacial coatings will be evaluated.","NASA applications that would directly benefit from this technology include Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP).  Initial NTP systems will have specific impulses roughly twice that of the best chemical systems, i.e., reduced propellant requirements and/or reduced trip time.  The proposed Phase I and Phase II efforts would greatly assist NASA with achieving the promise of NTP and NEP.  Potential NASA missions include rapid robotic exploration missions throughout the solar system and piloted missions to Mars and other destinations such as near earth asteroids.","Commercial sectors that will benefit from this technology include medical, power generation, electronics, defense, aerospace, chemicals, and corrosion protection.  Specific applications include protective coatings, x-ray targets, valves, non-eroding throats and thrusters for propulsion, and crucible/furnace components.","Characterization; Coatings/Surface Treatments; Composites; Fuels/Propellants; Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Metallics; Processing Methods; Prototyping"

Reactor shut down during a water submersion accident is a crucial issue that must be addressed in NTP systems. The technology that USNC will develop in this SBIR is a low risk design feature that has notable advantages over existing reactor shut-down systems during water submersion accidents.USNC's accident tolerant reactor shut-down system will consist of enhanced control drums with significantly more criticality worth. USNC's enhanced worth control drums are a low risk modification to the traditional control drum where a small amount of fuel is added opposite to the neutron absorber. In addition, USNC's enhanced worth control drums will be moved deeper into the active core to further enhance the criticality worth of the control drums. The combination of adding fuel and moving the drums deeper into the active core will substantially increase the shutdown margin of the control drums and will be sufficient to maintain sub-criticality in the worst case water submersion accidents. Neutronic analysis codes such as MCNP6 and Serpent 2 will be utilized.","NTP and its supporting technologies have great promise in spreading human presence to Mars and other locations beyond low earth orbit. USNC's accident tolerant reactor shutdown technology will address the water submersion criticality accident for NTP systems and help make NTP a viable technology to fulfill NASA human exploration needs.  USNC's work directly aligns with the NASA Technological Roadmap 2015 TA 2: In-Space Propulsion Technologies: 2.2.3 Thermal Propulsion. Currently, NTP is being investigated for a human Mars Mission in the 2030s time frame, but a NTP system would be a game changing technology that would have application for a multitude of missions. In addition, USNC's accident tolerant reactor shutdown technology can be applied to small nuclear systems for space or surface power. These systems, like NTP systems, must also remain sub critical during a water submersion accident.","The market for the NTP system and its supporting technologies extends beyond NASA with numerous potential customers in the private industry and defense sector. NTP is a game changing technology that is difficult to quantify in the non-NASA market but has the potential to be very large. USNC is currently pursuing earth based mobile reactors and small modular reactors. These reactors are different than traditional reactors as they can be shipped in whole or modular sections. In the shipment of these reactors it is essential to ensure that they are subcritical during water submersion (much like space reactors). The technology developed in this SBIR may have application in addressing water submersion in these earth-based reactors.  In addition, a number of other companies are trying to bring mobile or small modular reactors to the market, creating a clear opportunity to implement the novel technology developed in this SBIR. The market potential for advanced reactors is several billions dollars and approximately 40 U.S. companies are trying to bring advanced nuclear technology to the market backed by a total of more than 1.3 billion dollars of private investment.","Fuels/Propellants; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable); Spacecraft Main Engine"

Current state-of-the-art co-axial swaged cathode heaters use magnesium oxide (MgO) insulators, which experience a significant drop in insulation resistance at temperatures of 1300⁰C, causing heater failure.  Hollow cathode failure caused by the failure of an external cathode heater is the single most critical event that controls the thruster lifetime.  While alumina (Al2O3) has recently been used as a replacement insulator material, it has questionable reliability due to grain growth and void formation at temperatures >1600⁰C. In Phase I, we will formulate a new ceramic insulator using sound scientific principles, and develop a long-life cathode heater that can operate reliably at high power levels (>200 W) at high temperatures greater than 1600⁰C for use in long duration space propulsion missions.

Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are the typical cryogens as they provide the highest specific impulse of practical chemical propellants.  These cryogens are stored at temperatures of nominally 20 K for hydrogen and 90 K for oxygen.  Due to the large size of these tanks, refrigeration loads to maintain zero-boil-off are high, on the order of 10's of watts at 20 K and 100's of watts at 90 K.  Space cryocoolers have been developed for cooling space sensors that have modest cooling loads and are not suitable for high capacity applications.  On this program, we propose to develop a high capacity turbo-Brayton cryocooler that provides 150 W of refrigeration at 90 K.  On the Phase I project, we will design the cryocooler, assessing the size, mass, and performance, and assess development risks.

The Stirling cryocooler offers higher cooling efficiency than conventional reverse turbo-Brayton cooling approaches.  Furthermore, the close integration of our unique open-bore cryocooler and coolant circulator reduces connecting duct length, mass and associated pumping and thermal losses and can also eliminate the need for separate coolant recuperator heat exchangers used by other cryocooler-circulator combinations.  Finally, the modularity of our unique cryocooler and circulator components enables the system designer to build inherent redundancy into the system to boost propellant storage robustness over long missions.

Lower operating temperatures are possible via staging.  Potential applications include direct cooling of space sensors, vapor re-liquefaction for zero boil-off fluid storage or cooling superconducting magnetic bearings in support of flywheel energy storage systems. Space-based Refrigeration and Compression - The core cryocooler and linear motor technology could be applied to build higher-temperature Stirling coolers for in-space scientific experimentation or biological material preservation.  The same enabling technology could be used to build linear compressors for refrigerant-based cooling or other working gas compression or fluid pumping.

Brayton cryocoolers are well suited for high cooling power space applications, especially those such as cryogenic propellant management that benefit from broad area cooling.  However, Brayton recuperators are large, heavy and expensive.  CUA and LMSSC have been developing a robust ultra-compact recuperative heat exchanger for Joule-Thomson (JT) cryocoolers using CUA�s sacrificial fiber technology (VascTech).  This technology relies on weaving warp sacrificial fibers with weft copper wires to make a 3D structure with excellent counterflow heat exchange, but low parasitic heat conductance.  The proposed microcapillary recuperative heat exchanger (MRHX) requires much larger gas flow (for >150 W cooling at 90 K) than the JT recuperator, and the focus of this proposed work will be modifying and scaling up the heat exchanger for Brayton applications.  This new recuperator material will reduce the mass and cost of Brayton coolers while offering improved thermal performance.","The microcapillary recuperative heat exchanger (MRHX) supports the NASA Roadmap for In-Space Transportation, Cryogenic Fluid Management. A lighter, low cost, more robust Brayton cryocooler has numerous space applications, and may be able to replace Stirling and pulse tube coolers used in many instruments, eliminating the risk of exported vibration from the cryocooler and offering broad area cooling which is difficult to achieve with Stirling coolers.  Many highly sensitive instruments and optics require precise thermal stability and uniformity.  Most space cryocoolers provide cooling at a point source, and must cool the instrument or optics conductively.  This can lead to thermal gradients within large structures, and can also lead to temperature gradients between the cryocooler and instrument which require the cryocooler to operate at a lower temperature (and consequently require more electrical input power).  Thermal gradients within cryogenic storage tanks are a concern for long life cryogenic propellant storage.  Developing this MRHX allows one to retain the remote cooling functionality of the Brayton cooler but at lower mass and cost.","We regard the MRHX as having high potential for infusion to external customers as the hardware geometry and manufacturing process can be adapted for a wide variety of uses. The recuperative heat exchanger can also be used in Joule-Thomson coolers, such as the sorption coolers used on Herschel, Planck, Astro-E and Astro-H.  Furthermore, there are many terrestrial uses for inexpensive counterflow heat exchangers, beyond cryogenic applications such as air liquefaction and separation.

Cryogenic fluids such as LH2 and LOX are ideal upper stage propellants because of their high specific impulse.  Unfortunately, the high thermal conductivity of the adapter and payload interface or between the O2 and H2 tanks themselves allows significant heat transfer between the sections, ultimately opening a relief valve that vents the propellant to space. Once vented, the propellant is lost forever resulting in a limited on-orbit useful life for cryogenic upper stages. The proposed solution provides an insulative structural connection between the payload and the upper stage utilizing an inflatable annulus with performance attributes from TRLA's Ultra High Performance Vessel (UHPV) technology that provides an inflatable structure with fully determinate load paths and the highest specific strength and stiffness of any soft-goods architecture. By using the existing payload adapter technology and separation systems for the ascent, the long heritage and reliability of these systems are maintained. Once on orbit, the primary structural connection between payload and adapter separate as normal while the inflatable structure is deployed. The pressurized fabric ring acts as a thermal insulator significantly reducing the undesired heat leak while still providing structural characteristics at 0.2 g's of sustained compressive loads for station keeping, attitude control and telemetry.  The innovation will ultimately allow cryogenic propellants stored in an on-orbit depot to have a longer storage life while still utilizing the services of an attached upper stage.

The purpose of the Phase I program is to develop an electroanalytical device for analysis and process control of biocidal silver in potable water, with the option integrating an Ag+ ion generator. The device will automatically provide continuous and on-demand maintenance of Ag+ ion biocide levels in spacecraft water streams and storage tanks, as well as providing output data for silver concentrations and a profile of total silver added to the system over time. Considerable test work is planned under the AES program and, given silver ion's 'elusiveness' in water systems, the data will be far more reliable if the methodology for adding the biocide and measuring its concentration is performed by a reliable and flight-qualifiable design from the beginning. The Phase I Technical Objectives are to develop the device specifications, software and hardware to conform to spacecraft applications as specified by NASA. The specific objectives will be to 1) develop a complete analytical characterization of the detection method, inclusive of automated autocalibration and QA/QC functions, 2) demonstrate the Feedback Control Function to maintain consistent Ag+ ion concentration in active water systems, and 3) determine the operating parameters required to generate Ag+ in the ranges of 0.05-40 mg/l in potable water.Phase I will culminate in a complete analytical methodology and a flight preproduction prototype for measurement and control of silver ion at sub-ppb levels in finished waters.","Advanced Exploration Systems using silver as a biocide in water recoveryand water supply systems are the primary focus of this effort. Additionally, the analytical platform can be expanded to provide NASA with an entirely new generation of instruments that will enable a level of agility and in-flight analytical capability that currently does not exist.","Extensive global applications in environmental monitoring and industrial process control in automotive supply chain, semiconductor, lighting, mining, energy production and energy storage industries.

The sensor platform will incorporate three different types of sensors:  i) molecular recognition sensor elements incorporated onto nano-architecture for calcium detection, ii) Doped electronic material for pH measurement, and iii) a suitably designed microelectrode structure for conductivity determination. Phase I project will involve design and fabrication of the first generation sensor platform consisting of an electrochemical part (for calcium studies) and electronic part (for both pH and conductivity measurements). The capability of this platform to measure calcium in the range of 50-400mg/L, pH in the range of 0.5-5.0 and conductivity in the range of 10-250mS/cm will be demonstrated. In Phase II all the three types of sensor modalities will be integrated into a common platform. In addition, a handheld electronic readout unit will also be designed and fabricated in Phase II. This will serve as a basis for the development of a rugged detection system for applications on ISS.","Human space exploration missions require life support systems to sustain and secure crewmembers' health. The proposed detection system will provide a critical technology in the current NASA vision for space explorations. Urine processor assembly (UPA) on ISS is designed to extract around 85% of the water from wastewater including urine and flush water. However, because of lack of suitable monitoring instruments, the recovery percentage had to be compromised to ensure water quality and prevent the release of ammonia. Meanwhile, astronauts have been reported to lose an average of more than 1% bone mass per month spent in space. Hence the proposed approach can not only help monitor crew health but also recover more waste water.","The proposed detection system capable of monitoring calcium, pH and conductivity will have a wide range of commercial non-NASA applications such as marine resource management, environmental monitoring entities, aquaculturist, and fisheries etc. for assessing the impact of ocean acidification and calcification on the health of the marine ecosystem. Other applications could include clinical chemistry monitoring pH and calcium in plasma.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors)"

In particular, continuous and unattended pH, Ca2+, and conductivity monitoring in the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) in use in the ISS Water Recovery System is required. At present, no such sensor technology exists that can satisfy the demanding operational requirements of the ISS and future exploration missions. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) proposes to develop a luminescence-based optical sensor probe to monitor calcium, conductivity, and pH levels directly in ISS wastewater in real time. Optical sensors are superior to electrochemical ones in terms of robustness, reliability, and maintenance. These advantages are most notable in corrosive aqueous environments. Our monitor will incorporate robust sensor elements, interrogated via a compact, low-power optoelectronic unit. The proposed sensors will be remotely connected to the electronic circuitry by an electromagnetic interference (EMI)-proof optical fiber cable. For space systems control, miniature fiber optic sensors connected to the electronic circuitry by an optical fiber cable allow greater flexibility in placing the sensor system in the ISS, where space is highly valuable. Our flow-through monitor will include optical sensors for calcium and pH sensing based on previous sensor technologies developed at IOS. IOS will also incorporate a miniature conductivity sensor into the sensor probe system. In Phase II we will produce prototypes for integration in a Urine Processor Assembly and conduct extensive testing under simulated environmental conditions, culminating in delivery to NASA of a monitoring system, bringing the monitor to TRL 7.","Recycling spacecraft wastewater is essential for the success and sustainability of manned space missions. The proposed multisensory probe responds directly to a NASA need for monitoring calcium, pH, and conductivity in the ECLSS aboard the ISS, specifically in the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA). Successful development of a compact, low power, fully automated multisensor probe for multi-agent analysis will give NASA a powerful tool for wastewater monitoring. Real-time knowledge of wastewater chemistry will allow optimal recycling of wastewater aboard the ISS as well as for other manned space missions. This device will also have application as a monitor for water quality in all water streams aboard the ISS. Sensors capable of monitoring organic, inorganic, and trace contaminants in water, operational in microgravity, could make use of the same sensing technology and optoelectronic unit.","There is significant market potential for a low cost, compact, durable, accurate, and automated sensor to monitor water composition. State-of-the-art instrumentation for monitoring water quality includes instrumentation that is bulky and that requires trained personnel for operation. With its luminescent optical probe, our device will not only accurately perform in-line detection of calcium, pH, and conductivity, but will also be adaptable to monitor several other analytes important and/or relevant to water quality analysis. With the rising demand for smart water solutions in the water industry, a low cost, compact, and easy to use sensor technology will have significant market value. Additionally, there are a large number of potential commercial applications for a multisensor probe for calcium and pH, as well as for the individual sensors themselves, outside of the water quality and wastewater markets. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which require real time monitors for accurately tracking calcium, pH, and/or other biomarkers for R&D purposes will be target markets. Biomedical monitoring may also be an attractive business opportunity; miniature probes for measuring and monitoring extracellular calcium have potential applications for monitoring the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.[1]","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Remediation/Purification; Waste Storage/Treatment"

NanoLab proposes the use of a fundamentally new style of sensor based off of anisotropic impedance analysis of vertically aligned nanotube arrays (VANTA). Specifically, we propose the use of chemical anisotropic nanochannel impedance spectroscopy (CANIS). This style of sensor provides up to eight degrees of analytical freedom, resulting in extreme discrimination between chemical species without requiring modification of the sensor to provide selectivity. For the particular application of ethylene sensing, NanoLab proposes the use of a carbon nanotube based CANIS sensor, sensitized to improve the interaction of ethylene with the surface, using either a metal or metal organic coating, in order to lower the limit of detection. The sensor will be self-referencing to minimize drift, and will be capable of simultaneously monitoring other relevant species, such as water, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and ammonia without interference to the detection of ethylene. The sensor will be lightweight, and have a footprint of 1cm x 1cm.","The CANIS sensor is a multifunction, broad based sensor capable of quantifying and discriminating a wide variety of small molecules in either the gas or liquid phase. This includes organic species, inorganic species, and ionic species. The opportunities for a light weight sensors of this sort span a multitude of applications. Specifically, NanoLab envisions the CANIS sensor for use in space stations, in monitoring not only the atmosphere, but the health of astronauts through urinalysis, saliva analysis, blood tests, and breath analysis to monitor important biometrics, such as blood and urine ionic strength, calcium content, pH, etc., as well as nutritional markers including glucose, and bilirubin. Beyond biological assessments, the CANIS sensor has the ability to monitor atmospheric composition of inorganic and organic compounds  in complex mixtures without the need for independent development of specific sensitizing agents. As such, NanoLab envisions the use of CANIS sensors in exploratory missions, such as Mars rovers, as well as in greenhouse monitoring, such as in the proposed effort.The real analytical power of the CANIS system comes from the multiple degrees of freedom in the measurement without the need for sensitizers for many applications. This allows the sensor to fingerprint chemical species without needing prior knowledge of their existence.","This Phase I effort will expand our activities in sensors, which have been gaining significant momentum in the past years. The results of this Phase I work should provide a sensing platform appropriate for ethylene detection in on-world and off-world environments. In the envisioned Phase II effort, we will work to further optimize the limit of detection, and broaden the characterization of cross sensitive species. The developed sensor will find application in commercial growth, storage, and shipping of foods and minimize food spoilage. This sensor is just one application envisioned for the broadly functional CANIS style sensor, and will act as a launching point for development into medical, automotive, industrial, and laboratory sensors for both liquids and gasses. We see follow-on applications including:1) Simple point of care medical devices capable of simultaneous monitoring of multiple biomarkers, such as for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).2) Laboratory gas and liquid analyzer for detection of known and unknown species in complex mixtures.3) A robust industrial gas analyzer for determining trace and component gasses in process and waste gasses.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Analytical Methods; Biological (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Biomass Growth; Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Crop Production (see also Biological Health/Life Support)"

In enclosed spaceship settings, ethylene build-up can be deleterious to plants. Thus, there is a need to monitor ethylene in real-time, sensitively, reversibly and effectively. Currently, state of the art technology is limited with portability and detection sensitivity issues. To close this technology gap, InnoSense LLC (ISL) will develop a solid state electrochemical sensor (Polymer Nanowire based ethylene Monitor (PNet-Mon)). To expedite this development, PNet-Mon will build on electronic hardware platform engineered by ISL previously. The innovation on this project will only be on ethylene sensing. This effort directly addresses a need expressed in NASA Technical Roadmap (TA 6).","PNet-Mon is intended for use in plant growth systems and chambers in space. Once integrated into NASA systems, PNet-Mon will provide vital quantitative information in situ about the ethylene gas levels. The rugged, compact, and portable sensor will detect ethylene at part per billion levels. This is critical in enclosed space settings. Successful ethylene monitoring will enable efficient crop management. PNet-Mon will be compatible with size, power and sensitivity requirements of NASA for long-term human spaceflight missions.","In addition to NASA application during human spaceflight missions, PNet-Mon will prove to be a valuable tool in any greenhouse, food processing, storage and distribution facilities.  The benefits of integrating PNet-Mon into any produce/crop supply chain would be of great interest to the industry in terms of product quality and marketability, and production cost. By monitoring ethylene gas, the optimal harvest time and/or storage time/conditions can be determined. Thus, producers can achieve optimal fruit quality and ripeness. PNet-Mon supply chain integration can help prevent produce spoilage caused by deleterious levels of ethylene gas.

Hydrogen peroxide is an appealing disinfectant due to its low toxicity and innocuous decomposition products (i.e., water and oxygen). Faraday will construct a bench-scale electroreactor to incorporate a custom-fabricated gas diffusion cathode and a commercial mixed-metal oxide anode, which will then be used in hydrogen peroxide generation tests.  Adventitious hydrogen peroxide consumption at the anode will be avoided by inclusion of a selective membrane between the anode and cathode compartments. The performance of this electrochemical generation system will be enhanced through application of the FARADAYIC Process, which involves precise tuning of pulsed electrical potentials applied to the catalytic electrodes. The system will be characterized by the peroxide generation rate, the maximum achievable peroxide concentration, and the microbial disinfection capability demonstrated by the solutions generated. These efforts will provide a platform for scale-up and optimization efforts in Phase II and transition to commercialization in Phase III.","At present, surface disinfection in NASA space vehicles is accomplished through the use of pre-packaged, disposable, wetted wipes, which represent an appreciable carry-along mass and disposal burden.  The proposed hydrogen peroxide generation system offers a more economical and practical alternative, with the disinfectant solution being generated in situ and applied to reusable cloths, reducing both the carried and disposed mass associated with the disinfection process.  The stock materials for the disinfectant solutions would consist of dry buffer salts and detergents, reconstituted with water from onboard supply prior to passage through the generation system and application to suitable reusable cloths.","The proposed innovation has the potential to be useful in a variety of situations where disinfection of contact surfaces is of importance.  The specific application as described by the program solicitation topic is that of crew contact surfaces in space vehicles, but the system would be valuable in a broad range of other settings as well.  Some potential applications include naval warships and military field hospitals, where lightweighting of the logistical chain is a key consideration.  As well, chemical laboratory environments represent a possible application, where on-site generation of hydrogen peroxide for experimental use may be of value. More broadly, the global commercial market for hydrogen peroxide is sizeable, with a projected growth rate of 5.6% over the next decade.

The dust mitigation strategies learned through this effort will be leveraged on all planetary exploration hardware moving forward. While the focus of this task is on the High Pressure Oxygen Quick Disconnects that enable the flow of breathing gas, water, and electrical & communication signals from the suit to the vehicle or habitat, the dust mitigation strategies can be leveraged for other types of connectors and hardware as well. The knowledge and design techniques learned through these efforts will be used in support of all existing and future suit efforts including the current space suit program of record (EMU) and future programs (OCSS and AES) to market the dust mitigation strategies.","Along with servicing the space industry, Air-Lock provides this life support hardware to the aerospace, military and fire fighter industries. Similar to our spacesuit products, contamination control is always a consideration.

The next generation of QDs must transfer high pressure oxygen (HPO2) between the vehicle and space suits under adverse conditions, including an extreme range of temperatures, in a high vacuum, and amid pervasive dust. Currently, no QDs deliver O2 at sufficient pressure, nor are they able to mate in the presence of dust.Honeybee Robotics proposes to develop a dust tolerant, high pressure oxygen quick disconnect suitable for advanced spacesuit and airlock applications. This system will integrate form, fit, and function of existing and new subsystems for umbilical quick disconnects, leveraging both the design work completed to-date by Oceaneering (provided by NASA) and the dust-tolerant QD connector prototypes that Honeybee developed to TRL 6 for spacesuit applications for NASA's Constellation program. These QDs have been successfully tested at 6x10-6 mbar coated in JSC-1AF lunar dust simulant. Materials integral to the dust-tolerant system can perform acceptably at -160⁰C.The Phase 1 effort will focus on modifications necessary to apply existing dust-tolerant electrical connection technology (US Patent No. 8,011,941) to high-pressure oxygen delivery. This will include developing and performance testing a model in the presence of significant amounts of JSC-1A lunar simulant. A successful end point will demonstrate the design's capability to transmit gas over the interface and prevent dust from entering the gas stream over multiple mate/de-mate cycles. A design path will be laid out for Phase 2 to address remaining technical challenges and create higher-fidelity hardware suitable for testing at NASA.","Dust tolerant, high pressure oxygen quick disconnects will be critical to future exploration missions beyond LEO. Such an interface will find extensive applications in EVA systems designed to operate on the surface of Mars, the Moon, or in the particulate torus around planetary moons and near-Earth objects.The dust-tolerant, high pressure oxygen quick disconnect commercial applications may include resource prospecting and long-term human settlement.The same interface used in an oxygen quick disconnect can also be used for other fluid transfers in dusty environments, including potable or cooling water, or waste CO2, for extended EVA operations.The dust tolerant QD can also be used for fuel; rovers or other vehicles that require liquid recharge of consumables, as would be the case with fuel cell-powered systems, will require a dust-tolerant fueling QD interface. This interface could be integrated into manual or autonomous recharge systems.","Future commercial space missions into LEO or beyond will require life support equipment for all travelers, and requirements for an oxygen quick disconnect interface will likely be similar to NASA standards. Currently, no commercial dust tolerant, high pressure oxygen quick disconnect system exists, and development of this technology will be attractive to commercial entities that need high-reliability life support systems for crewed missions. This includes any lunar exploration or settlements that seek to harvest resources from the moon.Beyond direct interfacing with primary life support systems for human exploration, a dust tolerant, cryogenic fluid repeatable mate/de-mate interface could find use in fuel transfer for planetary vehicles. Rovers, whether autonomous or for human transport, may require refueling to recharge consumables, such as in the case of fuel cell-powered vehicles.Finally, autonomous spacecraft may require a dust tolerant interface to transfer fluid such as fuel, coolant, or other cryogenic fluids during on-orbit docking. This type of mating will likely be required for future modular spacecraft that are assembled on-orbit.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Tools/EVA Tools"

In Phase I, with the guidance of molecular modeling, we will synthesize several sorbents and evaluate their potential in reversible NH3 removal under representative conditions.  We will also evaluate the efficacy of the ambient temperature oxidation catalyst for formaldehyde removal as well as for oxidation of other VOCs.  We will demonstrate the regenerable sorbent�s operation for a minimum of 5,000 adsorption/regeneration cycles and its catalytic activity for a minimum of 400 hrs (equivalent of 50 8hr EVAs).  We will evaluate the impact of bed geometry and potential of using different integration options to the PLSS to ensure that the addition of these new materials will not impact the operation of the swing bed that removes carbon dioxide.  We will carry out detailed design of the TCCS and determine its weight/volume to assess the logistics savings against the one-time use NH3/CH2O removal sorbents.","The main attraction of our research to NASA is its ability to provide a lightweight, compact, TCCS for the PLSS.  Reducing the weight and volume of the sub-components of the spacesuit is of critical importance to NASA, particularly for next generation planetary exploration missions.","A successful ambient temperature CH2O and VOC oxidation catalyst and NH3 removal sorbent system that can remove harmful contaminants from breathing air will find an immediate use in a range of commercial markets such as fire protection systems and indoor air quality control.

A very simple way to remove ammonia and formaldehyde would be with a membrane that would allow ammonia and formaldehyde to escape to space vacuum while retaining oxygen (O2).  Reaction Systems, Inc. (RSI) proposes to develop a supported liquid membrane (SLM) that incorporates a facilitated transport mechanism for the control of ammonia and formaldehyde in spacesuits.  An SLM consists of a reactive liquid supported within a porous membrane and takes advantage of the difference in chemical reactivity between the compound of interest and oxygen to achieve the needed selectivity and permeation rate.  In addition to reacting with the contaminant, the liquid must have extremely low vapor pressure to prevent loss by evaporation, and it must have low viscosity to allow diffusion across the membrane.  As part of the development, RSI will prepare and characterize new functionalized liquid sorbents with near zero vapor pressure, and evaluate their effectiveness for ammonia and formaldehyde removal.","The most immediate application of the technology being proposed herein is the control of trace contaminants, like ammonia and formaldehyde, in a space suit.  The same technology could also find application for trace contaminant control in spacecraft cabins and on the International Space Station (ISS).  Currently, an acid treated, non-regenerable carbon bed is used to remove ammonia.  However, a highly selective SLM vented to space would be a continuous system that demands very little power, with negligible losses of nitrogen or oxygen.","This technology could also find application for trace contaminant control to improve indoor air quality in factories and laboratories.  For example, workers are exposed to formaldehyde in the manufacture of formaldehyde-based resins and their use in particleboard products. Morticians and laboratory workers may also be exposed to formaldehyde. Risk of exposure to ammonia is high in the manufacture of fertilizers.  For these applications a vacuum pump would be used on the low pressure side to provide the driving force for separation.  With the very high selectivity potentially available with an SLM, the flow through the pump would consist primarily of the contaminants and very little oxygen or nitrogen.  This would minimize the flow through the pump and therefore the required power.","Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Protective Clothing/Space Suits/Breathing Apparatus; Remediation/Purification; Smart/Multifunctional Materials"

To minimize design and layout time, STI shall use its ADONIS Rad Hard by Design Analog Cell Library (RADL).  RADL contains the basic components required for the design of the ASIC including radiation hardened by design operational amplifiers, voltage references, analog transistors, resistors and capacitors.  STI has developed a revolutionary new design tool, ADONIS, which will be used for this ASIC design. One of the key benefits of using STI's ADONIS technology is that it provides NASA Rad Hard technology that is portable to new processes and will extend the potential life of the program by ensuring that the design can be manufactured in a new fab if the existing fab closes.  Additionally, ADONIS can do this at a lower cost with reduced risk compared to existing design technologies.  In Phase II, STI shall take the feasibility design in Phase I, build a prototype ASIC, and test the silicon electrically before and after radiation exposure.  Other advantages of the patented ADONIS design technology are: (1)Consistent cell structures with Rad Hard design, (2)Reduced mask costs by 80% using conventional techniques, (3)Repeatable structures which control leakage, (4)Interactions between cells are known at design time, (5)Faster design cycle resulting in a savings of more than 2x standard design time, (6)Portability between different CMOS processes (7)Noise and IR reduction due to a proprietary power and ground mesh, (8)1D approach, and (9)Compatible with future Ebeam Direct Write Technology when it is commercialized.","High performance Speaker Driver and Audio ASICs can be used as standalone devices or in CODECs for audio applications.

Current CubeSat and small satellite solar arrays employ either fixed panels mounted directly to the Satellite side-wall(s) or small hinged rigid panels.  These arrays generate very low power (4-20W) due to their limited area available for solar cell installation, thereby constraining CubeSat payload capacity, capability and mission applications.  Composite Technology Development, Inc. (CTD) proposes to develop an approach for a high-power, flexible and compact deployable solar array for Deep Space CubeSat Applications.  The Composite Beam Roll-up Array (COBRA) is a very high specific power solar array that combines the Photovoltaic Assembly with the deployable boom structure into a unified integrated laminated assembly that can achieve >265 W/kg at the array level, including the deployable structure. The integrated structure will also shield the solar cells from the harsh space environment.  The objective of this SBIR is to develop a COBRA for a 6U Spacecraft that generates at least 200W for Deep Space Applications.  The unique design is also inherently low cost due to the design simplicity and very low part count.  Furthermore, the COBRA technology is highly modular and scale-able, and could be easily scaled to provide in excess of 600W for a small satellite.","CubeSats' fast time to market and modular architectures open up a new paradigm for NASA scientists and mission planners to consider more cost effective ways to perform a greater variety of science or exploration space missions.  Multipoint scientific investigations have been presented in the most recent NASA Roadmap and it is likely that these and other science objectives will be expanded upon in future decadal studies.  The high cost of access to space makes deploying constellations of traditional satellites impractical. It is therefore desirable to develop much smaller and lower-cost sensor/satellite systems such that the largest number of distributed measurements can be economically made in the space environment.  However, meaningful science investigations will require highly capable CubeSats with attitude determination and control systems, communications systems, data handling subsystems, and scientific payloads, all of which require high levels of power which will be enabled by the proposed technology.","CubeSats are already demonstrating commercial Earth Imaging capabilities. This market will continue to grow as other customers and agencies such as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency realize the benefits offered from these CubeSat operators. Other applications in asset tracking and surveillance around the globe can also be performed using CubeSat constellations. In addition, today's armed services are looking for faster / cheaper ways to gain eyes, ears and crosslink communication for the dynamic battlefield.

Due to this and the customized nature of satellites, existing space systems are very costly to stand up.  Nor are they designed for repair, upgrade, or reuse to amortize the cost over multiple missions.  As missions get further from low-earth orbit (LEO), the dangers of human extra-vehicular activity (EVA) for manual on-orbit assembly or repair increases making robotic assembly of large structures very desirable.  Honeybee Robotics (Honeybee) proposes to develop a Strut Attachment System (SAS) that provides a common electromechanical connection architecture for robotic on-orbit structures assembly.

The SAS will leverage technology that Honeybee developed for robotic satellite servicing (DARPA Satlet Grasper Tool | TRL-5).The proposed Phase 1 technical approach is to modify the Satlet Grasper Tool and receptacle designs to increase the connection's strength, rigidity, and power/data transmission capability.  The SAS will consist of the Strut Attachment Mechanism, Strut Receptacle, and Node. The Phase 1 project will result in a Strut Attachment Mechanism and Strut Receptacle at TRL of 4 at the end of Phase 1 and TRL 5-6 at the end of Phase 2.","The SAS will be an enabling technology for future exploration missions by providing a core technology for in-space robotic assembly of:- Extended operation space exploration vehicles- Planetary exploration surface habitats- In-space transportation hubsFuture exploration missions either in Earth orbit or to other planets will require large space vehicles.

In fact, the International Space Station is a perfect example of such a space asset.  Combining the enabling capabilities of robotically assembled, networked space frame structures, with other in-space robotic technologies being developed such as the in-space refueling work going on at NASA Goddard and the Phoenix robotic servicer/tender going on at DARPA, leads to the capability to assembled large structures on-orbit, connect multiple modules to a common structure, and create very large space systems that are not possible with today's methodology.","There exist multiple defense and commercial applications for the SAS including:- Large deployable aperture arrays to address the exponential increase in global mobile data consumption- GEO hosted payload platform to provide less expensive access to space for science, defense, and commercial customersDARPA is interested in the development of a persistent platform in GEO that would provide common resources (e.g. power, communications, attitude control) to a large number of hosted payloads.  Scientists, commercial entities, or defense customers many times desire an on-orbit capability, but the required investment to develop and launch the asset simply outweigh the benefits or do not mesh with budgetary constraints.  What if on the payload needed to be developed and there was inexpensive access to GEO via commercial payload delivery systems such as DARPA's Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) architecture?  A GEO hosted payload platform could provide significant value to numerous payloads.

Surface mobility is critical to outpost buildup and exploration activities, where the change in the vehicle weight between unloaded and loaded cargo conditions and travel over rough terrain can adversely affect the ride handling conditions and vehicle dynamics.  The vehicle suspension system components should accommodate for the required range of vehicle weights and provide mobility during various surface activities. In response to NASA?s need to improve surface mobility, an autonomously adaptive liquid spring/damper system is proposed.  This system will utilize a compressible fluid, which performs as a liquid spring to eliminate the need for mechanical springs and accumulators, to reduce the overall weight and space requirements of the suspension.  The controllable damping force will be utilized by a fluid system that has a fast response time.  The system will provide independently controllable damping force on each wheel.  Based on our prior work, the proposed system could have a weight saving of more than 20% and size saving of at least 40%.  The proposed system is a fail-safe device, i.e., in case of any power interruption or electronic failure, it will retain as a regular passive suspension system component.  In this effort, the feasibility of utilizing the proposed system will be demonstrated through testing and multi-body vehicle dynamics model analysis.  The proposed system will increase the mobility of the exploration vehicle under different payload (cargo and possible crew) configurations.","To load, manipulate, deposit and transport payloads to desired sites on the surface of the moon, the suspension systems of prototype NASA robotic vehicles plays a key role.  The proposed SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a liquid spring/damper to be utilized as a component of the active suspension system of NASA's space exploration vehicles, including the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) and Chariot and All Terrain Hex-Legged Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE).  All vehicles under consideration can support cargo transport and Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), which require them to perform activities such as surface navigation, terrain mapping and docking.  The proposed system can potentially be utilized in NASA?s Lunar Electric Rover and planetary rovers.","In addition to NASA's applications, advanced controllable suspension systems could be used for vehicle suspension systems, especially for medium/heavy vehicles to reduce weight, increase mobility, enhance controllability of the vehicle's motion, and to prevent rollover in rough terrains and during emergency maneuvers.  The applications range from commercial and private sector to military, such as medium/heavy commercial vehicles, buses, coaches, trailers, High Mobility Multi Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), tracked vehicles, unmanned military wheeled vehicles and, Light Armored Vehicles (LAV).  The developed liquid spring/damper is also suitable for use in landing system of the airplanes and suspension systems of railway vehicles, such as high-speed trains.",Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Vehicles (see also Autonomous Systems)

Knowing, for example, the soil strength and its density and in turn fundamental soil parameters such as friction angle and apparent or true cohesion, will guide the design of the wheels and excavation systems and help to determine anticipated excavation energies, time, and forces.Nearly all planetary rovers to-date have experienced some type of problem due to the unknown nature of planetary regolith.  The MER Spirit mission ended when the rover bogged down.  The MER Opportunity rover barely recovered from a sand trap. MSL Curiosity spent over a month trying to find a safer route around a sand dune.  Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle got stuck and had to be lifted and placed on firmer ground while Lunokhod managed to recover from a 'near' stuck position.Honey Robotics, therefore, proposes to design and test a prototype geotechnical tool called the Stinger, that combines soil bearing strength measurements with shear test measurements.  The Stinger instrument consists of a percussive cone shear-vane penetrometer capable of measuring near-surface and subsurface soil properties to a depth of 50 cm or greater. The cone deployment is percussive, because this approach reduces penetration forces, an important consideration when a tool is deployed in a low gravity environment from a small vehicle. During percussive cone deployment, the soil bearing strength is measured. The shear vane is initially housed inside a cone and it is pushed out whenever shear tests are required. When the shear vane is out, the cone-vane is rotated to measure shear strength of the soil. This measurement can be performed at any depth.Based on results of the breadboard testing, a preliminary design for a TRL6 Stinger GeoTool will also be realized.","The Geotechnical Tool is imperative to gather essential engineering data to determine bearing strength, density, and trafficability of regolith. This is most useful to establish the stability of massive structures, set up resource mining operations, and survey exploration sites and routes. In addition, soil physical properties are used to help interpret surface geologic processes and to constrain the origins and formation processes of the soil. The Stinger is, therefore, not only a necessary surveying and exploratory tool, but a valuable scientific instrument as well, which would prove to be most useful for lunar missions and for ongoing exploration on Mars. In addition to penetrometer applications, the percussive mechanism could be used for rapid excavation (via an impact-actuated digging tool), setting anchors into the ground, and for rotary-percussive drilling systems. The system will be designed with a goal of minimizing system mass so that it might be mounted on small platforms like NASA's Centaur2 and also be human-deployable.  Honeybee Robotics is a NASA-approved flight vendor and is therefore in the unique position to take a mechanism, such as that proposed, from low TRL to TRL 9, a successfully deployed flight unit. Honeybee has designed and built three critical flight components for Mars flight missions: Rock Abrasion Tool for 2003 MER, Robotic Arm Scoop for 2007 Phoenix Mars Mission, Sample Manipulation System and Dust Removal Tool for 2011 Mars Surface Laboratory.","There is a general need for systems that provide rapid and more reliable soil characterization and the Geo Tool could provide this. Some of the applications include oilsands bearing strength assessment (this is required by law in the state of Alberta), environmental monitoring of industrial sites, agricultural surveys, and soil remediation. The military has expressed the nead for a rapid near-surface soil characterization tool, something that can be carried and deployed by a single soldier, with the data acquired and processed by someone with no or little training. Currently we are in the process of negotiating a contract that could start as soon as April of 2016.",Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Metallics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Tools/EVA Tools

The scope of the proposed work encompasses the construction and experimental evaluation of a VLCA prototype for Phase I, including the mechanical structures, avionics, and embedded control software.

ART will represent autonomy requirements, test plans, and test results, and the relationships among them so that it is less difficult to state autonomy requirements clearly, to communicate test plans clearly among the full development team, to guide software development from requirements through acceptance tests, and to communicate test results in terms of the completeness with which the requirements have been tested. This will extend the state of the art by clarifying the progression from autonomy requirements to test results and make the tests more modular and reusable.The S&K team will first identify representative autonomy requirements for a design reference mission and high-level descriptions of how to test those requirements in the developed system. The team will then design XML schemas to represent data structures that define autonomy requirements, related test objectives, related cFS messages, test specifications and results. Next, they identify ways to generate and execute those tests by publishing and subscribing to appropriate cFS messages to run tests and examine the results.  The S&K team will design information displays for showing relationship among requirements, test designs and results so that it is clear how thoroughly the autonomy requirements have been tested and how they performed.  The team will develop a concept of operations for ART.  They will prototype enough of the concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, write a final report, and deliver results along with submission of a Phase II proposal.","ART will assist engineers and project engineers at NASA in managing and communicating autonomy requirements for flight and robotic systems. The forecasted potential and targeted applications relative to NASA needs are the development of robots (especially those interacting with humans) and the development of autonomous spacecraft systems both for unmanned spacecraft and those supporting small crews that operate at long distances from earth with resulting communications delays. The potential customers include manned missions to Mars and unmanned missions that will require increasing autonomy. They also include the development of robots like Valkyrie and Robonaut 2 that will support a small crew in performing safely the numerous duties required to operate a spacecraft for long duration, long distance missions. As pressures increase for spacecraft autonomy, the complexity of the autonomy and the number of systems that involve autonomy will increase. ART offers the ability to develop and test autonomy requirements more cost effectively.","There are a number of non-NASA applications that could benefit from better management of requirements for autonomy. In the developing drone market, there is already a very strong push for operating drones beyond the operator's line of sight, which requires autonomy to ensure successful completion of drone sorties. Autonomy is appearing with greater frequency and complexity in all sorts of software from office automation to data base searches and web site and smart phone applications. As these services expand their autonomy, they will feel greater pressure in managing the development and testing of that autonomy so that they can develop it efficiently and communicate it clearly to their customers. The S&K Team will need to perform market analyses in the future to determine if it is better to pursue a very simple application that can be started and used with very little training or a more detailed that can help to manage efforts of hundreds of engineers. Perhaps the best option is to offer both a light and a heavy duty version, with the light version getting potential customers into the framework of thinking about FM using our approach and the heavy duty assisting the coordination of a large number of engineers.","Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Man-Machine Interaction; Project Management; Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design); Verification/Validation Tools"

Automation can monitor critical resources, perform routine tasks, respond to unexpected events, and manage the overall operation of on-board systems. Current NASA missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are heavily dependent upon ground controllers to assist crew members in performing these activities.  Crew members and ground controllers rely on pre-defined standard operating procedures, which are at the heart of spacecraft operations. In current operations, automation and procedures are completely divorced from each other. This can make it difficult to utilize fully spacecraft automation, especially in long-duration crewed missions when ground control support is limited. On-board spacecraft automation typically focuses on fault monitoring and response and often uses specialized programming or scripting environments that are not accessible to crew members or system experts. On the other hand, procedures focus on non-continuous, human-in-the-loop execution of high-level instructions to change spacecraft operating states or respond to operational failures. This means that spacecraft automation systems are ignorant of the higher-level procedures being performed around them and spacecraft automation systems cannot exchange data with these procedures. On the other hand, procedures do not have access to or authority over spacecraft automation software and little knowledge of resource status or demands. TRACLabs has developed a procedure integrated development environment called PRIDE that is currently being used by NASA for ISS and Orion procedures. TRACLabs proposes to develop a generic PRIDE interface to real-time spacecraft automation systems. We propose to prototype this interface using the Integrated Test and Operations System (ITOS) and its Spacecraft Test and Operations Language (STOL) interpreter.",PRIDE  is being evaluated for use in ground control operations for the Resource Prospector (RP) robot being developed by NASA JSC and ARC for lunar surface operations. Ground control operations personnel for RP and have seen several demonstrations of PRIDE and are evaluating it. The results of this research are expected to have immediate applicability to RP and we anticipate RP using PRIDE for their ground operations.   We also see application to ISS when we complete integration with Timeliner in Phase II. This would allow PRIDE procedures to call Timeliner scripts. We will work with NASA JSC personnel to ensure we understand NASA's requirements in this area. Potential integration of STOL or Timeliner into MCC21 would provide additional commercial opportunities. TRACLabs has a long history of working on autonomous control of advanced life support systems. A combination of PRIDE and a life support executive such as PLEXIL would be applicable to many spacecraft life support systems.,"TRACLabs is already selling PRIDE as a commercial product to an oil field services company. PRIDE is proving automation assistance to drilling operations. Many oil field services companies have legacy automation systems that they would like to integrate with electronic procedure systems such as PRIDE. They have also expressed interest in PRIDE learning resource and duration constraints during operations to adjust schedules and predict when work will be finished. We will work with them to make sure that this project meets their requirements.  TRACLabs also sees application of this technology in the automotive manufacturing area. TRACLabs performed a small pilot project for automotive supplier on flexible robotic assembly. This was successful, and after a tour of several manufacturing facilities in North America, TRACLabs personnel are negotiating a follow-on contract for research and development.  Factory floor electronic procedures will also need to connect to legacy automation systems and provide timeline and resource allocation services.  Commercial space companies are interested in using PRIDE for their operations and integrating with their legacy spacecraft automation systems.

MAESTRO would be an open standards architecture and framework for the development of intelligent consumables management systems for autonomous and/or astronaut management of consumables.  Each task (an abstract token) in a MAESTRO/Aurora schedule would be a procedure of several steps or actions that must be executed, and incorporating the Adaptive Execution capability of Intelliface (based on Open Source SimBionic) would allow the plans and schedules generated by MAESTRO to be adaptively executed.  The Intelliface link to diagnosis systems allows the entire loop to be closed so that an autonomous or human-interfaced system can transition seamlessly between diagnosis, replanning, rescheduling, adaptive execution, etc.  The generality of the proposed MAESTRO system will be proven, in Phase I, by using it to develop three separate consumable management systems for three separate applications using the same code base.  Consumables management will be possible with significantly less skill and experience, less manpower, and reduced turnaround time.  The multiple applications also show that MAESTRO is a general, open architecture.","The most direct targets for transition of this proposed effort are the large number of intelligent consumables management systems needed for the several systems onboard various future manned and unmanned spacecraft.  By showing its ability to create high-quality responses to consumables events with greatly reduced manpower and expertise, MAESTRO will clearly illustrate its advantages over the status quo.  Because it will be an open system that other developers could use to create intelligent consumables management, a large number of intelligent consumables applications can be quickly developed.  Since MAESTRO is specifically designed to easily interface with Diagnosis, Adaptive Execution, and Planning engines, such developers will have their choice.  And additional interfaces can be developed over time to increase the number of such options.  There is a potential to automate the majority of consumables management decision-making at NASA, even for low earth orbit, with a corresponding savings in highly skilled manpower.  Additional applications are various types of ground processing at KSC.","On the commercial side, Stottler Henke already sells Aurora and associated customization services to private companies.  Commercial product and service sales related to Aurora have already resulted in over $8 million in revenue.  MAESTRO improvements can be readily incorporated into Aurora and sold through existing sales channels.

Avionic systems degrade in performance due to gradual development of anomalies and unanticipated failures ranging from issues affecting a single hardware or software subsystem to issues occurring as a result of coupling among multiple subsystems. In addition, system usage and operating conditions may lead to different failure modes necessating multiple recovery procedures possibly causing conflicts and deadlocks among recovery steps. QSI intends to address these challenges by leveraging the current capabilities of model-based fault management and supportability solutions of TEAMS to efficiently sequence individual steps within each procedure, including adding/deleting steps, and resolve conflicts and deadlocks in recovery procedures. TEAMS-RT, the real-time inference engine, has multiple fault diagnosis capability built-in. Additionally, TEAMS-RDS (TEAMS-remote diagnostic server) already exploits commonalities among test steps during guided troubleshooting, where each test is represented as a chain of pre-setup, post-setup and action nodes with Do and Undo steps interspersed. The proposed effort will extend this to more general digraphs of test and recovery/repair procedures and also embed this capability in a solution linked to enhanced TEAMS-RT for automated /crew-initiated recovery and resolution of conflicts and deadlocks in recovery procedures. This proposal aims to enhance QSI?s existing probabilistic inference engine to handle multiple, intermittent and coupled failure scenarios and developing an ISHM response engine module that dynamically assembles feasible and near-optimal recovery procedures to handle multiple failure scenarios.","NASA is developing increasingly autonomous systems that can perform missions with a high degree of certainty with minimal human intervention. Examples of such mission include rovers operating in Mars, where the missions are extremely long, and therefore multiple components and subsystems will degrade and fail over the duration of the mission. However, due to the long communication delays between Mars and Earth, these systems cannot be monitored and diagnosed by mission control like any other near-earth mission. The proposed capability will be invaluable to NASA for such operations by (a) Predicting failures before they disrupt the mission, (b) Reducing false positives of such prediction with the proposed inference engine under multiple failure scenarios, and (c) merging multiple recovery procedures that may have conflict. This will enable NASA to fill the gap between the current flight avionics CW FDIR systems and desired ISHM systems handling multiple failure high stress situations.","Among the other agencies, DoD, US Air Force, US Navy, and commercial aviation (e.g., SpaceX) are the most potential customer for the resulting technologies. Large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems can be potential areas to field the proposed technology.

However, the ISHM system might return a diagnosis that indicates multiple failures.  Or, it might return an ambiguity group that identifies more than one candidate failure. When multiple failures or ambiguous diagnoses occur, it seems attractive to exploit procedures that were developed in advance to handle each of the individual failures. However, simply combining procedures in just any order might not work due to interactions among the procedure goals and effects.  We propose to develop the Multiple Failure Response Procedure System, which will automatically generate and present procedures for responding to multiple failures and ambiguity groups. During this project, we will iteratively design, implement, and evaluate algorithms for generating multi-failure procedures from procedures developed for responding to single failures. Our approach is based on the belief that it is usually easier to develop procedures and plans from existing procedures that serve as large building blocks, compared to search-intensive methods that construct procedures from primitive steps. To identify and resolve procedure interactions, we will translate procedure specifications into planning domain actions, apply automated planning systems to generate a valid plan, and then translate the plan back into a combined procedure. We will design the procedure generation algorithm and user interface, develop a software prototype, and apply it to several scenarios to demonstrate our approach.","The technology resulting from this research will generate multi-failure response procedures from single-failure procedures in real-time when multiple failures occur or when ambiguous diagnoses are returned by automated diagnostic systems. This capability will extend the range of adverse situations for which procedures can be provided to support crew members and ground-based flight controllers. These multi-failure procedures can be used to respond to failures in air vehicles, space vehicles (manned and unmanned), and space habitats.","This technology can be used to enhance the range of adverse situations that can be supported by response procedures in other types of critical systems such as nuclear power plants and chemical plants, power distribution systems, and emergency response systems.",Diagnostics/Prognostics; Man-Machine Interaction; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Recovery (see also Vehicle Health Management)

The identification of an alternative fiber that could be used to both improve strength retention after exposure to high heat fluxes and eliminate the outgassing issues associated with the current use of PAN-based fibers could result in significant performance improvements for the thermal protection system. In addition, the ability to predict strengths for dry 3D woven materials would allow for additional design and analysis to be performed on various heat shield components which could reduce the amount of fabrication and testing that needs to be done to arrive at a suitable design.","In addition to the potential NASA applications, there is also potential for applications within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Specifically, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is currently investigating the use of 3D woven carbon fiber reinforced composites for aeroshell applications.  Depending on the desired trajectory of the vehicle, it is expected that some regions of the vehicle will experience peak surface temperatures that exceed the as-received temperature of the carbon fibers.  Therefore, modeling tools capable of predicting the effective material properties and strengths of 3D woven carbon fiber reinforced composites following additional graphitization of the fibers would also be very useful to this community.","Analytical Methods; Characterization; Destructive Testing; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Joining (Adhesion, Welding); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Textiles"

These TPS materials have unique properties for shedding the heat generated under reentry conditions to protect the integrity of the spacecraft.  However, ever-increasing mission demands require improved performance and a better understanding for modern heat shield structures.  This can be accomplished with a noninvasive, nondestructive method that uses projected sensing fields through the thickness of the TPS material.  Novel eddy current methods are proposed that incorporate innovative sensor array constructs, physics-based models, and multivariate inverse methods to nondestructively assess carbon-based TPS materials such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA).  The sensors can be mounted behind the TPS material or embedded within the TPS with sensing magnetic fields that are projected through the material.  JENTEK�s physics-based methods for diagnostics of layered media using MWM-Array technologies have been demonstrated as a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for flexible and rigid ablative TPS materials for condition, orientation, and thickness assessment.  These methods are commonly used for NDE, such as coating characterization, and have been extended to surface mounted sensing applications such as torque, fatigue, and heat treatment condition monitoring.  This proposed Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of these methods in an embedded sensor configuration for representative material layer configurations and a heating transient as well as investigate the adaptations required for full-scale testing and operation.  JENTEK delivered the MWM-Array solution used by NASA KSC on the Space Shuttle leading edge to detect damage of the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) thermal protection tiles; thus JENTEK is well-positioned to deliver a novel method for health monitoring of TPS materials.","If the program is successful, it will demonstrate the capability of the MWM-Array technology to monitor condition (e.g., electrical conductivity) thickness and temperature of materials that are exposed to high temperature conditions.  Initial implementation is anticipated to support specific spacecraft applications, such as monitoring during ground-based tests of thermal protection system materials.  Later versions with dedicated instrumentation designed for reduced size and weight have the potential for implementation on spacecraft.  In addition to basic heat shields for ablative TPS materials, it is anticipated that NASA may have a need for this type of projected field high temperature monitoring solution in other structures, such as the carbon-carbon rocket nozzles, Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicles, and exhaust nozzles.  Other NASA customers which will have a need for this technology include the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) spacecraft manufacturers and other interplanetary programs such as science exploration mission vehicles and human crew vehicles.","There are numerous applications that could use an in-situ health monitoring capability for materials exposed to high temperature conditions.  These embedded sensors could be incorporated into high performance analytical instruments to improve observability for high value and complex infrastructure, vehicles, machinery and processes.  This type of projected field sensing provides capability for through-thickness monitoring for damage, surface recession, and temperature with sensors placed in more accessible and lower temperature regions of structures.  An example is high temperature process monitoring such as heat treatment or annealing processes that are commonly performed on metals.  In-situ monitoring of the electrical conductivity and/or magnetic permeability would offer a real-time assessment and process control capability.  This could also be applied to composite materials where the electrical conductivity and temperature of the carbon-based material is monitored during impregnation and curing of resins.",Electromagnetic; Thermal

Flexibility is a result of easy rotation around the bonds within a polymer backbone, maintained only in the presence of low crosslink density. Conversely, a high char yield requires very robust bonding, generally with high crosslink density, since floppy, easily broken bonds lead to the evolution of gas, reducing the residual mass. Our modifications will reduce the char yield, but, in this case, even a 10% loss in char yield would still be comparable to the char yield of the inflexible phenolic resins currently in use.","Flexible polymers with high char yields are required for advanced ablative thermal protection systems (TPS) used for planetary aerocapture and entry, as well as for Earth return missions. Minimizing TPS weight versus legacy materials can greatly reduce the mission cost, and a suite of new TPS materials has recently been developed at NASA and elsewhere. However, most of these newer, higher-performing TPS have limitations on part size. A spacecraft TPS is therefore made from many individual pieces of material, and the narrow space between parts must be filled to retain performance. There is therefore an acute need for a gap filler that has enough flexibility to prevent cracks from developing during assembly and deployment, and a similarly high char yield so that cracks do not develop when the TPS is exposed to high thermal loads.","Ablative insulation incorporating high char yield polymers is widely used in a variety of military applications, including the reentry vehicles of ballistic missiles, rocket nozzles, and certain hypersonic vehicle designs. TDA is actively working with the Missile Defense Agency to develop new materials and/or formulations for several of these applications. New programs, such as the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, are also emerging, and would benefit from high char polymers with improved processing, environmental stability, and/or decreased thermal conductivity.","Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Passive Systems; Polymers"

Materials current under development include felt or woven material precursors impregnated with polymers (i.e. PICA) and/or additives to improve ablation and insulative performance, along with the block form of Avcoat ablator.

Shock location is measured using an imaging approach by laser Rayleigh scattering from molecules, shock velocity is measured by beam deflection via schlieren effects, and electron number density is measured by Thomson scattering. The Rayleigh and Thomson scattering methods are complimentary to each other and can use the same pulsed laser. The schlieren deflection is accomplished with a continuous wave laser and can be used to generate a precise arrival time and provide triggering for the pulsed laser. Thomson and Rayleigh scattering imaging may be extended to MHz rates with pulse burst laser technology, providing a capability to time-resolve the motion of the shock wave as it passes through the test section. The electron density measurement is a direct technique with the potential for high accuracy time and space-resolved measurements. The Phase I effort will demonstrate all three techniques in laboratory environments at relevant conditions.","The proposed diagnostics will support the development of spacecraft for entering planetary atmospheres, such as Mars and Venus, as well as reentry to Earth?s atmosphere. Radiative heat transfer to the vehicle during atmospheric entry can be severe, yet predictive methods are hampered by a lack of data for validating models. The proposed tools will provide electron number density and electron temperature thus yielding key insight into radiative properties of the plasma formed post-shock during atmospheric entry and help improve the fidelity of current measurement techniques. Information obtained from these diagnostics should aid in the design of advanced space exploration vehicles, and in the improvement of prediction models that simulate radiative heat transfer used in the design of thermal protection systems (TPS). This can help in reducing the design margins of TPS and thus result in increased mission payload capability.","The ability to accurately measure shock location, shock velocity, and electron number density would be attractive to research on hypersonic vehicles, and should find use in research facilities employed in the development of high-speed missiles and aircraft.

These highly reliable devices have no moving parts, operate over a large range of temperatures, and do not emit toxic or environmentally-unfriendly gases. These devices can be easily integrated into thermal energy conversion systems that meet NASA's needs for innovative space power generation on orbiting platforms, extraterrestrial surfaces, and space transportation vehicles. To date, the adoption of TE generator (TEG) devices in energy scavenging/power recovery applications has been hampered by three primary challenges:- Lack of thermoelectric material compositions with large figures of merit, ZT, that function over a range of operating temperatures- Lack of high throughput production methods that enable large-area, conformable TEG devices- High cost-per-unit area for tiling rigid plate TE devicesProduction of large-area sheets of high-ZT TEG devices that conform to space vehicle and other relevant thermal gradient surfaces acting to scavenge waste heat need specific processes (e.g. roll-to-roll). Nanohmics Inc. proposes to develop thermoelectric devices based on sintering of high-ZT thermoelectric powders. This TEG fabrication method will enable large-area, conformable devices with 1) high thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency, 2) high areal power conversion (W/cm2), 3) large total power recovery (W), 4) high specific power (W/kg), 5) low fabrication cost ($/W), and 6) durability and long operational life.","Space power engineers can use these devices to produce custom fit power generation systems directly on surfaces with high temperature differences such as the hull of a space vehicle, satellite thermal busses, and extraterrestrial shelter materials.

The proposed device embodiment is the only significant concept amendable to attachment to the contours and surfaces of space vehicles and as such will have a significant impact on generate power during space missions.","Unrecovered waste heat from energy-consuming industrial processes is estimated by the DoE at 5-13 quads/yr (1 quad = 1015 BTU). Assuming a conservative 9 quads, 6% efficiency for TE devices constructed with our approach, 50% losses due to parasitic heat transfer losses and integration, and penetrating 10% of the waste heat market, we estimate an economically viable TE device could enable recovery of ~20 trillion BTU of waste heat/year. Additionally, the incorporation of TE devices in automobiles can improve the efficiency of their power system by up to 5%. This level of waste heat energy recovery would lower the average consumer gas consumption ~15-20 gallons per year on a 750-gallon consumption/year basis with a cost savings on the order of $70-$100/year.  A low-cost manufacturing solution at the ~$100 price point would pay back in the first year, passing the savings onto the lifetime of the device, which based on non-moving parts, should be relatively long.  Technologies such as our proposed effort that lead to quasi-renewable energy recovery, or energy that would otherwise by radiated as waste environmental heat, will have a far-reaching impact on the world's energy consumption, including lowering the U.S. dependence on foreign oil.

This homogeneous joint will allow for high efficiency heat transfer from the core to NaK heat pipes with no voids or separations that can act as thermal shunts that will become hot spots/cold spots at the heat exchanging surface that could lead to dead spots, or potential sites for thermal runaway. The creation of a high efficiency joint allows both the core and the heat pipe to both operate at their optimum performance supplying a maximum and balanced thermal load to the hot side of the sterling engines making up the operating component generating electricity within the Fission Power System.","The development and characterization of LID bonding for Fission Power Systems will �enable� thermal transfer throughout all FPS versions to optimize performance and reliability for both manned and unmanned exploration of Mars, Venus, and the moon.","This technology will be applicable to terrestrial based applications such as commercial reactors, geothermal cores, and other high temperature heat pipe applications relating to regenerative heat transfer.

Radioisotope thermoelectric generators that converted heat produced by a decaying nuclear source to power have been used on missions such as Cassini, New Horizons, Galileo, Ulysses and the Mars Science Laboratory.  Although never flown by the United States, thermionic converters have also been investigated for space applications.  Their improved efficiency over thermoelectric generators makes them an attractive option, but the high operating temperatures required have thus far been a significant obstacle to their use.  Thermionic generators convert heat energy directly into electrical power.  An emitter electrode on a heat source emits electrons across a vacuum gap to a cold electrode.  The generated current is pumped through a load where it can do useful work before it is returned to the emitter.  Thermionic generators do not use any moving parts or working fluid, which results in highly reliable devices that do not need frequent maintenance.  Unlike thermoelectric generators, which have exhibited efficiencies only up to about 8%, state-of-the-art thermionic generators operate with efficiencies approaching 20%.  This proposal seeks to study the use of the nanomaterial C12A7 electride as an electrode material.  C12A7 electride has been shown to emit stably at temperatures in excess of 1600 degrees C and has a measured work function between 0.8-2.1 eV.  Due to its low work function, C12A7 electride has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of the state-of-the-art in thermionic energy conversion as well as enable device operation at much lower temperatures than is currently possible.  Busek previously has investigated C12A7 electride in thermionic emission configurations for space propulsion hollow cathode applications.  In the proposed work, Busek will evaluate the potential benefits of a C12A7 electride thermionic converter electrode.","The space market is a niche yet lucrative market for thermionic devices. NASA's deep-space missions might replace or augment radioisotope thermoelectric generation systems with thermionic systems, while in near-space, it may be possible to harvest thermal energy off monopropellant and bi-propellant propulsion systems (depending upon operating temperature/duration).  Such energy generation technology can be utilized for continuous or pulsed-power generation for a variety of spacecraft, rover vehicles, and basecamp power needs. While Busek does not have experience with radioisotope generation systems, it does have design and development experience with small chemical thruster systems (<20N green monopropellant systems). Such systems have been known to initiate and run at temperatures close to or exceeding the forecasted thermionic power generation threshold of 700k (800 degrees F/ 427 degrees C).  Coupling power generation with chemical propulsion warrants further exploration for both spacecraft as well as missile systems; such systems potentially being coupled with pulsed-power electronics, another area where Busek has design and development experience.","In the commercial space market, roughly 20 GEO launches and 25 non-GEO launches occur on an annual basis (excludes micro/nano-satellites), with most spacecraft having a number of chemical thrusters aboard for orbit-raising and station-keeping.  In addition to Busek's own chemical propulsion systems, potential space customers include chemical thruster manufacturers such as Rafael, EADS, ECAPS, Northrop Grumman, Moog (AMPAC), Aerojet. Collectively, these firms represent the large majority of chemical systems flow in the industry. Potential customers for radioisotope power generation include ESA missions and NATO customers.  The largest terrestrial market in terms of economic benefit, is industrial thermal energy recovery. The United States industrial sector uses one third of the country's energy.  Improved waste heat recovery technology, in which some of the used energy could be ""recycled"", would lead to lower operating costs and decreased environmental impact and is therefore of great interest.  Applications in which bulky, complex heat engines cannot be used need compact, solid-state devices that require little to no maintenance.  The potential improvements enabled by a C12A7 electride thermionic generator device, in both efficiency and flexibility of use, could lead to a significant decrease in costs for industries such as glass manufacturing, cement manufacturing, iron and steel manufacturing, aluminum production, and metal casting.","Conversion; Generation; Nanomaterials; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

Direct methane solid oxide fuel cell (DM-SOFC) technology with an internal reforming approach has been investigated for generation of electric power from methane in order to preserve mission flexibility. Current internal reformer catalyst uses a significant amount of water (or oxygen) in the fuel stream to eliminate carbon coking issue.  Lynntech proposes an advanced anode catalysis concept for DM-SOFC that is free of carbon coking without the use of water (or oxygen) in the fuel stream.  Preliminary results with Lynntech's advanced anode catalysis concept using 100% dry hydrocarbon fuels demonstrated similar power densities to direct internal reforming technology.  In Phase I, Lynntech will further optimize the anode electrocatalyst component and architecture, demonstrate the performance improvements and durability with single cells running on dry methane, and built and operate a bipolar short stack.  In Phase II, Lynntech will built a bipolar 3-kW DM-SOFC stack and integrate all of the balance of plant component, demonstrate its performance and durability with improved thermal cycling (using dry methane), and deliver it to NASA for further testing.","Future space missions will require a significant degree of mission flexibility (meaning utilize the resources available at the destination).  Power generation devices are one of the critical components that determine the mission flexibility parameter. Solid oxide fuel cell based generation of electric power maximizes the mission flexibility and such systems can be used for the following potential NASA commercial applications: Mars landers, rovers, and other exploration vehicles, sun-independent electrical power generation for crew transportation systems and surface systems, power generation for surface mobility systems, Lunar landers, and other similar applications.","Solid oxide fuel cell systems (with reformer integrated option) demonstrated the highest achievable energy efficiency for electric power generation from hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas, methane, syngas, and other similar fuels.  Carbon coking issue has been very detrimental on the long term durability (which has also affected their commercialization) and a major hurdle to overcome without the use of additional water or oxygen in the fuel stream.  Lynntech's advanced anode catalysis concept already demonstrated carbon coking free operation without the use of additional water (or oxygen).

In both cases, the electro-optic modulator itself induces an additional 60% optical loss, and requires nearly 0.5W of power to drive.  An alternative is to use a low-repetition-rate MLL in combination with a switch fabric to delay each output pulse into the correct PPM slot.  However, the use of photonic integrated circuits (e.g., silicon) is prohibitive due to the high intrinsic loss.  A 100-MHz PPM data rate scheme requires ~5ns pulse delay.  This represents 43-cm propagation in silicon, inducing a power loss ≥ 10 dB.  Adding the loss due to spiraled delay lines, switch junctions, and coupling on/off chip, the aggregate loss of the switch fabric is 18 to 24 dB, representing a significant efficiency loss.  RAM Photonics proposes the development of a qualitatively novel approach to high-efficiency, low-bit-rate laser transmitters compatible with space-borne missions.  Specifically, we propose to develop a laser transmitter that attains highly efficiency optical data generation by (1) generating only one optical pulse per symbol at arbitrary temporal location, (2) eliminating all electro-optic modulators, and (3) exploiting a nearly lossless fiber architecture.  The new transmitter device has low dissipation (< 0.5 W total) and low SWaP footprint, and can operate at arbitrary data rates and generate any symbol formats.","PPM laser transmitters, particularly with ultra-low electrical power consumption and arbitrary data format, are of significant interest for many NASA programs.  The direct NASA application is a PPM laser transmitter with the following characteristics: 10-100-MHz symbol data rate; 250-ps symbol slot width, 16-128 PPM M-ary, 1540-1560 nm wavelength, 50mW average power, 25-ps pulse width, and total average power consumption ≤ 500 mW.  Further, the PPM transmitter developed in this program could be directly applied to small systems in near-earth orbit, such as Cubesats, and in proximity-length applications, such as orbiter-to-lander communications.   They can also be used to seed a high-power fiber amplifier for interplanetary and deep-space optical communications systems.The transmitter can also be used as the seed for LIDAR transmitters.  In conjunction with a low-jitter clock generator, the PPM pulses can be applied to mm-scale ranging for use in identifying objects and mapping contoured structures.  The technology in our commercial CavitylessTM pulse source results in ultra-low-loss optical pulse generation with less than 25-fs jitter, and an optical engine that adds less than 5-fs of additive jitter.","The clear first application is as a seed for long-range, high-performance LIDAR laser systems.  One specific LIDAR application is differential absorption LIDAR, which require laser sources operating at 1.57μm for sensing CO2.  The technology developed in this program, although focusing on 1.5μm for the particular communication application, is not specifically dependent on the wavelength of the light.  By using alternate laser diodes and fiber amplifiers (doped with Yb, Tm, or Ho instead of Er), the 1-μm window can be reached as well as the 2.05-μm CO2 line, which is immediately applicable to environmental and pollution monitoring. A multitude of other photon-starved applications require format-flexible PPM transmitters, such as deep-sea sensing, aircraft-to-submarine communications, secure long-range optical links, and optical wireless.  Further, we expect that the new seed source, combined with our commercial product line of fiber amplifiers (www.ramphotonics.com/products/spa-fiber-amplifier) that are currently targeted to low-noise amplification of single (solitary) pulses to high pulse energies, will generate a new flexible-format pulsed laser source that can enable new opportunities in sensing, laser accelerator drivers, medical surgery, and ultrafast laser material processing.",Emitters; Lasers (Communication); Lasers (Guidance & Tracking); Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Transmitters/Receivers

The current Iris software is rudimentary compared the NASA Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS). The software on each slice uses a simple 333 kHz loop as a basic scheduler to invoke small C elements. Changes can only be made before the radio is installed in the spacecraft, and no code updates in flight are possible without patching.This proposal would result in software to enable simple, low-effort elaboration of new capabilities for the Iris and similar radios.1. Telecom Abstraction Layer (TAL) implements STRS capabilities, plus the infrastructure to dynamically select waveform applications on any sort of radio. A high-speed scheduler selects apps to run, collects execution information for debug, and reconfigures the system for needed operations. The TAL can be targeted to any radio with the modification of an i/o layer.2. Plug-in Cognition Architecture (PiCA) running on a separate slice for cognitive link services, interfaced to each radio slice via serial. Services could include downlink rate selection in response to DSN site conditions, guaranteed data delivery, relay, antenna pointing, and access negotiation. Built-atop flight-proven VML sequencing and JPL AutoNav for spacecraft navigation, easy-to-code scripts provide sophisticated timing and event response, making cognitive services easy to write and deploy, even after launch.The longer-duration computations of the PiCA do not interfere with the high-rate waveform activities in the TAL. Both can be updated with new components at any point in the mission, allowing unprecedented flexibility to take advantage of new technologies or compensate for spacecraft idiosyncrasies.PASDR has the potential to shorten radio development cycles and allow easy collaboration between separate developers, benefiting the community as a whole.","PASDR is applicable to any software-defined radio flying on any spacecraft. The potential for commercialization is therefore enormous. PASDR could be installed in Iris radios by the provider chosen by JPL, and any others that the market may offer for deep space and LEO use, to give NASA the ability to use sophisticated standardized communications across a broad range of different small missions. This would stimulate activity and reduce costs by freeing missions from having to implement any telecom software, leading to better reliability of communications, simpler mission conops, more cross-mission synergy, and lower barriers of entry for inexperienced mission sponsors.By lowering development costs of new capabilities, more companies may produce small software-defined radios for use in CubeSat missions. In addition to the data communications aspect, the PASDR would add radiometric data for 1-way ranging (with a suitable on-board oscillator) and Doppler, allowing the CubeSat community the opportunity for autonomous navigation. This will reduce the cost of missions by reducing the need for expert navigation.New mission component providers could use PASDR for larger spacecraft, providing them with the same software-defined flexibility as the CubeSat community reducing implementation costs, onboard navigation present in PASDR could be used on these more expensive missions due to its ready availability, reducing the need to use as much expert time for support.","Since PASDR works with any software-defined radio, it could be applied to non-NASA spacecraft: DoD, NOAA, and ESA missions are prime candidates. International release of software should be possible under ITAR controls. The PiCA element of PASDR could be directly applied to commercial launch vehicles, including for human access to space.PASDR is also applicable to terrestrial deployments. The capabilities produced by this SBIR could be applied to radios for autonomous vehicle control, airborne systems, and remote science stations with limited contact time. Doing so would allow easy crossover of waveform apps and cognition services between space and terrestrial deployments.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Architecture/Framework/Protocols; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Command & Control; Intelligence; Navigation & Guidance; Programming Languages; Sequencing & Scheduling; Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

Like all Kymeta/KGS metamaterial antenna systems, this antenna uses a tunable dielectric material and an array of radiating elements to create an interference pattern that steers the beam in the desired direction. This method provides moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering and similar functional performance to a traditional phased array at a fraction of the size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C). This prototype antenna meets RF performance goals but was designed as a proof of concept lab test unit with no environmental requirements. As a result, it needs a variety of minor modifications to be capable of surviving launch, to be capable of operating in the space atmosphere, and to better integrate into a CubeSat. This Phase I proposal focuses on the design of four updates to the antenna aperture to better meet requirements in the installed environment. Survivability during launch will be increased by a modification of the antenna-to-drive electronics connectors as well as the addition of two new bolts between the waveguide and radiating cell board; a redesign of the radiating cell will improve observed performance parameters during operation at temperature; and a modification of the waveguide will minimize the antenna footprint in a 3U CubeSat. If awarded, Phase I deliverables will include analysis and simulations of expected results, as well as a plan for fabrication and verification of the design during Phase II. If awarded Phase II, KGS would build and test the antennas designed in Phase I; if this testing indicates that the designs perform as expected based on analysis, the antenna itself would be ready to go to space.","This Ka-band CubeSat antenna is a small, lightweight antenna which provides moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering or power-hungry phase shifters. The modifications defined in this proposal will move it one step closer to being launch-ready for a CubeSat 3U or larger satellite in low Earth orbit. This technology provides a high data rate communications solution for small satellites which, when paired with sensors, would provide NASA with the ability to receive high volumes of sensor data directly from LEO satellites. This has potential applications to a variety of NASA interests, ranging from earth observation activities to experiments performed on LEO satellites. The technology could also be leveraged to provide inter-satellite links, allowing NASA increased communications architecture technology.","The CubeSat standard was defined by a university team in order to reduce cost and complexity of the launch of small satellites. Because they often do not have very much funding, university organizations developing CubeSats would benefit significantly from a small, lightweight, high-gain antenna which uses very little power and is available at relatively low cost.Aside from organizations who are interested in satellites, this small and lightweight antenna is appropriate for a variety of other applications. These include systems where either the antenna host platform or the antenna with which it is communicating is moving (or both), including aircraft, small marine craft, and mobile ground assets.

The continuation is achieved through establishing homotopies between some simple models, for which solutions are easy to obtain, and the full models. We will investigate how sensitivities of the trajectory to the homotopy parameters can be used to systematically and effectively automate the homotopy continuation, improving the robustness of the algorithms. We will also investigate adaptive fidelity models and alternative interpolation-based gravity models, as well as a number of techniques developed by the investigators to speed up the dynamics evaluations. Almost every legacy trajectory design software code used by NASA (e.g., Malto, Copernicus, EMTG, GMAT, etc.) is faced by the dilemma that hard problems simply don�t converge without a good initial guess. The gradient-based localized optimization methods used in these software tools require initial guesses that are close to the final solutions. The common practice of using solutions based on simplified models as initial guesses often do not yield convergence if the full problem is solved directly, especially in highly perturbed dynamical environments. In the proposed method, instead of taking a full step from the simple model to the full model, we systematically take smaller steps, and judiciously introduce incremental perturbations. This method is amenable to automation and yields robustness in convergence. The proposed research will greatly benefit NASA and the space trajectory design community in designing high-fidelity trajectories with true ephemerides and force fields.","The proposed robust trajectory design techniques and tool are significant for NASA in supporting its committed ambition of robotic and human space flight. Expected NASA applications are in the area of interplanetary mission design, missions to asteroids and comets, planetary moon tours, atmospheric entry, aerobraking, launch vehicle trajectory optimization, etc., all of which can benefit from the improved robustness in convergence as a result of the continuation methods. Existing NASA software packages such as the open-source GMAT (General Mission Analysis Tool), Copernicus, Malto, etc., can all be enhanced through wrappers or plugin implementing the proposed methods.","The proposed technology can find applications at other government agencies and commercial entities that deal with spacecraft trajectory design and launch vehicle analysis, such as the Air Force, Missile Defense Agency, Orbital Science Corporation, Boeing, SpaceX, etc. Potential applications can also be found in engineering and mathematical software market such as Analytical Graphics, Inc. and Mathworks, Inc.

It has been built with NASA trajectory optimization problems in mind, but can be applied to any class of NLP problem. By parallelising not only the basic linear algebra, but also the derivative calculation, problem formulation, and sparse aspects of typical problems, significant speed improvements are achievable by comparison to existing open source and commerical NLP solvers.","NASA currently utilizes SNOPT, IPOPT, and WORHP software packages for astrodynamics applications such as the design of complex spacecraft trajectories and other optimal control problems, but could greatly benefit from the introduction of a new parallel large-scale, nonlinear, sparse optimization solution.

Efficient, compact hybrid approaches using bulk solid-state pulsed transmitters followed by doped-fiber amplification will be a focus to reach flexible performance on the order of 200 ?J/pulse, 0.5-8 kHz PRF, which can serve as an effective transmitter for many applications as-is in both coherent or direct detection lidar architectures, or which can be increased via further amplification as needed.  Operationally flexible Q-switched and injection seeded operation compatible with several different applications with differing requirements will be emphasized.  Very compact efficient MO laser technology will also be exploited and a prototype MO delivered in Phase I.  Techniques will be explored to increase output pulse duration to narrow the transform-limited pulse spectra while maintaining very compact laser cavity length.  These innovations will apply directly to current NASA missions and instruments (Doppler lidar, IPDA, LAS) and accelerate commercial development and availability of practical ground-based and airborne systems (e.g. compact airborne CO2 concentration-measuring instruments) at BP and elsewhere.","Moderate average power, compact, operationally flexible 2 ?m solid-state/fiber hybrid transmitter laser solutions will tangibly and positively impact the readiness of current and future NASA laser remote sensing systems and missions for airborne and in the case of atmospheric DIAL instruments, space-based measurement applications.  Full development, test, and delivery at the end of Phase I of BP?s extremely compact and ruggedized master oscillator source will directly benefit existing NASA programs operating at 2 ?m and will accelerate commercial availability.  Efficient single-frequency pulsed 2 ?m wavelength lasers with variable pulse duration and PRF will greatly enhance the technical readiness of 2-micron wavelength coherent- and direct-detection lidar systems for ASCENDS type missions, IPDA, LAS, and hard-target identification, tracking, and imaging.  Many of the innovations proposed can be transferred to other relevant laser gain media and wavelengths for other NASA applications.","Non-NASA commercial applications of the proposed pulsed 2-micron solid-state/fiber hybrid laser sources include DoD hard target and space debris tracking and imaging problems as well as research and industrial applications requiring very compact efficient front-end transmitter lasers in the eye-safe SWIR wavelength region.  Specifically relevant to Beyond Photonics, we will capitalize on past NASA SBIR innovations that produced our initial SWIFT single-frequency solid-state cw single-frequency laser format and apply them to the pulsed single-frequency (injection seeded) transmitter laser design proposed here; we plan to incorporate new design concepts in this master oscillator (MO) laser, and then build, test, and deliver a fully functional prototype of the new MO source in Phase I.  We ultimately envision commercial development of a small, rugged, and compact differential-absorption lidar (DIAL) sensor product for airborne measurement of CO2 and water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere, and other similar laser remote sensing applications.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Infrared; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Optical; Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Ranging/Tracking"

The ideal laser source will be high performance for lidar (high pulse energy, high rep rate, short pulse duration) with specific targeted emission spectrum to meet ocean water transmittance and filtering requirements.  It will also feature low SWaP and a rugged form factor with high reliability for continual use on mobile platforms.  No existing laser source can meet these demanding requirements.To address this challenge and meet NASA's lidar source needs, Bridger Photonics, Inc. (Bridger) proposes creating a high power Q-switched, off-line Nd:YAG source at 946 nm, which, when frequency doubled to 473 nm, will provide high transmittance through ocean waters.  Bridger's design will leverage three key innovations: efficient, end-pumped, low-quantum-defect architecture; gain crystal design for optimal heat removal; and robust monolithic, alignment-free fabrication. The proposed design would allow for widespread deployment of mobile ocean-penetrating lidar transmitters.  Bridger's overall goal for this Phase I effort is construct a breadboard prototype laser emitting 10 WAVG at 473 nm with a viable pathway to a rugged, turn-key system with >10% wall-plug efficiency to be built and delivered in a Phase II effort.  Bridger has modeled and constructed similar lasers on Phase I SBIR efforts previously and will apply the innovations developed there towards this new system for NASA.","NASA's primary application for the proposed transmitter would be ocean bathymetry and underwater object detection.  The compact size, rugged design, and efficient electrical-to-optical conversion of Bridger's proposed laser would make it ideal suited for a mobile ship, airborne, or even satellite platform.Due to larger scattering at shorter wavelengths, the 473 nm source would be favored over the traditional 532 nm source for most cloud and aerosol lidar applications.  The 473 nm beam would also work well as a general purpose OPO pump beam especially for generating green to near-IR signal waves or into the SWIR spectral band.  The former is an intermediate step towards generating the UV wavelengths used for measuring tropospheric ozone via differential absorption lidar, while the latter is useful for profiling other important greenhouse gases and pollutants such as CH4, CO2, H2O, CO, NO2, and many others.  Finally the 946 nm fundamental source would be useful for water vapor lidar.","The proposed laser would be the most compact, high-power, solid-state blue laser source currently available.  Within the lidar market there are many organizations that would be potential customers for an ocean penetrating blue lidar transmitter for bathymetry and underwater object detection: the Navy, NOAA, the EPA, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and the Coast Guard for instance. The delivered lidar system would provide the Navy with the capability to conduct rapid and widespread object detection beneath the ocean surface from an airborne platform.  This will be an invaluable tool for searching for submarines, mines, and mapping the ocean floor.  Bridger envisions a wide variety of additional applications for this laser including gas sensing lidar, hard-target ranging, ablation applications including mass spectrometry, nonlinear spectroscopy and as general purpose OPO pump.  The proposed transmitter could easily be adapted to detect a host of gasses, most of which are detected in the short wave infrared and mid-infrared spectral regions which are well suited for a seeded OPO pumped either with the 946 or 473 nm beam.",Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Visible

Commercial applications include wireless (WiMAX, 3G, 4G) and fiber optic communication (40G and 100G Ethernet). The ramp-up of 100G Ethernet technologies raises the industry's demand for adequate test equipment. Therefore, the proposed ADC has great commercialization potential in this market segment. Possible military applications include high speed, secure communication and data transmission systems and millimeter-resolution radars.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage)"

Alphacore ASIC will have a 3 GSPS (gigasamples per second), 12-bit, 340mW, radiation hard ADC and a 128-band, low-power digital filter bank. The total power consumption of the ASIC is less than one watt (0.87W). The ASIC will be developed in a small-geometry CMOS technology (28nm) that is inherently tolerant to high radiation doses. Single event effect mitigation strategies will be used as well in this ASIC. Alphacore has been developing IP in this process, including current mode logic (CML) transceivers and phase-locked loop (PLL) that can be leveraged in this program.The proposed system�s front end ADC employs an innovative topology with a high-bandwidth front-end sampling circuit combined with an interpolated flash ADC and a back-end DSP that employs 128-band polyphaser filter bank using ultra low power synthesizable digital logic. The system is programmable and it is optimized to provide the user the most useful data available for effective RFI mitigation.  The system is also designed to be scalable to other missions.","Alphacore's technology supports NASA radiometer microwave sensors for a wide range of Earth observation applications. Examples of missions using the proposed RFI mitigating receiver back end technology are SMAP, and Jason missions. The Jason missions currently have radiometers that use analog band-pass filters. The future missions (Jason-CS / Sentinel A, and Jason-CS / Sentinel B) can significantly benefit from this low-power receiver ASIC that has on-chip ADC, digital filters and is optimized for RFI mitigation. Other example missions that can benefit from a radiation-hardened, high-speed, low-power ADC include solar system exploration missions (Europa Clipper, TSSM, VESPER, MARVEL, comet nucleus return, New Discovery and Living with a Star), Mars missions (MAVEN) and lunar orbiters and landers. The Jupiter-bound missions, such as the Europa Clipper and Io Volcano Observer missions, can greatly benefit from the ADC due to its high radiation hardness.","While the initial development of the ASIC targets the stringent requirements of NASA's space-based Earth observing radiometer applications, the receiver back-end also has wide applicability to commercial and defense space missions that measure the humidity of soil, atmosphere or the height of the ocean surface, as an example.The developed system is also very similar to the ones used to read out kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays that have wide applicability to radio astronomy experiments. One of the large scale experiments is Large Size Telescope (LST). The developed ASIC can be scaled to support KID array readout.The standalonerad-hard  ADC has impressive performance and finds strong market potential in defense, communication, test equipment, medical imaging, high-energy physics experiments and high speed digitizer boards.  The Government defense space industry, including satellite programs of Air Force, NRO, MDA, and Army will benefit from a high-performance radiation-hard ADC. Among these programs are AEHF upgrades, GPS follow-ons, MDA's PTSS, Air Force's TacSat family, Operationally Responsive Space (ORS), and Army's SMDC nanosat family. The defense CubeSat programs, including NRO's Colony program and the Air Force SENSE program will also benefit. Commercial space platforms that will benefit from the proposed rad-hard ADC include both LEO and GEO telecommunication satellites, such as Intelsat, Direct TV, XM radio, Orbcomm and Iridium.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); Data Modeling (see also Testing & Evaluation); GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Interferometric (see also Analysis); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)"

Our proposed plan is to take advantage of our PolyStrata� ultra-low loss micro-coax transmission lines, high power high efficiency GaN power amplifier and Low Noise Amplifiers to provide a transceiver with over 10 Watts of CW RF power and with less than 6dB of received Noise Figure. The integrated PolyStrata micro-coax assemblies allow for a paradigm shift in design and manufacturing of advanced microwave and millimeter wave components supported by ultra-low loss transmission lines (0.03 dB/mm at 94 GHz), ultra-wideband (no cut-off), very high isolation (>80 dB) and no dispersion. This together with the highest functional density, integrated thermal management, scalability in power handling and frequency of operation enable novel architectures to be built in which the usual performance tradeoffs would no longer be necessary. In recent years, Nuvotronics has demonstrated multiple high power SSPAs from 30 GHz to 240 GHz, enabling mmW components using the disruptive PolyStrata micro-coax technology. Our architecture will also offer excellent thermal management using the PolyStrata bulk copper thermal conductivity of 400W/mK and the 3D RF backplane routing, which allow heat sink integrated directly under the MMICs for efficient heat spreading.","Nuvotronics is committed to transitioning this work to NASA applications for future radars and sensors for atmospheric and environmental monitoring. Compact high power transceivers are the backbone in several critical NASA missions for both communications and radar sensor sources.  The PolyStrata based transceivers offer a scalable semi-hermetic system, compatible with different NASA airborne, high altitude UAVs and CubeSat platforms. Clouds are the single most important source of uncertainty in predictions of climate sensitivity. Remote sensing instruments capable of measuring humidity inside cirrus clouds on a global scale is needed. For this reason dual-frequency cloud-profiling radar, 94 GHz cloud profiling radar in the future Aerosol/Cloud Ecosystem Mission (ACE) are being planned for deployment. This transceiver has applicability to the Cloud and Precipitation Processes Mission (CaPPM) for vision beyond the GPM dual-precipitation radar (DPR). The goal is to mature these instrument concepts to the point that they are ready for integration into a future Earth-Science Satellite such as the Snow and Cold Land Process (SCLP) mission, or the draft requirements of the Global Cloud and Precipitation Mission (GPCM). Furthermore, synthetic aperture radar imaging, and other ground-based radars, utilize high power transceivers.","Millimeter operation offers tremendous opportunity for diverse applications such high data rate communication, synthetic aperture radar imaging and aircraft landing systems, but the challenges of creating microwave circuits become exponentially harder at these frequencies.  Compounding an already difficult paradigm, these solutions need to address applications that are extremely cost sensitive and high volume (thus any solution must be mass producible). The PolyStrata technology offers a revolutionary solution by compartmentalizing all of the microwave ""challenges"" into a single integrated component that can be placed on a standard printed circuit board. In most long term forecasts, demand for mobile broadband data is insatiable.  According to the FCC, ""in a span of 10 to 15 years, the world's cellular operators increased capacity by 20x while demand increased by more than 100x"". The transceiver Nuvotronics will be developing in this research will have many commercial applications in mm-wave radio solutions from point to point application to switch beam antenna array.

Apart from the detector, the performance of these FPAs is determined by the Read-Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) that amplifies and multiplexes photo generated charge for signal processing by peripheral circuitry.In this project we propose to develop a new ROIC for low background applications, specifically designed to overcome present limitations of image persistence and inter-pixel capacitance (IPC). The main innovation in this project is an adaptive unit cell that can be individually and randomly programmed via on-chip logic to control bias state and reset duration of any pixel in the array while the integration of science data is on-going.In Phase I we will conduct a pixel trade study and performance evaluation for a Capacitive Trans-Impedance Amplifier (CTIA) and a source follower per detector (SFD) type pixel using analog circuit simulations. Then we will generate the optimum unit cell layout, define the overall architecture and create the top level schematic. By the end of Phase I we will have completed the blue prints for the design. The completion of the top level schematics, verified through simulation, is a critical milestone in the development. It substantially reduces the risk associated with creating new ROIC technology and will allow us to efficiently fabricate and test the device in Phase II. All results from Phase I will be documented in a preliminary Interface Control Document (ICD) so that the new ROIC can be considered for future missions.In Phase II we will produce the layout of the entire chip for fabrication using stitching lithography in a state of the art CMOS foundry and demonstrate its functionality on packaged prototypes.

The operating temperatures and overall thickness will be used as part of a trade-off study designed to achieve the quantum efficiency and dark current program goals. Shockley-Read-Hall minority carrier lifetimes of T2SLs are predicted to increase due to hydrogen-passivation, leading to larger signal-to-noise ratios for improved range of detection, enhanced discrimination capabilities, or operation at higher temperatures. Reducing the electrical activity of defects by passivating them with hydrogen is equivalent to lowering their density, and has proven successful in other semiconductor systems. The proposed hydrogenation technique makes use of the same dry-etch equipment employed during FPA manufacturing, making it easy to implement. In addition to the potential to remove the deleterious effects of bulk material defects, ICP hydrogenation also improves the detector's surface passivation quality. Smaller pixels, reduced integration times, and systems with larger fields-of-view will be realized, allowing the imaging of fast changing scenes over long ranges.","Large format VLWIR FPAs will be a valuable asset for a variety of Earth, planetary and astrophysics science experiments that require infrared imaging.

The goal is to achieve 4um spectral resolution with wide dynamic range to measure both the Sun's and the Moon's radiometric characteristics. Currently the best known infrared photon detectors used for spectroscopy are based on MCT. With an adjustable bandgap and little lattice mismatch, MCT photon detectors with high quantum efficiency are sensitive to a very broad spectral range. The proposing company, EPIR, is the leading small business in MCT growth, characterization and focal plane array (FPA) fabrication. The spectroscopic filter is an important component of any spectrometer. Compared with other technologies, e.g. Michelson or Offner interferometers, the proposed AOTF offers high spectral resolution, with the advantages of high speed, programmable waveband selection flexibility, and arbitrary wavelength step size. An AOTF has no moving parts and can be integrated with a MCT photodetector monolithically. The biggest advantage of the proposed spectrometer is its compact system design that reduced size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP), offering significant benefits to the payload as well as in the operation of missions.","The compact, short wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectrometer, or hyperspectral camera fabricated by integrating a MCT-based PD or focal plane array FPA with an AOTF, has huge potential applications in future NASA missions to Mars, Jupiter, and other space exploration missions. Besides quantitative irradiance or radiance measurements and calibrations of celestial bodies, atmospheric infrared absorption spectra, or the reflectivity of the ground soil often reveal the identity of the atmospheric composition and the mineral structures of an unknown planets, and are of significant importance to study the formation and the history of alien planets as well as monitoring and surveying different characteristics of Earth.","The infrared PDs have applications in threat warning systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) ground and airborne, including small to medium size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile threat defense. This technology would also be applicable for various targeting, tracking, active pixel components, countermeasures and proximity fuse applications. Since hyperspectral detection allows for unparalleled target identification, it is expected that this technology will provide a strategic advantage in missile seekers to circumvent counter-measures.The infrared PDs and FPAs also have a wide range of civilian applications, such as telecommunication via optical fibers, spectrometry, thermometry, high-end industrial manufacturing, and hotspot detection. Larger FPAs, due to their lower costs and lightweight characteristics, will have applications in astronomy, geophysics, geology, law enforcement, remote environmental sensing, search and rescue, and emergency response including firefighting. If multistage thermo-electric coolers are used, the product would also have applications for medical systems, commercial airlines, and ground transportation.",Detectors (see also Sensors); Filtering; GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Gratings; Infrared; Interferometric (see also Analysis); Radiometric; Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems)

The proposed sensor will comprise a photodiode, a Schottky diode, and an amplifier circuit fabricated in the same process flow and monolithically integrated on the same die. We will use silicon carbide as the semiconductor material, which will make the proposed work the first time an integrated silicon carbide sensor device is fabricated. The nascent semiconductor material, silicon carbide, has found widespread application in power electronics. However, its advantageous properties as an optoelectronic detector device in the UV range (transparency to visible light and very low dark current, both results of its very wide bandgap) have not been utilized widely. With the proposed work, we therefore aim to advance the state-of-the-art in silicon carbide technology. To realize the goals of the program, which are designing and fabricating a SiC VUV detector, a SiC DUV/EUV detector, a single SiC nMOSFET, an amplifier comprised of SiC nMOSFETs, and an integrated single chip photodetector and amplifier from these individual components, we propose a work plan including process development and optimization for SiC Schottky diodes (as the VUV detector) and SiC nMOSFETs, and process optimization for SiC photodiodes (the EUV/DUV detector). We will simultaneously develop and optimize the process to fabricate all these components on the same die with the required connections to obtain a monolithic SiC detector/amplifier circuit and thereby obtain a SiC sensor-on-a-chip.","The wideband UV detection system on a chip we plan to design and fabricate should be helpful for NASA's efforts in Astrophysics, Planetary, Earth Science and Heliophysics. We expect that the new EUV, VUV and Deep UV detection system on a chip could find applications in programs that need UV sensing. NASA Solar and Terrestrial probes, such as DYNAMIC and MEDICI, the Living with a Star program (GDC), and the Explorer Mission could benefit from the wide band technology. Ozone layer depletion is letting more UV enter the earth. The technology we are proposing here should make it easier for NASA to monitor UV penetration of the atmosphere and the effect on the earth's ecosystem. Special welding methods that are being explored MSFC Advanced Welding and Manufacturing facility could benefit from the use of the system we propose to monitor the integrity of their metallurgical results. The Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter can use our system for their lunar mapping by detecting low intensity UV from stars that reflect off the lunar surface. Furthermore, the UV emission from solar storms may be of such high energy that they may disrupt systems on the earth. The wide band UV system on a chip that we propose could be used by NASA to help monitor these storms. In addition, single chip EUV, VUV and deep UV system, with associated circuitry for readout, needs little extra components and thus can be implemented in a small payload of a spacecraft.","Military and government organizations will find our UV detectors useful in their early warning systems as rockets emit in the UV region.  Furthermore, NOx compounds used in jet fuel emit in the UV spectrum when burned.  This makes our devices useful for engine monitoring systems in military and commercial aircraft.   UV spectrometry is a practice used throughout medicine in chemistry where our silicon carbide photodiodes can potentially replace existing diode/photomultiplier tubes in UV spectrometry systems, simultaneously reducing the cost and improving the accuracy of these systems.  UV is used to study reaction kinetics in chemistry.  It can also be used to distinguish between pre-cancerous growths and invasive carcinomas in head, neck, anal, cervical and breast cancer.  In hospitals, UV radiation is used to decontaminate patient rooms as DNA denatures when absorbing UV light at 260 nm.  The same process of using UV radiation as a germicidal agent can be used in hot tubs, aquariums, ice making machines, food processing, wineries, breweries and water purification.The wide-band gap of SiC results in leakage current that is substantially lower than silicon based devices on the market.  Since our SiC photodiodes can simultaneously lower the cost and decrease the detection limit of several metals, such as lead, in AAS systems.

In addition, internal defects cause spatial distortions in images. To meet the needs of hard X-ray astronomy a lower cost, more uniform and more readily available alternative to CZT is desirable.Thallium bromide (TlBr) has higher density and atomic number than CZT and therefore higher stopping power at hard X-ray energies. TlBr has a low melting point (460 ⁰C, compared to ~ 1100 ⁰C for CZT) and cubic crystal structure and can be grown from the melt by low cost techniques. As a result, TlBr has the potential to be a more efficient, lower cost alternative to CZT in the detector plane architecture developed by Harvard for use in high resolution coded-aperture telescopes.","The TlBr based spectroscopic imaging array that we propose to develop should be suitable for the next generation of wide-field hard X-ray coded-aperture imagers currently under development (cf. the ProtoEXIST and HREXI programs). It is anticipated that this technology will eventually be employed as part of a Medium Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission similar to that of the proposed Energetic X-Ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) and will probe X-ray transient phenomena with an improved sensitivity, energy resolution and angular resolution.

The addition of fluorescence lifetime measurements distinguishes it from other compact, field-portable instruments available. The instrument will require no reagents or consumables and by simply placing the instrument on a sample of rock, soil, or ice, or other material it will be able to detect a wide range of organics (at or below the 10-100 ppb-level) including free aromatic amino acids; biomarkers including F420 (specific to methanogens), NADH, and proteins; PAHs; and porphyrins (e.g. chlorophyll). It will be designed with flight in mind so that mass, volume, and power-usage will be minimized as much as possible. The use of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and/or avalanche photodiodes (APDs) will make the system compact and rugged and thus suitable for future missions and ongoing field and laboratory studies.","A flight version of FLEXEMS could be used on nearly any NASA mission that has the detection and identification of organics as one of its goals. Because FLEXEMS is inherently a stand-off instrument requiring no consumables, it requires no complicated sample-handling and can take a variety of different form-factors to suit the mission architecture: flow-through measurements of extraterrestrial water or melted ices; surface measurements of ices or minerals; integrated into optical microscopes or microfluidic platforms; etc. Because FLEXEMS requires no consumables, it could be used indefinitely making it especially well-suited for long-duration missions where it could serve as both a primary instrument or a triage instrument for other instruments that may have a limited number of uses. Target extraterrestrial bodies FLEXEMS would be ideal to explore include Europa, Enceladus, comets and asteroids, Mars, and the permanently-shadowed craters of Moon. Additionally, its miniature size makes it suitable for Small- Sat missions to study organics such as O/OREOS. For terrestrial use, it will allow researchers in NASA's Space Science and Astrobiology Division to quantify the presence of different minerals and organics during analog field research and laboratory research.","FLEXEMS has many uses outside of NASA.

For exploration missions to hostile environments, such as those around Jupiter, Venus or Mercury, the dose to the scintillation material can become high, rendering them useless in a short time frame.  A common practice to mitigate these effects is to anneal the scintillation materials, yet for the most advanced materials (hermetically packaged) that have unique properties that can be exploited (such as particle species discrimination based on the transient light response), there is no practical method or process to anneal them.  For various experiments, the largest scintillation crystal possible may be ideal, yet when attempting to build an instrument inside a small spacecraft, such as a 3-6U cubesat, SiPMs are the only option to optically readout the crystal.  Unless the energy spectrum can be compromised, a large crystal will require a large SiPM array, and to obtain the best performance from the detector, the array would need to be cooled.  In both of these cases, the temperature of the scintillator and SiPM are modified for a specific purpose.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a scintillator detector module for gamma ray and neutron detection that will provide mitigation strategies for reducing radiation and temperature effects.","The development of this technology will serve instruments for planetary science missions. In the latest planetary science Decadal Survey (DS), gamma-ray and neutron spectrometers are explicitly mentioned for a potential New Frontier mission ? Trojan Tour and Rendezvous. Among missioned identified, these detectors could be used to examine the surface of a comet for sample return (Comet Surface Sample Return), the surface of the moon for sample return (Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Sample Return), lateral variations in the structure and composition of the lunar crust (Lunar Geophysical Network), and the surface of Venus in-situ (Venus In Situ Explorer).  These potential missions could be proposed later in 2016 and onward.","The robust testing required for space flight leads to high-quality terrestrial instrument that will have uses for military and homeland security applications.  Scintillation detectors are used in security applications where the temperature conditions fluctuate and handling is done without care, which is also valid for oil-well logging.  For other applications, such as radiation monitors at nuclear reactors, the radiation tolerance must be high as the instruments can be exposed to low-doses for multiple years.  Our technology will be an excellent fit for personal Radiation Detectors (PRD), Spectroscopic Radiation Detectors (SPRD), in Radioisotope Identification Devices (RIIDs), Area Monitors, and in Stand-off detectors.",Composites; Ionizing Radiation; X-rays/Gamma Rays

The heat flow probe has already been designed and tested to reach a depth of 3m and will be installed underground by an existing gas jet drilling method. By burying an innovative, broadband, optical seismometer along with the heat flow probe, we can accomplish all of the goals of a high-mass, high-power surface seismic station with minimal mass and power. While this method currently allows installation at depths of 3m - we make maximum use of this environment - our sensor anticipates possible deployments at much greater depths. In the proposed work we will build and test a full working prototype of this seismometer. We will test it under lunar environmental conditions (vacuum, temperature and simulated regolith), bringing this instrument concept (TRL2) to a tested prototype (TRL4).","This instrument is directly designed to address the NASA Planetary Science Decadal Survey call for a Lunar Geophysical Network (LGN) mission. We are working with colleague Clive Neal, of University of Notre Dame, on the proposal of a LGN for the next available New Frontiers mission opportunity. Such a mission will need to by necessity of cost be incredibly miniaturized in both mass and power. We do not believe current seismological equipment can provide the low mass, high signal-to-noise, and low power required for such a mission. Our system can meet the needs of this mission and will automatically accompany the geothermal heat probe elements of the geophysical network, which already need to access the subsurface. A compact probe can be placed in the subsurface by proposed conventional auger drills (such as developed by partner Honeybee Robotics), which could enable global access to any solid surface solar system body (Mars,Europa, Titan...).  On icy bodies, such as Europa, subsurface melting devices (cryobots) should carry a small seismic and heat flow package. Placed into the subsurface aboard a melting probe, our system would provide information on the thickness and internal structure of an icy crust while simultaneously providing a nearly isothermal environment with protection from surface radiation. Such an instrument could also be sent to the Polar ice caps of Mars, where our high-frequency strengths would provide incredible detail on internal layering.","Energy Efficiency/Renewable Energy Related Research and Research and Development.Advanced Seismic Instrumentation Research Company (ASIR) is the new realization of the PI?s long-term commitment to seismic instrumentation and installation-technology development.

An important aspect of this technology is the potential for the low-cost (<$30M/mission) in-situ quantification of off-world resources. Indeed, the recent NEO Trajectory Opportunities Study asked, What is the elemental and mineralogical composition and water content of primitive bodies? while the recent National Research Council Planetary Science Decadal Survey indicated that laser spectroscopy is a key technology that will provide answers via in situ measurement of off-world trace-gas species in various space-flight missions. Towards that end, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop an ultra-low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) in-situ integrated optical sensor for the sensitive measurement of trace gases, initially water vapor. The novel sensor architecture, based on open-path Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy (TDLAS), will serve as a platform for a family of sensors, each able to detect one of the gaseous species of interest to NASA. The proposed project focuses on using novel manufacturing and engineering design concepts to create a sensor measurement head that detects <10 ng/cm3 water vapor in a 1cm optical path as part of a 10g, 1cm3 package. When combined with PSI's integrated electronics, the complete sensor SWaP is expected to be on the order of 500 g, 100 cm3 , and <600 mW, nominally 10-100X better than the current state-of-the-art.PSI's Phase I Program objective is a laboratory bench-top demonstration proving the feasibility of the compact packaging design in meeting both the spectroscopic goals and the SWaP needs for future inter-planetary CubeSat missions. This will entail the design and fabrication of an integrated optical water vapor sensor and the experimental demonstration of water vapor measurements with chemical resolution relevant to in situ resource quantification.","PSI will create a platform for highly sensitive laser-based sensors on a chip-like platform suitable for packaging in a housing comparable to a cell phone and amenable to volume production. The proposed sensor platform will be directly applicable to NASA CubeSat space exploration missions.Although TDLAS technology is not much more complex than that of CD players, currently the smallest and lowest cost available TDLAS sensors weigh about 1.5 kg and cost ~$10,000. The high cost results from using: 1) laser packages produced in relatively low volumes yielding costs of greater than $1000 each; 2) bulk optical components; 3) control and acquisition electronics built from commercial discrete components. These costs limit TDLAS applications to low-volume markets where the expensive sensor provides an economic payback. The NASA need for sensors of low size, weight, and power provides an opportunity to develop and apply novel manufacturing techniques that overcome these cost barriers.","Success in project Phases I-III will lead to a new paradigm for highly sensitive and selective laser-based gas sensors. These sensors will be designed for high volume manufacturing using established micromachining or semiconductor fabrication techniques at costs enabling widespread deployment. While this proposal specifically addresses NASA planetary exploration mission needs for trace-gas detection, the products deriving from this technology can also address applications including wide-area networked sensing of toxic industrial chemicals and chemical weapons, greenhouse gas measurement networks, and other industrial, commercial, medical, environmental and consumer applications for trace gas sensors where cost, size, and complexity currently hinder widespread acceptance. Defense and Homeland Security applications of unattended ground sensors may also be supported by results of this project.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Essential Life Resources (Oxygen, Water, Nutrients); Health Monitoring & Sensing (see also Sensors); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing)"

B, Lafayette, CO 80026 - 8868",(303) 396-8536,3,4,"Even though gaseous methane (CH4) is a comparatively sparse constituent in Earth�s atmosphere, it is the third most impactful greenhouse gas after water vapor and carbon dioxide, and the second most important in terms of anthropogenic drivers.  Methane is some 60 times more effective than CO2 in absorbing long-wavelength radiation, because the methane absorption lines in that part of the spectrum are less saturated and have less overlap with water vapor lines.  Natural and agricultural sources of methane continue to dominate, but are difficult to separate and quantify.  World-wide, rice cultivation, biomass burning, ruminant farm animals, and fossil fuel mining and usage have long been the most powerful drivers, but with climate change these sources could be dwarfed in the future by the release of enormous quantities of methane from melting permafrost and/or methane hydrates currently buried deep in ocean sediment.  Innovative new remote sensing technologies need to address the atmospheric methane concentration measurement problem for NASA and other applications.Beyond Photonics proposes to investigate specific very compact pulsed lidar designs near the 1.645-micron wavelengths of interest by NASA for atmospheric methane (CH4) and potentially water vapor in the same nominal wavelength region.  Specifically, methane concentration from moderate-sized unmanned aerial vehicles of NASA�s choice will be a focus; this application puts particular emphasis on decreasing size, weight, and prime power (SWaP) and eliminating active laser component cooling.  Particular emphasis will also be placed on ensuring that the lidar designs are compatible with scaling to space qualification in future such programs.  Emphasis will also be placed on technical approaches with good operational flexibility in terms of pulse energy and duration, frequency agility, and application to other IR and SWIR wavelengths.","Potential NASA applications of the proposed low-SWaP, UAV-borne methane IPDA sensor include identification and quantification of atmospheric methane sources and sinks on a finer spatial scale than currently possible, immediately valuable for climate model improvement and atmospheric sciences.  Water vapor concentration can be readily added to such an instrument for further functional enhancement and utility.  The single frequency Q-switched Er:YAG lasers developed in this effort will also be applicable to aerosol backscatter measurement and Doppler winds measurement applications.  The emphasis on very compact and electrically efficient operation will enhance the potential of such lasers in numerous current and planned NASA missions.  IPDA DIAL lidar advancements associated with the proposed work relate directly to transmitter laser, seed laser, transmitted energy monitoring and calibration, and associated photonic component requirements of NASA programs such as CO2 IPDA, ASCENDS, and LAS.","Potential non-NASA commercial applications are of great interest to Beyond Photonics in terms of low cost, compact DIAL product development, as evidenced in our use of company IRAD to further the proposed effort.  We ultimately envision commercial development of small, rugged, compact differential absorption lidar (DIAL) sensors for airborne (UAV) methane and CO2 atmospheric constituent detection and characterization.

FSLI will provide the size and concentration of particles in the 0.1 to 5 micron range while DH will provide the size, concentration and shape of particles larger than 5 micron. Accurate measurements with FSLI rely on precisely knowing the intensity of the illumination beam at the position of the particle. An innovative fiber optic bundle will select for measurement the particles that cross the very center of the illumination beam where the intensity is uniform and known. The proposed DH strategy will employ small CCD with fast data transfer to enable continued scanning of the atmosphere over many meters or even hundreds of meters. Both technologies will employ small, low power components making them suitable for UAV operation. The Phase I work will include modeling and experimental demonstrations culminating with the conceptual design of a field prototype system.","Applications include the characterization of particles in the Earth atmosphere as well as environmental sensing of planetary and lunar missions. Other NASA applications include characterizing liquid water content in icing facilities, and measuring fuel spray distributions associated with gas turbines and other propulsion systems.","Commercial applications include measuring bioaerosols (e.g. pollen, molds), characterizing droplet size and concentration in agricultural sprays, fire sprinklers, ink jet printers, diesel injectors, and numerous food processes.

Therefore in situ measurements of absorption and backscattering, as functions of wavelength, along with in situ and satellite radiometery, are key to refinement and calibration of legacy ocean color algorithms, as well as development of next generation ocean color products such as phytoplankton functional type. Currently, commercial instruments exist for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral absorption coefficient, but no instrument exists for measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient.We propose to develop an active sensor for in situ measurement of the hyperspectral backscattering coefficient. We are considering a design based on a broadband white source (chopped), monochromator for varying the source beam wavelength, and hyperspectral detectors (receiving at 2-3 angles) using spectrometers that track the monochromator. There are several configurations of the source, monochromator, spectrometer, and detector that can be considered the aim of the proposed work is to simulate a number of instrument configurations and assess technical and commercial feasibility of such hyperspectral backscattering instrument.The proposed instrument addresses a critical gap in the field of currently available systems for measuring hyperspectral IOPs in situ, in support of hyperspectral ocean color missions.","The novel proposed sensor for measuring hyperspectral backscattering has wide applicability in the field of ocean optics and ocean biology and biogeochemistry. There are currently no instruments available that make this measurement.NASA scientists and NASA-funded researchers,especially those working on risk reduction and optical IOP-radiometric closure studies as well as phytoplankton functional group algorithms, and increasingly complex biogeochemical and ecosystem models are currently hindered by a lack of ground truth hyperspectral backscattering data. Given the current push within NASA programs in preparation for launch of the PACE ocean color mission and EXPORTS field campaign, development of this system is very timely.","Similar to the NASA applications, the target market for the proposed instrument is broad.

A powerful technique to help constrain source and sink strengths in GHG exchange processes is the analysis of the relative proportions of isotopic variants of GHG's.   In this proposal, we focus on the most important GHG:  carbon dioxide.  The standard isotopes of carbon dioxide (13C-CO2 and 18O-CO2) are already being measured on a global scale  (for example by NOAA and INSTAAR within the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network).  We propose to demonstrate and commercialize new isotopic measurement capabilities for more exotic isotopes of carbon dioxide that are difficult to measure with existing techniques.  Specifically, we propose using Tunable Infrared Laser Direct Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS) to measure the primary clumped isotope of CO2 (Δ13C18O16O) and to simultaneously measure the mass independent 17O content (Δ17O).  The proposed instrument will directly measure atmospheric samples with no need for chemical separation and will report isotopic ratios with 0.02 per mil repeatability and with time resolution of 2 to 3 minutes.  The instrument will be sufficiently compact to be field or flight deployable thus providing the possibility of continuous high accuracy measurements of Δ13C18O16O and Δ17O rather than occasional flask samples.","This technology will be complementary to and supportive of NASA's substantial effort to provide global monitoring of carbon dioxide (OCO-2, ASCENDS, etc).  The powerful constraints provided by isotopic measurements of carbon dioxide can help achieve the stated goals of the ASCENDS mission, namely to provide improved ability to predict/model long-term changes in the climate cycle based both on the understanding of the natural processes driving the variability of natural carbon sources and sinks, and on the transport of carbon through the atmosphere. In addition, NASA plays a leading part in the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP).  USGCRP has a pivotal role in implementing President Obama's Climate Action Plan, including the responsibility to grow the knowledge base needed to respond to a changing climate and a transforming world.   The technology being developed in the proposed project will provide a crucial new tool to quantify the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide.","In addition to being an important research tool, this laser isotope monitor will be helpful to climate treaty verification and to the enforcement and verification of carbon cap and trade systems.  For example, the climate agreements that were negotiated at the recent COP 21 meeting in Paris require that nearly every country will need to begin assembling detailed inventories of their greenhouse-gas emissions.  Creating verifiable carbon dioxide budgets on this scale will require extensive and sophisticated carbon dioxide measurements systems and isotopic constraints will be extremely useful if not essential.  The market for monitoring carbon dioxide is already large and will grow dramatically in coming years as the world begins to truly grapple with challenge of climate change.  Isotopic measurements of carbon dioxide are certain play a significant role.","Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Chemical/Environmental (see also Biological Health/Life Support); Infrared; Lasers (Measuring/Sensing)"

The nanomembrane structure combined with NanoSonic's patented self-assembly processing approach allow a unique way to tune sensitivity and selectivity. The wireless sensor system would be capable of sensing multiple heavy metal materials, improve upon conventional sampling methods in terms of cost, sensitivity, and selectivity, and benefit future environmental analysis programs.

An appreciation of the instrumentation issues obtained by working with such areas would allow improvements in sensor materials, electronics and packaging, and potentially allow the transition of related products to operational platforms. The commercialization potential of the NM sensor technology developed through this NASA SBIR program lies in three areas, namely 1) detect and map environmentally-hazardous chemical concentrations, 2) locate sources of pollution from analysis of concentration gradients, and 3) identify chemical concentrations potentially harmful to people and/or destructive to industry/agriculture.","Primary non-NASA customers would be university, government laboratory and industry researchers.

This new instrument will enable the scientific community to expand atmospheric and oceanic research and monitoring applications, and to advance lunar and interplanetary exploration horizons. The new architecture is based on the use of polarization-analyzing components made with custom thin-film optical coatings. As a result of this new approach, wavelengths shorter than 400 nm can be readily analyzed, and simultaneous measurements can be accomplished without the need for birefringent, electrically modulated parts, or moving components. The unique architecture is well suited for extended space missions because it satisfies low power and weight budget requirements, has inherently high radiation tolerance, and uses photometrically stable passive components to insure extended operational life. It incorporates a built-in photometric stability monitoring system. The Phase I effort will refine the design concept and optics components, and a proof-of-concept device will be build and performance will be evaluated. The majority of components are off-the-shelf. Results will be applicable to the construction of a prototype in Phase II.","Applications of the passive portable polarimeter include space missions for earth climate and resource monitoring as well as moon surface studies. Scenes of interest for climate and earth resource monitoring include aerosols, dust and smoke, water and ice clouds, greenhouse gases, vegetation and ground surfaces, hydrosols, oceanic biogeochemistry related to color dissolved organic matter (CDOM), phytoplankton blooms, and chlorophyll density. Extension of measurements to wavelengths as short as ~280 nm is desired for more complete characterization and monitoring of aerosol and ocean color properties that are associated with the effects of climate change. Monitoring of sources of aerosols such as wind-blown dust, industrial air and water pollution, biomass burning, and ocean hydrosols will be advanced. Data collected at shorter wavelengths with the polarimeter will improve accuracy of satellite climate-related retrievals such as those generated by MODIS and VIIRS systems. An additional application is for secure undersea and atmospheric communications. The discrimination of man-made surfaces (textures) from natural surfaces is made possible, and applications include homeland security, battlefield, and vehicle and aircraft detection. In aviation, automotive, and marine environments, distinguishing layers of ice from liquid water on wings can provide hazard warning. Detection of cancerous cells and disease identification is made possible through polarization imaging.","Our novel polarimeter design can be applied to several commercial industries including medical, aviation, and automotive. Polarimetry can be used in medical and clinical trials to detect and identify abnormal scatter patterns due to burns and melanoma and in deeper tissues.  Analysis of the polarized light scattered by biological media such as skin and tissues contains surface texture and microstructure information might be useful in disease identification and wound healing progress. Detection of cancerous cells is made possible through polarization imaging [14]. Recent research has suggested that cancerous protein and DNA products in blood can be identified through interaction with circular polarization that is induced by the chiroptical activity of gold nano particlesNatural surfaces exhibit different light scattering properties than man-made surfaces, and through polarimetry, a more complete characterization can be made, thus permitting the ability to distinguish the two surfaces. For example, large differences in polarization, linear and elliptical, are found between metals and dielectrics such as paint and glass.

Cooling loads for these detectors will range from 0.25 W to 1.0 W at the primary load site, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems.  Due to jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is required.  In addition, a multistage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency and lowest mass.  Turbomachine-based Brayton cryocoolers are ideal candidates for these applications because they are highly efficient, lightweight, vibration-free, multistage compatible, and have long maintenance-free lifetimes.

The vision of the low-temperature and input power Deep Space Cryocooler System (DSCS) is to advance the state of the art in Cryocooler systems by developing a low-cost single stage cryocooler, designed to target low heat rejection temperatures (150K) and low cold-tip temperatures (35K), and integrate it with a set of high reliability, micro-sized Low Cost Cryocooler Electronics (μLCCE) customized to operate efficiently at very low power levels (10W). Additionally, the low-cost, light weight, and small size of the DSCS will enable instrumentation on miniature satellite platforms. A key objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate cryogenic cooling technologies for science measurement capabilities with smaller, more affordable spacecraft and concurrently reducing system risk, cost, size, and development time, consistent with NASA SBIR Science Subtopic S1.09.In the Phase I effort, the uLCCE brassboard will improve upon the mLCCE (TRL6 in 2016) design by evaluating a handful of candidate improvements that will reduce the SWaP requirements of the electronics.  Detailed circuit modeling will verify performance of key parameters , which will then inform the final schematic and layout of the uLCCE.  The accompanying Thermo-Mechanical Unit will be designed by Lockheed Martin. The conceptual coldhead design leverages their existing TRL 6 Microcryocooler, and will introduce design improvements to target the low heat reject and cold-tip temperatures specified in this solicitation.  The design approach will be confirmed with detailed thermodynamic modeling.  A prototype uLCCE and upgraded microcryocooler will be built and integration tested in a future Phase II effort.","NASA's Interplanetary, Solar System, and Astrophysics missions are examples of the type of deep-space mission we are targeting with this proposed effort. A complete system that can enable science instruments to be deployed on small, low-cost spacecraft will greatly extend NASA's R&D capabilities. Past MCS and CCS programs laid the groundwork for miniaturization of Iris Technology's CCE, while the DSCS venture will bring that capability to even lower power, smaller size, deep-space missions. The Europa missions could immediately benefit from this product, and as technology advancements are pushing boundaries deeper into Space, the DSCS can also serve as a foundation for future planetary exploration. The New Frontiers initiative has already launched several probes to Pluto, Jupiter, and distant asteroids, and has the future mission scope of exploring Saturn, additional asteroids, or Venus. These destinations would require similar performance targets put forth by this SBIR solicitation. Additionally, NASA is on the verge of launching Mars Cube One, the first demonstration of CubeSats that have flow in deep space. If proven successful, the number of CubeSat missions reaching deeper into space is also likely to increase. The DSCS's small size and weight, and low power requirements make CubeSats an ideal platform, and they would increase the scientific capability of these small satellites.","Iris' Cryocooler Control Electronics portfolio has been gaining increasing interest as measured by the ROM requests we have been receiving from the larger Aerospace Industry.  Companies such as Lockheed Martin, Harris Corporation, Honeywell Hymatic, and Raytheon, have all expressed interest in our mLCCE to our larger sized HP-LCCE products, and we expect this interest to grow with an expanded portfolio.  The addition of the uLCCE increases commercial application to both low-power applications with small SWaP requirements, and those applications extending to deeper space. More broadly, the basic uLCCE physical and firmware architectures are supportive of a wide range of mission needs, such as battery charging, heater control, panel actuation, pointing mechanisms, etc. The current potential commercial applications for the DSCS range from supporting imagery and surveillance capabilities, with a strong outlook for additional applications.","Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Command & Control; Cryogenic/Fluid Systems"

This Phase I research proposal will begin development of a 1015-segment MEMS DM. It will result in a completed CAD layout of the DM, a conceptual package design, a conceptual electrical probe card design, and the fabrication of a key layer in the actuator process to demonstrate high-resolution field-stitched photolithography. The ultimate goal is to develop flight-like hardware based on Iris AO�s proven hybrid MEMS DM technology. The increased spatial resolution afforded by the development here will enable picometer resolution DMs required to reach 10^10 contrast levels necessary for direct detection of Earth-sized terrestrial planets.","Iris AO technology can be a key enabling component in a host of future NASA missions, including the space telescopes of the SMEX, DISCOVERY and FLAGSHIP programs, and also technological development funded by the SAT and Exoplanet Research programs. Four recent mission concepts (Exo-C, WFIRST, EXCEDE, ACESAT) require multiple DMs to implement coronagraphs. One of these, ACESAT, which was submitted to SMEX, specifically requires MEMS DMs due to their low cost, low weight and low consumption. ATLAST, the next flagship space telescope, may likely be equipped with a VNC planet-finder as the VNC is compatible with segmented primary mirrors and obscurations. Similarly, the emergence of low-cost CubeSats for astronomy and Earth observations suggests that MEMS adaptive-optics technology could be common in the future. Finally, future NASA-funded instruments for ground-based telescope projects like the Extremely Large Telescopes (Thirty Meter Telescope, Giant Magellan Telescope and E-ELT), would likely require adaptive optics to remove aberrations from atmospheric turbulence. Another potential area for Iris AO technology is in laser communications with satellites. Iris AO DMs are capable of handling tens to hundreds of Watts of optical power with dielectric coatings. The DMs could be used to compensate for atmospheric turbulence that inhibits downlink and uplink bandwidth.","The proposed adaptive optics technology would find immediate application in several military communications and imaging products. Systems used in military surveillance such as the Predator and Global Hawk would benefit from the high-resolution, light weight, and low power consumption afforded by Iris AO's MEMS. Atmospheric correction enabled by these low-cost but highly capable devices would benefit space situational awareness surveillance applications as well. In the commercial sector, adaptive optics has been employed in research systems in biological imaging, most notably in vision science and microscopy. Several research universities are reporting results using AO-equipped systems. The high segment-count devices enabled by this proposal would lead to unprecedented levels of spatial fidelity for biological imaging applications. Other commercial applications include metrology, laser processing, coherent combination of multiple fiber lasers, and laser beam quality improvement and drift compensation. Iris AO segmented mirrors are uniquely well suited to higher power applications such as laser processing, combining fiber lasers, and laser beam quality improvement. This advantage lies in the relatively thick segments that enable the use of dielectric coatings which tend to warp conventional surface micromachined MEMS DMs. The precision open-loop operation of Iris AO DMs greatly simplifies the use of DMs in these applications.",Adaptive Optics; Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and smaller; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Mirrors; Prototyping

Telescopes with Apertures of 4-meters or larger and using an internal coronagraph require a telescope wavefront stability that is on the order of 10 pico-meters RMS per 10 minutes. Interest is also for IR/FIR missions requiring 8-meter or larger diameter mirrors with cryogenic deformations <100 nm RMS.  Fantom Materials is specifically responding to the need for ultra-stable mirror support structure traceable to the needs of Cosmic Origins for UVOIR, Exo and FIR telescopes, including mirror support structures, whiffle plates, delta frames and strongbacks. HoneySiC material has multiple features that make it very attractive as a potential future deployment hinge and latching material: 1) It's an additively manufactured Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) with no Coefficient of Moisture Expansion (CME). Individually molded parts become a monolithic construct, thus it is possible to manufacture an entire telescope using HoneySiC, 2) It's extremely light weight; laminate HoneySiC sheets have the same density as beryllium and honeySiC panels have about 1/5 the density of beryllium, 3) It's extremely dimensionally stable due to a zero-CTE across a temperature range of -200 to +25C.  The thermal conductivity can be supercharged by addition of extremely high thermal conductivity carbon nanotubes.  To achieve a stability of 10 picometer (e.g., LISA gravity wave detector mission) will require the distortion parameters to go to zero for a passive material.  The overarching objectives of the project are to collaborate with NASA MSFC, GSFC, JPL and Northrop Grumman to demonstrate new mirror mounting materials with ultra-stability. Potentially every beryllium and M55J-954-6 part could be replaced by HoneySiC, resulting in a massive reduction in labor and schedule, as well as weight.  Stiffness and dimensional stability would be greatly enhanced by HoneySiC or H2CMN.","From the present state-of-the-art it will take an 8 order-of-magnitude improvement in materials stability This project is the point of departure for ultra-stable mirror support structures made using first-generation zero CTE HoneySiC (circa 2014), and 2nd generation Hierarchical Hybrid Ceramic Matrix Nano-composite (H2CMN, circa 2016).  These extremely promising engineered ceramic matrix composite materials will replace the status quo, moisture-absorbing, organic matrix composites used in the present state-of-the-art composites, as well as to directly replace beryllium. 1st and 2nd generation HoneySiC will provide the low areal cost, low areal density, low cost and ultra-stability that is required for future EUV, UV/O and Far-IR mission telescopes.","Low cost, lightweight, dimensionally stable HoneySiC material has use in complex telescopes for Astronomy, Imaging and Remote Sensing applications, including optical instruments/telescopes which enable imaging, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions for police and paramilitary units, fire fighters, power and pipeline monitoring, search and rescue, atmospheric and ocean monitoring, imagery and mapping for resource management, and disaster relief and communications.

The technique in accomplishing this is by fabricating the lens facesheet as the top most layers in the melting process.  This way, our melting technique in producing the best possible finish on the lens surface SLM can provide. If this is successful, then performing a electro-polishing of the substrate before nickel plating the lens facesheet, single point diamond turning (SPDT) is the only time it is necessary. By developing the SLM techniques having a facesheet ROC with minimum variation, and having an optimized facesheet thickness designed for additive manufacturing, this substrate can be scaled to support flight hardware designs for UVOIR mirrors.","We recognize that NASA, even as leaders in the application of AM across the aerospace industry, is likely to take a conservative approach to adopting flight-rated SLM components.  However, we do believe there are several near-term applications.  For example, additive manufactured mirrors using the techniques we will develop in Phase 1, can be directly applied to relatively small aperture mirrors which are launch on sounding rockets.  Our current capabilities using the Concept Laser M2 are a direct fit for further development of mirror substrates to be used in infrared or ultraviolet or optical applications. A good example is the optical lens associated with missions in the Medium Class Explorers (MIDEX) TESS mission.  In addition, continued mirror development and mounting schemes, we can see the development of larger segmented mirror development for launch on the future Space Launch System.","ASTS plans to develop processes and techniques using SLM on materials such as SS316L, Inconel 718, Ti6Al4V, and copper based materials used for rocket combustion devices.  In addition, we see potential in the use of aluminum silicon based alloys, which can be used as a mirror substrate for nickel plating.  With this as an option, application for optical in infrared mirrors could be developed as a low cost solution for utilization in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for a variety of functions such as in the agriculture industry for climate and soil moisture monitoring, and in the transportation industry for delivery products or packages to residential addresses.

Our plan in this Phase I effort would be to implement our UltraForm Finishing (UFF) (a sub-aperture compliant wheel and belt type polishing process for rapid material removal from the ground/machined state to a finished work piece), with a new work piece rotary axis configuration.  The UFF rapidly removes residual grinding & cutter marks and sub-surface damage, while providing a robust solution for surface corrections on the required X-ray mandrels and cylindrical shells. Our UFF process was initially developed for high speed finishing of hard ceramic plano components and is now producing impressive test results for smoothing of critical aspheric components. OptiPro's technologically advanced optical manufacturing capabilities, along with our strong university and industry partnerships, gives us a very strong team and a clear path towards developing and commercializing the platforms which solve the difficult challenges associated with the fabrication of these large complex mirrors and cylindrical shells.  The fabrication of shells with the electroforming process and glass replication process require very accurate mandrels. The proposed Phase I plan will include the design, manufacture and assembly of a precision rotary axis.  The rotary axis will be tested on a host OptiPro UFF optical fabrication platform while polishing an Aluminum Mandrel. The part geometry will be measured with OptiPro�s �UltraSurf� a non-contact free-form measurement system. We envision that the work done during Phase I will be extended during Phase II to hyperbolic or elliptical shaped mirror surfaces. This research will position us with the information needed to develop the machine platforms needed for the fabrication and test of large mirrors and mandrels.","UltraForm Finishing (UFF) and UltraSmooth Finishing (USF) are CNC processes designed to remove grinding sub surface damage as well as mid spatial frequency errors for both relatively ""soft"" glasses as well as metals and ceramics for many applications. These applications may include the fabrication of forming mandrels used to produce multiple segmented shell mirrors for the International X-Ray Observatory (IXO) and (NXGO). The aspheric and freeform optical surfaces required by LISA and WFIRST will also benefit from the fabrication advances made with this endeavor. By integrating finite element analysis (FEA) tools with the UFF and USF computer aided manufacturing (CAM) interface, we will be able to optimize the fabrication process and subsequently reduce mid spatial frequency and slope errors. The UFF has the capability to work with a wide range of traditional optical mediums (i.e., combination of belt materials and loose abrasives) in addition to a variety of sizes of wheels. The work piece rotary axis combined with the UFF platform will provide NASA a unique tool for fabricating the current mandrel designs. The wide variety of loose and bound abrasive slurries make the UFF and USF ideal for finishing Aluminum, hard ceramics, Silicon and SiC. The UFF has shown promise for grinding as well as polishing hard ceramic surfaces.  GSFC, MSFC and JPL have requirements for the cost effective manufacture of Aluminum work pieces and glass or ceramic mandrels.","Since 1989 OptiPro has developed and refined conceptual technologies into robust deterministic machines and processes for the optical fabrication industry. Non-NASA commercial applications include the fabrication of flats, spheres, aspheres, and complex conformal shapes such as aerodynamic ogive domes. Commercialization of these technologies has developed into very cost effective solutions. The combination of UFF and USF polishing tools can be used to polish a variety of materials, removing grinding marks and subsurface damage. This makes these processes excellent candidates for applications where mid-spatial-frequency and slope surface errors are an issue such as EUV lithography. Another application is for laser amplifiers, such as the Inertial Confinement Fusion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, at the University of Rochester. For these types of applications, laser damage threshold and irradiance distribution are critical and therefore mid-spatial frequency errors need to be minimized after the polishing stage. These processes are also being utilized for many new military optical systems requiring conformal shaped optics in the very hard optical ceramics and the softer optical glasses.

Large x-ray telescopes will demand large, high stiffness, and lightweight substrates to provide rigidity to support the production of nested optical surfaces while requiring accurate alignment through the use of stable support structures. Ideally, these nested x-ray mirrors would be of heavy metal, microns in thickness and be self-supporting through launch, this is currently impractical. However, near ideal x-ray optics can be produced with the low density material of Be-38Al backing a thin layer of electroless nickel with precision single point diamond turned surfaces. The use of Be-38Al can yield lightweight, precise, and stable substrates. Coefficient of thermal expansion matching electroless nickel can be deposited thinly on top of the Be-38Al substrates, and then single point diamond turned to optical finishes. In addition, Be-38Al is a proven structural material that can be readily fabricated into precision members to create support structures to align and create entire large, athermal x-ray telescopes.","The development and verification of the Be-38Al/NiP/SPDT system to yield x-ray optics will enable future NASA large telescopes to be built and launched.

The key innovations are the use of a new interferometric modality and a novel non-contact optical probe that together measure high surface slope acceptance angles to nanometer sensitivity. When the probe is integrated with a precision motion, x, y, & z metrology frame (Phase II) (see Figure-1), it will meet NASA's need to measure free-form optical surfaces from 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameter ranging from F/2 to F/20, including slopes up to 20 degrees (with potential for 60 degrees), with an uncertainty targeted at 2 nm RMS. The probe operation does not require tilting to measure slopes. This results in this simplified cartesian metrology frame, also critical to achieve 2 nanometer measurement uncertainty. These features: nanometer resolution and 20 degree slope acceptance angle, have up to this time not been found in a single probe or sensor, non-contact or contact. This proposal integrates the spectrally controlled source and breadboard probe developed under a previous SBIR to develop a practical detection method reading the technology for a successful SBIR Phase II project.","Free-form optics, both axially and non-axially symmetric, enable small and lightweight imaging and projection optical systems required by NASA.Future NASA missions with alternative low-cost science and small-sized payloads are constrained by the traditional spherical form optics. These could benefit greatly by the free-form optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements- quoted from the NASA SBIR 2016 Phase I Solicitation. This application aims to enable those optics to be manufactured to the required tolerances to enable free-form optics to be used as envisioned. As of today there are no metrology tools available to meet the 2 nm RMS measurement uncertainty required to meet these mission requirements. Thus the primary road block to manufacturing high performance free form optics is metrology. The PROBE being developed in Phase I and implemented in Phase II is a unique approach that combines non-contact interferometric sensitivity with high surface slope acceptance. Thus the accuracy, speed and data density required for free form optics will be achieved. This combination will enable optical manufacturers to meet NASA's need to acquire nanometer level free-form optics.","The use of free form optics in commercial applications is massive, yet limited by the availability of high performance metrology. Cell phones, tablets, computers and remote mounted cameras all use axially symmetric free forms in the optical designs. The imaging quality of these systems is limited by the lens metrology. Improved metrology will mean improved consumer electronics performance and higher manufacturing yields, and potentially lower costs to manufacture. Beyond consumer imaging systems, machine vision, security and defense related imaging and industrial instrumentation all could benefit from free form optics. Non-axially symmetric free forms are needed for projection systems and illumination systems. New telescope designs at MIT Lincoln Laboratory promise wider fields of view with higher lateral resolution. Again metrology is lacking to produce these optics in the surface accuracy, data density and speed required to be commercially viable. Improved metrology means improved performance and higher manufacturing yields, and potentially lower costs to manufacture. The PROBE and Phase II  profiler will meet these commercial market needs for high density data across the whole surface.

However Ir coatings also have notoriously high stress. Coating stress will deform the thin-shell mirror substrates, degrading angular resolution. While we have previously developed a zero net-stress reflective Ir/Cr bilayer coating, we nevertheless find significant substrate deformation when these coatings are deposited onto thin-shell cylindrical mirror substrates. The source of the deformation from these zero net-stress coatings remains unclear, but is likely related to coating thickness non-uniformities and substrate edge effects. In any case, the low-frequency figure errors that currently result from the deposition of these zero net-stress coatings are beyond acceptable limits for sub-arc-second mirrors. Consequently, the problem of coating-induced substrate distortion from Ir-based reflective films must be solved in order to meet the needs of future NASA X-ray astronomy missions. The overall goal of our research is the development of zero net-stress, non-distorting Ir-based coatings for thin-shell mirror substrates that do not induce resolution-degrading substrate distortions. Specifically, we propose to develop (a) zero net-stress Ir-based coatings having film thickness that is highly uniform in two dimensions (axial and azimuthal) when deposited onto cylindrical thin-shell mirror substrates, and (b) 2D-uniformity-controlled Ir-based coatings that will be deposited on both the front (reflecting) and back (non-reflecting) surfaces of thin-shell cylindrical mirror segments, in order that the film stresses on either side of the substrate are made to balance so as to mitigate any significant substrate distortions that will degrade angular resolution.","The successful completion of our proposed SBIR activities will result in the development and commercial availability of non-distorting, X-ray reflective iridium coatings for cylindrical mirror segments that can meetthe performance goals of future NASA X-ray astronomy missions currently being formulated. These same uniform, zero net-stress Ir coatings will also be needed for the production of ultra-flat reflection gratings for X-ray astronomy.","The development of non-distorting, double-side iridium coatings may lead to new applications in the microelectronics and flat panel display industries, where distortions due to film stress are becoming increasingly important.",Gratings; Mirrors

Due to the significant manufacturing and assemble cost reductions afforded by the TAPS architecture over traditional FPS systems, the TAPS solution could be used as a direct replacement over traditional thermoelectric or other Stirling based systems in space missions.Furthermore, the TAPS technology enables architectures that are difficult, or impossible with other systems. Specifically, TAPS can easily be utilized for a combined power and cooling duplex, and some preliminary designs have been created. Such systems would enable a sustained presence in extreme planetary environments such as the surface of Venus.","Nirvana Energy Systems is currently working to commercialize the NASA technology through an exclusive patent license granted for the Alpha-STREAM technology that the TAPS technology is partially based on.

The thin cell will be built using MicroLink's signature epitaxial lift off technology and standard metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) along with City Labs' tritium betavoltaic expertise.  The proposed betavoltaic p/n junction can be stacked in a box or rolled into a cylinder and will provide a cost saving of up to 90%, while increasing energy density to up to twenty times that of lithium batteries.  Such an advanced semiconductor device will produce much higher power outputs than are possible with existing state-of-the-art devices as illustrated in the Figure.  It will provide the battery a life span in excess of 20 years with the broad-range temperature-insensitivity benefits normally associated with betavoltaics.  This increased power/energy density for tritium betavoltaics will open up pathways for significant advances in power solutions for diminutive sized, low-power microelectronic devices that may be used in Cubesat and in-space power systems.  Example applications include microwatt-to-milliwatt autonomous 20+ year sensors/microelectronics for use in structural monitoring, mesh networks, tagging and tracking wireless sensors, medical device implants, and deep space power where solar is not easily available.

The <2U system will provide 6U CubeSats with 1000m/s of deltaV at 1.2mN thrust and >1500s Isp while requiring less than 45W of power. Compared with existing state-of-the-art CubeSat thrusters, the system will provide more thrust than available gridded ion engines at lower power and without greatly penalizing Isp. Busek will develop the thruster through new innovations merged with existing, flight-qualified electrospray thruster heritage. The extremely low flow rates of high Isp electrospray thrusters permits passive feeding, where pressure vessels, regulators and their associated electronics are eliminated in favor of a natural flow regulation; freeing up valuable volume budget for additional propellant or payload. However, passive electrospray thrusters in general suffer from flow control ambiguities, leading to irrecoverable failures due to the conductive propellant degrading or shorting electrical isolators. Busek will integrate new innovations that overcome these issues into a systematic development methodology, leading to the most robust passively-fed electrospray thruster to date. The system will be capable of more 0.7kg of propellant throughput (~1000m/s deltaV for a 6U CubeSat) and be fully scalable to higher capacity.In Phase I Busek will develop a thruster head that provides >300microN of thrust and includes a never-saturated porous reservoir. The restorative capillary force of this reservoir will prevent liquid seepage and maintain consistent performance. An annular geometry will circumvent propellant and surface degradation due to edge effects. In parallel, a method for transferring IL from high open volume storage tanks to the intermediate porous reservoir will be demonstrated. Finally, the complete 1.2mN thruster, comprising an array of 4 thruster heads will be designed. Phase II, will validate this system and culminate with delivering an engineering model","NASA's 2015 technology roadmap recognizes the importance of electrospray propulsion to primary propulsion, formation flight and attitude control of small (3U-6U) spacecraft. Specific applications include asteroid scouting missions along with lunar and interplanetary missions. Additionally, the proposed electrospray system is ideal for drag-compensation applications for long term earth observation (EO) missions at altitudes as low as 200km. Furthermore, the technology continues to have numerous applications to scientific spacecraft of all sizes where high precision, low thrust systems permit extremely accurate attitude and station keeping. The latter functionality has been recently demonstrated in-space by Busek's colloid thrusters on the NASA ST7/ESA LISA Pathfinder mission. The highly scalable nature of the technology, both in terms of thrust and deltaV, without loss of performance is a critical feature permitting applicability to this wide spectrum of functions. However, lifetime limitations and scalability to sufficient thrusts are recognized as present gates to reliable realization of CubeSat scale high deltaV systems.Busek has proven both the functional feasibility and lifetime potential of colloidal/electrospray propulsion through the ST7/LISA spacecraft program. Through integrating that heritage and addressing the life-limiting issues of passively fed electrospray thrusters, Busek aims to bring the full potential of electrospray propulsion to 3U/6U spacecraft platforms","Compact propulsion systems that are scalable in both thrust and deltaV without loss of performance are an enabling technology for CubeSat missions and therefore have numerous commercial applications.  The market size for the proposed system is accordingly very large. Potential non-NASA customers include commercial asteroid prospecting, DoD and commercial EO missions. Numerous LEO CubeSat mission durations could be extended through the drag-compensation capabilities of the proposed system.De-orbiting applications are particularly relevant to new LEO telecommunication and EO initiatives.

It is likely that in the near future, international agreements will require provisions in spacecraft design to reposition satellites to disposal orbits, or to completely deorbit them.

MVP harnesses technology used in 3d printing applications to feed propellant into proven electrothermal propulsion technology developed by CU Aerospace to provide a safe and reliable system with high performance. The MVP concept accepts a variety of filament propellants, the leading candidate being a commercially available polymer. This should provide 900 N-s total impulse with a 1U (10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) system. This imparts 250 m/s Delta-V to a standard 4 kg, 3U CubeSat.

The baseline MVP, occupying a 1U volume, has minimal impact on the CubeSat bus and payload. The solid propellant has no handling, storage, or operational restrictions beyond those of the CubeSat. The ease of handling and storage for the solid propellant can extend operation to planetary missions with no additional monitoring or controls.","The MVP thruster will provide a compact, light-weight, non-hazardous, propulsion technology solution that will be made available in a family of sizes that can meet the differing needs of users in DOD, industry, and academia for CubeSat and small-satellite missions.

Typically, requirements imposed by the primary mission have led secondary payloads to have very limited propulsion capability. For earth orbiting spacecraft, the requirements to reenter within 25 years can be an issue. For lunar or interplanetary missions, lack of significant ΔV capability limits the science potential. For example, the system in the Mars Cube One 6U spacecraft is only capable of a few tens of m/s. Many such nanosats, including CubeSats slated to accompany the primary spacecraft towards Europa, could greatly benefit from real delta-V capability (> 1 km/s) while reducing risks to the primary payload. Flight Works is proposing to develop such capability and focus on the development of a pump-fed AF-M315E thruster. In the novel concept, propellant atomization is improved, conventional materials can be used for the injector and the valve, resulting in a more compact, lower cost, high performance thruster. Also, since the approach to ignition and combustion sustainment does not involve catalysts, the thruster life-limiting component is removed. This thruster is integrated into a micropump-fed system: there is no need for a separate pressurization, the propellant storage and feed system operates at low pressures, and lighter, conformal tanks can be used. This combination decreases system overall size and mass by 20-40% depending on the mission while reducing risks to the primary payload.More generally, the technology is applicable to any propulsion system, whether primary or for attitude control, where hydrazine is currently used, and is competitive with bipropellant systems for microsats due to the reduced system mass.","The technology offers the means of drastically reducing the risks posed by secondary payload propulsion systems onto primary missions. It also drastically increases their mission capabilities (in terms of delta-V capabilities) by decreasing the mass, complexity and cost of space propulsion systems. As such, it can enable new secondary missions which would not be possible otherwise. This applies to all microsat and nanosat missions which could benefit from high thrust and delta-V around 1 km/s. For earth orbiting spacecraft, the technology allows deployment to the desired orbit, orbit or constellation maintenance, de-orbit.

Based on initial vehicle architecture optimization analysis completed by engineers at Arctic Slope Technical Services (ASTS), the acceleration limit places a significant impact on the grain profiles used on both the first and second stage rocket motors.  Therefore, the use of a dual pulse rocket motor grain design enables the use of two subsequent pulses that are ignited so as to mimic a single grain along the optimal thrust profile.  This solution burns down the risks associated with an end burning grain design.  The dual pulse grain design leverages finocyl designs that offers significant grain stress relief because of the fins.  Also this approach offers the ability for a smaller and lighter nozzle because of the shortened burn time. Moreover, this will provide significant opportunity for the motors to get smaller in length by being able to be packaged more efficiently.

Even basic capabilities to push in one direction will allow nanosats to remain in orbit longer, or allow a satellite placed into low-Earth orbit to nudge itself to a higher geostationary orbit. In support of this technological need, Plasma Processes will design, fabricate and demonstrate combustion of a miniaturized propulsion system compatible with non-toxic HAN- and ADN-based green monopropellants for small spacecraft propulsion. The use of advanced, non-toxic propellants can increase mission capabilities including longer mission durations, additional maneuverability, increased scientific payload space, and simplified launch processing. Adding propulsion will also enable de-orbiting of the satellite after completion of the mission.","Potential NASA Applications include small spacecraft and satellite missions requiring Orbit change & Attitude Control, Precision Propulsion, Formation Flying and Target Reentry. Examples of future mission implementation are next-generation Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology Satellite (FASTSAT); Lunar Flashlight; and NEA Scout.","Commercial application of the technology will provide safe and affordable miniaturized propulsion to support the emerging small, micro- and nano- satellite community; and small satellite constellations to provide global internet and mapping planned by joint ventures including SpaceX/Google and One Web LLC.

CFDRC has worked with researchers in designing and synthesizing propellants called ionic liquids.  These are generally not as high-performing as traditional storables and still have toxicity issues.  Other work by CFDRC and Army researchers (among others) has demonstrated that gelling of liquid propellants, even toxic hypergols, can enhance their insensitive munitions (IM) properties to a significant  degree.  Besides the IM benefits, gelling of the fuel allows the suspension of ultrafine particles that both densify the propellant and add to the combustion energy, and thereby the specific impulse.CFDRC proposes to combine these research elements into a comprehensive assessment in Phase I to determine the degree to which the gelation of innovative propellant combinations can enhance the system benefits, including performance, safety, and launch costs.  Then in Phase II, the desired propellants will be obtained or synthesized, and then gelled.  A liquid apogee motor-class thruster will be fabricated and the gelled propellants will be hot-fired in the thruster for evaluation.  The end Phase II will focus on identification of opportunities to transition and integrate this technology into NASA, DoD and commercial product lines, with special emphasis on NASA secondary payload propulsion applications.","The applications derived from creating safer versions of high-performing liquid bipropellants are numerous and will find many NASA applications especially in the secondary payload propulsion marketplace.  Among these uses are: gelled liquid apogee engines, reaction control thrusters, and gelled liquid upper-stage engines.

The effects of EMI can be detrimental to electronic systems utilized in space missions; even small EMI issues can lead to total mission failure, resulting in significant mission delays and economic loss.  Additionally, NASA is challenged to find ways of effectively shielding sensitive electronic equipment from EMI without adding significant weight to space flight vehicles and satellites in order to manage fuel costs. The solution for both issues resides in the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are advancing as the most promising solution for reducing the weight of spacecraft wires. CNTs are an alluring alternative to conventional conductors used in coaxial data cables because they combine mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and low density. DexMat has developed a novel CNT deposition process for directly applying CNTs onto dielectric materials to produce an electrically conductive EMI shield.  The high conductivity CNT fibers have the potential to replace the inner conductor in cables, improving their mechanical durability and providing comparable specific conductivity to copper. By placing a premium on the quality of raw CNTs, DexMat has created a product which will have increased potential to reduce cable weight while minimizing insertion losses when incorporated into wire. In the proposed research DexMat seeks to increase electrical conductivity of CNT films, produce cost competitive products, develop new quality assurance processes, and determine the long-term product reliability of CNT cables.  Understanding these facets of CNT cable production will lead to enhancements on DexMat innovation and production of a commercially viable product.","Lightweight CNT shielded cables would provide a significant cost-effectiveness by reducing weight in space applications. Given the tremendous costs associated with satellite launches, the NASA will see significant savings from our CNT-based wire.","Commercial and Military aerospace companies are seeking opportunities to reduce weight on their aviation and space platforms to improve range and lower operating costs.  Fuel costs are one of the biggest concerns among commercial airlines.  Reducing exposure to fuel costs is a significant priority for all operators of aircraft and space systems.

Modern CubeSats rely heavily on solar panels to provide the necessary energy for operation. Additionally, radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are the primary source of energy responsible for supporting long duration missions where other sources of energy are not available or are logistically prohibitive to utilize. In both cases, to satisfy the electrical requirements of higher powered loads Li-ion battery solutions must increase in both weight and size.FastCAP Systems is proposing an ultracapacitor based hybrid power supply (HPS) to dramatically reduce the size and weight of conventional high power energy storage solutions while increasing power handling capability. The proposed system will incorporate FastCAPs patented technology for harsh environment and ruggedized ultracapacitors already proven in the oil and gas industry and currently being developed across multiple grants for space exploration. The targeted application that this proposal will focus on is a high power (> 100W) HPS for integration into CubeSats.Ultracapacitors have a relatively high power density that is roughly 10 to 100 times greater than Li-ion batteries and can be integrated into an energy storage system to both increase power handling capability and reduce the weight and size of a system designed for Li-ion batteries alone. The HPS will be responsible for charging and managing its ultracapacitor banks as well as performing system diagnostics that can be reported through the unit's communication port. The system will embrace modular design techniques similar to those already employed by FastCAP's energy exploration systems and consist of two modules.","Hybrid ultracapacitor based power supplies (HPS) enable high power density well beyond traditional capabilities of bulk energy storage such as Li-Ion batteries. The targeted application that this proposal will focus on is a high power (> 100W) HPS for integration into CubeSats. The CubeSat platform was chosen for its inherent size and weight restrictions but as a relatively low cost and standardized platform for this new technology. Future development of ultracapacitor based HPS systems will leverage the size, weight, and performance benefits demonstrated on the CubeSat platform for expansion into larger more powerful systems. Beyond CubeSats, ultracapacitor based power systems enable any platform that incorporates low power energy generation to reduce the mass and volume of its energy storage while improving power bus regulation and system efficiency. For example, RTG, flywheel, and photovoltaic platforms typically include battery packs for storage and high power delivery that can be made smaller and lighter while enabling substantially higher power delivery. Furthermore, the use of ultracapacitor systems enable efficient point of load (POL) generation and power delivery, reducing system complexity, wiring harness size, and enabling new sensing architectures. Additional applications include weather balloon communication and sensing, extravehicular activity (EVA) suits, satellite load deployment, vehicle separation stages, and many more.","Hybrid ultra-capacitor power systems find potential applications in many fields where high power density is critical for operation. FastCAP's ruggedized system designs and large temperature range find immediate application in NASA applications as well as other applications within military, automotive, and aerospace industries.FastCAP's hybrid technology is of interest to the military to reduce the size and weight of existing battery storage while improving power density. For example, assisted human exo-skeletons are wearable mobile systems intended to assist a soldier in physical tasks that would other be too difficult to complete without machinery. High power density power systems are required in order to be light enough be worn while powerful enough to power exoskeleton motors. Other uses included compact missile power systems where fast deployment of loads or motor actuation is required in a very small, ruggedized form factor. Additionally, micro-grid technology often integral to special operations units, can be benefitted for mass and volume reduction while supporting the array of communication, sensing, and life support systems typically power by solar panels and lithium batteries.Finally, the aerospace and automotive industries are primarily concerned with mass reduction, safety, and cost reduction.

Low-cost access to space, fueled by the agile and ever more capable CubeSat supply, will consume a larger and larger portion of the space market in the near future for Earth and solar system targeted missions.

The HPoCCS design will include consideration for both the volume and thermal compatibility that a high power management system will require in a CubeSat. It will enable > 100W peak high power generation from deployed solar panels, charging and monitoring of a 100W orbit average power (OAP) capable battery stack, conditioning and distribution of the battery bus voltage and converted voltages to the spacecraft, and thermal management of the incoming, stored, and distributed path power.

The most promising approach to still be fully developed and exploited requires conducting multi-point or distributed constellation-based observations. This system-level observational approach is required to understand the ?big picture? coupling between disparate regions such as the solar-wind and earth and planetary magnetospheres, ionospheres, upper atmospheres, land, and oceans.

Finally, attractive military and civilian applications involving mobile solar electric power are derived from the ability to recharge batteries in remote locations.",Conversion; Generation

The fundamental operation of this Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell is improved over comparable fuel cell technologies, providing simplified system design and longer duration missions. The Non Flow Through (NFT) nature of reactant consumption within the fuel cell stack produces a much higher utilization of reactants. The Advanced Product Water Removal (APWR) embodied within each repeat element of the fuel cell stack allows for the elimination of the water separation devices usually residing in the balance of system. This drives system simplification while increasing overall reliability and reducing system cost. The HEAL FC can be operated as a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell for long endurance missions and also as a hydrogen-air fuel cell. This transition from pure oxygen to air can be accomplished dynamically in flight, allowing for reduced mass of the oxygen storage subsystem. This is a critical advantage for UAS flying to and from dense air environments consuming air as the fuel cell oxidant and switching over to pure oxygen when in the dense air region of concern. The fuel cell stack improvements to be made as part of this topic are planned to make the fuel cell stack more amenable to Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) by reducing mass and volume. The current configuration of the fuel cell stack was driven by performance only. Now that the NFT and APWR technologies have been proven, the stack hardware itself must be minimized to fit the UAS markets. Costs for this advanced fuel cell system will inherently be reduced through the implementation of mass production design methodology to transform a well-functioning power system for space applications to lower altitude uses.","A High Efficiency Advanced Lightweight Fuel Cell (HEAL FC) provides a power architecture for a broad range of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. This modular system can be configured to power High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft as well as much smaller UAVs gathering data within volcanic plumes. When combined with novel hydrogen and oxygen reactant storage systems, the HEAL FC can provide flight times well in excess of the two days the Predator B can fly for NASA's Ikhana program. Much smaller UAVs used for lower altitude data gathering, similar to Aerovironment's Dragon Eye, can benefit from utilizing a HEAL FC for extended mission duration, as well as flight within dense air environments.The Infinity HEAL FC can continue to be utilized within space applications being pursued by NASA, from Space Launch Systems (SLS) to future manned mission programs. Although Infinity's fuel cell has been developed for these space applications to date, the mass and volume of power infrastructure for such missions is always a major concern. The development of a much lighter fuel cell stack would provide a modular power system applicable to a broad array vehicles.","From airborne activities to underwater operations, all commercial entities are eager for longer endurance above or below the water. Many activities within the oil and gas markets, for example, require battery powered autonomous underwater vehicles to re-surface frequently for battery replacement or recharging, resulting in far more costly pipeline inspections. The scientific community's underwater mapping capabilities and cost-effectiveness could also improve dramatically. The upcoming lower altitude package delivery services, such as Amazon, FedEx, and others, also demand longer duration in the air, effectively increasing delivery radius from warehouses and the mobile delivery platforms currently being developed.Commercial space companies, such as SpaceX, Blue Origins, and others could benefit from the mass and volume reduced HEAL FC. From launch vehicles to orbiting platforms, the HEAL FC could form the heart of a power and energy infrastructure capable of scaling to meet the needs of each application.",Air Transportation & Safety; Atmospheric Propulsion; Conversion; Fuels/Propellants; Generation; Heat Exchange; In Situ Manufacturing; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Storage; Surface Propulsion

Only recently has a 10-12 hour UAV been considered reliable enough to move closer to the ultimate goal of UAV's, which is ultra-long duration (month-long or more) sustained flight without any human intervention. Helios, Airbus, Titan, Facebook, and the PUMA UAV's have already helped push the boundaries of ultra-long endurance UAV's, however, focusing on specific power (Wh/kg - the ratio of power, time and mass) may provide NASA with a new solution. Swift Engineering is proposing a solution that is optimized at the subsystem (solar cell, batteries, power management) and at the system level. It utilizes the highest specific power technologies and provides substantial test data to back up power analysis for Phase II.

The proposed sensor platform consists of compact, tube-deployed UAVs equipped with atmospheric sensors and a custom launch system. Initial development of the sensor-UAV was performed during a NASA Phase I Contract in 2014. Barron Associates is proposing a development schedule that builds upon the prior Phase I technology to mature the sensor-UAV and launch system in preparation for Phase II cloud measurement tests.","The sensor-UAS provides a low-cost atmospheric sensing platform option that requires minimal training for use. As such, the potential NASA applications include many of the atmospheric research areas of interest, as well as some atmospheric sensing applications. The Phase II demonstration application will be a cloud sensing mission for characterizing the cloud content by pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Hurricane research is a second NASA application, with Barron?s UAS able to provide capabilities for wind and PTH sensing in turbulent environments. A third NASA application is volcanic research, measuring ash and particle concentrations, gas species concentrations and winds.  Another application for NASA is for climate research, in particular the measurement of methane in the Arctic. Satellite calibration/validation campaigns represent an additional NASA application as programs such as OLYMPEX are frequently measuring specific atmospheric properties and coverage could be enhanced with the technology.","Potential non-NASA customers include NOAA, DoD, DoE domestically, and international atmospheric researchers with similar interests to NASA. NOAA is a primary customer with several possible applications. Hurricane researchers at NOAA demonstrated in September of 2014 the use of tube launched, expendable UAVs for atmospheric science in a hurricane. Wildfire monitoring is a second application for NOAA. The DoE desires small UAV methane sensing capability. The DoD has ongoing interest in the use of small, expendable UAVs for reconnaissance, ordinance delivery and battlespace awareness.

Using a recovery system that enables landings to specific coordinates can dramatically reduce suborbital flight recovery costs, future space return flight costs in the Earth's atmosphere. It also has potential in the Mars' atmosphere where a lightweight, low volume flight system such as a parafoil can increase the range of motion across the planet with increased lift or reduced drag.A fabric ram air canopy can be dramatically lighter weight than a foldable composite system while still being able to provide long range glide and descent rate control. Wizbe Innovations has developed a unique, lightweight fabric system to control airflow in textile based ram air canopies.Controlling the airflow provides glide and directional control to improve steering, potentially increase lift, and potentially reduce opening shock. Another potential advantage to moving the controls into the canopy is that it reduces field logistics by reducing retrieval to only the parachute canopy. Wizbe's controls are located within the parachute and have no winches, pulleys and wires outside the canopy.","The ability to actively control permeability in fabrics has many applications including in parachutes, clothing, shelters, sails, and filtration products. The airflow control can be integrated into the canopies in a variety of ways. NASA can use the system for a variety of applications including sub-orbital, re-entry into earth's atmosphere, or flights within other planet's atmosphere. The Sounding Rockets Program Office (SRPO), located at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility, provides suborbital launch vehicles, payload development, and field operations support to NASA and other government agencies. With improved landing accuracy, without increasing payload weight, launches could be performed for less money and with improved landing locations. For re-entry, NASA, as well as multiple commercial space launch systems, are looking for improved landing accuracy. Many of the systems are using complex rocket systems, but a simple ram air canopy with improved landing accuracy could reduce the complexity of the landings and make the overall system less expensive.  One of NASA Strategic Plan objectives is providing emergency abort capability and ensuring safe re-entry and landing. This ram air canopy design cuts across multiple strategic objects to enable safer flights, improves maturing transformative solutions, and enables improved emergency systems.","The technology also has commercial potential in sports ram air canopies for increased steering capability, improved glide, higher safety margins, as well as potential to provide increased capabilities for hot air ballooning, gliders, and sailing. For the military, parachutes are a vital technology for moving Warfighters, ammunition, and other supplies to the battlefield. Personnel parachutes provide life support for paratroopers and are part of the ejection seat of aircraft for the pilot. Cargo parachutes are used to drop military equipment and supplies from aircraft. Many aircraft also use deceleration parachutes to slow down. For disaster relief, a parachute may also be used for delivering medicines, goods and other supplies to isolated victims. This actively controlled airflow fabric has several benefits that improve control in parachutes. The system incorporates an innovative control system using shape memory alloy that is likely to lead to a simple, effective fabric for airflow control with minimal weight gain and low volume changes. This actively controlled airflow provides will directional control and glide control (increased lift).","Actuators & Motors; Aerodynamics; Air Transportation & Safety; Airship/Lighter-than-Air Craft; Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Astronautics); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Textiles"

Each flight, the fuel energy is burned based upon an assumed time requirement to transport people from one point to another as quickly as possible. Unmanned aerial vehicles do not share this constraint, and many proposed future electric unmanned aerial vehicle missions do not include time from the ground station to the area of interest as a limiting factor. These missions typically list battery life and sensor space inside UAV's as the limiting factors. By adjusting the path flown and exploiting atmospheric energy, air vehicles could potentially fly indefinitely, and/or greatly improve their duration and range. The following are a few of the benefits that will be possible by utilizing these techniques with a UAV:1. Fixed wing unmanned electric aircraft could reduce battery weight and exchange it for additional payload capabilities. 2. Winged VTOL (i.e Swift Engineering's X-Blade) aircraft could arrive onstation with full batteries, allowing sustained hovering flight. 3. Energy regeneration by the back-driving of the electric motors. 4. Increased speed en route by flying in lift rather than sink. Full-scale sailplane pilots use various weather and soaring forecast tools to aid in planning when and where the best conditions will exist for soaring flight. A flight planning tool using a flight simulator with integrated soaring and weather forecasts would run through the entire flight, for several flight paths, and display the important information as the flight unfolds. Plots of battery state, ground speed, GPS position, altitude vs. time, and others would be displayed to showcase the advantages of flying specific flight profiles. The design, build, and initial flight testing of this simulator tool are the focus of this research which will provide increased capability for any UAV that does not have point to point requirements and may need to survey remote locations.","Any mission which would involve scientific research could benefit from this system. Examples would include but not be limited to missions with LIDAR payloads, IR/EO camera payloads, hyperspectral imaging payloads, science analysis of atmospheric data collection, and any remote UAV sensing application for which reaching a location is not time sensitive, but rather battery/payload sensitive. Numerous unmanned and manned atmospheric flight vehicles at NASA could integrate this software and potentially greatly increase mission range and endurance.","A few potential applications for the use of SoarSim at Swift Engineering are as follows: - X-blade (Swift's flagship UAV development platform) - Northrop Grumman Bat (designed and manufactured by Swift) - General military UAV flight planning tool Other general applications of the methods developed by the SoarSim research could potentially be applied in future research in underwater glider flight planning. Just as the atmosphere possesses areas of free energy that can be exploited, so does the ocean. Long endurance underwater gliders could exploit this just as sailplanes already do in the air. Private pilots could also potentially utilize this software for increased fuel economy. For a general aviation, light single-engine airplane pilot who flies regularly from Point A to Point B, SoarSim could prove to be a valuable tool. If these pilots do not mind adding a few minutes to their flight time, they could save money while reducing their emissions impact. By using the SoarSim app, they can plan their flight such that they are aloft for 15 minutes longer than the direct route, but burn 40% less fuel. SoarSim also increases the safety of a flight by enhancing situational awareness of the vertical motion of the atmosphere.","Algorithms/Control Software & Systems (see also Autonomous Systems); Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Data Fusion; Data Processing; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Generation; Navigation & Guidance; Sources (Renewable, Nonrenewable)"

In situ measurements are currently made through the use of ground sensors and dropsondes. ?Ground sensors, such as seismometers, tiltmeters, in-ground gas monitors and near-field remote sensings instruments[,]? have limited measurement density and provide only information about atmospheric boundary conditions. Dropsondes can provide measurements over the entire vertical profile, but are limited to sampling over a small time period. In situ measurements can be augmented with satellite-based remote sensing systems, such as ASTER, MODIS, AIRS and OMI, however, satellite-based data suffers from its relatively small spatial density and limited frequency of measurement. A need exists for additional targeted in situ data from volcanic ash clouds, particularly to assess ...particle size distribution, ash cloud height, and ash cloud thickness including spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal variability of ash concentration.The proposed innovation, the SuperSwift XT, will meet NASA's need to enhance [the] performance and utility of NASA's airborne science fleet by providing a durable, terrain-following UAS that will be adapted for use in harsh environments containing environmental phenomena that impacts societal activity (i.e. volcanic emissions impacting the safety of passenger aviation). The sUAS will provide targeted, in situ observations from previously inaccessible regions that can significantly advance NASA?s goal of safe, efficient growth in global aviation by aiding in the collection of scientific data from which predictive Volcanic Ash Transport and Dispersion models (VATD) used to inform air traffic management systems.","Multi-year observations of volcanoes with a variety of systems has already been conducted by by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's CARTA-UAS project, along with its partners. These observations have occurred and various distances and locations around the volcanoes. Use of a multiple UAS system with appropriate architecture for cooperative and coordinated surveys by durable yet affordable (attrition acceptable) vehicles will greatly improve the coverage available when collecting useful science data. Other volcano-studying robot projects could also benefit from the addition of UAS for heterogenous vehicle deployment (also supported by Black Swift Technologies architecture) or a transition to exclusively aircraft for the collection of valuable science data.","A number of post-research and development applications exist, commercial and scientific. The proposed innovation, including the total sensor suite, can be utilized for scientific research by federal and state public agencies and other state-funded laboratories to collect data on coherent atmospheric structures such as smog, volcano plumes, wildfire smoke, chemical fires, forest humidity, etc. Commercial applications for private industry exist as well, such as utilizing the SuperSwift XT to determine chemical composition of smokestack exhaust so as to remain within EPA-permitted levels of pollutant gasses and to assess the composition, and relative danger, of chemical fires at refineries. Additionally, the specially trained Incident Meteorologists (IMETs) from NOAA use portable weather stations near large wildfires to generate critical weather forecasts for the effectiveness and safety of fire crews.

This platform will address the increasing attitude control performance requirements of CubeSats to enable commercial and scientific missions previously restricted to larger and more expensive satellite platforms.Reducing jitter in attitude determination and control systems (ADCS) CubeSat platforms has typically been an after-thought.  Miniaturizing large satellite ADCS to CubeSat size has resulted in relatively poor attitude stability due to inexpensive reaction wheels and high noise IMU?s. In the past five years, the CubeSat industry has seen a huge increase in customers with miniaturized payloads seeking high capability platforms.  Arcsecond attitude stability is an enabling technology for many optical missions, including optical communication, space based optical inspection, and exoplanet imaging.","The interest in CubeSats has grown exponentially over the last decade. From scientists to the U.S. war fighter, the aerospace community has seen the tangible benefits of using CubeSats to satisfy key roles in their experiments and operational missions. NASA has played a significant role in fostering the growth of the CubeSat community.Exoplanet imaging is an application that requires extremely good pointing stability.  NASA?s Kepler mission, launched in March 2009, is currently surveying a large section space in search of exoplanets.  Follow-up measurements on specific targets identified by Kepler would be a great fit for CubeSat exoplanet imagers, as very long measurements could be taken at relatively low cost.  The number of CubeSat exoplanet imagers would easily scale, allowing follow-up measurements of hundreds of potential exoplanets.Beyond imaging applications, the NASA Ames LADEE mission utilized laser communication to provide a high bandwidth long distance communication link.  Laser communication was demonstrated from the moon with a beamwidth of 3 arc-seconds, requiring tight pointing stability from the ADCS.  The technology developed in this SBIR could allow high bandwidth laser communication links without a separate pointing control stage, freeing up limited CubeSat payload space.","Arcsecond level jitter performance is important for low-light optical imaging applications, particularly satellite inspection missions.  These missions have traditionally been restricted to government agencies, though commercial satellite inspection in the GEO belt would be useful for satellite operators to diagnose failures at a safe distance.  Although most Earth imaging occurs at very short exposure windows (<1ms), increased attitude stability in a standard platform would improve the ground resolution/price ratio for these missions.There is likely commercial interest in a star tracker that can operate as a rate sensor.  The rate sensor can be used as a backup to an IMU in control systems, or even as the primary sensor for precision pointing.  Since the rate sensor will be relatively high bandwidth, the rate sensor technology could increase the control loop bandwidth, providing better pointing accuracy and stability at low altitudes or in the presence of other disturbance torques.","Attitude Determination & Control; Image Processing; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z)"

The ATA/SNL Team is proposing the development of the DRG for potential integration into the DCIRU in Phase II.  The highly symmetrical and scalable DRG disc standing wave design was selected by DARPA and NVESD as the only MEMS design capable of navigation grade performance.  The DRG consists of a MEMS disk resonator that provides rotation sensing capable of both tactical and navigation grade precision.","ATA has successfully developed and transitioned SBIR innovations into government and commercial programs.  One example is our recent success transitioning technologies first developed on the NASA Phase I SBIR, MIRU I.  The DRG-based CubeSat Inertial Reference Unit, or DCIRU, will be integrated into an original design that will directly benefit NASA?s future GNC systems for future CubeSat missions, i.e., NASA?s CubeSat Launch Initiative (CLI) that actively solicits CubeSat opportunities for low cost space exploration. ATA?s DCIRU specifically addresses NASA?s desire for advanced autonomous navigation and attitude control that would facilitate significant advances in independence from Earth supervision by enabling high bandwidth CubeSat inertial attitude knowledge (IAK) and control required for future sophisticated science missions.  There are currently no precision space qualified IRUs available for CubeSats today due to SWaP limitations.  The proposed DRG/ DCIRU developments will ultimately fulfill the crucial need for a CubeSat compatible IRU.","ATA is working to insert our DCIRU technology into many air and space markets. Potential applications include missions having stringent line-of-sight stabilization (LOSS) and IAK requirements.  OIRUs are used in airborne HEL and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) applications along with space Laser Communications (Laser Communication). ATA anticipates capturing significant market share, as OIRUs are a very specialized product niche in which we own most of the Intellectual Property (IP).  We continually work to enhance and improve our OIRU designs and technology to maintain our competitive edge while reaching out to competitors to supply their specific mission needs.  Our goal is to be the Number One supplier of DCIRUs worldwide.","Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Inertial; Inertial (see also Sensors); Navigation & Guidance; Relative Navigation (Interception, Docking, Formation Flying; see also Control & Monitoring; Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

The Phase I effort lays a strong foundation for a Phase II effort that will include the construction and demonstration of an at-scale system using materials suitable for a Venus or Titan mission.

This technology improves upon the platform objectives of the Venus Climate Mission (VCM), one of five flagship missions called for by the National Research Council 2013 Decadal Survey. The VCM mission includes a gondola/balloon system with a 21 day life at a 55.5km altitude in 2021. Its objectives are to characterize the greenhouse atmosphere of Venus, its origin and evidence of climate change. This mission can be significantly enhanced by staying aloft for five or more years and navigate the planet utilizing altitude cycling. To meet a 2021 launch, preliminary design and technology completion for the VCM must occur in 2017-18 and can incorporate proposed innovation.

FastCAP is planning to design and prototype a hybrid system comprised of the proposed ultracapacitor in parallel with a high energy density, rechargeable, lithium ion battery showing at least 50% volume reduction and 100% lifetime increase compared to stand-alone lithium batteries, meeting long duration research balloon requirements. During Phase I, FastCAP will evaluate both novel under-development and off-the-shelf lithium chemistries utilized in aerospace applications. The resulting hybrid battery-ultracapacitor (HBU) system combines the benefits of both technologies and will meet NASA's scientific balloon requirements of energy density, power density, shelf life, temperature, reliability and cycle life. This ultracapacitor can also be coupled to a piezoelectric generator, thanks to a high cut off frequency greater than 500Hz. The proposed HBU system will enable significant improvements in the design of power storage for terrestrial and planetary balloons, reducing their weight, volume, and complexity, while improving performance and relaxing design constraints on scarce candidate battery technologies. Compared to today's high-rate reserve and rechargeable battery technologies, the proposed hybrid system will provide much higher power and higher energy density, show tremendous improvement in cycle lifetime, and show reduced risk of explosion and thermal runaway associated with high-rate discharge, thanks to the power buffering role of the ultracapacitor within the HBU system. In applications where batteries are currently oversized for power handling, dramatic reductions in total energy storage system weight will be achieved by complementing those batteries with ultracapacitors.","The proposed 28 VDC hybrid aerospace graded ultracapacitor/battery module will be designed to power critical components needed for long duration terrestrial and planetary balloons. This innovative design will ensure available energy for more than 12 continuous hours using a lithium ion high energy density rechargeable battery (>200Wh/kg), and guaranteeing power delivery in the range of 100-1000 watts with the ultracapacitor pack.  Phase II will focus on collaboration with an aerospace rated battery supplier (i.e. EaglePicher/Yardney) that has designed and produced high energy density batteries for previous space missions. We have received a letter of support from EaglePicher indicating a possible partnership leading to customized design work and testing validations specific to NASA requirements. Inclusion of a high power density ultracapacitor module working in parallel with a high energy battery pack will provide a considerable overall weight and volume reduction for the energy storage system with improved performance.

Imagine an inflatable, flying wing-glider that could enter Titan?s atmosphere from orbit, execute controlled movements in atmospheric flight, and descend to the surface for scientific measurement or payload delivery. The Titan-Buoyant Atmospheric Glider (T-BAG) system is a hybrid entry vehicle, balloon, and maneuverable glider with 3-D directional control that could satisfy all of these objectives while operating on the minimal power available from a Radioisotope Power Source (RPS). T-BAG's unique buoyancy control system is at the heart of the proposed innovation, enabling both ascending and descending glide without propulsion systems or control surfaces. Potential T-BAG mission applications include long-lived flight at low altitudes with revisit capability, high resolution surface imaging, in-situ measurements of precipitation, fog, volcanism, etc., and controlled, targeted delivery of landers to the surface.","As discussed in the subtopic, NASA is interested in Titan aerial vehicles with maneuvering capabilities and operational flexibility over a wide range of altitudes. T-BAG could support many Titan missions including prebiotic exploration and astrobiology and habitability studies. While the proposed effort is focused on developing and tailoring a vehicle for the Titan environment, the Buoyant Atmospheric Glider (BAG) system concept in general would be applicable on any solar system body with a prominent atmosphere. BAG's capability for controlled, targeted delivery of cargo (e.g., rovers, landers, supplies) could make it well suited for Mars exploration missions and habitat support. The BAG concept also has many Earth-based applications that are of interest to NASA. It could conduct high-altitude atmospheric science and low-g sample or payload return from ISS. In addition, it could act a space station escape or emergency crew return vehicle.","Buoyant Atmospheric Glider technology may have applications in the Department of Defense (DOD).

To this end, Creare proposes to develop an efficient, vibration-free pump that has design features to prevent cavitation in the pumping chamber and in the hydrodynamic fluid bearings, and thus enables the pump to achieve a long service life.  The development of the refrigerant pump will be built on Creare's proven high-speed turbomachine technologies for space applications.

Flexible thermal straps and Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) are typically used for this flexible thermal link. Thermal straps are a lower technology solution for lower heat transport applications (<10 Watt) that need small mechanical displacement. LHPs can transport kilowatts of heat over long distances and have transport lines and condenser tubes that are flexible, bendable, and easily routed through complex paths. Drawbacks of LHPs include being significantly more expensive to fabricate and qualify.

(ACT) proposes to develop a low-cost Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) evaporator using a technique known as Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), otherwise known as 3D printing, to produce low-cost LHPs to be used in CubeSat and SmallSat applications. The wick structure in an LHP assumes the role of a pump in a standard loop, pumping liquid from the lower pressure condenser to the higher pressure evaporator by capillary forces. The overall thermal performance of the system is therefore highly dependent on the in-situ characteristics of the wick structure. Current LHP wick manufacturing and installation processes are cumbersome, labor intensive, and suffer from a low yield rate. Specifically, the primary wick�s hydrodynamic characteristics and sealing integrity to the envelope are critical to heat transport, start-up, shut down and overall reliability.  It is estimated that the cost to produce an LHP evaporator, including the attachment of the bayonet, secondary wick and compensation chamber, accounts for approximately 75% of the total system�s manufacturing cost. By 3D printing an evaporator envelope with an integral porous primary wick structure, the overall complexity and cost of the design can be significantly reduced.","Ammonia and propylene LHPs are currently used in most NASA and commercial satellites.  In comparison with Constant Conductance Heat Pipes (CCHPs), they carry much higher powers (1 kW vs. 100 W) over longer distances (10 m vs. 2-3 m).  They also are better suited for ground testability.  An LHP can operate with the evaporator 2 meters above the condenser, versus 2.5 mm for a CCHP.  Their main drawback is that they are two orders of magnitude more expensive to fabricate and test than CCHPs.  Fabricating, machining, and inserting the primary and secondary wicks into the pump is the bulk of the fabrication expense (The remainder of the LHP is just plumbing).  The first benefit of the proposed evaporator/wick fabrication will be a significant reduction in cost of LHPs supplied to NASA.  A second benefit of reduced costs it that LHPs will be much more attractive for the smaller satellites, such as SmallSat and CubeSat, that NASA is now considering for future missions.  The overall budget for these satellites is severely constrained when compared to the larger satellites that NASA has fabricated in the past.  LHPs have not been considered in the past for these small satellites, partially due to their high cost.  The reduced fabrication costs will allow ACT to fabricate smaller LHPs for these smaller satellites, at a price that is acceptable with their smaller budgets.","ACT is one of only two companies in the United States that sells heat pipes, Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs), and LHPs to the government and commercial customers for spacecraft thermal control.  The benefits for the Air Force are similar to the benefits for NASA, both for today�s spacecraft, and for smaller satellites in the future.  The commercial communications satellite market is the current primary market for LHPs.  For example, one prime uses 5 to 6 LHPs on each satellite, and would also benefit from reduced costs.Finally, Universities are able to fabricate their own CubeSats for research in space; however, their budgets are much too limited to allow them to use LHPs as a thermal control tool.  In addition, these SmallSats have no need for the high powers and long lengths of current LHPs.  They could benefit from small size LHPs, if the cost can be significantly reduced.

As they enter the atmosphere, these vehicles are subjected to extreme hypersonic environments typified by large structural loads, high heat fluxes and temperatures, and an aggressive aerothermal environment where nonequilibrium dissociated gases may cause chemical ablation at the vehicle's surface. These hypersonic flows involve highly nonlinear fluid-thermal interactions such as very strong shocks, high aeroheating, and shock boundary layer interactions. The extreme environments result in nonlinear, coupled interactions between the vehicle's structure and the environment. Traditionally, designs of reentry vehicles and their components have been analyzed by different engineering disciplines in an uncoupled manner, leading to a simplified superposition of different independent analyses. Depending on the assumptions, this can potentially lead to overconservatism or omission of multiphysics phenomena such as the deformation of structural skin panels which alters the local flow field and results in higher aerodynamic and heat loading. To alleviate these problems, ATA Engineering proposes to develop an innovative approach utilizing an existing multiphysics framework that enables a more complete simulation of the aeroheating environment throughout the flight trajectory in the continuum regime is proposed. In Phase I, we will demonstrate feasibility of solving these problems in ATA's multiphysics simulation environment by coupling CHAR (a 3D, implicit charring ablator solver), Loci/CHEM (a computational fluid dynamics solver for highspeed chemically reacting flows), and Abaqus (a commercial nonlinear structural dynamics package) to create a fully coupled aerothermoelastic charring ablative solver.

Enhancing the sensitivity of existing devices, reducing their size, or both can allow the use of inertial navigation in smaller airframes, or free up room to include larger mission payloads for scientific or military purposes.Using fast-light effects generated in fiber with Stimulated Brillouin Scattering, we will enhance rotation sensitivity of conventional Ring Laser Gyroscope, to develop IMUs that will deliver higher performance and/or lower SWaP than a traditional navigation system.  Previous results have shown sufficient fast-light effects with COTS components to demonstrate the technology, while numerical analysis indicates that a gyro could provide rotation sensitivities as low as 10-8 rotations/second.  In the proposed Phase I work, we will demonstrate fast-light enhancement of an RLG in the lab for the first time and analyze factors affecting the performance and stability of the system in order to verify specs and design a prototype for construction in Phase II.","The improvement of inertial sensor components is essential to support navigation and attitude control systems for future NASA satellite missions. The proposed technology will have significantly reduced size and weight with ruggedized components designed to meet stringent dynamic, mechanical, thermal and radiation specifications for operation in space. A robust, high performance, and cost effective gyroscope suitable for space based operations will also have significant impact on demanding NASA applications that require stabilized platforms for long term space applications in smaller and smaller satellites.

Other NASA mission profiles or applications that would benefit from generically small, light- weight, low power laser sources would be equally well served.","An ultra-compact laser source can be used at 1 or 0.5micron wavelength for LiDAR applications to map and image objects; a narrow laser-beam can map physical features with very high resolution. It can target a wide range of materials, including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols, clouds, and even single molecules. 0.5mm wavelength penetrates water easily and is useful for bathymetry measurements in shallow water.  The proposed laser can be used in the Automotive Safety and Navigation, Geography, Law Enforcement, Meteorology, Mining, Robotics, and Wind Farm markets.Military lasers have reached size and energy criteria but always at the cost of poor beam quality and consequent difficulties in atmospheric propagation for their intended applications. Q-Peak's advantage would be in having developed an ultra-compact, simple, and rugged technology for generation of single mode laser pulses in the green, near-IR, or eyesafe regions. This laser device will be much better suited for fieldable systems than present products with respect to both SWaP and mode profile. When converted to eyesafe wavelength present Department of Defense procurement of eyesafe rangefinder exceeds 2500 units per annum with a constant need to advance the state of the art and reduce soldier carry-weight and workload. The laser architecture proposed here would have great promise in fulfilling an Urgent Needs Requirement for all branches of the DOD interested in precision targeting.","3D Imaging; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Entry, Descent, & Landing (see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry); Image Analysis; Lasers (Ladar/Lidar); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Navigation & Guidance"

These bodies include the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Asteroids, Comets and moons of Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Surface missions to these bodies, would most probably require some type of a sampling system to capture samples and deliver them to in-situ instruments or sample return containers.Honeybee Robotics, therefore, proposes to develop a robust on-demand sample acquisition and delivery system enabled by a high efficiency blower. The system will be akin to conventional vacuum cleaners on Earth, but adapted for Venus conditions. As such, the main technology areas will include development of the following four subsystems: Blower, Cyclone, Nozzle and Tubing; with the Blower being most critical.The target mission will be Venus In Situ Explorer (VISE), however, the technology could be adopted to Mars missions.  We will use CFD FLUENT to perform blower and cyclone analysis simulating Venus' atmosphere and gravity, as gravity affects cyclone performance. We will fabricate and test a blower under relevant pressure conditions in a high pressure chamber. We will also fabricate a cyclone and suction tubes. The system will be assembled to allow end to end testing. Further, we will develop a TRL 5/6 design for the pneumatic system, which would be fabricated and tested in Phase 2","There are several missions to Mars and Venus that could take advantage of this technology. The missions in the New Frontiers class could include Venus In Situ Explorer and in the Flagship class could include the second mission in the Mars Sample Return Program, Mars Ascent Vehicle. It is prudent to have a backup sampling system adjacent to the MAV, and the proposed technology could serve as a back up sampler.In the HEOMD directorate, In Situ Resource Utilization missions to Mars could also use this technology. In addition, certain subsystems could be used to augment traditional sampling systems such as drilling. For example, a blower could be used to clean holes of cuttings during drilling and in turn not only improve drilling efficiency several fold, but the same system could be used to capture and transfer cuttings in real time.","The sampling technology system could be used by commercial companies that are interested in mining and in-situ resource utilization. The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to establish human presence on Mars. As such, SpaceX would directly benefit from mature sampling and mining technologies.Other non-NASA applications include robotic acquisition of volatiles as well as soil and liquid samples from hazardous environments, chemical spills, nuclear waste, oil spills. Examples include samples from nuclear waste sites as well as disaster sites (Fukushima nuclear reactor).","Aerodynamics; Analytical Instruments (Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, Energy; see also Sensors); Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing; Metallics; Pressure & Vacuum Systems; Pressure/Vacuum; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Tribology"

Each ""P3"" controller is small enough to be mounted in the tiny volume normally reserved for the encoder; and, indeed, each P3 carries the entire active electronics of the encoder function by measuring the magnetic field of a 6x2.5-mm radially-polarized button magnet bonded to the tail of the spinning motor shaft. A Kalman filter enables the encoder to read to 12-bits-absolute at commutated speeds up to 14,000 RPM. The controller has all of the functions expected of conventional controllers. However, based on three patents of international scope and a fourth PCT application, the part count has been substantially reduced, with subsequent reduced size, fewer parts to fail, fewer parts that otherwise generate quiescent power, and reduced cost. The Phase-I objectives will select two brushless servomotors of varying specifications that support NASA's rover missions. The electromechanical interface between P3 and the motors will be designed, assembled, fixtured with particle-brake loads, and then rigorously stress tested before working with NASA engineers to create a conceptual design for Phase II and beyond. Phase I is expected to result in a TRL of 4. Phase-II efforts will focus on design-modifications to address issues found in Phase-I and will encompass rigorous stress-testing in relevant environments. Phase II is expected to result in a TRL of 5. Phase-III commercialization efforts will create a system of motor controllers that not only support NASA rover missions, but also support other space-based non-terrestrial applications, such as servomotor actuation on satellites for precision antennae and laser pointing and the deployment of articulated structures.","Brushless servomotors are essential in NASA applications such as mobile manipulation on rovers and for satellite navigation, control, and positioning where the motors must remain in active service indefinitely. Unlike stepper motors, they do not induce unwanted vibrations aboard sensitive spacecraft. And, unlike brushed motors, brushless servomotors have high torque density, add no brush friction, do not generate contaminating dust, and have much longer life times. The use of brushless motors usually requires custom and expensive electronics that are often larger than the motors they control. This is especially true for small motors that operate below 100 watts. Frequently, the power required for the controller itself is greater than the power needed at the motor. One Fortune-100 customer is interested in purchasing initial sample units, but if technically successful, they would become a regular customer of a commercial version of the P3, thereby making these devices commercially available to NASA as affordable common-off-the-shelf (COTS) components.","As machines become more intelligent through embedded processing and sensor fusion we expect them to do more too, improving not only industrial productivity, but our quality of life as society ages. While embedded processors and MEMS-based sensors have become tiny, highly effective, and affordable; similar improvements in servomotors have evolved more slowly. At fractional-horsepower levels the power electronics contribute significantly to total motor-system bulk and complexity. Providing smaller and more efficient servoelectronics will enable OEMs to increase the competitiveness of their products. For example, robots will become more agile with additional degrees of freedom and less mass to accelerate. New fuel-cell designs combined with ultra-high motor efficiency will enable affordable prostheses with true dexterity instead of 0 or 1 degree of freedom; and orthotics will begin to assist human motions intelligently, rather than passively bracing.","Actuators & Motors; Attitude Determination & Control; Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Isolation/Protection/Shielding (Acoustic, Ballistic, Dust, Radiation, Thermal); Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Navigation & Guidance; Positioning (Attitude Determination, Location X-Y-Z); Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Telemetry (see also Control & Monitoring); Telemetry/Tracking (Cooperative/Noncooperative; see also Planetary Navigation, Tracking, & Telemetry)"

Luna is currently engaged in a Phase II SBIR with NASA JPL (contract NNX13CP33P) to develop a revolutionary technology that monitors the distributed tension, curvature, and path of a tether that connects a marsupial rover robot to its base station.  This sensing tether turns a passive cable that provides power and communication into a powerful tool that provides information about the health and state of both the rover and the tether, alerting the base station to possible pinch points, snagged cables, or high tension due to poor traction or steep slope encountered by the rover. Luna proposes to miniaturize the interrogation system of the MaRS Tether to enable JPL to realize the full potential of the rover.  Reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of the tether system will allow the rover to be tested in multiple realistic scenarios.  In addition, miniaturization is the first step in preparing the entire sensing tether system for flight-readiness for missions to Mars, asteroids, and the rest of the Solar System.","The NASA market for self-sensing tethers is focused on missions featuring robotic exploration, especially using the Axel rover. NASA is planning specific missions including Mid-Size Rovers, Astrobiology Field Lab, Network Landers, Europa Explorer, and Titan-Enceladus Explorer to bring back samples from comets, asteroids, and the lunar south polar basin, and Mars. Market opportunities for tethered rovers within NASA often coincide with Mars exploration missions that are launched every 26 months. Prime contractors supporting NASA's rover missions include Lockheed Martin Astronautics. Reducing the size, weight, and power of the sensing tether's interrogation system will show the feasibility of including this technology on missions to asteroids, Mars, and the rest of the Solar System","Luna has already seen significant market pull for distributed fiber optic shape and position sensing in minimally invasive surgery. In 2014, Intuitive Surgical acquired Luna's shape sensing technology for use in medical applications.  Luna's recent developments have generated interest outside of the medical arena, with inspections of military structures, human posture measurements, and long-range shape and position measurement all as potential areas of growth.  Reducing the size, weight, and power of the interrogation system will enable this technology to meet a wider range of industry needs and bring it closer to industry adoption.

Due to the innovative motor design, the proposed system is significantly shorter than a conventional hybrid motor system but maintains safety, reduced complexity, and storability advantages of hybrid motor systems. The system leverages additive manufacturing for the rocket nozzle and injector system in order to decrease both weight and part count. This innovation is an ideal propulsion technology for a variety of sample return missions from Mars or other bodies with significant gravity wells.","With the wide variety of NASA objectives for sample return, one clear common thread is that high-performance, reliable propulsion systems for small vehicles will be essential to keeping the missions affordable.  Parabilis� proposed bi-axial hybrid propulsion technology addresses this common need and enables mission designers to realize a panoply of new high-value science missions that use low-cost small vehicles. In addition to the sample return missions, a propulsion solution to these challenging problems would also be useful across a range of other demanding propulsion applications where high-performance and compact size are critical.  These additional uses include entry, descent, and landing operations, launch vehicle upper stages, kick stages, and spacecraft main engines.  Every NASA exploration mission utilizes these components to greater or lesser degree, therefore, advancing the state of the art in sample return propulsion is bound to have payoffs throughout the exploration enterprise.","Numerous sample return missions from various bodies are either currently underway or in development, with the trend expected to grow as exploration continues. Hayabusa 2 is an asteroid sample return mission operated by the Japanese space agency and is currently en route to a 2018 rendezvous with asteroid Ryugu.

Of the tasks needing to be accomplished, the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), or means for getting the samples into orbit around Mars, is considered the highest risk.  The MAV will be required to remain on the Martian surface for a year or more in order to return to Earth on a minimum energy trajectory and coordinate with the other aspects of the MSR. Environmental conditions on Mars are a significant concern, with seasonal extremes of about �110�C and 25�C.  To reduce the required system mass and power related to thermal management, fuel, oxidizer, and ignition system components should be able to withstand these temperature variations.  The trajectory of the MAV also has the requirement for restart capabilities.The focus of this proposal is the development of hypergolic ignition systems for MAV application.  The current oxidizer of choice for the MAV is a mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON), which is a known hypergol with many fuels.  The proposed solution uses metal particles (e.g., hydrides, boranes, or borohydrides) to generate ignition by injection and mixing with the oxidizer.  The particles are initially housed in a sealed, pressurized chamber prior to injection.  An inert gas acts as the pressurant for the particles and also serves to protect the particles from oxidation and hydrolysis during storage.  Elimination of polymeric materials from the ignition train eliminates concerns of glass transition, which could lead to ignition failure in traditional pyrotechnic/pyrogen igniters.  The focus of the study is the design, analysis, and testing of potential particle injection configurations and the selection of the ideal candidate particle type and morphology.  At the completion of Phase I, as system ready for subscale testing in a hybrid rocket motor will be ready for implementation.","The proposed technology finds applications directly related to the MAV for MSR mission.  Further applications include the use in any system that would benefit from hybrid rocket propulsion systems that requires multiple start capability.  A feature of this technology is the scalable nature of the system.  The scalability can potentially allow application for a range of propulsion systems with sizes from cubesat thrusters to large scale-boosters.  The capability of hybrid propulsion systems for low operating temperatures makes them attractive candidates for planetary exploration and in-space propulsion.  The elimination of mass and power requirements for thermal management increases the potential payload mass.  As such, the use of this ignition technology is applicable to all such missions as it is based on the same premise of low-temperature storage and operation.","The capability for low-temperature storage and operation, ability to provide multiple ignition pulses, and simple design makes this development attractive for such systems as:- Attitude control systems for satellite propulsion;- Commercial or military propulsion systems that would undergo large temperature changes in storage;- Commercial or military space systems that require launch from cold climates;- Military propulsion systems that have wide temperature requirements for storage;",Fuels/Propellants; Launch Engine/Booster; Maneuvering/Stationkeeping/Attitude Control Devices; Spacecraft Main Engine

The converter operates as a charger, upconverter, and downconverter using a single transformer. The converter uses smart technology to interleave DAB converter stages for ripple current reduction and optimized load sharing of stages to extend the high efficiency load range of the converter to 6.25% of full load. By using smart technology, the load condition of each DAB converter stage is monitored and its load sharing controlled depending on the converters total load condition. In this way, each converter stage is kept at or above 25% load. Therefore the minimum load of the new DAB converter with four interleaved stages is one fourth of 25% or 6.25%.

The previously developed Venus Microsensor Chemical Array (VMCA) consists of sensing elements which can operate in a 500 C environment, but which currently rely on silicon based electronics for signal acquisition, control and data transmission, which requires active cooling for a Venus mission deployment. NASA GRC has demonstrated simple SiC electronic circuits, such as differential amplifiers and logic gates that were packaged and operated for a world-record of thousands of hours at 500 C. Ongoing work at NASA, universities, and industry is increasing the complexity and capability of SiC devices.  This proposal aims to develop electronics designs and architecture to enable NASA's high temperature SiC electronics to be applied to the VCMA to form a science instrument suitable for a future Venus mission.   Phase I will develop innovative designs using near term SiC components to provide transduction and signal processing needed to operate the VMCA without active cooling.  Phase I designs will be demonstrated in hardware using silicon versions of electronics components which are achievable in SiC.  This process is the key first step in applying emerging development of SiC electronics to a harsh environment chemical sensing need. Phase II will focus on implementation of the SiC electronics design utilizing the best available SiC components.","The primary NASA application of the specific technology will be for instrument development for Venus exploration. Future missions in the atmosphere and surface of Venus as defined by the Venus Flagship Mission Science and Technology Definition Team will require high temperature electronics.  The proposed development of high temperature electronics for a chemical measurement instrument supports the Decadal Survey finding that the Venus In-situ Explorer mission to be a New Frontiers high priority mission.  The high temperature electronics also have direct applications to on-engine instruments, such as pressure transducers, chemical sensors, and actuators for jet engines.","Non-NASA commercial applications are related to the use of instrumentation in high temperature applications such as mining, deep oil drilling, jet engine instrumentation and controls, solid oxide fuel cells, monitoring of geothermal wells, and deep underground mining.

Semiconductor technologies capable of meeting these demanding requirements tend to have limited capabilities, are expensive, and are not easily configured for specific mission requirements. Leading-edge applications will benefit from the ability to implement high speed interconnect protocols between host processors and system slaves, such as sensors, actuators, power managers, imagers and transceivers. The development of a Radiation Hardened Serializer/Deserializer (SERDES) embedded macro is proposed for insertion into digital integrated circuits (ICs) suitable for scalable single and multi-core processors, special purpose logic functions and scalable memory blocks on a space-qualified, radiation hardened integrated circuit digital fabric. A NASA-funded Structured ASIC architecture is under development at Micro-RDC, capable of meeting space-grade requirements while creating a cost-effective, quick-turn development environment. The SASIC fabric will implement known Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) techniques on an advanced 32nm CMOS SOI process, supporting high-density, high-speed low-power implementations. A unique Digital Logic Tile architecture with through-seal-ring connections allows the designer to define single or multi-core processors, dedicated logic functions, scalable memory blocks and user-defined I/Os; all on a single, scalable integrated circuit.The 32nm platform (fabric) development incorporates the RHBD building-blocks (e.g. flip-flops, gates, distributed memory, block memory, I/O) required for the systems designer to implement functional blocks for application-specific requirements. During this project a high speed SERDES physical layer macro will be developed for insertion into more complex digital processing elements.","NASA supports various requirements ranging from science missions, space station, and deep space missions requiring high-performance computing and controls.  Interplanetary and long term low Earth orbit systems require radiation tolerances capable of ensuring that the on-board electronics outlast the life expectancy of the systems. These demanding requirements of radiation tolerance and harsh operating environments force satellite systems developers to consider capabilities that are uniquely optimized for their applications. The Structured ASIC solves the dilemma of balancing performance, cost, risk and time to deployment against alternative solutions.Scalable, high performance control systems can support a wide range of applications when design flexibility is readily available.  The ability to right-size integrated circuits while adding features, such as high speed SERDES communication links, while maintaining performance at low costs enables the use of this technology across a wide range of programs and applications.NASA programs/missions that will benefit include the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) mission, Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO), BOReal EcosystemAtmosphere Study (BOREAS) and the Methane Trace Gas Sounder. Longer term missions include lunar landers and orbiters, Mars missions (MAVEN), solar system exploration (e.g. Titan, Juno, Europa, comet nucleus return, New Discovery, and Living with a Star (LWS)).","Companies that deploy satellites for purposes similar to NASA's Earth-centric applications will greatly benefit from this technology for the same reasons as NASA. There are, however, a number of additional applications that require this kind of performance.Military, intelligence and commercial satellites will show growing demand in units deployed and performance.  The 2014 FAA Commercial Space Transportation Forecasts predicts that an average of seventy eight commercial payloads will be launched annually over the next decade.  A reasonable estimate of the number of classified military and intelligence payloads at least equals the commercial deployments.  Micro-RDC currently offers 90nm, 50MHz RHBD Structured ASICs capable of handling low to mid-range control and compute requirements in space. The 32nm 300MHz capabilities in this proposal greatly improve densities and processing speed, including the ability to add high speed SERDES communication links. These links will enhance multi-processsor, multi-node computing, as well as enable communications to multiple peripheral functions such as sensors, actuators, image capture and processing subsystems and data communications links.","Avionics (see also Control and Monitoring); Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Command & Control; GPS/Radiometric (see also Sensors); Image Processing; Multiplexers/Demultiplexers; Navigation & Guidance; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Routers, Switches; Sensor Nodes & Webs (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport)"

Currently, the only approved full-system microbial reduction method is dry heat microbial reduction, which requires heating of the spacecraft to high temperature for a fixed length of time at a specific humidity. While this technique is practical and effective, some state-of-the-art electronics and other thermally sensitive components make this technique unusable for certain materials.One potential alternative technique for surface sterilization of a fully assembled spacecraft or components is the use of atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ), which has been an area of investigation within the biomedical community. The APPJ has the advantage that the plasma is ejected from a device (up to several centimeters) and travels to the surface to be sterilized. Eagle Harbor Technologies (EHT), Inc. is proposing to develop a large-area APPJ for spacecraft surface sterilization. EHT will leverage the previously developed EHT nanosecond pulser, which provides unprecedented control of output voltage, pulse width, and pulse repetition frequency. This capability will allow EHT researchers to develop and optimize an APPJ for surface sterilization.","The primary goal of the proposed SBIR program is the development of a large-area atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) for spacecraft surface sterilization for Planetary Protection. The Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 outlines potential planetary missions that require the need for developing advanced Contamination Control for Planetary Protection technology over the next decade, especially for Mars, Europa, and Enceladus missions. The EHT large-area APPJ would complement other contamination control technologies in NASA�s toolkit. The EHT large-area APPJ would allow for the sterilization of materials that cannot be subjected to other sterilization technique and thereby allowing spacecraft designers to utilize a wider range of components and materials.","Surface sterilization is an important issue for the medical community. In hospitals the ability to sterilize a surface without chemicals or heat would potentially allow for faster, more robust cleaning of surfaces. The large-area nature of the EHT APPJ would allow large surfaces to be sterilized more quickly. Additionally, surface sterilization with large-area APPJ could play an important role in biomedical research laboratories to prevent contamination of instruments and surfaces while limiting the spread of infectious diseases. Another commercial application of the EHT large-area APPJ is surface treatments. APPJs are used for the treatment, cleaning, and modification of surfaces for a wide range of applications from nanoparticle production to improving material bonding.",Coatings/Surface Treatments; Isolation/Protection/Radiation Shielding (see also Mechanical Systems); Remediation/Purification

Contamination Control and Planetary Protection requirements focus on both forward and backward contamination from such bodies where a number of acceptable processes have been developed for sterilizing spacecraft hardware and sample return materials. In particular for backward contamination control, NASA has shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide is an effective method for sterilizing samples and surfaces. However, for long duration exploration missions, stored hydrogen peroxide solutions lose their efficacy. To ensure an effective vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization process for return trips, Reactive Innovations, LLC proposes to develop a miniaturized vapor hydrogen peroxide generator that produces this sterilant in situ using only water and DC electrical energy. With this approach, surfaces and sample return materials can be effectively sterilized during sample collection using a NASA approved sterilant.","This vaporized hydrogen peroxide generator will serve NASA's needs for contamination control and planetary protection. Integrating this peroxide generator into sterilization system will enable an effective sterilant to be produced for long duration missions where stored hydrogen peroxide is not feasible. Further, reclaiming the oxygen and water breakdown products from hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes can be reprocessed within the peroxide generator hardware minimizing mass expendables.","Commercial opportunities for the hydrogen peroxide generator may be directed toward medical equipment sterilization. Integrating this generator into sterilizers will enable fresh hydrogen peroxide to be generated overcoming storage concerns that can lead to a loss of efficacy over time. Additionally, recurring sterilization costs would be reduced for the operators using on-demand generated hydrogen peroxide rather than using resupply of hydrogen peroxide cartridges. Toward a more effective sterilization system, Reactive's hydrogen peroxide generator may be combined with a comparable ozone generator Reactive produces. Both hydrogen peroxide and ozone are effective sterilants in themselves, however, combining the two sterilants together produces hydroxyl radicals that are extremely effective for sterilization processes.  This combined hydrogen peroxide and ozone sterilization system would compete favorably to existing hydrogen peroxide/gas plasma sterilization systems that create powerful hydroxyl radicals as well.","Fluids; Food (Preservation, Packaging, Preparation); Material Handing & Packaging; Medical; Remediation/Purification; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Waste Storage/Treatment"

VCSELs run out of bandwidth at 56 Gb/s PAM4, and the latency of PAM4 is incompatible with super-computing. Other available technologies are excessively expensive, have high power consumption, are far from proven or they require temperature control. The proposed concept integrates an Electro-Absorption Modulator (EAM) with a Surface-Emitting (SE) laser capable of > 100 Gb/channel NRZ which can be arrayed to > 1 Tb/s for a 10 element array. Using NRZ instead of a more complex format reduces latency dramatically. The proposed device can operate over a wide temperature range, at least 25 C to 125 C and potentially over the full military range without temperature control. The EAM SE laser has a 30% reduction in power per bit compared to VCSEL solutions, and the transmission distance is dramatically improved. The proposed low cost device  can be manufactured by the billions. The EAM SE laser array can be flip-chip mounted  onto silicon.. This unique device has ten times the  reach of VCSELs, more than sufficient for any data center or super computer. The EAM SE laser is made from elements which are already proven and understood, but put together in a manner which achieves the performance ultra-scale computing needs.","Potential NASA ApplicationsThe proposed EAM SE laser solves the latency, bandwidth, footprint, and power consumption problems of optical communications in ultra scale computing and super computing which are vital to the success of NASA?s mission. In adddition LAN?s and MAN?s can also use the technology because of its substantial range. The device will be flip chip mounted on silicon and it has a temperature range of at least 25C to 125 C so it can handle the heat load which an array encounters on top of silicon driver circuitry.  The  > 1 Tbps  data rates and compact EAM SE laser arrays reduce the number of fiber cores, which have become prohibitive with current VCSEL technology..  The radical approach of the EAM SE laser solves difficult and profound problems with current optical communication technologies using already understood elements.   The EAM SE laser can be put into high volume production quickly.","Potential non NASA ApplicationsThe proposed EAM SE laser operates over a temperature range of at least 25 C to 125 C, provides low latency NRZ > 1Tbps data transmission for a 10 element array. The low cost device  has minimal power consumption,  is compact, has range more than sufficient for communication across a data center, MANs, LANs or as short as chip to chip, and is easily integrable on silicon by flip chip bonding and provides vertical light emission. The technologies used in this device are proven, but the elements are put together using design choices optimized for low power, ultra-high speed low latency communication.  These characteristics make this device ideal for super computing, large data centers, chip to chip communication, LANs and MANs with a short time to market given sufficient resources. In the long term, the array elements may be used by the hundreds in small scale computing in products such  as PCs and smart devices resulting in total volumes approaching one trillion devices.","Cables/Fittings; Data Processing; Fiber (see also Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Photonics); Gratings; Lasers (Communication); Network Integration"

Early investment in analyzing a wide range of options can produce markedly better designs.  That means pervasive modeling and simulation (M&S) early in conceptual design could pay large dividends for NASA, especially if M&S were cheaper to carry out, and if resulting models could be exploited throughout and across projects.We propose to develop Model Annotations and Tools for Teamwork, Execution, and Reuse (MATTER).  This innovative technology will increase the efficiency and value of model-based systems engineering (MBSE).  MATTER will improve on existing SysML-based MBSE by defining new types of metadata that enable valuable processing capabilities not supported by the standard SysML language and existing tools: (1) Semantic descriptions capturing the intended uses of model fragments will encourage reuse, when combined with tools for managing and searching a model library; (2) Additional descriptions of model component interfaces will enable efficient composition and configuration of models; (3) Annotations on the behaviors and constraints of model elements will ease automation of simulation generation and analysis; (4) Tracking of model changes--including version branches representing alternate designs--will facilitate flexible trade analysis, model continuity and evolution across the project lifecycle, and teamwork; and (5) Generation and routing of change notifications will further coordinate team efforts, as awareness of shifts in inputs or the irrelevance of intended outputs will reduce wasted work.During this project, we will design the system and develop a software prototype that illustrates the feasibility and utility of this approach.","MATTER technology will enable NASA mission planners and systems engineers to more quickly and thoroughly document, evaluate, vary, and extend early design explorations and decisions.  MATTER will contribute to the successful adoption of MBSE, lowering the costs of formal modeling and increasing the payoffs.  Application will not ultimately be limited to use on space-based science missions.  With appropriate extension to ontologies and growth of supporting libraries, MATTER can become an enterprise-wide accelerator across entire mission lifecycles.","Whether in Government or industry, essentially all large-scale systems development efforts have a substantial systems engineering component.  These could all benefit from the increased rigor of MBSE and the improved usability, economics, and long-term payoff of MATTER.  Thus, this technology will be of high value, for instance, in many Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and Federal Aviation Administration acquisitions.

NASA has invested significant effort and has developed a draft FM Handbook to improve FM design, development, V&V and operations processes. While the FM Handbook provides rules and guidelines, those can be effectively followed for realizing the above mentioned goals with the aid of advanced Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) software tools. NASA uses a variety of such tools to conduct its FM activities. However, these tools are varied and disjoint, and often require manual intervention to transfer data from the output of one tool to the input of another. This process is tedious and error-prone and scales poorly for large, complex systems. This prevents SHM engineers from gaining insight into the overall system level design and characteristics that are key to transparency, verifiability and efficiency of implementing and testing FM. To address these challenges QSI-DST team plans to develop techniques and concomitant software tools to (1) capture diverse and disjoint data products and multi-domain modeling information into TEAMS for standardizing FM Techniques and Activities, (2) conduct Architecture Trade Studies focusing on failure detection (abort trigger) effectiveness with corresponding sensor suite selection, and (3) introduce ancillary capabilities in TEAMS to support the main tasks such as assessment of Failure Effect Propagation timing (FEPT). The proposed effort seeks to aid the evaluation and V&V of FM of system(s) in multiple usage scenarios through utilizing existing capabilities and introducing added capabilities to TEAMS for the computation and evolution of relevant FM analyses. The added capabilities include information integration; extending the system modeling capabilities; and assessing the effect of implementing diagnostic decisions on overall functionality of the system.","NASA's current vision to enhance the level of fault management and planning makes the proposed effort worthy of funding from several branches within it. Clearly, establishing the proposed technology that will increase Flight Safety despite planned and unplanned failure events, and the software tool for supporting their implementation will allow NASA to better plan and execute future Science Missions. As per the proposed implementation it is envisioned that the technology will also be able to readily operate as part of NASA's next generation Mission Control Technology allowing NASA to utilize the fault management and mission satisfiability information from the tool for improved mission execution while improving safety, mission success probability. In addition, NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft has some simulation and vehicle model. These can be used as a candidate information sources for TEAMS to build the FM capabilities for this vehicle. This technology is also directly applicable to both military and commercial aircraft applications.","Among other agencies, DoD, US Air Force, US Navy, and commercial aviation (e.g., SpaceX) are the most likely potential customers for the resulting technologies. Large scale military systems (systems of systems) such as NORAD, Space Command ground segments, the Joint Strike Fighter fleet, the Navy shipboard platforms, Submarine Commands and ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems can be potential areas to field the proposed technology. In addition, UAVs, UMGs and other unmanned submersible vehicle markets are potential targets as well. The product is also expected to be of commercial value to the manufacturers of DoD and military's remotely guided weapons and reconnaissance systems. Since the TEAMS-based solution can also be hosted into most advanced engineering systems, the solution can function as a standalone product. Therefore, this can be marketed to commercial aircraft operators and maintainers as well. In addition, it could benefit OEM customer support of globally distributed high-value high-assurance equipment such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment and medical diagnostic equipment.","Analytical Methods; Diagnostics/Prognostics; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Quality/Reliability; Recovery (see also Autonomous Systems); Simulation & Modeling; Software Tools (Analysis, Design)"

Specifically mass savings are tremendous with the use of radiation hardened high voltage and power devices: A possible use of 300 V solar arrays instead of the 120 V option for solar electric propulsion would decrease the payload by as much as 2.5 tons with larger voltage operation resulting in further weight cuts. This is only practically achievable using radiation hardened silicon carbide devices as the silicon on-resistance versus radiation hardening penalty renders the silicon option not beneficial for conversion efficiencies. To achieve space SEE and TID tolerant silicon carbide power devices, we will follow two parallel paths.First, we are partnering with Cree (Wolfspeed) to determine heavy ion and TID susceptibility of their Gen2 1200 V power MOSFETs. We will also devise experiments to understand and identify failure mechanisms leading to the measured behavior. In Phase I, we will pursue these experiments, and start device modeling these Gen2 devices. In Phase II, we will build on this foundation to come up with possible rad-hard designs that will be newly fabricated and tested. Second, CoolCAD also plans to design, lay out and fabricate JFET based silicon carbide high voltage / power devices. This provides an alternative to Cree's MOS based power device. In Phase I, we will fabricate a prototype JFET power device, and plan to also heavy ion test this device to determine its vulnerability to heavy ions and TID.","An example immediate benefit of the space hardened high voltage parts with voltage ratings >300 V is that they would enable next generation high-power electric propulsion systems beyond their current limit of 5 kW. Use of a wide bandgap semiconductor such as silicon carbide would also increase their efficiency beyond that is currently achieved in these systems, which is >92%. Silicon carbide as being the most mature among the wide bandgap semiconductors in terms of fabrication and processing offers an enabling technology for meeting the NASA technology roadmap goals and milestones.

However, the current state of the art for this technology proves to have significant issues that prevent its use in the space environment.  Specifically the susceptibility to heavy ion damage that requires significant derating of the devices to a point that makes their use not practical.  The problem for SiC MOSFET?s appears to make these devices unusable in space system due to the extremely low operating voltage where damage occurs within the device.  This proposal will focus on SiC MOSFET and propose a novel approach to significantly improve the heavy ion performance to a level where the use of SiC MOSFET?s constructed using this approach would be feasible in most space applications.  Semicoa is teamed with General Electric Global Research Center (GEGR) to solve this issue and provide a pathway to bring these devices to the space market fully qualified to military specifications.  The focus of this effort will be to further optimize the hardening techniques being investigated by GEGR and develop a novel approach to depositing the gate oxide with Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) techniques.  This approach will allow the use of a much thicker gate oxide, while maintaining the total dose hardness characteristics, and provide significant improvement to the heavy ion performance.  The challenge will be addressing the interface between the dielectric and the semiconductor.  It is believed that the ALD process using a High-K dielectric material will lower the interface state density to achieve the total dose hardness while at the same time provide for a significant improvement in the heavy ion performance.","The development and integration of high voltage/high temperaturecomponents that can be space qualified will lead to increases in system level performance as they will tend to increase efficiency and decrease mass at the system architecture level. Such performance improvements are necessary if NASA is to realize several operational concepts such as very high power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP).  In a simplistic but specific realization, higher voltage parts allow power generation at higher voltages on the arrays themselves, this higher voltage allows for the same power to be transferred at lower current thereby reducing cable mass at the system level.","Silicon MOSFET?s seem to be reaching the ?end of the road? as far as improvements to the technology for power, speed and performance.  SiC MOSFET technology offers high-temperature and high-power operation far superior that that of Silicon MOSFETs.  It is generally felt that SiC is early in its life cycle and there are many applications that could benefit from this technology.  SiC extreme high electron mobility and low temperature coefficient enables a very low RDS(ON).  This device would have superior switching characteristics due to the high critical field, high electron mobility, high saturation velocity and low gate-drain capacitance of the SiC device.  This also allows for short delay times and excellent controllability in low duty-cycle applications.  SiC devices also have significantly lower output capacitance when compared to Silicon MOSFET?s of similar RDS(ON).  SiC offers the benefits of the least power consumption while providing for the lowest energy loss at extremely high temperatures requiring limited external cooling.","Amplifiers/Repeaters/Translators; Characterization; Circuits (including ICs; for specific applications, see e.g., Communications, Networking & Signal Transport; Control & Monitoring, Sensors); Manufacturing Methods; Materials (Insulator, Semiconductor, Substrate); Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Power Combiners/Splitters; Routers, Switches; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Transmitters/Receivers"

SiC devices offer higher temperature operation, lower on-resistance, higher breakdown voltages, and higher power conversion efficiency than Silicon power devices. However, high vulnerability to heavy-ion induced degradation and catastrophic failure has precluded this promising technology from space PMAD applications. Importantly, physical mechanisms for this vulnerability are not well understood, resulting in the inability to develop radiation hardened SiC devices. CFDRC, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University and Wolfspeed, a Cree company, will utilize a coupled experimental and physics-based modeling approach to address this challenge. In Phase I, we will perform heavy ion testing of commercial Wolfspeed SiC Schottky diode and power MOSFET to generate response data. Detailed TCAD models for the diode will be developed, validated, and applied to identify physical mechanisms behind measured radiation response. In Phase II, we will focus on SiC power MOSFETs and perform additional heavy ion and total dose testing as a function of temperature and bias. Extensive TCAD modeling will be performed to identify radiation and temperature dependent response mechanisms, and to investigate device structure/process modifications for improved radiation hardness.

Specifically highlighted is the need for physics-based models of power-related components. The modeling and analysis tools developed here directly address this need, and will help NASA better evaluate device performance under radiation and high temperature at an early stage, and design space qualified power electronics with better understanding and control of design margins, thereby reducing the development time and cost.","Space qualified SiC power electronics will find application in power systems in all space-based platforms, including DoD space systems (communication, surveillance, missile defense), and commercial satellites.

Applications in the terrestrial energy sector include PMAD systems in all-electric and hybrid cars, grid-scale energy storage systems, smart grid, green energy systems (wind/solar systems), solid-state lighting, and remote, off-grid power systems (crewed vehicles and habitats). Other commercial applications of SiC include high temperature power and control systems for extreme environments such as geothermal drill sites and sensor systems in engines of aircraft and hybrid vehicles.

Our proposed project specifically addresses these issues. Thermoplastically net shaped BMG structures through blow-molding will fulfill these needs. Furthermore, the net-shape ability allows reduction of components, joints, costs and weight. It also enables multifunctional structures through integration of sensors, keys, and feedthroughs into BMG articles. This is achieved due to exceptional strength and elasticity of BMGs, as well as novel processing methods, developed and patented by Prof. Schroers at Yale and Supercool Metal. Specifically, for Phase I of the project, we will target net shaping and fabrication of multifunctional BMG structures with sizes suitable for small satellites,but this technology has broader implications on structural space applications in general.","Combining the properties of best structural metals with the processability of thermoplastics brings unique opportunities that will have a vast impact in a broad range of industries. Net shaping of BMGs is highly attractive for electronic casings, defense (armor), aerospace, automotive, watches, and biomedical industries. Currently, Supercool Metals has several contracts with large commercial companies in the watch industry for production of prototype watch movement components based on our TPF net shaping and molding processes. We are also working with electronics companies on development of casings for mobile phones and laptops and with aerospace companies on replacement of Ti-based components.",Antennas; Contact/Mechanical; Metallics; Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Pressure/Vacuum; Processing Methods; Smart/Multifunctional Materials; Structures

Monument Ave., Dayton, OH 45402 - 1382",(937) 412-1208,2,4,"In this project Advratech will develop a new additive manufacturing (AM) process called Selective Laser Ablation and Melting (SLAM).  The key innovation in this project is the implementation of laser micromachining - guided by high resolution surface profilometry - as a subtractive method for making in-process corrections to traditional SLM builds.  Currently such an approach to hybrid AM has not been created, but will significantly advance the state-of-the-art for advanced metallic materials manufacturing.  The SLAM process will build a layer of a part by conventional SLM, immediately determine deviations from intended part tolerance - which may result either from normal limits of SLM resolution or errors in powder spreading - and then use the micromachining laser to correct those deviations before continuing to the next layer of the build.  Unlike other AM processes, SLAM will be able to produce micron-precision features and smooth surfaces on complex internal part structures that cannot be obtained by any other means. It will also produce high resolution external surface features and minimal roughness levels that will require little or no post-processing.  Finally, by elimination of small build errors in situ, before they can propagate into larger errors, it will greatly enhance reliability relative to traditional SLM methods and current hybrid AM methods, leading to higher part confidence, better process documentation (LLP data can be stored to inform digital thread records and digital twin models), and thus easier part certification.  A new AM process with these improvements has been identified an area of need for NASA, where current processes struggle to produce validated, defect free parts in a reliable fashion.  By achieving these improvements SLAM will also reduce costs and lead-time.  Manufacturing possibilities are increased as well by enabling micro-AM components or internal features.","As with standard SLM, the general application of the SLAM process is the manufacture of metal components that have complex geometries not efficiently obtainable by other means, or that require production in low quantities (e.g., replacement of legacy parts) that is too expensive for conventional manufacturing. The number of specific component applications from aerospace and other sectors is vast. The value of SLAM to practitioners of SLM at NASA is the improvement of several aspects of the SLM process, including: Improved resolution and finer feature size, process reliability and success rate, Reduced post-processing needs, in-process monitoring for process qualification, closed-loop feedback control, final inspection of component geometry, and the Materials Genome Initiative where the micromachining capabilities of SLAM will facilitate improved model validation capability.  For specific NASA applications we envision SLAM being highly useful for low-volume space platform components of complex geometry and structure.  The micromachining capability brought to bear in this project may also have great application in other NASA AM processes, such as electron-beam powder bed processes and EBF3.  In electron-beam powder bed processes the entire powder bed is loosely sintered to the finished components.  With in situ micromachining this sintered powder would be separated from the components, drastically reducing post-processing needs.","SLAM represents a new AM process with many advantages over SLM, and other, processes.  Therefore, much like with NASA specific applications, the number of Non-NASA commercial applications are vast.  Nevertheless, there is significant overlap with NASA applications in the aerospace industry, where new AM processes are consistently sought after for developing superior rocket motor and jet engine components, as well as less flight critical components.  A recent example from Luna Innovations is the AM of aerodynamic components with embedded fiber-optic sensors, the micron-precision SLAM will bring to bear will greatly enhance this work, and facilitate multidimensional fiber channels. In addition to LUNA, Resonetics, a leading laser-based medical device manufacturer, would benefit tremendously from the ability to produce customized micro-medical devices.  These may include complex stents for arterial junctions, neurological probes, and other applications - current AM techniques are not adequate for this work. Other government agencies have potential applications as well, including the Army Research and Development Engineering Center who are seeking advanced AM technology for enhanced munitions technologies.  Finally, SLAM has potential application as a research and development test-bed at Universities and other R&D groups, who seek low-cost, customizable AM technology.",Condition Monitoring (see also Sensors); In Situ Manufacturing; Lasers (Machining/Materials Processing); Lasers (Measuring/Sensing); Microfabrication (and smaller; see also Electronics; Mechanical Systems; Photonics); Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE; NDT); Optical/Photonic (see also Photonics); Process Monitoring & Control; Prototyping; Quality/Reliability

Although TSW offers an approach which allows more precise control of the temperature, better measurement of temperature in the weld zone is needed. The Industrial Measurement System Inc. (IMS Inc.) and University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) team propose to demonstrate the feasibility of ultrasonic thermometry technique to measure temperature, in real-time, in the fusion zone, during the TSW process. Using sensors attached to the containment plates, precise time-of-flight (ToF) measurements of ultrasound propagating through the fusion zone will be used to estimate temperature.  This temperature measurement is non-intrusive and does not influence the thermal transport in the weld zone.  Temperature data can be obtained at data rates as high as 1 kHz with the precision of a few degrees Centigrade.  Thus, these measurements can be used as feedback controls in in-situ process control strategy for the TSW process.  Precise temperature control will enable superior mechanical properties in the weld joint and thus maximize the capability of the TSW weld process.","NASA is using several manufacturing processes supporting the Space Launch System to create structures with superior mechanical properties and increased reliability.  Solid state welding including ultrasonic, thermal, and friction stir welding is among the joining methods particularly well suited for high-strength, temperature-resistant materials such as titanium alloys, Inconel/Nickel-Based alloys.  Real-time, in-process measurement of weld temperature can be used to control the joining process to produce high-strength, defect-free components and joints, improve weld quality, significantly reduce costs, and increase production rates.  Potential NASA applications for the TSW technology include solid and liquid rocket motor casing, liquid rocket nozzle extensions, and other high temperature components.","The Navy is interested in effective titanium alloy welding technologies for ship building.  Similarly the Army has a need to joining titanium for use in land vehicles and armor.  Several commercial companies are pursuing TSW and FSW including Boeing, Airbus, Hayes Wheels, Williams International, and Lockheed-Martin.  Many of the metals used in the oil and gas industry are difficult to fusion weld including titanium and its alloys. Thus, solid state joining processes which require precise temperature control are being pursued as alternatives to produce robust structures more amenable to high pressure applications.",Metallics; Processing Methods; Thermal

The greatest risk/concern voiced by these mission development teams related to composite TRAC?-Boom technology is the highly nonlinear and time-dependent creep and stress relaxation behavior of the bonded ?ridge-joint? that joins the two circular flanges and endures sustained stress when the boom is flattened and stowed.To address this concern, Roccor proposes to improve the performance of the bondline in composite TRAC?-Booms by reinforcing the adhesive joint with high stiffness elements that allow higher packaging strains while minimizing creep.  We also propose to validate a relatively low cost, out-of-autoclave process for affecting the bond, and validate analytical models to simulate the time- and temperature-dependent viscoelastic behavior of composite TRAC? bonded joint, and guide engineering qualification of the joints for future NASA missions.  The results of the proposed Phase 1 program will include: 1) assessment of the feasibility of Roccor?s creep-resistant bondline technology, 2) validation of an engineering framework (through model and test correlation) for flight validation of composite TRAC?-Boom designs, and 3) development of a Phase 2 plan for elevation of the technology from TRL 3 to TRL 5 for future NASA flight applications.",* CORSAIR comet sample return ?harpoon?* Deployable solar sails (NEA Scout)* Deployable mono-pole and di-pole antennas for CubeSats* Deployable CubeSat decelerators,* Deployable solar sails* Deployable mono-pole and di-pole antennas for CubeSats* Deployable CubeSat decelerators,"Actuators & Motors; Characterization; Composites; Deployment; Models & Simulations (see also Testing & Evaluation); Polymers; Prototyping; Spacecraft Design, Construction, Testing, & Performance (see also Engineering; Testing & Evaluation); Spacecraft Instrumentation & Astrionics (see also Communications; Control & Monitoring; Information Systems); Structures"

Standard operating procedures are at the heart of spacecraft operations, with almost 5000 procedures for ISS alone. Performing these procedures often requires close collaboration between ground controllers who have deep knowledge of the spacecraft's systems and crew members who have on-board situation awareness. This close collaboration will become more difficult in extended missions and crew members will need to have more autonomy. Augmented reality technology can help replace some of the guidance that ground controllers offer to crew members during procedure execution. Augmented reality can also provide continuous and just-in-time training opportunities during extended missions as well as entertainment and social connection opportunities. Context-sensitive augmented reality  provides different support depending upon the on-board situation and ties directly to procedures, system data, daily plans, background information, and robotic assistants. TRACLabs has developed a procedure integrated development environment called PRIDE that is currently being used by NASA for ISS and Orion procedures. TRACLabs proposes to integrate augmented reality technologies into PRIDE in collaboration with the Georgia Tech Augmented Environmental Lab. In particular, Georgia Tech has developed an augmented realty capable web browser and Javascript framework that will complement the PRIDE web-based procedure execution system. These two industry-leading technologies will form the platform on which a suite of context-sensitive augmented reality applications can be quickly developed and deployed for a variety of NASA applications.","This research can have immediate application to ISS operations because there are several iPads already on ISS and a Microsoft HoloLens on its way. We will use ISS procedures as test cases for this project. We will work closely with a variety of NASA personnel who are working on next generation procedure displays. We also see applications to robotic missions including control of NASA's R2 and R5 robots and robots on other planetary surfaces. PRIDE is being evaluated for use in ground operators for the Resource Prospector robotic mission to the moon being jointly developed by NASA JSC and ARC. Ground operations personnel are currently evaluating PRIDE and this technology would be able to assist them in their operations. We also have a close relationship with the Autonomous Mission Operations TOCA Autonomous Operations Project (AMO-TOCA)being tested on-board ISS. This could serve as a potential Phase~III testbed on ISS. Finally, we have connections to the Human Research Program (HRP) at NASA and will work with those personnel to identify applications, including analog test environments, for this work.  We will meet with all of these individuals in Phase~I to determine their requirements and use cases for augmented reality.","TRACLabs is already selling PRIDE  as a commercial product with oil field services company Baker Hughes as a launch customer. Baker Hughes is field-testing PRIDE  at several sites world-wide before deployment in actual operations in mid-2016. PRIDE is proving automation assistance to drilling operations. Augmented reality would immediately increase the effectiveness of the PRIDE software in drilling operations by providing assistance in performing complex and dangerous procedures. TRACLabs expects additional customers in the oil and gas industry will deploy PRIDE  once it has been proven effective by Baker Hughes. TRACLabs also sees application of this technology in the automotive manufacturing area. TRACLabs performed a small pilot project for automotive supplier Magna (second largest in the world with 285 manufacturing facilities and over 125,000 employees) on flexible robotic assembly. This was successful, and after a tour of several Magna manufacturing facilities in North America, TRACLabs personnel are negotiating a follow-on contract for research and development. Augmented reality would be used to assign personnel on the manufacturing floor in performing their tasks and validating their work. We expect other manufacturing companies to be interested as well.

The cost of a missed capture or improper arm/vehicle contact is likely to be very high. Since these operations may be performed up to six months after the most recent ground-based training, crews aboard the ISS prepare for such manual robotic tasks with the Robotics On-Board Trainer, a laptop-based graphical/dynamic simulator using NASA Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphic (DOUG) software from Johnson Space Center's Virtual Reality Laboratory. This system, however, does not utilize any real-world, 3-D, out-the-window views. Building upon recent advances in head-mounted augmented reality systems, the team of Systems Technology, Inc. and Dr. Stephen Robinson of UC Davis propose the Station Manipulator Arm Augmented Reality Trainer (SMAART) that will offer ISS crews significantly more realistic on-board refresher training for vehicle capture by manipulating the actual SSRMS with real out-the-Cupola-window views, but with a graphically-simulated vehicle overlaid on the astronaut's non-simulated view via a head-mounted display. Providing multi-sensory realism in on-board training for such high cognitive-demand skills is expected to increase crew readiness and therefore reduce operational risk for visiting vehicle capture.",The proposed Station Manipulator Arm Augmented Reality Trainer (SMAART) technology directly supports the Augmented Reality topic of the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) by allowing astronauts to train/mission rehearse the complex resupply capsule capture task with the mission specific hardware. Currently all training conducted once on-board the ISS is accomplished using a simulation program that does not include use of the actual SSRMS inceptors or feature real-world views. This proposed program also compliments the current STMD Game Changing Development Program IDEAS - Integrated Display and Environmental Awareness System. This program led by Kennedy Space Center with support from Ames Research Center is developing a transparent head mounted display augmented reality system to support situational awareness for operations on Earth and in Space. The emerging SMAART technology can be used to support and/or enhance IDEAS-based applications.,"The SMAART-based technology is a leap forward from conventional augmented reality in that it will allow the virtual objects to interact directly, not passively with real-world objects in the combined mixed-world environment. Furthermore, using the new geometry-based keying technology, any vehicle or environment can potentially become an in situ simulator. Examples include aviation, a shipyard crane cab, a UAS ground station, and many others. Imagine that a naval aviator can repeatedly practice carrier landings in the actual aircraft at a safe altitude to improve proficiency in a wide variety of conditions before ever attempting actual landings on the carrier. This technology will find applications in the area of hazardous duty training for first responders and the military and broad commercial applications in training for industrial maintenance tasks and operator training with complex machines and vehicles.",Display; Image Processing; Man-Machine Interaction; Mission Training; Prototyping; Robotics (see also Control & Monitoring; Sensors); Simulation & Modeling; Tools/EVA Tools

MonitAR will replace guidance from mission control during periods of long time delay or when communication with Earth is not possible. Astronauts using AR glasses will receive feedback from MonitAR via visual cues as they progress through procedures on the spacecraft. The visual cues will be provided when MonitAR determines the astronaut is executing a task (a specific step in the procedure) that deviates from the current procedure. MonitAR will then guide the astronaut back to completing the task in a way that fits with the procedure. During execution, the current and upcoming tasks are proactively displayed to the astronaut in a readable form. The key innovation is to apply Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to enable MonitAR to predict the task the astronaut is beginning to execute rather than recognize it when completed. This look-ahead capability enables guidance to be provided early enough to avoid procedure/task failure. Moreover, CBR takes advantage of the astronaut?s extensive training to capture how procedures/tasks are completed and, thereby, avoid a cumbersome and brittle modeling effort. Astronaut procedures will be represented as tasks in a plan using Action Notation Modeling Language (ANML), a planning language already being used to represent astronaut procedures. By representing the procedures as plans, the different ways a procedure can be correctly executed will be captured directly from the existing procedures.","The initial target application for this work is to support astronaut training operations. MonitAR will enable astronauts to operate and maintain numerous systems that might unexpectedly break or provide emergency first aid without support from Earth. By adding AR-enabled look-ahead capability in monitoring procedure performance, MonitAR will provide timely guidance to keep astronauts on task.","Other potential applications for MonitAR include situations where users are under stress, required to follow procedures to accomplish certain tasks, and train to maintain proficiency in them. Examples include maintenance operations on complex systems like airplanes, ships, industrial control systems, and so on. MonitAR could also be used for providing first aid in the field when a medical doctor is not present. Potential customers include DoD's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), FEMA for relief/response operations, and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) for epidemic control procedures. In the private sector, companies that provide industrial control systems would find MonitAR useful in handling abnormal situations in refineries, electrical and nuclear facilities, and manufacturing settings.","Autonomous Control (see also Control & Monitoring); Data Input/Output Devices (Displays, Storage); Intelligence; Man-Machine Interaction; Mission Training; Perception/Vision; Tools/EVA Tools"

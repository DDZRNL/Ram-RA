      "NASA is interested in soliciting proposals to develop a process for large scale freeform fabrication using additive manufacturing of GRCop-42 and functional gradient materials. Components such as rocket nozzles and heat exchangers are actively-cooled with internal channel features and require high performance materials in the extreme environment. Typically these components are made from a monolithic alloy, although various alloys and functional gradient materials could increase performance and optimize the overall system. The objective of this solicitation is to complete process development (i.e., directed energy deposition, coldspray, etc.) to fabricate a freeform component that incorporates thin-wall integral channels into a structure. This process should focus on GRCop-42 (Cu-Cr-Nb) and transition to an alternate material using a functional gradient process. The proposer should provide a technique and approach to axially transition from the GRCop-42 to alternate alloy (Superalloy, Stainless, High Entropy Alloys) providing a compatible functional gradient joint to minimize stresses. A thorough development approach would include process development, initial characterization and testing of the GRCop-42 and functional gradient alloys, process demonstration of manufacturing technology demonstrators (MTD), and trade study and/or planning to increase the scale to several feet in diameter.\n",

These technologies have been limited to monolithic materials though. Additional development has included bimetallic cladding (radial deposition) to provide superalloy jackets on copper-alloy combustion chambers under the Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) project, however this technology is not easily accessible at service companies. While the technology exist to fabricate components at sizes <16” diameter using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) using GRCop-42, this is limited to a monolithic material in the axial direction. There are also no current additive techniques to rapidly fabricate GRCop-42 structures larger than this scale.\n",

Optimized structures for heat exchanges and combustion devices would include the ability to fabricate large structures with complex internal features and vary/transition alloys along the axial length of a component (not just radial). This would allow for a more compliant bond between a copper-alloy and alternate material instead of a drastic change in alloys. This would reduce risk of joints. A further gap is the ability to produce copper-alloys, such as GRCop-42, in scales larger than 16” diameter. This provides new solutions for designers of large engines and structures providing higher thermal margins on the walls with the use of copper.

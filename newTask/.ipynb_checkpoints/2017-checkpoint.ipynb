Autonomous Systems technologies provide the means of migrating mission control from Earth to spacecraft and habitats. This is enhancing for missions in the Earth-Lunar neighborhood and enabling for deep space missions. Long light-time delays, up to 42 minutes round-trip between Earth and Mars, require time-critical control decisions to be closed on-board autonomously through automation and astronaut-automation teaming rather than through round-trip communication to Earth mission control. </p><p>Long-term crewed spacecraft and habitats, such as the International Space Station, are so complex that a significant portion of the crew's time is spent keeping it operational under even under nominal conditions in low-Earth orbit, while still requiring significant real-time support from Earth. The considerable challenge is to migrate the knowledge and capability embedded in current Earth mission control, with tens to hundreds of human specialists ready to provide instant knowledge, to on-board automation that teams with astronauts to autonomously manage spacecraft and habitats. The autonomous agent subtopic addresses this challenge by soliciting proposals that leverage the growing field of cognitive computing to advance technology for deep-space autonomy. </p><p>The technology challenge for autonomous crewed systems in off-nominal conditions is even more critical. In the majority of Apollo lunar missions, Earth mission control was needed to resolve critical off-nominal situations ranging from unexplained computer alarms on Apollo 11 to the oxygen tank explosion on Apollo 13 that required executing an 87 hour free return abort trajectory around the moon and back to earth. Through creative use of Lunar Module assets, Apollo 13 had sufficient resiliency to keep the three astronauts alive despite loss of the oxygen tank and many of the capabilities of the service module. In contrast to a lunar mission, a free return abort trajectory around mars and back to earth is on the order of two years – requiring a leap in resiliency.  To prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) in deep space missions, spacecraft and habitats will require long-term resiliency to handle failures that lead to loss of critical function or unexpected expenditure of consumables. Long communication delays or accidents that cause loss of communication will require that the initial failure response be handled autonomously. The subtopic on resilient autonomous systems solicits technology for the design and quantification of resiliency in long-duration missions. The subtopic on sustainable habitats solicits technology for long-term system health management that goes beyond short-term diagnosis technology to include advances machine learning and other prognostic technologies. </p><p>Enhancing the capability of astronauts is also critical for future long-duration deep space missions. Augmented reality technology can guide astronauts in carrying out procedures through various sensory modalities. The augmented reality subtopic within the human research program topic area is very relevant to autonomous systems technologies, and proposers are encouraged to review that subtopic description.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong></p></div><li class=\"first-topic even\"><div class=\"topic\"><div class=\"topicDesc\"></div><div><div class=\"view view-topics view-id-topics view-display-id-subtopics_by_parent\"><div class=\"view-content\"><ul><li class=\"second-topic even\"><p class=\"topic_nid_ehb\" id=\"subtopic_H6_02\"></p><div class=\"subTopTitle clearfix\" id=\"fa_58322\"><p class=\"subtopic\"><span>H6.02</span>Resilient Autonomous Systems </p><ul><li class=\"even\"><a class=\"pdf-icon\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/printpdf/58322\" title=\"pdf\">PDF</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><img alt=\"Subtopic Pointer\" height=\"25\" src=\"./2017_files/pointer_icon.png\" title=\"Subtopic Pointer\" width=\"25\"/></li> <span class=\"even\" style=\"padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 5px; display:inline-block;\"><a class=\"pointerScrollLinkFA\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\" id=\"pointer_58403\">A2.02</a></span><span class=\"even\" style=\"padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 5px; display:inline-block;\"><a class=\"pointerScrollLinkFA\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\" id=\"pointer_58406\">A3.02</a></span></ul></div><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Lead Center:</span> ARC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Participating Center(s):</span> JPL, JSC, MSFC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Technology Area:</span> TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Solicitation Year:</span> 2017</p><div><p class=\"parsed-topic-content\">Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews with limited ground support to manage spacecraft, habitats, and supporting equipment to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) over extended… <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\">Read more&gt;&gt;</a></p><div class=\"whole-topic-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews with limited ground support to manage spacecraft, habitats, and supporting equipment to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) over extended duration missions. In particular, these capabilities are needed to handle faults leading to loss of critical function or unexpected expenditure of consumables. Expanded flight control functionality will be on-board spacecraft to support autonomy with significant automation, autonomy, and decision support software. The increasingly complex interconnectivity of these elements introduces new vulnerabilities within space systems that are sometimes impossible to predict.  In that context, one key property of the respective system is its resilience to unforeseen events.</p>\n",
      "<p>Resilience, as defined by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [1] (NAS), is the ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events.  Within this definition, resilience has two manifestations: engineering and ecological.  Engineering resilience is focused on the ability of a system to absorb and recover from adverse events, while ecological resilience is focused on understanding how close a system is to collapse and reorganization.  The engineering definition brings resilience principles such as robustness, redundancy, and modularity, while the ecological definition supports principles of flexibility, adaptability, and resourcefulness.</p>\n",
      "<p>To enable resilient behavior of a system (such as a vehicle, a habitat, a rover, etc.), \"resilience\" needs to be built-in during the design phase of the system development. To that end, the operational states of a system’s component need to be considered in conjunction with the intended function of the component and its possible failure modes throughout the vehicle's life cycle. Where possible, critical failures are eliminated during the design stage. For failure modes that cannot be eliminated, a mechanism needs to be designed that considers how to have optimal state awareness during operations and to mitigate the fault. Mitigation can be accomplished through fault avoidance, fault masking, or Fault Detection, Assessment, and Recovery (FDIR). FDIR can be realized through hardware or software solutions as well as by intervention of the mission crew or mission control.  The detection / assessment / recovery process will involve identification of:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Small variations in overall system performance that may “coincide and combine” to produce significant risk.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Dependencies within the system that contribute to unforeseen increased risk.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">The strategies and solutions used by crew and controllers to run mission operations safely.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Recovery/fallback mechanisms that help the human/technology system cope with foreseen and unforeseen operational conditions and events.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">The adaptability and flexibility needed to handle unpredictable and uncertain situations.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">The different technical, functional, and procedural features that can interact in a positive way to achieve mission success.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p> Four processes characterize the emergence of resilience as a system property:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Sensing -</em> measuring new information about a system’s operating environment with focus on anomalous data.  These data can alert system evaluators of overlooked possibilities. This process connects components in the physical domain to the information domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Anticipation -</em> imagining multiple future states without reducing improbability to impossibility; this includes incorporating the uncertainty in the future states and including the impact of such uncertainty on system operation. This process connects components in the information domain to the cognitive domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Adaptation -</em> reacting to changing conditions or uncertain states to restore critical functionality under altered conditions or operating environments. This process connects the cognitive domain to the physical domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Learning -</em> observing external conditions and system responses to improve understanding of relationships and possible futures, identifying needs for system improvement where applicable. This process links the physical, information, and cognitive domains together and can incorporate the social or human crew domain depending on the system studied.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Since a vehicle is made up of many components, a system-of-system’s approach needs to be considered in a multi-objective optimization context to account for interdependencies and to realize possible mutually beneficial mitigation solutions for resiliency.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposals to this subtopic should specify innovation and approaches toward two goals:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Development of methods and tools that allow the assessment and optimization of system resilience during its conceptual design stage, while simultaneously maximizing reliability and safety.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Development of measures and metrics that quantify the degree of resilience of a system with respect to a mission ConOps and hazard analysis.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Resilience measures and metrics must be general enough to support broad applications, yet precise enough to measure system-specific qualities. Such metrics are necessary to make resource and operations decisions. Risk metrics tend to assess risks to individual components, ignoring system functionality as the result of interacting components. Resilience measures and metrics also need to account for uncertainty in the planned operation of the system, and focus on integrating statistical methods for uncertainty propagation into resilience-based design. Rather than the static view of systems and networks in risk assessment, resilience adopts a dynamic view. This means resilience metrics must also consider the ability of a system to plan, prepare, and adapt as adverse events occur, rather than focus entirely on threat prevention and mitigation. Finally, resilience depends upon specific qualities that risk assessment cannot quantify, such as system flexibility and interconnectedness.</p>\n",

Novel artificial intelligence capabilities augmenting crews will be required for them to autonomously manage spacecraft operations and interact with Earth mission control under these conditions, including spacecraft and systems health, crew health, maintenance, consumable management, payload management, training, as well as activities such as food production and recycling.</p>\n",
      "<p>Autonomous agents with cognitive architectures would be able to interface directly with the crew as well as with the onboard systems and mission control, thus reducing the cognitive loads on the crew as well as performing many tasks that would otherwise require scheduling crew time. In addition, this cognitive computing capability is necessary in many circumstances to respond to off-nominal events that overload the crew; particularly when the event limits crew activity, such as high-radiation or loss of atmospheric pressure events.</p>\n",
      "<p>In deep space, crews will be required to manage, plan, and execute the mission more autonomously than is currently done on the International Space Station (ISS); which from Low Earth Orbit has instantaneous ground support. NASA expects to migrate significant portions of current operations functionality from Earth flight control to deep-space spacecraft to be performed autonomously. These functionalities will be performed jointly by the crew and cognitive agents supervised by the crew; so the crew is not overburdened. Cognitive agents that can effectively communicate with the crew could perform tasks that would otherwise require crew time by providing assistance, directly operating spacecraft systems, providing training, performing inspections, and providing crew consulting among other tasks.</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to the complexity of such cognitive agents and the need for them to be continually updated, their software architecture is required to be modular. A requirement for the cognitive software architecture is that modules can dynamically be added, removed, and enhanced. Types of modules would likely include a smart executive, state estimator, planner/scheduler, diagnostics and prognostics, goal manager, etc. Other modules that may be supported include a dialog manager, risk manager, image recognition, instructional drawing, crew task manager, etc. This type of modular cognitive architecture is consistent with that proposed by Prof. Marvin Minsky in \"The Society of Mind\", 1988, and subsequent proposals and realizations of cognitive agents. Recent venues for cognitive architectures include: ICCM (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>) and CogArch 2016 @ ASPLOS (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>).</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to NASA's need for fail-safe capabilities, such as continued functionality during high-radiation events, the cognitive architecture will be required to be capable of supporting multiple processes executing on multiple processors, in order to meet the expected computational loads as well as be robust to processor failure. Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are also required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with other modules on the cognitive agent in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. Note that a cognitive agent suitable to provide crew support on spacecraft may also be suitable for a variety of Earth applications, but the converse is not true; thus requiring this NASA investment.</p>\n",
      "<p>The emphasis of proposed efforts are expected to be on analyzing and demonstrating the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions. The software engineering of a cognitive architecture is to be documented and demonstrated by implementing a prototype goal-directed cognitive agent that interacts with simulated spacecraft systems and humans.</p>\n",
      "<p>For Phase I, a preliminary cognitive architecture, preliminary feasibility study, a cognitive agent prototype that supports a human operating a simulate complex system that illustrates a candidate cognitive agent architecture, and a detailed plan to develop a comprehensive cognitive architecture feasibility study are expected. For Phase II, it is expected that the proposed detailed feasibility study plan is executed. In Phase II it is expected that a comprehensive cognitive architecture will be generated, along with a demonstration of an agent prototype that instantiates the architecture. The agent prototype should interact with a spacecraft simulator and humans executing a plausible HEOMD design reference mission beyond cis-lunar (e.g., Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Mission: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf\">https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf</a>). Phase II deliverables are also expected to include a comprehensive feasibility study report, and a detailed plan to develop a fully instantiated robust cognitive architecture suitable for proposing to NASA and other organizations interested in funding a flight capability. A Phase II prototype suitable for a compelling flight experiment or simulation interfacing with the ISS or a spacecraft-relevant robotic system is encouraged.</p>\n",

The autonomous agent subtopic addresses this challenge by soliciting proposals that leverage the growing field of cognitive computing to advance technology for deep-space autonomy. </p><p>The technology challenge for autonomous crewed systems in off-nominal conditions is even more critical. In the majority of Apollo lunar missions, Earth mission control was needed to resolve critical off-nominal situations ranging from unexplained computer alarms on Apollo 11 to the oxygen tank explosion on Apollo 13 that required executing an 87 hour free return abort trajectory around the moon and back to earth. Through creative use of Lunar Module assets, Apollo 13 had sufficient resiliency to keep the three astronauts alive despite loss of the oxygen tank and many of the capabilities of the service module. In contrast to a lunar mission, a free return abort trajectory around mars and back to earth is on the order of two years – requiring a leap in resiliency.  To prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) in deep space missions, spacecraft and habitats will require long-term resiliency to handle failures that lead to loss of critical function or unexpected expenditure of consumables. Long communication delays or accidents that cause loss of communication will require that the initial failure response be handled autonomously. The subtopic on resilient autonomous systems solicits technology for the design and quantification of resiliency in long-duration missions. The subtopic on sustainable habitats solicits technology for long-term system health management that goes beyond short-term diagnosis technology to include advances machine learning and other prognostic technologies. </p><p>Enhancing the capability of astronauts is also critical for future long-duration deep space missions. Augmented reality technology can guide astronauts in carrying out procedures through various sensory modalities. The augmented reality subtopic within the human research program topic area is very relevant to autonomous systems technologies, and proposers are encouraged to review that subtopic description.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong></p></div><li class=\"first-topic even\"><div class=\"topic\"><div class=\"topicDesc\"></div><div><div class=\"view view-topics view-id-topics view-display-id-subtopics_by_parent\"><div class=\"view-content\"><ul><li class=\"second-topic even\"><p class=\"topic_nid_ehb\" id=\"subtopic_H6_02\"></p><div class=\"subTopTitle clearfix\" id=\"fa_58322\"><p class=\"subtopic\"><span>H6.02</span>Resilient Autonomous Systems </p><ul><li class=\"even\"><a class=\"pdf-icon\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/printpdf/58322\" title=\"pdf\">PDF</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><img alt=\"Subtopic Pointer\" height=\"25\" src=\"./2017_files/pointer_icon.png\" title=\"Subtopic Pointer\" width=\"25\"/></li> <span class=\"even\" style=\"padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 5px; display:inline-block;\"><a class=\"pointerScrollLinkFA\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\" id=\"pointer_58403\">A2.02</a></span><span class=\"even\" style=\"padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 5px; display:inline-block;\"><a class=\"pointerScrollLinkFA\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\" id=\"pointer_58406\">A3.02</a></span></ul></div><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Lead Center:</span> ARC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Participating Center(s):</span> JPL, JSC, MSFC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Technology Area:</span> TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Solicitation Year:</span> 2017</p><div><p class=\"parsed-topic-content\">Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews with limited ground support to manage spacecraft, habitats, and supporting equipment to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) over extended… <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\">Read more&gt;&gt;</a></p><div class=\"whole-topic-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Future human spaceflight missions will place crews at large distances and light-time delays from Earth, requiring novel capabilities for crews with limited ground support to manage spacecraft, habitats, and supporting equipment to prevent Loss of Mission (LOM) or Loss of Crew (LOC) over extended duration missions.

      "<p>To enable resilient behavior of a system (such as a vehicle, a habitat, a rover, etc.), \"resilience\" needs to be built-in during the design phase of the system development. To that end, the operational states of a system’s component need to be considered in conjunction with the intended function of the component and its possible failure modes throughout the vehicle's life cycle. Where possible, critical failures are eliminated during the design stage. For failure modes that cannot be eliminated, a mechanism needs to be designed that considers how to have optimal state awareness during operations and to mitigate the fault. Mitigation can be accomplished through fault avoidance, fault masking, or Fault Detection, Assessment, and Recovery (FDIR).

Resilience measures and metrics also need to account for uncertainty in the planned operation of the system, and focus on integrating statistical methods for uncertainty propagation into resilience-based design. Rather than the static view of systems and networks in risk assessment, resilience adopts a dynamic view.

Novel artificial intelligence capabilities augmenting crews will be required for them to autonomously manage spacecraft operations and interact with Earth mission control under these conditions, including spacecraft and systems health, crew health, maintenance, consumable management, payload management, training, as well as activities such as food production and recycling.</p>\n",
      "<p>Autonomous agents with cognitive architectures would be able to interface directly with the crew as well as with the onboard systems and mission control, thus reducing the cognitive loads on the crew as well as performing many tasks that would otherwise require scheduling crew time. In addition, this cognitive computing capability is necessary in many circumstances to respond to off-nominal events that overload the crew; particularly when the event limits crew activity, such as high-radiation or loss of atmospheric pressure events.</p>\n",
      "<p>In deep space, crews will be required to manage, plan, and execute the mission more autonomously than is currently done on the International Space Station (ISS); which from Low Earth Orbit has instantaneous ground support. NASA expects to migrate significant portions of current operations functionality from Earth flight control to deep-space spacecraft to be performed autonomously. These functionalities will be performed jointly by the crew and cognitive agents supervised by the crew; so the crew is not overburdened. Cognitive agents that can effectively communicate with the crew could perform tasks that would otherwise require crew time by providing assistance, directly operating spacecraft systems, providing training, performing inspections, and providing crew consulting among other tasks.</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to the complexity of such cognitive agents and the need for them to be continually updated, their software architecture is required to be modular. A requirement for the cognitive software architecture is that modules can dynamically be added, removed, and enhanced. Types of modules would likely include a smart executive, state estimator, planner/scheduler, diagnostics and prognostics, goal manager, etc. Other modules that may be supported include a dialog manager, risk manager, image recognition, instructional drawing, crew task manager, etc. This type of modular cognitive architecture is consistent with that proposed by Prof. Marvin Minsky in \"The Society of Mind\", 1988, and subsequent proposals and realizations of cognitive agents. Recent venues for cognitive architectures include: ICCM (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>) and CogArch 2016 @ ASPLOS (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>).</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to NASA's need for fail-safe capabilities, such as continued functionality during high-radiation events, the cognitive architecture will be required to be capable of supporting multiple processes executing on multiple processors, in order to meet the expected computational loads as well as be robust to processor failure. Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are also required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with other modules on the cognitive agent in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. Note that a cognitive agent suitable to provide crew support on spacecraft may also be suitable for a variety of Earth applications, but the converse is not true; thus requiring this NASA investment.</p>\n",
      "<p>The emphasis of proposed efforts are expected to be on analyzing and demonstrating the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions. The software engineering of a cognitive architecture is to be documented and demonstrated by implementing a prototype goal-directed cognitive agent that interacts with simulated spacecraft systems and humans.</p>\n",
      "<p>For Phase I, a preliminary cognitive architecture, preliminary feasibility study, a cognitive agent prototype that supports a human operating a simulate complex system that illustrates a candidate cognitive agent architecture, and a detailed plan to develop a comprehensive cognitive architecture feasibility study are expected. For Phase II, it is expected that the proposed detailed feasibility study plan is executed. In Phase II it is expected that a comprehensive cognitive architecture will be generated, along with a demonstration of an agent prototype that instantiates the architecture. The agent prototype should interact with a spacecraft simulator and humans executing a plausible HEOMD design reference mission beyond cis-lunar (e.g., Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Mission: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf\">https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf</a>). Phase II deliverables are also expected to include a comprehensive feasibility study report, and a detailed plan to develop a fully instantiated robust cognitive architecture suitable for proposing to NASA and other organizations interested in funding a flight capability. A Phase II prototype suitable for a compelling flight experiment or simulation interfacing with the ISS or a spacecraft-relevant robotic system is encouraged.</p>\n",

For failure modes that cannot be eliminated, a mechanism needs to be designed that considers how to have optimal state awareness during operations and to mitigate the fault. Mitigation can be accomplished through fault avoidance, fault masking, or Fault Detection, Assessment, and Recovery (FDIR). FDIR can be realized through hardware or software solutions as well as by intervention of the mission crew or mission control.  The detection / assessment / recovery process will involve identification of:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Small variations in overall system performance that may “coincide and combine” to produce significant risk.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Dependencies within the system that contribute to unforeseen increased risk.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">The strategies and solutions used by crew and controllers to run mission operations safely.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Recovery/fallback mechanisms that help the human/technology system cope with foreseen and unforeseen operational conditions and events.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">The adaptability and flexibility needed to handle unpredictable and uncertain situations.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">The different technical, functional, and procedural features that can interact in a positive way to achieve mission success.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p> Four processes characterize the emergence of resilience as a system property:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Sensing -</em> measuring new information about a system’s operating environment with focus on anomalous data.  These data can alert system evaluators of overlooked possibilities. This process connects components in the physical domain to the information domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Anticipation -</em> imagining multiple future states without reducing improbability to impossibility; this includes incorporating the uncertainty in the future states and including the impact of such uncertainty on system operation. This process connects components in the information domain to the cognitive domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Adaptation -</em> reacting to changing conditions or uncertain states to restore critical functionality under altered conditions or operating environments. This process connects the cognitive domain to the physical domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Learning -</em> observing external conditions and system responses to improve understanding of relationships and possible futures, identifying needs for system improvement where applicable. This process links the physical, information, and cognitive domains together and can incorporate the social or human crew domain depending on the system studied.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Since a vehicle is made up of many components, a system-of-system’s approach needs to be considered in a multi-objective optimization context to account for interdependencies and to realize possible mutually beneficial mitigation solutions for resiliency.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposals to this subtopic should specify innovation and approaches toward two goals:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Development of methods and tools that allow the assessment and optimization of system resilience during its conceptual design stage, while simultaneously maximizing reliability and safety.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Development of measures and metrics that quantify the degree of resilience of a system with respect to a mission ConOps and hazard analysis.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Resilience measures and metrics must be general enough to support broad applications, yet precise enough to measure system-specific qualities. Such metrics are necessary to make resource and operations decisions. Risk metrics tend to assess risks to individual components, ignoring system functionality as the result of interacting components. Resilience measures and metrics also need to account for uncertainty in the planned operation of the system, and focus on integrating statistical methods for uncertainty propagation into resilience-based design. Rather than the static view of systems and networks in risk assessment, resilience adopts a dynamic view. This means resilience metrics must also consider the ability of a system to plan, prepare, and adapt as adverse events occur, rather than focus entirely on threat prevention and mitigation. Finally, resilience depends upon specific qualities that risk assessment cannot quantify, such as system flexibility and interconnectedness.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposed solutions are expected to have characteristics including (but not limited to):</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Life-cycle models (i.e., models that assess the resilience of the system over its entire life-cycle) that encapsulate cost/benefit of envisioned design solution and that can be used to inform about the resilience of the system.</li>\n",

      "<li class=\"odd\">Models may need to assess behavior and consequences during degraded (or faulted) state.</li>\n",

Novel artificial intelligence capabilities augmenting crews will be required for them to autonomously manage spacecraft operations and interact with Earth mission control under these conditions, including spacecraft and systems health, crew health, maintenance, consumable management, payload management, training, as well as activities such as food production and recycling.</p>\n",
      "<p>Autonomous agents with cognitive architectures would be able to interface directly with the crew as well as with the onboard systems and mission control, thus reducing the cognitive loads on the crew as well as performing many tasks that would otherwise require scheduling crew time. In addition, this cognitive computing capability is necessary in many circumstances to respond to off-nominal events that overload the crew; particularly when the event limits crew activity, such as high-radiation or loss of atmospheric pressure events.</p>\n",
      "<p>In deep space, crews will be required to manage, plan, and execute the mission more autonomously than is currently done on the International Space Station (ISS); which from Low Earth Orbit has instantaneous ground support. NASA expects to migrate significant portions of current operations functionality from Earth flight control to deep-space spacecraft to be performed autonomously. These functionalities will be performed jointly by the crew and cognitive agents supervised by the crew; so the crew is not overburdened. Cognitive agents that can effectively communicate with the crew could perform tasks that would otherwise require crew time by providing assistance, directly operating spacecraft systems, providing training, performing inspections, and providing crew consulting among other tasks.</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to the complexity of such cognitive agents and the need for them to be continually updated, their software architecture is required to be modular. A requirement for the cognitive software architecture is that modules can dynamically be added, removed, and enhanced. Types of modules would likely include a smart executive, state estimator, planner/scheduler, diagnostics and prognostics, goal manager, etc. Other modules that may be supported include a dialog manager, risk manager, image recognition, instructional drawing, crew task manager, etc. This type of modular cognitive architecture is consistent with that proposed by Prof. Marvin Minsky in \"The Society of Mind\", 1988, and subsequent proposals and realizations of cognitive agents. Recent venues for cognitive architectures include: ICCM (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>) and CogArch 2016 @ ASPLOS (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>).</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to NASA's need for fail-safe capabilities, such as continued functionality during high-radiation events, the cognitive architecture will be required to be capable of supporting multiple processes executing on multiple processors, in order to meet the expected computational loads as well as be robust to processor failure. Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are also required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with other modules on the cognitive agent in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. Note that a cognitive agent suitable to provide crew support on spacecraft may also be suitable for a variety of Earth applications, but the converse is not true; thus requiring this NASA investment.</p>\n",
      "<p>The emphasis of proposed efforts are expected to be on analyzing and demonstrating the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions. The software engineering of a cognitive architecture is to be documented and demonstrated by implementing a prototype goal-directed cognitive agent that interacts with simulated spacecraft systems and humans.</p>\n",
      "<p>For Phase I, a preliminary cognitive architecture, preliminary feasibility study, a cognitive agent prototype that supports a human operating a simulate complex system that illustrates a candidate cognitive agent architecture, and a detailed plan to develop a comprehensive cognitive architecture feasibility study are expected. For Phase II, it is expected that the proposed detailed feasibility study plan is executed. In Phase II it is expected that a comprehensive cognitive architecture will be generated, along with a demonstration of an agent prototype that instantiates the architecture. The agent prototype should interact with a spacecraft simulator and humans executing a plausible HEOMD design reference mission beyond cis-lunar (e.g., Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Mission: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf\">https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf</a>). Phase II deliverables are also expected to include a comprehensive feasibility study report, and a detailed plan to develop a fully instantiated robust cognitive architecture suitable for proposing to NASA and other organizations interested in funding a flight capability. A Phase II prototype suitable for a compelling flight experiment or simulation interfacing with the ISS or a spacecraft-relevant robotic system is encouraged.</p>\n",

In aeronautics, power technologies are needed to supply large-scale electric power and efficiently distribute the power to aircraft propulsors. In the space power domain, mission applications include planetary surface power, large-scale spacecraft prime power, small-scale robotic probe power, and smallsat/cubesat power. Applicable technology options include photovoltaic arrays, radioisotope power systems, nuclear fission, thermal energy conversion, motor/generators, fuel cells, batteries, power management, transmission, distribution and control. An overarching objective is to mature technologies from analytical or experimental proof-of-concept (TRL3) to breadboard demonstration in a relevant environment (TRL5).

Scientific priorities for future planetary science missions are guided by the recommendations of the decadal surveys published by the National Academies. The goal of the decadal surveys is to articulate the priorities of the scientific community, and the surveys are therefore the starting point for NASA’s strategic planning process in science (<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf\">http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf</a>). The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 - 2022, was released in 2011. This report recommended a balanced suite of missions to enable a steady stream of new discoveries and capabilities to address challenges such as sample return missions and outer planet exploration. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future NASA science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics which could potentially benefit from these technology developments include S4.04 Extreme Environments Technology, and S4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology. This subtopic is also directly tied to S3.02 Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions for the development of advanced Power Processing Units and associated components.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Power Electronics and Management</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>NASAs Planetary Science Division is working to implement a balanced portfolio within the available budget and based on the decadal survey that will continue to make exciting scientific discoveries about our solar system. This balanced suite of missions shows the need for low mass/volume power electronics and management systems and components that can operate in extreme environment for future NASA Science Missions. In addition, studying the Sun, the heliosphere, and other planetary environments as an interconnected system is critical for understanding the implications for Earth and humanity as we venture forth through the solar system. To that end, the NASA heliophysics program seeks to perform innovative space research missions to understand:</p>\n",

      "<li class=\"odd\">How solar activity impacts Earth and the solar system.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Fundamental physical processes that are important at Earth and throughout the universe by using space as a laboratory.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Heliophysics also seeks to enable research based on these missions and other sources to understand the connections among the Sun, Earth, and the solar system for science and to assure human safety and security both on Earth and as we explore beyond it. Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems of these future spacecrafts/platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. Radioisotope power systems (RPS), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) and In-Space Electric Propulsion (ISP) are several programs of interest which would directly benefit from advancements in this technology area. These types of programs, including Mars Sample Return using Hall thrusters and power processing units (PPUs), require advancements in components and systems beyond the state-of-the-art. Of importance are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125° C to over 450° C) with a number of thermal cycles. Novel approaches to minimizing the weight of advanced PPUs are also of interest. Advancements are sought for power electronic devices, components, packaging and cabling for programs with power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions to up to 20 kilowatts for large missions.

      "<p>In the future, robotic and human exploration vehicles with increasingly capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be investigating Earth, extraterrestrial moons, planets and asteroids. These vehicles, especially those that visit the surfaces of these myriad destinations, will be tightly constrained in the areas of mass, volume and energy. Our historical method of implementing single function elements such as short and long‐range data and voice radios as well as short‐range radar sensors does not lend itself to mass, volume or energy efficiencies that can support future resource challenged platforms.  </p>\n",
      "<p>One method of enhancing limited resources is to leverage recent advances in the areas of Reconfigurable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technologies as well as RF components, materials and packaging to create advanced multifunction RF platforms. Recent advances in high speed digital electronics, especially where clock speeds exist in the range of several GHz, have blurred the lines between what was traditionally considered “analog” and digital”. Digital signal processing techniques with multi‐GHz clock rates can generate arbitrary user‐defined analog waveforms at RF frequencies as never before. These waveforms, when coupled with advanced RF electronics focused on S‐Band through Ka‐Band frequencies, greatly improve the functionality, performance and utility of space‐based communications devices. This naturally leads to advanced multi‐function RF platforms; platforms that serve more than one user or function and are reconfigurable, on‐demand, by the user for arbitrary applications. The commercial cellphone and wireless industries have been highly successful in developing multifunction RF and wireless platforms that serve a broad range of customers. NASA can leverage these techniques, hardware, algorithms and waveforms developed by industry for use in space applications. However, in order to leverage this increased level of configurability, functionality and performance, NASA needs to further invest in technologies for two key areas: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Advanced waveform development in the digital domain. Specifically: the foundation has been laid through prior NASA investments in the area of generating the infrastructure for software‐based algorithms. These investments led to the development and demonstration of the Space Telecommunication Radio System (STRS) architectural standard for software‐defined radios. Now that the architecture has been instantiated, the next logical step in NASA’s investment portfolio is the development of actual application backend platforms and waveforms that meet this architectural standard. Advanced backend platforms generate (for transmission) or process (from reception) the appropriate waveform at a common Intermediate Frequency (IF) for transmission to, or reception from, an appropriate RF front‐end. In addition, the backend processor is reconfigurable, by the user, for a specific application at a given time (radar vs. short range communications link, etc.). </li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\">The development and demonstration of advanced RF Front‐Ends that cover NASA RF bands of interest; specifically, S‐Band, X‐Band and/or Ka‐Band. These RF front‐ends may support time multiplexed waveforms such as radar or (digitized) half‐duplex voice transmissions as well as frequency duplexed waveforms such as full‐duplex two‐way navigation and data communications. Specifically, these front‐ends are expected to leverage state‐of‐the‐art RF materials (e.g., GaN, SiC, CMOS, etc.), packaging (e.g., MIC, SMT, etc.), device (e.g., MMIC, MEMS, etc.) and component techniques to minimize mass, volume and energy resource usage while supporting multi‐functionality. In implementing these multifunction RF Front‐Ends, we must note that there are three key functions embedded within these front‐ends that require further development:</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>High Efficiency Microwave Power Amplifiers -</em> Compact, lightweight, space qualifiable Ka‐band solid‐state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with integrated electronic power conditioner that can deliver an output power on the order of 10 to 20 Watts (CW) with bandwidth on the order of 1% to 2% and mass less than 1 kg is of interest to NASA. In addition, low‐noise amplifiers (LNAs) with noise figures on the order of a dB or less is of interest to NASA. Since overall efficiency is of paramount importance for low dc power consumption, efficiency enhancement techniques are of interest. Furthermore, SSPAs with good linearity and capable of functioning in tandem with software defined radios (SDRs) for amplifying spectrally efficient digital modulation format signals are also of interest.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Electronically Steered Antennas -</em> Electronically steered antennas, especially at Ka‐Band, are of interest. Applications include large, high‐performance electronicallysteered antennas required for a dedicated communications relay spacecraft with multiple simultaneous connections, advanced multifunction antennas to support science missions that utilize a multifunction antenna to both communicate and conduct science, and small, lightweight antennas for communications only that provide moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering. Antennas that are reconfigurable in frequency, polarization, and radiation pattern that reduce the number of antennas needed to meet the communication requirements of NASA missions are desired.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Ultrawideband (UWB) Antennas and Electronics -</em> Recent developments in commercial chipsets and antennas that implement UWB modulation techniques are of interest to NASA. Advanced signal processing techniques that can leverage investments made in the commercial communications industry for space applications as well as UWB antennas that function in the standard NASA S/X/Ka‐Band frequency ranges are of interest to NASA. This includes modulation and demodulation techniques and algorithms for UWB signal transmission and reception. </li>\n",
      "</ul></ul><p>For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. </p>\n",

      "<p>In the future, robotic and human exploration vehicles with increasingly capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be investigating Earth, extraterrestrial moons, planets and asteroids. These vehicles, especially those that visit the surfaces of these myriad destinations, will be tightly constrained in the areas of mass, volume and energy. Our historical method of implementing single function elements such as short and long‐range data and voice radios as well as short‐range radar sensors does not lend itself to mass, volume or energy efficiencies that can support future resource challenged platforms.  </p>\n",
      "<p>One method of enhancing limited resources is to leverage recent advances in the areas of Reconfigurable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technologies as well as RF components, materials and packaging to create advanced multifunction RF platforms. Recent advances in high speed digital electronics, especially where clock speeds exist in the range of several GHz, have blurred the lines between what was traditionally considered “analog” and digital”. Digital signal processing techniques with multi‐GHz clock rates can generate arbitrary user‐defined analog waveforms at RF frequencies as never before. These waveforms, when coupled with advanced RF electronics focused on S‐Band through Ka‐Band frequencies, greatly improve the functionality, performance and utility of space‐based communications devices. This naturally leads to advanced multi‐function RF platforms; platforms that serve more than one user or function and are reconfigurable, on‐demand, by the user for arbitrary applications. The commercial cellphone and wireless industries have been highly successful in developing multifunction RF and wireless platforms that serve a broad range of customers. NASA can leverage these techniques, hardware, algorithms and waveforms developed by industry for use in space applications. However, in order to leverage this increased level of configurability, functionality and performance, NASA needs to further invest in technologies for two key areas: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Advanced waveform development in the digital domain. Specifically: the foundation has been laid through prior NASA investments in the area of generating the infrastructure for software‐based algorithms. These investments led to the development and demonstration of the Space Telecommunication Radio System (STRS) architectural standard for software‐defined radios. Now that the architecture has been instantiated, the next logical step in NASA’s investment portfolio is the development of actual application backend platforms and waveforms that meet this architectural standard. Advanced backend platforms generate (for transmission) or process (from reception) the appropriate waveform at a common Intermediate Frequency (IF) for transmission to, or reception from, an appropriate RF front‐end. In addition, the backend processor is reconfigurable, by the user, for a specific application at a given time (radar vs. short range communications link, etc.). </li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\">The development and demonstration of advanced RF Front‐Ends that cover NASA RF bands of interest; specifically, S‐Band, X‐Band and/or Ka‐Band. These RF front‐ends may support time multiplexed waveforms such as radar or (digitized) half‐duplex voice transmissions as well as frequency duplexed waveforms such as full‐duplex two‐way navigation and data communications. Specifically, these front‐ends are expected to leverage state‐of‐the‐art RF materials (e.g., GaN, SiC, CMOS, etc.), packaging (e.g., MIC, SMT, etc.), device (e.g., MMIC, MEMS, etc.) and component techniques to minimize mass, volume and energy resource usage while supporting multi‐functionality. In implementing these multifunction RF Front‐Ends, we must note that there are three key functions embedded within these front‐ends that require further development:</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>High Efficiency Microwave Power Amplifiers -</em> Compact, lightweight, space qualifiable Ka‐band solid‐state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with integrated electronic power conditioner that can deliver an output power on the order of 10 to 20 Watts (CW) with bandwidth on the order of 1% to 2% and mass less than 1 kg is of interest to NASA. In addition, low‐noise amplifiers (LNAs) with noise figures on the order of a dB or less is of interest to NASA. Since overall efficiency is of paramount importance for low dc power consumption, efficiency enhancement techniques are of interest. Furthermore, SSPAs with good linearity and capable of functioning in tandem with software defined radios (SDRs) for amplifying spectrally efficient digital modulation format signals are also of interest.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Electronically Steered Antennas -</em> Electronically steered antennas, especially at Ka‐Band, are of interest. Applications include large, high‐performance electronicallysteered antennas required for a dedicated communications relay spacecraft with multiple simultaneous connections, advanced multifunction antennas to support science missions that utilize a multifunction antenna to both communicate and conduct science, and small, lightweight antennas for communications only that provide moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering. Antennas that are reconfigurable in frequency, polarization, and radiation pattern that reduce the number of antennas needed to meet the communication requirements of NASA missions are desired.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Ultrawideband (UWB) Antennas and Electronics -</em> Recent developments in commercial chipsets and antennas that implement UWB modulation techniques are of interest to NASA. Advanced signal processing techniques that can leverage investments made in the commercial communications industry for space applications as well as UWB antennas that function in the standard NASA S/X/Ka‐Band frequency ranges are of interest to NASA. This includes modulation and demodulation techniques and algorithms for UWB signal transmission and reception. </li>\n",
      "</ul></ul><p>For all above technologies, research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards Phase II hardware/software demonstration with delivery of a demonstration unit or software package for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. </p>\n",

      "<p>In the future, robotic and human exploration vehicles with increasingly capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be investigating Earth, extraterrestrial moons, planets and asteroids. These vehicles, especially those that visit the surfaces of these myriad destinations, will be tightly constrained in the areas of mass, volume and energy. Our historical method of implementing single function elements such as short and long‐range data and voice radios as well as short‐range radar sensors does not lend itself to mass, volume or energy efficiencies that can support future resource challenged platforms.  </p>\n",
      "<p>One method of enhancing limited resources is to leverage recent advances in the areas of Reconfigurable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technologies as well as RF components, materials and packaging to create advanced multifunction RF platforms. Recent advances in high speed digital electronics, especially where clock speeds exist in the range of several GHz, have blurred the lines between what was traditionally considered “analog” and digital”. Digital signal processing techniques with multi‐GHz clock rates can generate arbitrary user‐defined analog waveforms at RF frequencies as never before. These waveforms, when coupled with advanced RF electronics focused on S‐Band through Ka‐Band frequencies, greatly improve the functionality, performance and utility of space‐based communications devices. This naturally leads to advanced multi‐function RF platforms; platforms that serve more than one user or function and are reconfigurable, on‐demand, by the user for arbitrary applications. The commercial cellphone and wireless industries have been highly successful in developing multifunction RF and wireless platforms that serve a broad range of customers. NASA can leverage these techniques, hardware, algorithms and waveforms developed by industry for use in space applications. However, in order to leverage this increased level of configurability, functionality and performance, NASA needs to further invest in technologies for two key areas: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Advanced waveform development in the digital domain. Specifically: the foundation has been laid through prior NASA investments in the area of generating the infrastructure for software‐based algorithms. These investments led to the development and demonstration of the Space Telecommunication Radio System (STRS) architectural standard for software‐defined radios. Now that the architecture has been instantiated, the next logical step in NASA’s investment portfolio is the development of actual application backend platforms and waveforms that meet this architectural standard. Advanced backend platforms generate (for transmission) or process (from reception) the appropriate waveform at a common Intermediate Frequency (IF) for transmission to, or reception from, an appropriate RF front‐end. In addition, the backend processor is reconfigurable, by the user, for a specific application at a given time (radar vs. short range communications link, etc.). </li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\">The development and demonstration of advanced RF Front‐Ends that cover NASA RF bands of interest; specifically, S‐Band, X‐Band and/or Ka‐Band. These RF front‐ends may support time multiplexed waveforms such as radar or (digitized) half‐duplex voice transmissions as well as frequency duplexed waveforms such as full‐duplex two‐way navigation and data communications. Specifically, these front‐ends are expected to leverage state‐of‐the‐art RF materials (e.g., GaN, SiC, CMOS, etc.), packaging (e.g., MIC, SMT, etc.), device (e.g., MMIC, MEMS, etc.) and component techniques to minimize mass, volume and energy resource usage while supporting multi‐functionality. In implementing these multifunction RF Front‐Ends, we must note that there are three key functions embedded within these front‐ends that require further development:</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>High Efficiency Microwave Power Amplifiers -</em> Compact, lightweight, space qualifiable Ka‐band solid‐state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with integrated electronic power conditioner that can deliver an output power on the order of 10 to 20 Watts (CW) with bandwidth on the order of 1% to 2% and mass less than 1 kg is of interest to NASA. In addition, low‐noise amplifiers (LNAs) with noise figures on the order of a dB or less is of interest to NASA. Since overall efficiency is of paramount importance for low dc power consumption, efficiency enhancement techniques are of interest.

Robots can perform tasks to assist and off-load work from astronauts. Robots may perform this work before, in support of, or after humans. Ground controllers and astronauts will remotely operate robots using a range of control modes, over multiple spatial ranges (shared-space, line of sight, in orbit, and interplanetary) and with a range of time-delay and communications bandwidth. Technology is needed for robotic systems to improve transport of crew, instruments, and payloads on planetary surfaces, on and around small bodies, and in-space. This includes hazard detection, sensing/perception, active suspension, grappling/anchoring, legged locomotion, robot navigation, end-effectors, propulsion, and user interfaces.</p><p>In the coming decades, robotic systems will continue to change the way space is explored. Robots will be used in all mission phases: as independent explorers operating in environments too distant or hostile for humans, as precursor systems operating before crewed missions, as crew helpers working alongside and supporting humans, and as caretakers of assets left behind. As humans continue to work and live in space, they will increasingly rely on intelligent and versatile robots to perform mundane activities, freeing human and ground control teams to tend to more challenging tasks that call for human cognition and judgment.</p><p>Innovative robot technologies provides a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility, manipulation and human-robot interaction offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Enhancements and potentially new forms of robotic systems can be realized through advances in component technologies, such as actuation and structures (e.g. 3D printing). Mobility provides a critical capability for space exploration. Multiple forms of mobility offer great promise in exploring planetary bodies for science investigations and to support human missions. Manipulation provides a critical capability for positioning crew members and instruments in space and on planetary bodies, it allows for the handling of tools, interfaces, and materials not specifically designed for robots, and it provides a capability for drilling, extracting, handling and processing samples of multiple forms and scales. This increases the range of beneficial tasks robots can perform and allows for improved efficiency of operations across mission scenarios. Manipulation is important for human missions, human precursor missions, and unmanned science missions.  Sampling, sample handling, transport, and distribution to instruments, or instrument placement directly on in-place rock or regolith, is important for robotic missions to locales too distant or dangerous for human exploration.</p><p>Future space missions may rely on co-located and distributed teams of humans and robots that have complementary capabilities. Tasks that are considered \"dull, dirty, or dangerous\" can be transferred to robots, thus relieving human crew members to perform more complex tasks or those requiring real-time modifications due to contingencies. Additionally, due to the limited number of astronauts anticipated to crew planetary exploration missions, as well as their constrained schedules, ground control will need to remotely supervise and assist robots using time-delayed and limited bandwidth communications.  Advanced methods of human-robot interaction over time delay will enable more productive robotic exploration of the more distant reaches of the solar system.  This includes improved visualization of alternative future states of the robot and the terrain, as well as intuitive means of communicating the intent of the human to the robotic system.</p></div><li class=\"first-topic even\"><div class=\"topic\"><div class=\"topicDesc\"></div><div><div class=\"view view-topics view-id-topics view-display-id-subtopics_by_parent\"><div class=\"view-content\"><ul><li class=\"second-topic even\"><p class=\"topic_nid_ehb\" id=\"subtopic_S4_02\"></p><div class=\"subTopTitle clearfix\" id=\"fa_58324\"><p class=\"subtopic\"><span>S4.02</span>Robotic Mobility, Manipulation and Sampling  </p><ul><li class=\"even\"><a class=\"pdf-icon\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/printpdf/58324\" title=\"pdf\">PDF</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><img alt=\"Subtopic Pointer\" height=\"25\" src=\"./2017_files/pointer_icon.png\" title=\"Subtopic Pointer\" width=\"25\"/></li> <span class=\"even\" style=\"padding-left: 5px; padding-top: 5px; display:inline-block;\"><a class=\"pointerScrollLinkFA\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\" id=\"pointer_58359\">S4.06</a></span></ul></div><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Lead Center:</span> JPL</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Participating Center(s):</span> AFRC, ARC, GSFC, JSC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Technology Area:</span> TA4 Robotics, Telerobotics and Autonomous Systems</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Solicitation Year:</span> 2017</p><div><p class=\"parsed-topic-content\">Technologies for robotic mobility, manipulation, and sampling are needed to enable access to sites of interest and acquisition and handling of samples for in-situ analysis or return to Earth from planetary and solar system small bodies including Mars, Venus, comets, asteroids, and planetary moons.… <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\">Read more&gt;&gt;</a></p><div class=\"whole-topic-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>Technologies for robotic mobility, manipulation, and sampling are needed to enable access to sites of interest and acquisition and handling of samples for in-situ analysis or return to Earth from planetary and solar system small bodies including Mars, Venus, comets, asteroids, and planetary moons.  Application to Ocean Worlds is of increasing importance. </p>\n",

      "<p>Adaptive user interfaces, also called intelligent user interfaces, can decrease workload in cases of high attentional loads by presenting the information needed in simpler forms or in different formats. For example, to decrease attentional load, the interface may be modified from text to icons, or the interaction may change from written procedures to voice commands. There is evidence that workload can be reduced if some of the visual information is presented in a different modality or format in high attentional demand situations. Adaptive user interfaces can also provide displays that offer improved and optimized navigation tailored for the current state of the user. Interfaces can be augmented with visual and auditory elements that, again, adapt based on the needs of the user. Thus, the adaptability of the interface is increased in a different dimension. The augmented reality (AR) technology holds the promise to improve crew performance to execute complex procedures in a deep-space human spaceflight missions where communication back to the Earth-based mission control is limited and delayed.</p>\n",
      "<p> In Phase I, a proof-of-concept prototype for an adaptive interface system with augmented reality should be developed and tested for a high workload (e.g., fault management or critical time constraints) scenario. The work should include a literature review on the effects of modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and combination of these) and format (e. g., text, icons, graphs) on workload. A model should be developed based on these principles, as well as an adaptive interface framework for a selected system used for spaceflight. Example scenarios and displays will be provided by NASA for this purpose. Model inputs can be simulated or emulated with hardware. The key technology areas are image registration, new software approaches to integrate augmented reality content from multimedia and multiple modalities, fusion of vision, human tracking, and integration of digital data with live sensor data and models.</p>\n",
      "<p> In Phase II, the prototype adaptive interface system with augmented reality should be designed and validated for the selected high workload use case, as well as a procedure-based task. Display components should dynamically change as a function of the cognitive state and the level of expertise of the operator. The cognitive states (stress, fatigue, and workload) do not need to be measured or prototype; they can be simulated with various levels and treated as input parameters to the prototype. The usability of the prototype should be tested, including trigger events and timing of adaptation.</p>\n",
      "<p> The team should include expertise on augmented reality, interface design, task analysis, and workload.</p>\n",

Vehicle outfitting provides the equipment necessary for the crew to perform mission tasks as well as provide them a comfortable, safe and livable habitable volume. Effective and efficient human-system interfaces and interactions are critical and should be considered as an integral part of this effort and demonstrated. Integrated outfitting is often a distributed hardware set that operates in unison or independently to perform a habitation function. Outfitting includes secondary structure (e.g., floors and walls), crew structures (e.g., crew quarters, radiation storm shelters) as well as the distribution of outfitting items (e.g., crew personal items) and utilities (e.g., avionics, ventilation, lighting) to sustain the crew during a mission. Habitat features and capabilities that allow autonomous monitoring or robotic interaction of items to enable habitat outfitting (e.g., high accuracy localization systems or mounting approaches) prior to crew arrival or after crew departure are also of interest. Concepts that can reuse launch support structure for outfitting are advantageous if it can be done without significant or with no crew interaction. Concepts should be capable of outfitting habitats with diameters of 3-8 meters and lengths of 4-10 meters. Habitat atmospheric pressure may vary from 0-1 atm for launch and 0.5-1 atm during crew usage. The following habitat outfitting specific habitat outfitting areas are requested.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Interior Structures</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Deployable, inflatable, 3D printable from processed launch packaging, reusable secondary structure, and crew structures for outfitting the vehicle habitable volume. Concepts should not be constrained to the ISS rack geometry or attachments. Concepts must be volumetrically and mass efficient, and have a metric less than 25 kg/m<sup>3</sup> for an enclosed volume. Proposed technologies that provide a surface area (e.g., floor) or utility (e.g., plumbing) should define a normalized metric (e.g., kg/ m<sup>2</sup> or kg/m/plumbing run). The selection of non-metallic materials is very important in a spacecraft and will need to meet off-gassing and flammability requirements. Concepts should also have surfaces that either resist the accumulation of dust and dander or are readily cleanable. Structures should include appropriate factors of safety and assumptions should be included in the proposal. Concepts should be capable of sustaining launch loads (which can be in a stowed configuration) of 6g axial and 2g lateral. Crew structures must be capable of withstanding crew kick loads of 125 lbs when fully deployed. Concepts that are also applicable to habitat and life support equipment mounting are desirable.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Autonomous Outfitting Capabilities<br/></strong><br/> Development of features and systems are required that can enable habitat structures, crew equipment, logistics, and trash to be interacted with autonomously with no direct crew involvement. Requested capabilities are rapid identification, localization in 3D space (including pose or orientation), and interaction with items. The intent is to allow robotic interaction with items prior to crew arrival and after crew departure. This may include deployment of interior structures, maintenance of the habitat, or monitoring of the habitat including health and status of items. Systems may also enable or facilitate human-machine interactions by providing greater situational awareness. Development of the robotic elements themselves are excluded from this subtopic. Mechanisms, electro-mechanical, and software applications and algorithms that enable autonomous outfitting and maintenance capability are requested. Dependencies on batteries are highly undesirable. Concepts that provide significant automated vehicle health monitoring should consider submission to the 'Autonomous Systems' topic.</p>\n",

ISS has employed a wide variety of analytical instruments to deal with critical items. These functional needs are required to address identified risks to crew health during Exploration-class missions. The current approach onboard ISS, if any, will serve as the logical starting point to meeting the functional needs. However, the following limitations were found common to all the current approaches on-board ISS for any missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO): reliance on return sample and ground analysis, require too much crew time, constraints on size, mass, and power, lack of portability, and insufficient calibration life. Hence a concerted effort is underway to address these gaps and mature those solutions to ground and flight technology demonstrations. Technologies that show improvements in miniaturization, reliability, life-time, self-calibration, and reduction of expendables are of interest.<strong> </strong></p>\n",

As our exploration missions increase in distance and duration, logistics reduction becomes even more important since they may need to be pre-deployed 2-5 years before a crew arrives. Reducing the initial mass and volume of supplies, or reusing items that have been launched, will be very valuable. Logistics unique to a spacecraft system (i.e., life support and propulsion) are not addressed by this subtopic and are not requested. Three of the largest logistics consumables are the logistical packaging (e.g., cargo bags, foam, retention straps, and cargo support pallets), clothing, and food. Approximately 1,000 cargo bags (0.053 m3 each) may be required for a Mars mission's logistics. Cargo is typically packed in foam, placed in a bag, and strapped to the vehicle or a cargo pallet/structure in the vehicle. Clothing is currently disposed of on the Space Station when it becomes too dirty to wear because there is no way to clean it. Food nutritional content and quality decreases over time and depends on the specific nutrients, food matrix, food packaging, and storage environment. Food may need to be stored up to five years before consumption, and maintaining stable nutrition is a significant challenge. Reductions in food mass, nutrient studies, and nutrient generation are not requested as part of this subtopic. All proposals should consider maintainability as well as dormancy periods without crew.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Vehicle Level Cold/Alternate Atmosphere Food Storage</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Innovative use of materials, insulation, and heat removal systems are requested. Standalone systems as well as innovative approaches integrated into portions of the vehicle structure and thermal loops are acceptable. One method of increasing food nutrient shelf-life is with cold stowage and/or alternate atmospheres (i.e., low oxygen composition). Stored food volumes of 2-8 m<sup>3</sup>, with average packaged food density of 250-500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, may be required at temperature ranges of -80° to +20°C. Oxygen levels &lt;21% and food compartment pressures less than one atmosphere are being studied for their effects. Ability to control the atmosphere and pressure in the cold stowage volume is beneficial but is not required of a submitted technology, nor is the full temperature range listed above required. Systems must be capable of surviving launch loads (6g axial and 2g lateral) when fully loaded and be capable of autonomous operation for up to five years in microgravity. Concepts must be volumetrically efficient, mass efficient, and highly reliable since loss of food quality can result in loss of crew performance. The advantages of proposed concepts compared to the ISS Refrigerator/Freezer Rack (RFR) and terrestrial high efficiency freezers must be described. The ISS RFR, which never flew but achieved temperatures of -22°C and +4°C in freezer and refrigerator modes, had a secondary mass penalty of 1.36 kg for every 1 kg of food due to cabinet, drawers, insulation, cooling system and rack masses. (NASA/TP-2015–218570) The goal is to lower this secondary mass penalty for cold stowage below 0.2 kg per 1 kg of food. For long term storage of food, drawers are not required. At the same time, the refrigeration and insulation systems should be efficient enough to run (at steady state) on less than 0.15 Watts per kg of food frozen at -22°C in a 23°C ambient.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Alternative Launch Packaging of Logistics and Cargo</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Alternatives to the existing ISS use of Cargo Transfer Bags (CTBs), foam, straps, and cargo pallets is required. Cargo densities of 510 kg/m3 (single CTB capability) must be supported during launch acceleration of 6g axial and 2g lateral. Total packaging mass efficiencies of all required materials between the cargo and the vehicle pressure shell structure should be less than 0.3 kg packaging/kg of cargo. Concepts should be capable of scaling between logistics vehicles with diameters of 3-8 meters and lengths of 4-10 meters. Logistics vehicle atmospheric pressure may vary from 0-1 atm for launch and 0.5-1 atm during crew use.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Innovative Crew Clothing Systems to Extend Duration of Wear</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Innovative systems that refresh crew clothing to extend the duration of wear are requested. Crew exercise clothing, for example, is currently discarded into the trash after 2-3 uses because there are no space laundry systems. The goal is to extend the duration of wear by 2-3 times or more for several types of garments. Systems must be capable of sanitizing/refreshing a small set of crew clothing that includes exercise t-shirts, exercise socks, exercise shorts, male and female undergarments, and male and female daily wear, such as crew polo shirts. The system should provide odor control while preserving the appearance, color and brightness, and the physical and mechanical properties of the fabrics, which include cotton, wool and modacrylic. Odor control can be through absorption, adsorption, denaturation, or neutralization of pH and odorous compounds, etc. Innovative use of technologies, such as ultraviolet light, microwaves, vacuum, ozone, steam, CO<sub>2</sub>, charcoal filtration, minimal water, or other technologies will be considered. The crew clothing sanitizing/refreshing system must be capable of operating for a minimum of 3 years in microgravity with minimal consumables, crew time requirement and electrical power. Cleaning/washing agent should be limited to less than 10 grams of consumables per kg of crew clothing for each refresh. No water or extremely low water usage systems are preferred, but if water is used, water usage should be less than 200 grams per kg of clothing washed. No hazardous gases or particles can be released into the crew atmosphere during or after operation. Concepts must be volumetrically efficient, mass efficient, not adversely impact the closed loop life support systems, and be highly reliable. Cleaning/washing systems may be used during outbound transit to Mars, then be dormant for up to 18 months prior to the return trip to Earth. Controlling microbial activity and odor during this dormancy is important to habitat and crew health.</p>\n",

However, this data is irrelevant if humans using the suits aren't effective.  Characterizing human suited performance has continued to be a challenge, partly due to limitations in sensor technology. One concept is to use sensors placed at/on the human body, underneath the pressure garment to obtain knowledge of the human bodies movements.  This data could then be compared against the suit motion.  Various sensors, sensor technologies, and sensor implementations have been attempted over two decades of efforts, but each has had issues.  Previous efforts have used Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR), TouchSense shear sensors, pressure-sensing arrays (Tek scan etc.), piezo-electric sensors, among others but have not met all requirements. Most issues have centered around accuracy when placed on the pliant surface of the skin, and accuracy when placed over curved surfaces of the skin. Accuracy has been sufficient to delineate low, medium or high levels of force but not a reliable quantitative value. This, combined with aberrant readings when the sensor is bent has led to these sensors only providing a rough idea of the interaction between the suit and the skin: while in a controlled environment the sensors are accurate to within 10% or so, the accuracy falls significantly when measuring the skin and being bent or pressed in inconsistent ways; on the order of 50% accuracy or worse. The sensors also are prone to drift (falling out of calibration) quickly during use. Lastly, the sensors, while pliant, are still relatively thick and as such translates to discomfort and loss of tactility. This is typical during all previous testing but most notable when sensors are bent along an axis (or worse, along two axis such as required to follow a complex anatomical contour). As such, the effect on the suit/skin interface that is being measured is changed, which adds an additional complication to interpreting data output from these sensors. Much of the work within JSC has improved the integration, comfort, and calibration of these sensors, but the accuracy performance characteristics when in use have not been sufficient to meet requirements. A new sensor technology is warranted for use in our application.</p>\n",
      "<p>Current critical needs that this technology would enable include the ability to optimize suit design for ergonomics, comfort and fit without the sole reliance on subjective feedback. While subjective feedback is important, developing a method to quantify the amount of force or pressure on a particular anatomical or suit landmark will aid in providing a richer definition of the suit/human interface that can be leveraged to make space suits more comfortable while reducing risk of injury. Taken together, these improvements will enhance EVA performance, reduce overhead and reduce personnel and programmatic risk. This technology implementation would require relatively accurate pressure or force readings in the medium to high range.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the future, alternative space suit architectures such as mechanical counter pressure may be feasible, and a critical ancillary to such an architecture is to verify that necessary physiological pressure requirements are being met to ensure the health and safety of the crew. To this end, the technology should be able to accurately measure mechanical pressure on the human skin in the low pressure (&lt; 10 psi) range.</p>\n",
      "<p>Performance targets vary upon application, but the sensing technology should have the following characteristics:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Measures force and/or mechanical pressure.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Accurate to within 10%.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Resistant to aberrant readings when under moderate bending, shear or torsion.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Either sufficiently pliant, or high enough spatial resolution, to follow anatomical curves on the human skin without discomfort or lack of mobility.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Thin profile (~mm).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Packaged at high spatial resolution (~cm) or sufficiently small to facilitate a custom packaging/substrate solution with a high spatial resolution.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Free of rigid or sharp points that would cause discomfort.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Low power (~5V, ~mA).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Capable of integration to the inside of the pressurized suit surface as well as the human skin (or integrated to conformal garment).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">At this early stage, a simple digital readout capability to evaluate sensor performance.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>For this SBIR opportunity specifically, we are looking for a single sensor technology that targets the above requirements including readout capability. They should either be packaged into a component level prototype (shoulder or arm segment with multiple sensors) or a flexible packaging option (multiple sensors that could be integrated ad-hoc into a component level prototype through placement of said sensors on the skin or comfort garment).</p>\n",
      "<p>The most attention should be paid to maximizing spatial resolution, accuracy and thinness for this prototype. Lastly, as previous work has demonstrated a relatively high failure rate of these sensor types over time, the individual sensor elements should be replaceable and/or spares should be provided.</p>\n",

They enable crews to live and work safely in deep space, and include integrated life support systems, radiation protection, fire safety, and systems to reduce logistics and the need for resupply missions. Innovative health management technologies are needed in order to increase the safety and mission-effectiveness for future space habitats on other planets, asteroids, or lunar surfaces. For example, off-nominal or failure conditions occurring in safety-critical life support systems may need to be addressed quickly by the habitat crew without extensive technical support from Earth due to communication delays. If the crew in the habitat must manage, plan and operate much of the mission themselves, operations support must be migrated from Earth to the habitat. Enabling monitoring, tracking, and management capabilities on-board the habitat and related EVA platforms for a small crew to use will require significant automation and decision support software.</p>\n",
      "<p>This subtopic seeks to broaden the scope of traditional caution and warning systems, which are typically triggered by out-of-bounds sensor values, by including machine learning and data mining techniques. These methods aim to reveal latent, unknown conditions while still retaining and improving the ability to provide highly accurate alerts for known issues. The performance targets for known faults and failures will be based upon false alarm rate, missed detection rate, and detection time (first time prior to the adverse event that the algorithm indicates an impending fault/failure). Methods should explore the trade space for ISHM data and processing needs in order to provide guidance for future habitat sensor and computational resource requirements.</p>\n",

Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 6 or higher are sought.</p>\n",
      "<p>Key features of Sustainability Base that make it relevant to deep space habitat technology are its use of a grey water recycling system and a photo-voltaic array.

Also, information on power consumption (whole building, plug load, other loads metered at the panel/circuit level) can be made available. These remaining systems, while conventionally \"green,\" have no unique feature that can't be exclusively used for terrestrial purposes. However, the fact that all such systems require less power to support human occupancy can be used as a focal point to serve as a testbed for deep space habitats that will need to operate within finite energy budgets.</p>\n",

The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2017 program year, we are restructuring the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, adding new, rotating out, splitting and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. There are two new subtopics for this year.  The first solicits development of in situ instrument technologies and components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life, especially extant of life, in the Ocean Worlds.  The second seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. The microwave technologies subtopic has been split this year into two subtopics one focused on active microwave remote sensing and the second on passive systems such as radiometers and microwave spectrometers.  A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration.

Technologies that can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement.

The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2017 program year, we are restructuring the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, adding new, rotating out, splitting and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. There are two new subtopics for this year.  The first solicits development of in situ instrument technologies and components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life, especially extant of life, in the Ocean Worlds.  The second seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. The microwave technologies subtopic has been split this year into two subtopics one focused on active microwave remote sensing and the second on passive systems such as radiometers and microwave spectrometers.  A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program.

To meet NASA’s requirements for remote sensing from space, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as balloon, small sat, and CubeSat are also considered and encouraged.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposals must show relevance to the development of lidar instruments that can be used for NASA science-focused measurements or to support current technology programs. Meeting science needs leads to four primary instrument types:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Backscatter -</em> Measures beam reflection from aerosols to retrieve the opacity of a gas.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Ranging -</em> Measures the return beam’s time-of-flight to retrieve distance.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Doppler -</em> Measures wavelength changes in the return beam to retrieve relative velocity.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Differential Absorption -</em> Measures attenuation of two different return beams (one centered on a spectral line of interest) to retrieve concentration of a trace gas.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Phase I research should demonstrate technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit. Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform amply defended by the proposer. For the 2017 SBIR Program, NASA is soliciting the component and subsystem technologies described below:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Compact and rugged single-frequency continuous-wave and pulsed lasers operating between 290 nm and 2.05 micrometer wavelengths suitable for Lidar.  Specific wavelengths of interest to match absorption lines or atmospheric transmission: 0.29 – 0.32 micrometer (ozone absorption), 0.45 – 0.049 micrometer (ocean sensing), 0.532 micrometer, 0.815 micrometer (water line), 1.0 micrometer, 1.57 micrometer (CO<sub>2</sub> line), 1.65 micrometer (methane line), and 2.05 micrometer (CO<sub>2</sub> line). Architectures involving new developments in diode laser, quantum cascade laser, and fiber laser technology are especially encouraged. For pulsed lasers two different regimes of repetition rate and pulse energies are desired: from 1 kHz to 10 kHz with pulse energy greater than 1 mJ and from 20 Hz to 100 Hz with pulse energy greater than 100 mJ.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Optical amplifiers for increasing the energy of pulsed lasers in the wavelength range of 0.28 micrometer to 2.05 micrometer.  Specific wavelengths of interest are listed in the above bullet. Also, amplifier and modulator combinations for converting continuous-wave lasers to a pulsed format are encouraged. Amplifier designs must preserve the wavelength stability and spectral purity of the input laser.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Ultra-low noise photoreceiver modules, operating at 1.6 micrometer wavelength, consisting of the detection device, complete Dewar/cooling systems, and associated amplifiers. General requirements are: large single-element active detection diameter (&gt;200 micrometer), high quantum efficiency (&gt;85%), noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth greater than 10 MHz.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Novel, highly efficient approaches for High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) receivers. New approaches for high-efficiency measurement of HSRL aerosol properties at 1064, 532 and/or 355 nm. New or improved approaches are sought that substantially increase detection efficiency over current state of the art.   Ideally, complete receiver subsystems will be proposed that can be evaluated and/or implemented in instrument concept designs.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">New space lidar technologies that use small and high-efficiency diode or fiber lasers to measure range and surface reflectance of asteroids and comets from &gt;100 km altitude during mapping to &lt;1 m during landing and sample return with a size, weight, and power substantially less than 28x28x26 cm<sup>3</sup>, 7.4 kg, and 17 W respectively. Technologies that can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement. The receiver integration time can be continuously adjusted to allow trade-off between the maximum range and measurement rate. The lidar should have multiple beams so that it can measure not only the range but also surface slope and orientation.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Fast laser beam steering mechanism to increase the sampling density, coverage, and signal to noise ratio of pulsed space-based Lidar. The mechanism needs to steer a 1064 nm pulsed laser beam through a set of at least 8 discrete and repeatable angles spanning a range of 10 mrad or greater along one dimension. The scan repetition rate needs to be 8 kHz or higher. Desired specifications include a pointing accuracy of 0.1 mrad or better, a settling time of &lt;15 microseconds to switch between two angles apart, and a usable aperture of 10 mm (can be achieved using a beam expander as long as the outgoing beam meets all requirements).</li>\n",

The rapid development of small, low-cost remote sensing and in situ instruments is essential to achieving this objective. For Earth Science needs, in particular, the subtopics reflect a focus on instrument development for airborne and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. Astrophysics has a critical need for sensitive detector arrays with imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetric capabilities, which can be demonstrated on ground, airborne, balloon, or suborbital rocket instruments. Heliophysics, which focuses on measurements of the sun and its interaction with the Earth and the other planets in the solar system, needs a significant reduction in the size, mass, power, and cost for instruments to fly on smaller spacecraft. Planetary Science has a critical need for miniaturized instruments with in situ sensors that can be deployed on surface landers, rovers, and airborne platforms. For the 2017 program year, we are restructuring the Sensors, Detectors and Instruments Topic, adding new, rotating out, splitting and retiring some of the subtopics. Please read each subtopic of interest carefully. There are two new subtopics for this year.  The first solicits development of in situ instrument technologies and components to advance the maturity of science instruments focused on the detection of evidence of life, especially extant of life, in the Ocean Worlds.  The second seeks instruments and component technologies that will enable unambiguous determination of whether extant life is present in target environments on other solar system bodies. The microwave technologies subtopic has been split this year into two subtopics one focused on active microwave remote sensing and the second on passive systems such as radiometers and microwave spectrometers.  A key objective of this SBIR topic is to develop and demonstrate instrument component and subsystem technologies that reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of SMD observing instruments and to enable new measurements. Proposals are sought for development of components, subsystems and systems that can be used in planned missions or a current technology program. Research should be conducted to demonstrate feasibility during Phase I and show a path towards a Phase II prototype demonstration. The following subtopics are concomitant with these objectives and are organized by technology.</p></div><li class=\"first-topic even\"><div class=\"topic\"><div class=\"topicDesc\"></div><div><div class=\"view view-topics view-id-topics view-display-id-subtopics_by_parent\"><div class=\"view-content\"><ul><li class=\"second-topic even\"><p class=\"topic_nid_ehb\" id=\"subtopic_S1_01\"></p><div class=\"subTopTitle clearfix\" id=\"fa_58347\"><p class=\"subtopic\"><span>S1.01</span>Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies</p><ul><li class=\"even\"><a class=\"pdf-icon\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/printpdf/58347\" title=\"pdf\">PDF</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul> </ul></div><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Lead Center:</span> GSFC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Participating Center(s):</span> JPL, LaRC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Technology Area:</span> TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories &amp; Sensor Systems</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Solicitation Year:</span> 2017</p><div><p class=\"parsed-topic-content\">NASA recognizes the potential of lidar technology in meeting many of its science objectives by providing new capabilities or offering enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and topographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms.

To meet NASA’s requirements for remote sensing from space, advances are needed in state-of-the-art lidar technology with an emphasis on compactness, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, and high performance. Innovative lidar subsystem and component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and surface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this subtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such as balloon, small sat, and CubeSat are also considered and encouraged.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposals must show relevance to the development of lidar instruments that can be used for NASA science-focused measurements or to support current technology programs. Meeting science needs leads to four primary instrument types:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Backscatter -</em> Measures beam reflection from aerosols to retrieve the opacity of a gas.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Ranging -</em> Measures the return beam’s time-of-flight to retrieve distance.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Doppler -</em> Measures wavelength changes in the return beam to retrieve relative velocity.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Differential Absorption -</em> Measures attenuation of two different return beams (one centered on a spectral line of interest) to retrieve concentration of a trace gas.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Phase I research should demonstrate technical feasibility and show a path toward a Phase II prototype unit. Phase II prototypes should be capable of laboratory demonstration and preferably suitable for operation in the field from a ground-based station, an aircraft platform, or any science platform amply defended by the proposer. For the 2017 SBIR Program, NASA is soliciting the component and subsystem technologies described below:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Compact and rugged single-frequency continuous-wave and pulsed lasers operating between 290 nm and 2.05 micrometer wavelengths suitable for Lidar.  Specific wavelengths of interest to match absorption lines or atmospheric transmission: 0.29 – 0.32 micrometer (ozone absorption), 0.45 – 0.049 micrometer (ocean sensing), 0.532 micrometer, 0.815 micrometer (water line), 1.0 micrometer, 1.57 micrometer (CO<sub>2</sub> line), 1.65 micrometer (methane line), and 2.05 micrometer (CO<sub>2</sub> line). Architectures involving new developments in diode laser, quantum cascade laser, and fiber laser technology are especially encouraged. For pulsed lasers two different regimes of repetition rate and pulse energies are desired: from 1 kHz to 10 kHz with pulse energy greater than 1 mJ and from 20 Hz to 100 Hz with pulse energy greater than 100 mJ.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Optical amplifiers for increasing the energy of pulsed lasers in the wavelength range of 0.28 micrometer to 2.05 micrometer.  Specific wavelengths of interest are listed in the above bullet. Also, amplifier and modulator combinations for converting continuous-wave lasers to a pulsed format are encouraged. Amplifier designs must preserve the wavelength stability and spectral purity of the input laser.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Ultra-low noise photoreceiver modules, operating at 1.6 micrometer wavelength, consisting of the detection device, complete Dewar/cooling systems, and associated amplifiers. General requirements are: large single-element active detection diameter (&gt;200 micrometer), high quantum efficiency (&gt;85%), noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth greater than 10 MHz.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Novel, highly efficient approaches for High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) receivers. New approaches for high-efficiency measurement of HSRL aerosol properties at 1064, 532 and/or 355 nm. New or improved approaches are sought that substantially increase detection efficiency over current state of the art.   Ideally, complete receiver subsystems will be proposed that can be evaluated and/or implemented in instrument concept designs.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">New space lidar technologies that use small and high-efficiency diode or fiber lasers to measure range and surface reflectance of asteroids and comets from &gt;100 km altitude during mapping to &lt;1 m during landing and sample return with a size, weight, and power substantially less than 28x28x26 cm<sup>3</sup>, 7.4 kg, and 17 W respectively. Technologies that can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement. The receiver integration time can be continuously adjusted to allow trade-off between the maximum range and measurement rate. The lidar should have multiple beams so that it can measure not only the range but also surface slope and orientation.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Fast laser beam steering mechanism to increase the sampling density, coverage, and signal to noise ratio of pulsed space-based Lidar. The mechanism needs to steer a 1064 nm pulsed laser beam through a set of at least 8 discrete and repeatable angles spanning a range of 10 mrad or greater along one dimension. The scan repetition rate needs to be 8 kHz or higher. Desired specifications include a pointing accuracy of 0.1 mrad or better, a settling time of &lt;15 microseconds to switch between two angles apart, and a usable aperture of 10 mm (can be achieved using a beam expander as long as the outgoing beam meets all requirements).</li>\n",

There are four potential investment areas that NASA is seeking to expand state of the art capabilities for possible use on future programs such as WFirst (<a href=\"http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/</a>), the Europa Jupiter System Science missions (<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/jpl-europa20090218.html\">http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/jpl-europa20090218.html</a>), and flagship missions under consideration for the 2020 Astrophysics  Decadal Survey (<a href=\"http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/PCOS_facility_missions_report_final.pdf\">http://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/PCOS_facility_missions_report_final.pdf</a>). The topic areas are:<strong> </strong></p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Cryocooler Systems and Components </strong> </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Miniaturized/Efficient Cryocooler Systems -</em> Cryocooler systems are sought for application on SmallSat and small low power instrument space platforms.  Present state-of-the-art capabilities provide 0.4 W of cooling at 77 K with approximately 5 W input power, while rejecting heat at 300 K, and having a system mass of 400 grams. Desired performance specifications for cryocoolers include a cooling capability on the order of 0.2 W at a temperature of approximately 30 K. For application on missions to outer planets, cryocoolers are needed with a cooling power of 0.3 W at approximately 35 K, with a heat rejection temperature as low as 150 K.  Desired masses and input powers in both cases are &lt; 400 grams and &lt; 5W respectively. Component level improvements are also desirable.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Low Temperature/High Efficiency Cryocoolers -</em> High efficiency, multi-stage coolers with a low temperature stage capable of reaching 4 to 10 K will be needed for future astrophysics missions.  Current state-of-the-art coolers include a device providing 0.04 W at 4.5 K and another providing 0.09 W at 6 K.  Cryocoolers are sought that provide higher cooling power, for example &gt;0.3 W at 10 K, with high efficiency.  Devices that produce extremely low vibration, particularly at frequencies below a few hundred Hz are of special interest. Component level improvements are also desirable.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Cryogenic/Rad-Hard Accelerometers -</em> Accelerometers that can operate at 150 K, withstand a 0.01 Tesla magnetic field and are radiation hard to mega-rad level doses are needed for cryocooler control and monitoring in missions to outer planets. </li>\n",

Future missions requiring sub-Kelvin coolers will need devices that provide lower operating temperature (&lt;50 mK), higher (preferably 100%) duty cycle, higher heat rejection temperature (preferably &gt; 10K), higher overall system efficiency, and lower mass. Improvements at the component level are needed to achieve these goals. Specific components sought include:</li>\n",

Enceladus is a small icy moon of Saturn, with a radius of only 252km. Cassini data have revealed about a dozen or so jets of fine icy particles emerging from the south polar region of Enceladus. The jets have also been shown to contain organic compounds, and the south-polar region is warmed by heat flow coming from below.</p>\n",
      "<p>As a target for future missions, Enceladus rates high because fresh samples of interest are jetting into space ready for collection.  Indeed, Enceladus has been added to the current call for New Frontiers missions with a focus on habitability and life detection. Particles from Enceladus also form the E-ring around Saturn. The particles in the E-ring are known to contain organics and are thus also an important target for sample collection and analysis. Recent data have indicated a possible plume at Europa that may also be carrying ocean water from that world into space. In addition to plumes, there are other energetic processes that can spray material from the surface of these low-gravity worlds into space where they could also be collected in-flight and analyzed.</p>\n",
      "<p>Collecting samples for a variety of science purposes is required. These include samples that allow for determination of the chemical and physical properties of the source ocean, samples for detailed characterization of the organics present in the gas and particle phases, and samples for analysis for biomarkers indicative of life.

By using and converting local resources into products, less material needs to be launched from Earth. The ability to make life support consumables (oxygen, nitrogen, and water), propellants for ascent and space transportation vehicles, and fuel cell reactants for energy generation and storage have the biggest influence on launch mass, crew and mission risk, and cost in current human exploration mission plans. These products can be used to reduce Earth launch mass or lander mass by not bringing everything from Earth, reduce risks to the crew and/or mission by reducing logistics and providing increased self-sufficiency, and reduce costs by needing less launch vehicles to complete the mission and/or through the reuse of hardware and lander/space transportation vehicles. </p><p>The ISRU Focus Area in this year’s solicitation will concentrate on how to acquire carbon dioxide and water from the Mars atmosphere and soil resources. Because understanding resource characteristics is extremely important to designing larger scale systems to extract and process these resources, the ISRU Focus Area will also emphasize the need for small payloads to perform this task on future lunar missions.</p><p>Since ISRU can be performed wherever resources may exist, ISRU systems will need to operate in a variety of environments and gravities and need to consider a wide variety of potential resource physical and mineral characteristics. ISRU hardware for Mars missions must be desired to operate continuously (day and night) for very long durations (480 days), and to environments specified in the table below.

Understanding the change in mass, power, volume, and complexity as a function of outlet pressure is also an important factor in selection.  Since carbon dioxide is the main gas of interest, techniques and technologies that separate the carbon dioxide from the other gases in the Mars atmosphere before, during, or after compression are considered beneficial in the selection process.  Proposers should consider but not be limited to past work on Mars atmosphere collection, separation, and compression technologies such as carbon dioxide freezing, rapid cycle adsorption pumps, and mechanical compressors.  For concepts that separate carbon dioxide from other Mars gases at Mars atmosphere pressures, proposers must include an active flow device to ensure the remaining gases do not prevent further separation and collection of the carbon dioxide.  Proposals should consider the impact on atmosphere flow to overcome flow resistance due to filtration devices that will need to be placed at the inlet.  Power needed for the proposed technology operation should be differentiated between electrical and thermal, and consideration should be given on how the thermal management system and the Mars environment could minimize the need for electrical-to-thermal energy conversion.

      "<p>Technologies are sought for processing of hydrated and icy Mars soils to extract water.  Soil processing for water extraction needs to consider the range of water content in Mars soils and water extraction rates defined below.  Proposals for soil processing also need to define potential water loss due to valve/enclosure sealing for closed soil reactors or losses due to exposure to the surrounding environment or soil for open soil reactors.  Proposals need to consider what other volatiles and contaminants are released due to soil processing/heating.  Proposed solutions that perform in a non-continuous fashion are acceptable, as long as they achieve the same total production quantities on a daily or weekly basis.  Understanding the change in mass, power, volume, complexity, and contaminant release as a function of water content in the soil, heating temperature, and heating method are important factors in selection.  Power needed for the proposed technology operation should be differentiated between electrical and thermal, and consideration should be given on how the thermal management system and the Mars environment could minimize the need for electrical-to-thermal energy conversion.</p>\n",
      "<p>Based on past and recent human Mars exploration mission studies, to meet ascent propellant production rates with margin, approximately 1.6 kg/hr of water must be collected and cleaned for subsequent processing.  At this time, 3 soil processing units for extraction of water from Mars soils is baselined for human Mars missions.  Multiple excavation and processing units are allowed, but should be justified based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements. Proposers can submit combined excavation and soil processing technologies.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Technologies are sought for the separation, collection, and cleaning of water released from soil processing of hydrated and icy Mars soils.  Separation of contaminants from water can be performed in the vapor phase during release or after collection, but technologies need to be regenerative.  Separate and multiple technologies for collection, separation, and cleanup can be proposed for any one or all of the functions (separation, collection, and cleaning)  All must operate in conjunction with the soil processing reactors for the soil/water production rates, contaminants, and mission durations specified above.  It is encouraged that proposers for soil processing of Mars soils also consider including technologies requested below for water separation, collection, and cleanup since the two technology needs can be highly interconnected.  Multiple units are allowed, but should be justified based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements.  Water will need to be clean enough to be fed to a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis unit.</p>\n",

SMD’s future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points, or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems like: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. High performance space computing technologies are also included in this focus area.  Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs.  For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115°C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending).

      "<p>NASA’s Scientific Balloons provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in power storage and satellite communications bitrates as described below: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Power Storage -</em> Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used.  Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost.  Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications.  Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support.</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Satellite Communications -</em> Improved and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers.  The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight.  Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more.  Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications.  A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink.  TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive.  Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. </li>\n",

A target payload mass of 100 kg shall be used for system sizing purposes. The primary focus should be on the design of the floating platform system and the materials for achieving long duration operation. Concepts may include fixed altitude and/or variable altitude (controlled) floating vehicles. Systems that use alternative lift gases such as ammonia, or phase change fluids should be considered.

The increased sensitivity also opens up new science possibilities such as detection of subsurface geological features, tests of Lorentz invariance, improving the bandwidth sensitivity product for gravity wave detection, and tests of general relativity.

      "</ul><p><strong>Slow-Light Enhanced Spectral Interferometers </strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth.</p>\n",

Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity.  </p>\n",
      "<p>For contamination control efforts, analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at &lt;&lt;40 ppb or &lt;&lt;20 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> on a surface and detection of particles &lt;0.2 microns in size are being sought. In addition, techniques for detection of one or more of the following molecules and detection level are being needed:  </p>\n",

      "</ul><p>For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment. </p>\n",

SMD’s future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points, or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems like: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. High performance space computing technologies are also included in this focus area.  Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs.  For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115°C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending).

Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in power storage and satellite communications bitrates as described below: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Power Storage -</em> Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used.  Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost.  Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications.  Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support.</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Satellite Communications -</em> Improved and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers.  The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight.  Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more.  Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications.  A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink.  TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive.  Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. </li>\n",

      "<p>Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth.</p>\n",

Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity.  </p>\n",

      "</ul><p>For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment. </p>\n",

SMD’s future direction will be moving away from exploratory missions (orbiters and flybys) into more detailed/specific exploration missions that are at or near the surface (landers, rovers, and sample returns) or at more optimal observation points in space. These future destinations will require new vantage points, or would need to integrate or distribute capabilities across multiple assets. Future destinations will also be more challenging to get to, have more extreme environmental conditions and challenges once the spacecraft gets there, and may be a challenge to get a spacecraft or data back from. A major objective of the NASA science spacecraft and platform subsystems development efforts are to enable science measurement capabilities using smaller and lower cost spacecraft to meet multiple mission requirements thus making the best use of our limited resources. To accomplish this objective, NASA is seeking innovations to significantly improve spacecraft and platform subsystem capabilities while reducing the mass and cost that would in turn enable increased scientific return for future NASA missions. A spacecraft bus is made up of many subsystems like: propulsion; thermal control; power and power distribution; attitude control; telemetry command and control; transmitters/antenna; computers/on-board processing/software; and structural elements. High performance space computing technologies are also included in this focus area.  Science platforms of interest could include unmanned aerial vehicles, sounding rockets, or balloons that carry scientific instruments/payloads, to planetary ascent vehicles or Earth return vehicles that bring samples back to Earth for analysis. This topic area addresses the future needs in many of these sub-system areas, as well as their application to specific spacecraft and platform needs.  For planetary missions, planetary protection requirements vary by planetary destination, and additional backward contamination requirements apply to hardware with the potential to return to Earth (e.g., as part of a sample return mission). Technologies intended for use at/around Mars, Europa (Jupiter), and Enceladus (Saturn) must be developed so as to ensure compliance with relevant planetary protection requirements. Constraints could include surface cleaning with alcohol or water, and/or sterilization treatments such as dry heat (approved specification in NPR 8020.12; exposure of hours at 115°C or higher, non-functioning); penetrating radiation (requirements not yet established); or vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide (specification pending).

Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in power storage and satellite communications bitrates as described below: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Power Storage -</em> Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used.  Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost.  Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications.  Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support.</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Satellite Communications -</em> Improved and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers.  The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight.  Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more.  Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications.  A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink.  TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive.  Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. </li>\n",

      "<p>Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth.</p>\n",

Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity.  </p>\n",

      "</ul><p>For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment. </p>\n",

Astrophysics applications require large aperture light-weight highly reflecting mirrors, deployable large structures and innovative metrology, control of unwanted radiation for high-contrast optics, precision formation flying for synthetic aperture telescopes, and cryogenic optics to enable far infrared telescopes. A few of the new astrophysics telescopes and their subsystems will require operation at cryogenic temperatures as cold a 4°K. This topic will consider technologies necessary to enable future telescopes and observatories collecting electromagnetic bands, ranging from UV to millimeter waves, and also include gravity waves. The subtopics will consider all technologies associated with the collection and combination of observable signals. Earth science requires modest apertures in the 2 to 4 meter size category that are cost effective. New technologies in innovative mirror materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide and nanolaminates, innovative structures, including nanotechnology, and wavefront sensing and control are needed to build telescopes for Earth science.</p></div><li class=\"first-topic even\"><div class=\"topic\"><div class=\"topicDesc\"></div><div><div class=\"view view-topics view-id-topics view-display-id-subtopics_by_parent\"><div class=\"view-content\"><ul><li class=\"second-topic even\"><p class=\"topic_nid_ehb\" id=\"subtopic_S2_01\"></p><div class=\"subTopTitle clearfix\" id=\"fa_58362\"><p class=\"subtopic\"><span>S2.01</span>Proximity Glare Suppression for Astronomical Coronagraphy</p><ul><li class=\"even\"><a class=\"pdf-icon\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/printpdf/58362\" title=\"pdf\">PDF</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul> </ul></div><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Lead Center:</span> JPL</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Participating Center(s):</span> ARC, GSFC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Technology Area:</span> TA8 Science Instruments, Observatories &amp; Sensor Systems</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Solicitation Year:</span> 2017</p><div><p class=\"parsed-topic-content\">This subtopic addresses the unique problem of imaging and spectroscopic characterization of faint astrophysical objects that are located within the obscuring glare of much brighter stellar sources.

The current state-of-art of mirror fabrication technology for X-Ray missions is very expensive and time consuming. Additionally, a number of improvements such as 10 arc-second angular resolutions and 1 to 5 m<sup>2</sup> collecting area are needed for this technology.

Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area. This research effort seeks a cost reduction for precision optical components by 5 to 50 times, to less than $1M to $100 K/m<sup>2</sup>. </p>\n",

      "<p>Future NASA missions with alternative low-cost science and small-size payload are constrained by the traditional spherical form of optics. These missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements. Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of un-obscured systems. For the coronagraphic applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect, the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic prescription would need to be in F/# range of F/2 to F/20. In addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable.</p>\n",

For example, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These tools allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties.

These tools allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions.

Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard.

NSCI charges every agency that is a significant user of HEC to make a significant contribution to this goal.

      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Many NASA science applications demand much faster supercomputers.  This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1 (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Data analytics is becoming a bigger part of the supercomputing workload, as computed and measured data expand dramatically, and the need grows to rapidly utilize and understand that data. This area calls for technologies that support convergence of computing systems optimized for modeling &amp; simulation and those optimized for data analytics (e.g., data assimilation, data compression, image analysis, machine learning, visualization, and data mining). In-situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element. This supports NSCI Objective 2 (Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Presently it is difficult to integrate cyberinfrastructure elements (supercomputing system, data stores, distributed teams, instruments, mobile devices, etc.) into an efficient and productive science environment. This area seeks technologies to make elements of the supercomputing ecosystem much more accessible and composable, while maintaining security. Thus supports NSCI Objective 4 (Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development.).</li>\n",

Advancements in information technology will allow many people within and beyond the Agency to more effectively analyze and apply these data and information to create knowledge. For example, modeling and simulation are being used more pervasively throughout NASA, for both engineering and science pursuits, than ever before. These tools allow high fidelity simulations of systems in environments that are difficult or impossible to create on Earth, allow removal of humans from experiments in dangerous situations, provide visualizations of datasets that are extremely large and complicated, and aid in the design of systems and missions. In many of these situations, assimilation of real data into a highly sophisticated physics model is needed. Information technology is also being used to allow better access to science data, more effective and robust tools for analyzing and manipulating data, and better methods for collaboration between scientists or other interested parties. The desired end result is to see that NASA data and science information are used to generate the maximum possible impact to the nation: to advance scientific knowledge and technological capabilities, to inspire and motivate the nation's students and teachers, and to engage and educate the public.</p></div><li class=\"first-topic even\"><div class=\"topic\"><div class=\"topicDesc\"></div><div><div class=\"view view-topics view-id-topics view-display-id-subtopics_by_parent\"><div class=\"view-content\"><ul><li class=\"second-topic even\"><p class=\"topic_nid_ehb\" id=\"subtopic_S5_01\"></p><div class=\"subTopTitle clearfix\" id=\"fa_58376\"><p class=\"subtopic\"><span>S5.01</span>Technologies for Large-Scale Numerical Simulation</p><ul><li class=\"even\"><a class=\"pdf-icon\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/printpdf/58376\" title=\"pdf\">PDF</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul> </ul></div><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Lead Center:</span> ARC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Participating Center(s):</span> GSFC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Technology Area:</span> TA11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology and Processing</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Solicitation Year:</span> 2017</p><div><p class=\"parsed-topic-content\">NASA scientists and engineers are increasingly turning to large-scale numerical simulation on supercomputers to advance understanding of complex Earth and astrophysical systems, and to conduct high-fidelity aerospace engineering analyses.

Successful technology development efforts under this subtopic would be considered for follow-on funding by, and infusion into, NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects - the High End Computing Capability project at Ames and the Scientific Computing project at Goddard. To assure maximum relevance to NASA, funded SBIR contracts under this subtopic should engage in direct interactions with one or both HEC projects, and with key HEC users where appropriate.

      "<p>The three main technology areas of S5.01 are aligned with three objectives of NSCI, the National Strategic Computing Initiative, announced by the White House in July 2015.  The overarching goal of NSCI is to coordinate and accelerate U.S. activities in HEC, including hardware, software, and workforce development, so that the U.S. remains the world leader in HEC technology and application. NSCI charges every agency that is a significant user of HEC to make a significant contribution to this goal. This SBIR subtopic is an important part of NASA's contribution to NSCI.  See <a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"https://www.nitrd.gov/nsci/index.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nitrd.gov/nsci/index.aspx<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a> for more information about NSCI. The three main elements of S5.01 are:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Many NASA science applications demand much faster supercomputers.  This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1 (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Data analytics is becoming a bigger part of the supercomputing workload, as computed and measured data expand dramatically, and the need grows to rapidly utilize and understand that data. This area calls for technologies that support convergence of computing systems optimized for modeling &amp; simulation and those optimized for data analytics (e.g., data assimilation, data compression, image analysis, machine learning, visualization, and data mining). In-situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element. This supports NSCI Objective 2 (Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Presently it is difficult to integrate cyberinfrastructure elements (supercomputing system, data stores, distributed teams, instruments, mobile devices, etc.) into an efficient and productive science environment. This area seeks technologies to make elements of the supercomputing ecosystem much more accessible and composable, while maintaining security. Thus supports NSCI Objective 4 (Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development.).</li>\n",

For robotic payloads larger than the Curiosity rover, larger parachutes will be required. These parachutes need to be tested under the low-density supersonic conditions that match Mars conditions. However understanding the shape history, dynamics, and induced stresses in the parachute structure and broadcloth during the inflation event is needed to ensure that minimum strength margin requirements are met. Further understanding the strength capability of materials under bi-axial and shear stress is essential. The measured material capabilities and stress conditions during inflation will be matched with computer models that will eventually be used as predictive tools in the parachute design process. This SBIR asks for help inventing and utilizing techniques for measuring parachute materials strength capabilities under flight-like loading conditions, and measuring, or inferring, parachute material stress and shape histories found during the inflation process during supersonic parachute inflation testing planned for the 2018 timeframe. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Parachute Materials Testing</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Low mass, high strength parachute fabrics typically are constructed using various woven low mass Dacron or nylon broadcloth (e.g., 1.2 oz./yd2) that are sewn as gores onto Kevlar (or other high strength) webbing that forms a circumferential and radial skeleton primary structure. These materials as well as associated seams and joints are typically strength tested uni-axially. In some cases bi-axial testing has occurred however test fixtures and test facilities that attempt to reproduce the bi-axial and shear-induced stresses and strain associated with the dynamic inflation event do not appear to exist.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposers to this subtopic should suggest ideas and provide the capability for determining the strength of these classes of materials including joints and seams under various bi-axial stress and shear conditions (materials, sample joints and seams will be provided) that are representative of the manner in which the materials are loading during and after inflation.</p>\n",
      "<p>Phase I will be expected to deliver: Measurement detailed design (and design review), Details of material test requirements (to be worked with the lead center in this phase), Implementation and cost plan, and Test facility and calibration plan</p>\n",
      "<p>Phase II will be expected to deliver: Tested and calibrated material test instrumentation and/or facility, Material testing (using samples provided by parachute manufacturers), Test data analysis and results.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>In-situ Instrumentation</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Ultimately, to prove that sufficient strength margin exists in the parachute design we need to determine the stresses or strains of the materials, seams and joints during the supersonic inflation event(s). Computer models that attempt to predict these stresses have not been validated due to an absence of data to ground the simulation results. NASA may execute supersonic, high-altitude inflation testing using various sized DGB parachutes in the 2018 timeframe. Plans include the use of high-speed stereo machine vision cameras that will allow shape history reconstruction of the very fast (&lt; 1 sec) inflation event. Load cells on the riser(s) will provide estimates of the integrated tension during the event. After the test, the parachute and its instrumentation will be recovered and data extracted to gain understanding of the event. Some strain might be observable. What is missing are means to more directly measure or infer the peak stresses in the skeleton and broadcloth during the inflation event. Creative solutions have been proposed in the past, to instrument the parachute directly but these suffer from immaturity, use unproven integration techniques, and/or have questionable accuracies. These past solutions include: stress paint, strain threads that act as peak strain telltales, ultra-low-mass miniature self-contained strain gauges, and passive peak stress detection sewn into the circumferential and radial skeleton webbing (ball-strain yielding). These and other ideas are encouraged.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposers should suggest and have the ability to deliver various types of in-situ or remote instrumentation. Care should be taken to ensure that the incorporation of these devices do not excessively interfere with the operation of the parachute during the mortar-launched parachute inflation.</p>\n",

Deployable decelerator technology will enable delivery of an estimated 20 metric tons of payload required to support human exploration of Mars, and will also enable return of large payloads from Low Earth Orbit as well as launch asset recovery for reduced cost of space access.

Cutting-edge manufacturing technologies offer the ability to dramatically increase performance and reduce the cost of NASA’s programs. This topic is focused on technologies for both the ground-based advancements and in-space manufacturing capabilities required for sustainable, long-duration space missions to destinations such as Mars.</p><p>The terrestrial subtopic areas concentration is on research and development of advanced metallic materials and processes and additive manufacturing technologies for their potential to increase the capability and affordability of engines, vehicles, space systems, instruments and science payloads by offering significant improvements over traditional manufacturing methods. Technologies should facilitate innovative physical manufacturing processes combined with the digital twin modeling and simulation approach that integrates modern design and manufacturing. The in-space manufacturing subtopic areas which focus on the ability to manufacture parts in space rather than launch them from Earth represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the orbital supply chain model for human spaceflight.  In-space manufacturing capabilities will decrease overall launch mass, while increasing crew safety and mission success by providing on-demand manufacturing capability to address known and unknown operational scenarios.  In addition, advances in lighter-weight metals processing (on ground and in-space) will enable the delivery of higher-mass payloads to Mars and beyond.  In order to achieve necessary reliabilities, <em>in-situ</em> process assessment and feedback control is urgently needed. Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility and prototype hardware development during Phase I and show a path toward Phase II hardware and software demonstration and delivering an engineering development unit for NASA testing at the completion of the Phase II that could be turned into a proof-of-concept system for flight demonstration.</p></div><li class=\"first-topic even\"><div class=\"topic\"><div class=\"topicDesc\"></div><div><div class=\"view view-topics view-id-topics view-display-id-subtopics_by_parent\"><div class=\"view-content\"><ul><li class=\"second-topic even\"><p class=\"topic_nid_ehb\" id=\"subtopic_H7_01\"></p><div class=\"subTopTitle clearfix\" id=\"fa_58381\"><p class=\"subtopic\"><span>H7.01</span>In-Space Manufacturing of Electronics and Avionics</p><ul><li class=\"even\"><a class=\"pdf-icon\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/printpdf/58381\" title=\"pdf\">PDF</a></li></ul><ul></ul><ul> </ul></div><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Lead Center:</span> MSFC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Participating Center(s):</span> ARC</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Technology Area:</span> TA12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing</p><p class=\"l-center\"><span>Solicitation Year:</span> 2017</p><div><p class=\"parsed-topic-content\">The purpose of this subtopic is to encourage highly collaborative research and development in the area of In-Space Printable Electronics capabilities geared towards laying the foundation and infrastructure for the next generation of in-space advanced electronics manufacturing technologies.… <a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/58007/detail?data=ch9&amp;s=58000#\">Read more&gt;&gt;</a></p><div class=\"whole-topic-content\" style=\"display: none;\"><p>The purpose of this subtopic is to encourage highly collaborative research and development in the area of In-Space Printable Electronics capabilities geared towards laying the foundation and infrastructure for the next generation of in-space advanced electronics manufacturing technologies. </p>\n",

Many NASA programs baseline AM components in their design, however qualification efforts are complicated by the absence of industry-accepted standards and process controls. The near-term methodology for part quality assurance is to use pre-process and post-process measurements to show that a part design and as-built hardware meet the established requirements to safely and reliably complete the intended mission. This method relies heavily on the ability to non-destructively evaluate parts to identify process escapes resulting in flaws in the AM parts. For parts of complex geometry, which is often the motivation toward AM, post-build inspections can be limited. The long-term goal of part qualification is to \"qualify as you go.\" This concept uses pre-process, in-process, and post-process measurements to demonstrate that a part will perform to requirements. Successful technology demonstration has the potential to reduce scrap rates, and the cost and quantity of post-build NDE required for part qualification.</p>\n",
      "<p>The principal desired outcome of this subtopic is to develop reliable in-process sensing and monitoring technologies for powder bed fusion (PBF) AM processes to aid in the quality of processes used to produce critical components for aerospace applications. Current AM PBF technologies run with limited or no process feedback; therefore, the ability to rely on process control alone is limited and the ability to non-destructively inspect AM parts is critical to the flight rationale for fracture critical components. The ability to augment AM process controls with verifiable feedback regarding process stability and part quality will significantly reduce the risk associated with complex AM parts that cannot be readily inspected with available non-destructive evaluation methods. The objective of the subtopic is to support activities that provide a foundation for practical application of AM sensing and monitoring technology in the aerospace sector, and also enable and stimulate development and innovation within the topic area.

Previous wind tunnel and flight tests demonstrated that this technology is capable of improving vehicle performance by reducing and/or eliminating separation and increasing circulation. When integrated into a transport aircraft, therefore, AFC would result in smaller control surfaces creating less drag and thereby less fuel consumption during flight. Widespread application of the technology on commercial transports, however, requires that AFC actuation systems be energy-efficient, reliant, and robust.  Another challenging aspect of the design of the actuation system involves understanding how and where to integrate the actuator into the vehicle.  Computational tool development is needed, in parallel with actuator development, to enable a more synergistic approach to active flow control system design thus maximizing the potential benefits of an AFC system. </p>\n",
      "<p>This solicitation is for innovative AFC actuator concepts and design tools, applicable to subsonic transports and/or civil aircraft that incorporate vertical lift capability, that take advantage of reduced order models to develop AFC actuators and AFC actuation systems that will aid in advancing AFC technology.   </p>\n",

This study (CFD 2030 Study: A Path to Revolutionary Computational Aerosciences (<a href=\"http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf\">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf</a>), noted many shortcomings in the existing technologies used for conducting high-fidelity simulations, and made specific recommendations for investments necessary to overcome these challenges. Chief among the recommendations was the need for robust higher-order discretization schemes, scalable solvers on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, and adaptive h-p mesh refinement. It was recognized that the generation of meshes suitable for high-accuracy CFD simulations constitutes a principal bottleneck in the simulation workflow process as it requires significant human intervention. Similarly, providing access to the underlying geometry definition, as needed for both high-order simulations and adaptive gridding, is currently not available and is a further roadblock to the ubiquitous use of these technologies.  </p>\n",
      "<p>In the area of geometry definition, a critical need arises from the fact that laser scans of the aircraft surfaces are often used to generate computer aided design (CAD) files. This often leads to surface geometries with unphysical surface waviness as part of the surface fitting process of the laser scan point clouds resulting in poor CFD meshes and, hence, erroneous CFD solutions.  Also, in some cases the CAD geometry is only represented as a tessellated surface while continuous and differentiable surfaces are needed for meshes that would yield accurate solutions and accurate mesh refinement results. A tool that could remove unphysical surface waviness as well as fit tessellated CAD surfaces and output a continuous and watertight spline surface is needed for practical applications. </p>\n",
      "<p>To enable accurate CFD solutions, proposals are solicited in two areas: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">To develop robust means for generating meshes suitable for high-order accurate flow solvers, that can be demonstrated not to compromise the accuracy of the simulations. The three-dimensional unstructured grid tool developed during this research effort should be capable of creating mixed-element meshes. In conjunction with these meshes, geometry information must be easily accessible in a heterogeneous distributed computing environment through well-defined, yet lightweight, Application Programming Interface (API).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">To develop a CAD tool that could generate high-quality, continuously splined surfaces free of unphysical waviness and tessellated faces. </li>\n",
      "</ul><p>The new capability will be demonstrated for configurations of interest to NASA aeronautics (<a href=\"http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm\">http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm</a>) in terms of accuracy, speed and robustness. The proposers must present a convincing case that the proposed approach has the potential of meeting these metrics. </p>\n",
      "<p>Phase I research is expected to develop the technology and demonstrate it on relatively simpler configurations, while Phase II will increase the technology readiness level and include demonstration on more complex configurations. </p>\n",

In addition to design databases, these facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena and support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective of the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA’s ground-based test facilities to revolutionize wind tunnel testing and measurement capabilities and improve utilization and efficiency. For this solicitation, NASA seeks proposals for innovative research and development in the following areas:   </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Wind Tunnel Calibration and Characterization</em> - Capabilities for wind tunnel calibration and characterization are critical for overall enhancement of facilities and will play a critical role in achieving the CFD 2030 Vision [1]. Systems that can provide planar or volumetric measurements of flow quantities such as multi-component velocities, density, and pressure in the airflow upstream and downstream of test articles are required to quantify tunnel inflow and outflow conditions and specify boundary conditions for numerical simulations. NASA envisions using these systems in large test sections (6 feet wide by 6 feet high and larger) and desires the system design to include provisions for combining these data into the regular stream of test data provided by a given facility.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Model Attitude and Position Monitoring</em> - Measurements of wind tunnel model attitude and position (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw angles and spatial coordinates X, Y, Z relative to a defined origin and coordinate system) are critical but are often difficult to make due to packaging constraints and model orientations where gravity based sensors are not applicable. To address some of these limitations, optical and non-optical techniques are needed to provide real-time or near real-time measurements of model attitude at high data rates of 10 Hz and with sufficient accuracy (0.005± 0.0025 degrees in pitch 0.025±0.025 degrees in roll and yaw). The setup and calibration time required for these systems should be 4 hours or less to minimize the impact on tunnel operations.  With regard to position monitoring, many NASA wind tunnel facilities conduct tests at elevated temperatures (above 300°F) or at extremely low temperatures (-250°F). Displacement measurement components used in actuator systems for setting hydraulic cylinder positions and other hardware used in test article support and positioning systems must operate routinely in these extreme environments. Innovative designs for sensors, position measurement and monitoring, and hardware solutions are desired to provide accurate and reliable performance at these extreme conditions.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Technologies for Engine Simulators</em> - The need to assess aerodynamic performance at higher system levels with respect to fuel-burn and noise has created a great demand for propulsion-airframe integration (PAI) testing. Currently, PAI tests can be quite expensive due to issues related to the integration of the system into the model, reliability, complexity of the calibration, and the high pressure air and/or power which must cross the force and moment balance. NASA seeks innovative propulsion simulation systems that are more compact and capable of accurately simulating the flow, speed, and volume of actual propulsion systems, including approach and landing conditions for the assessment of airframe noise. Hydraulic, pneumatic, electric, or hybrid approaches are solicited. </li>\n",
      "</ul><p>NASA also seeks innovative measurement systems and techniques for monitoring and evaluating the performance of these propulsion simulation systems. Example measurement systems and techniques include, but are not limited to, simulators that permit the measurement of loads on individual blades for studies involving boundary layer ingestion, force and moment balances capable of transferring high pressure air and/or power across the balance and operating at high temperatures (up to 350°F), and wireless sensor networks that are self-powered, intelligent (e.g., self-organizing, sensor fusion], and capable of performing preprocessing at or near the sensor to reduce bandwidth requirements. </p>\n",

Future air vehicles, especially autonomous vehicles, must operate with a high degree of awareness of their own well-being, and possess the internal intelligence to provide warning and potentially take action in response to off-nominal states. A vehicle’s capability to independently assure safety may be the only recourse in some situations, and addresses the recurring issue of inappropriate crew response. Further, early warning of impending maintenance conditions reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down-time through improved vehicle availability and throughput. Understanding the vehicle state also has impact on vehicle performance, efficiency, and environmental impact. This Subtopic seeks technologies to enable intelligent vehicle systems with an internal situational awareness and ability to respond to off-nominal conditions for piloted vehicles augmented with autonomous capabilities, as well as increasingly autonomous unmanned air systems (excluding vertical lift vehicles).</p>\n",

Previous wind tunnel and flight tests demonstrated that this technology is capable of improving vehicle performance by reducing and/or eliminating separation and increasing circulation. When integrated into a transport aircraft, therefore, AFC would result in smaller control surfaces creating less drag and thereby less fuel consumption during flight. Widespread application of the technology on commercial transports, however, requires that AFC actuation systems be energy-efficient, reliant, and robust.  Another challenging aspect of the design of the actuation system involves understanding how and where to integrate the actuator into the vehicle.  Computational tool development is needed, in parallel with actuator development, to enable a more synergistic approach to active flow control system design thus maximizing the potential benefits of an AFC system. </p>\n",

This study (CFD 2030 Study: A Path to Revolutionary Computational Aerosciences (<a href=\"http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf\">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf</a>), noted many shortcomings in the existing technologies used for conducting high-fidelity simulations, and made specific recommendations for investments necessary to overcome these challenges. Chief among the recommendations was the need for robust higher-order discretization schemes, scalable solvers on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, and adaptive h-p mesh refinement. It was recognized that the generation of meshes suitable for high-accuracy CFD simulations constitutes a principal bottleneck in the simulation workflow process as it requires significant human intervention. Similarly, providing access to the underlying geometry definition, as needed for both high-order simulations and adaptive gridding, is currently not available and is a further roadblock to the ubiquitous use of these technologies.  </p>\n",
      "<p>In the area of geometry definition, a critical need arises from the fact that laser scans of the aircraft surfaces are often used to generate computer aided design (CAD) files. This often leads to surface geometries with unphysical surface waviness as part of the surface fitting process of the laser scan point clouds resulting in poor CFD meshes and, hence, erroneous CFD solutions.  Also, in some cases the CAD geometry is only represented as a tessellated surface while continuous and differentiable surfaces are needed for meshes that would yield accurate solutions and accurate mesh refinement results. A tool that could remove unphysical surface waviness as well as fit tessellated CAD surfaces and output a continuous and watertight spline surface is needed for practical applications. </p>\n",
      "<p>To enable accurate CFD solutions, proposals are solicited in two areas: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">To develop robust means for generating meshes suitable for high-order accurate flow solvers, that can be demonstrated not to compromise the accuracy of the simulations. The three-dimensional unstructured grid tool developed during this research effort should be capable of creating mixed-element meshes. In conjunction with these meshes, geometry information must be easily accessible in a heterogeneous distributed computing environment through well-defined, yet lightweight, Application Programming Interface (API).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">To develop a CAD tool that could generate high-quality, continuously splined surfaces free of unphysical waviness and tessellated faces. </li>\n",
      "</ul><p>The new capability will be demonstrated for configurations of interest to NASA aeronautics (<a href=\"http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm\">http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm</a>) in terms of accuracy, speed and robustness. The proposers must present a convincing case that the proposed approach has the potential of meeting these metrics. </p>\n",
      "<p>Phase I research is expected to develop the technology and demonstrate it on relatively simpler configurations, while Phase II will increase the technology readiness level and include demonstration on more complex configurations. </p>\n",

Responding to this call will require a proposal describing the intent to conduct novel research in materials and structures that is linked to enhancing aircraft propulsion efficiency.

In addition to design databases, these facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena and support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective of the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA’s ground-based test facilities to revolutionize wind tunnel testing and measurement capabilities and improve utilization and efficiency. For this solicitation, NASA seeks proposals for innovative research and development in the following areas:   </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Wind Tunnel Calibration and Characterization</em> - Capabilities for wind tunnel calibration and characterization are critical for overall enhancement of facilities and will play a critical role in achieving the CFD 2030 Vision [1]. Systems that can provide planar or volumetric measurements of flow quantities such as multi-component velocities, density, and pressure in the airflow upstream and downstream of test articles are required to quantify tunnel inflow and outflow conditions and specify boundary conditions for numerical simulations. NASA envisions using these systems in large test sections (6 feet wide by 6 feet high and larger) and desires the system design to include provisions for combining these data into the regular stream of test data provided by a given facility.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Model Attitude and Position Monitoring</em> - Measurements of wind tunnel model attitude and position (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw angles and spatial coordinates X, Y, Z relative to a defined origin and coordinate system) are critical but are often difficult to make due to packaging constraints and model orientations where gravity based sensors are not applicable. To address some of these limitations, optical and non-optical techniques are needed to provide real-time or near real-time measurements of model attitude at high data rates of 10 Hz and with sufficient accuracy (0.005± 0.0025 degrees in pitch 0.025±0.025 degrees in roll and yaw). The setup and calibration time required for these systems should be 4 hours or less to minimize the impact on tunnel operations.  With regard to position monitoring, many NASA wind tunnel facilities conduct tests at elevated temperatures (above 300°F) or at extremely low temperatures (-250°F). Displacement measurement components used in actuator systems for setting hydraulic cylinder positions and other hardware used in test article support and positioning systems must operate routinely in these extreme environments. Innovative designs for sensors, position measurement and monitoring, and hardware solutions are desired to provide accurate and reliable performance at these extreme conditions.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Technologies for Engine Simulators</em> - The need to assess aerodynamic performance at higher system levels with respect to fuel-burn and noise has created a great demand for propulsion-airframe integration (PAI) testing. Currently, PAI tests can be quite expensive due to issues related to the integration of the system into the model, reliability, complexity of the calibration, and the high pressure air and/or power which must cross the force and moment balance. NASA seeks innovative propulsion simulation systems that are more compact and capable of accurately simulating the flow, speed, and volume of actual propulsion systems, including approach and landing conditions for the assessment of airframe noise. Hydraulic, pneumatic, electric, or hybrid approaches are solicited. </li>\n",
      "</ul><p>NASA also seeks innovative measurement systems and techniques for monitoring and evaluating the performance of these propulsion simulation systems. Example measurement systems and techniques include, but are not limited to, simulators that permit the measurement of loads on individual blades for studies involving boundary layer ingestion, force and moment balances capable of transferring high pressure air and/or power across the balance and operating at high temperatures (up to 350°F), and wireless sensor networks that are self-powered, intelligent (e.g., self-organizing, sensor fusion], and capable of performing preprocessing at or near the sensor to reduce bandwidth requirements. </p>\n",

Future air vehicles, especially autonomous vehicles, must operate with a high degree of awareness of their own well-being, and possess the internal intelligence to provide warning and potentially take action in response to off-nominal states. A vehicle’s capability to independently assure safety may be the only recourse in some situations, and addresses the recurring issue of inappropriate crew response. Further, early warning of impending maintenance conditions reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down-time through improved vehicle availability and throughput. Understanding the vehicle state also has impact on vehicle performance, efficiency, and environmental impact. This Subtopic seeks technologies to enable intelligent vehicle systems with an internal situational awareness and ability to respond to off-nominal conditions for piloted vehicles augmented with autonomous capabilities, as well as increasingly autonomous unmanned air systems (excluding vertical lift vehicles).</p>\n",

Previous wind tunnel and flight tests demonstrated that this technology is capable of improving vehicle performance by reducing and/or eliminating separation and increasing circulation. When integrated into a transport aircraft, therefore, AFC would result in smaller control surfaces creating less drag and thereby less fuel consumption during flight. Widespread application of the technology on commercial transports, however, requires that AFC actuation systems be energy-efficient, reliant, and robust.  Another challenging aspect of the design of the actuation system involves understanding how and where to integrate the actuator into the vehicle.  Computational tool development is needed, in parallel with actuator development, to enable a more synergistic approach to active flow control system design thus maximizing the potential benefits of an AFC system. </p>\n",

This study (CFD 2030 Study: A Path to Revolutionary Computational Aerosciences (<a href=\"http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf\">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140003093.pdf</a>), noted many shortcomings in the existing technologies used for conducting high-fidelity simulations, and made specific recommendations for investments necessary to overcome these challenges. Chief among the recommendations was the need for robust higher-order discretization schemes, scalable solvers on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, and adaptive h-p mesh refinement. It was recognized that the generation of meshes suitable for high-accuracy CFD simulations constitutes a principal bottleneck in the simulation workflow process as it requires significant human intervention. Similarly, providing access to the underlying geometry definition, as needed for both high-order simulations and adaptive gridding, is currently not available and is a further roadblock to the ubiquitous use of these technologies.  </p>\n",
      "<p>In the area of geometry definition, a critical need arises from the fact that laser scans of the aircraft surfaces are often used to generate computer aided design (CAD) files. This often leads to surface geometries with unphysical surface waviness as part of the surface fitting process of the laser scan point clouds resulting in poor CFD meshes and, hence, erroneous CFD solutions.  Also, in some cases the CAD geometry is only represented as a tessellated surface while continuous and differentiable surfaces are needed for meshes that would yield accurate solutions and accurate mesh refinement results. A tool that could remove unphysical surface waviness as well as fit tessellated CAD surfaces and output a continuous and watertight spline surface is needed for practical applications. </p>\n",
      "<p>To enable accurate CFD solutions, proposals are solicited in two areas: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">To develop robust means for generating meshes suitable for high-order accurate flow solvers, that can be demonstrated not to compromise the accuracy of the simulations. The three-dimensional unstructured grid tool developed during this research effort should be capable of creating mixed-element meshes. In conjunction with these meshes, geometry information must be easily accessible in a heterogeneous distributed computing environment through well-defined, yet lightweight, Application Programming Interface (API).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">To develop a CAD tool that could generate high-quality, continuously splined surfaces free of unphysical waviness and tessellated faces. </li>\n",
      "</ul><p>The new capability will be demonstrated for configurations of interest to NASA aeronautics (<a href=\"http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm\">http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm</a>) in terms of accuracy, speed and robustness. The proposers must present a convincing case that the proposed approach has the potential of meeting these metrics. </p>\n",
      "<p>Phase I research is expected to develop the technology and demonstrate it on relatively simpler configurations, while Phase II will increase the technology readiness level and include demonstration on more complex configurations. </p>\n",
      "<p>Note: This subtopic is focused on addressing high fidelity meshes and geometry tools as they relate to large scale, complex fluid dynamics simulations.

In addition to design databases, these facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena and support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective of the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools and technologies that can be applied in NASA’s ground-based test facilities to revolutionize wind tunnel testing and measurement capabilities and improve utilization and efficiency. For this solicitation, NASA seeks proposals for innovative research and development in the following areas:   </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Wind Tunnel Calibration and Characterization</em> - Capabilities for wind tunnel calibration and characterization are critical for overall enhancement of facilities and will play a critical role in achieving the CFD 2030 Vision [1]. Systems that can provide planar or volumetric measurements of flow quantities such as multi-component velocities, density, and pressure in the airflow upstream and downstream of test articles are required to quantify tunnel inflow and outflow conditions and specify boundary conditions for numerical simulations. NASA envisions using these systems in large test sections (6 feet wide by 6 feet high and larger) and desires the system design to include provisions for combining these data into the regular stream of test data provided by a given facility.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Model Attitude and Position Monitoring</em> - Measurements of wind tunnel model attitude and position (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw angles and spatial coordinates X, Y, Z relative to a defined origin and coordinate system) are critical but are often difficult to make due to packaging constraints and model orientations where gravity based sensors are not applicable. To address some of these limitations, optical and non-optical techniques are needed to provide real-time or near real-time measurements of model attitude at high data rates of 10 Hz and with sufficient accuracy (0.005± 0.0025 degrees in pitch 0.025±0.025 degrees in roll and yaw). The setup and calibration time required for these systems should be 4 hours or less to minimize the impact on tunnel operations.  With regard to position monitoring, many NASA wind tunnel facilities conduct tests at elevated temperatures (above 300°F) or at extremely low temperatures (-250°F). Displacement measurement components used in actuator systems for setting hydraulic cylinder positions and other hardware used in test article support and positioning systems must operate routinely in these extreme environments. Innovative designs for sensors, position measurement and monitoring, and hardware solutions are desired to provide accurate and reliable performance at these extreme conditions.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Technologies for Engine Simulators</em> - The need to assess aerodynamic performance at higher system levels with respect to fuel-burn and noise has created a great demand for propulsion-airframe integration (PAI) testing. Currently, PAI tests can be quite expensive due to issues related to the integration of the system into the model, reliability, complexity of the calibration, and the high pressure air and/or power which must cross the force and moment balance. NASA seeks innovative propulsion simulation systems that are more compact and capable of accurately simulating the flow, speed, and volume of actual propulsion systems, including approach and landing conditions for the assessment of airframe noise. Hydraulic, pneumatic, electric, or hybrid approaches are solicited. </li>\n",
      "</ul><p>NASA also seeks innovative measurement systems and techniques for monitoring and evaluating the performance of these propulsion simulation systems. Example measurement systems and techniques include, but are not limited to, simulators that permit the measurement of loads on individual blades for studies involving boundary layer ingestion, force and moment balances capable of transferring high pressure air and/or power across the balance and operating at high temperatures (up to 350°F), and wireless sensor networks that are self-powered, intelligent (e.g., self-organizing, sensor fusion], and capable of performing preprocessing at or near the sensor to reduce bandwidth requirements. </p>\n",

Future air vehicles, especially autonomous vehicles, must operate with a high degree of awareness of their own well-being, and possess the internal intelligence to provide warning and potentially take action in response to off-nominal states. A vehicle’s capability to independently assure safety may be the only recourse in some situations, and addresses the recurring issue of inappropriate crew response. Further, early warning of impending maintenance conditions reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down-time through improved vehicle availability and throughput. Understanding the vehicle state also has impact on vehicle performance, efficiency, and environmental impact. This Subtopic seeks technologies to enable intelligent vehicle systems with an internal situational awareness and ability to respond to off-nominal conditions for piloted vehicles augmented with autonomous capabilities, as well as increasingly autonomous unmanned air systems (excluding vertical lift vehicles).</p>\n",

      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Compact and rugged single-frequency continuous-wave and pulsed lasers operating between 290 nm and 2.05 micrometer wavelengths suitable for Lidar.  Specific wavelengths of interest to match absorption lines or atmospheric transmission: 0.29 – 0.32 micrometer (ozone absorption), 0.45 – 0.049 micrometer (ocean sensing), 0.532 micrometer, 0.815 micrometer (water line), 1.0 micrometer, 1.57 micrometer (CO<sub>2</sub> line), 1.65 micrometer (methane line), and 2.05 micrometer (CO<sub>2</sub> line). Architectures involving new developments in diode laser, quantum cascade laser, and fiber laser technology are especially encouraged. For pulsed lasers two different regimes of repetition rate and pulse energies are desired: from 1 kHz to 10 kHz with pulse energy greater than 1 mJ and from 20 Hz to 100 Hz with pulse energy greater than 100 mJ.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Optical amplifiers for increasing the energy of pulsed lasers in the wavelength range of 0.28 micrometer to 2.05 micrometer.  Specific wavelengths of interest are listed in the above bullet. Also, amplifier and modulator combinations for converting continuous-wave lasers to a pulsed format are encouraged. Amplifier designs must preserve the wavelength stability and spectral purity of the input laser.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Ultra-low noise photoreceiver modules, operating at 1.6 micrometer wavelength, consisting of the detection device, complete Dewar/cooling systems, and associated amplifiers. General requirements are: large single-element active detection diameter (&gt;200 micrometer), high quantum efficiency (&gt;85%), noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth greater than 10 MHz.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Novel, highly efficient approaches for High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) receivers. New approaches for high-efficiency measurement of HSRL aerosol properties at 1064, 532 and/or 355 nm. New or improved approaches are sought that substantially increase detection efficiency over current state of the art.   Ideally, complete receiver subsystems will be proposed that can be evaluated and/or implemented in instrument concept designs.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">New space lidar technologies that use small and high-efficiency diode or fiber lasers to measure range and surface reflectance of asteroids and comets from &gt;100 km altitude during mapping to &lt;1 m during landing and sample return with a size, weight, and power substantially less than 28x28x26 cm<sup>3</sup>, 7.4 kg, and 17 W respectively. Technologies that can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement. The receiver integration time can be continuously adjusted to allow trade-off between the maximum range and measurement rate. The lidar should have multiple beams so that it can measure not only the range but also surface slope and orientation.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Fast laser beam steering mechanism to increase the sampling density, coverage, and signal to noise ratio of pulsed space-based Lidar. The mechanism needs to steer a 1064 nm pulsed laser beam through a set of at least 8 discrete and repeatable angles spanning a range of 10 mrad or greater along one dimension. The scan repetition rate needs to be 8 kHz or higher. Desired specifications include a pointing accuracy of 0.1 mrad or better, a settling time of &lt;15 microseconds to switch between two angles apart, and a usable aperture of 10 mm (can be achieved using a beam expander as long as the outgoing beam meets all requirements).</li>\n",

Atom interferometers exploit the quantum mechanical wave nature of atomic particles and quantum gases for sensitive interferometric measurements. Ground-based laboratory experiments and instruments have already demonstrated beyond the state of the art performances of accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity measurements. The microgravity environment in space provides opportunities for further drastic improvements in sensitivity and precision. Such inertial sensors will have great potential to provide new capabilities for NASA Earth and planetary gravity measurements, for spacecraft inertial navigation and guidance, and for gravitational wave detection and test of properties of gravity in space.  </p>\n",

These missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements. Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of un-obscured systems. For the coronagraphic applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect, the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic prescription would need to be in F/# range of F/2 to F/20. In addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable.</p>\n",

The goal of the decadal surveys is to articulate the priorities of the scientific community, and the surveys are therefore the starting point for NASA’s strategic planning process in science (<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf\">http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf</a>). The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 - 2022, was released in 2011. This report recommended a balanced suite of missions to enable a steady stream of new discoveries and capabilities to address challenges such as sample return missions and outer planet exploration. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future NASA science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics which could potentially benefit from these technology developments include S4.04 Extreme Environments Technology, and S4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology.

      "<p>NASA’s Scientific Balloons provide practical and cost effective platforms for conducting discovery science, development and testing for future space instruments, as well as training opportunities for future scientists and engineers. Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in power storage and satellite communications bitrates as described below: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Power Storage -</em> Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used.  Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost.  Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications.  Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support.</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Satellite Communications -</em> Improved and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers.  The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight.  Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more.  Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications.  A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink.  TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive.  Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. </li>\n",

      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Floating Platforms for Venus -</em> NASA is interested in conducting long term monitoring of the Venus atmosphere and the signatures of seismic and volcanic events from the planetary surface using floating platforms at altitudes of between 50 and 60 km for periods in excess of 100 days. The temperature at 50 km is roughly 75°C; at 60 km it is about -10°C. Sulfuric acid aerosols are known to exist in this altitude range on Venus. A target payload mass of 100 kg shall be used for system sizing purposes. The primary focus should be on the design of the floating platform system and the materials for achieving long duration operation. Concepts may include fixed altitude and/or variable altitude (controlled) floating vehicles. Systems that use alternative lift gases such as ammonia, or phase change fluids should be considered. Traditional lift gases such as helium or hydrogen are acceptable.  Additional areas of interest for developing floating platforms include:</li>\n",

      "<li class=\"odd\">Miniature pumped fluid loop systems with passive valve for radiator heat rejection turndown, and consumes minimal power.</li>\n",
      "</ul><li class=\"odd\">Current capillary heat transfer devices require tedious processes to insert the porous wick into the evaporator and to seal the wick ends for liquid and vapor separation. Advanced technology such as additive manufacturing is needed to simplify the processes and ensure good sealing at both ends of the wick. Additive manufacturing technology can also be used to produce integrated heat exchangers for pumped fluid loops in order to increase heat transfer performance while significantly reducing mass, labor and cost.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Science missions are more dependent on optically sensitive instruments and systems, and effects of thermal distortion on the performance of the system are critical. Current Structural-Thermal-Optical (STOP) analysis has several codes that do some form of integrated analysis, but none that have the capability to analyze any optical system and do a full end-to-end analysis. An improvement of existing code is needed in order to yield software that can integrate with all commonly used programs at NASA for mechanical, structural, thermal and optical analysis. The software should be user-friendly, and allow full STOP analysis for performance predictions based on mechanical design, and structural/thermal material properties.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Thermoelectric converts (TEC) have advantages of small size, long life, solid state design, and no moving parts or fluid operation, and have been used on many science instruments requiring dedicated/localized cooling to meet their stringent requirements. However, they have historically exhibited poor efficiency and have not been able to provide the cold temperatures needed by certain types of space science instruments.  Research and development in areas of advanced materials, processes, and designs are needed in order to improve its efficiency, and extend its low temperature (&lt;90K) capability for space science application.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Water has been used in two-phase thermal control devices such as heat pipes due to its high heat transport capability. However, water has two main drawbacks that limit its use in many aerospace applications. Its expansion upon freezing creates a concern about rupture of the heat pipe and the concern for reliable startup from an initially frozen state. Water-containing azeotropes, which behave as a single-component working fluid, can offer substantial benefits as alternatives to use of pure water for applications where freeze/thaw and frozen startup concerns exist. High-performance water azeotropes which can lower the freezing point of water below -40°C while providing improved reliability for aerospace thermal control systems are needed.  </li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) offer unprecedented functionality and efficiency in small form factors, but their operation is constrained by the current remote cooling paradigm that relies on conduction and heat spreading across multiple interfaces. An embedded approach, which facilitates in-situ cooling of the chip stack is needed. Such a cooling device must also accommodate high heat fluxes and minimize the thermal resistance between the heat source and sink.</li>\n",

A positive dispersion can be used to slow the propagation of optical pulses to extremely small velocities. Similarly, a negative dispersion can lead to conditions where pulses propagate superluminally. These effects have now moved beyond the stage of intellectual curiosity, and have ushered in studies of a set of exciting applications of interest to NASA, ranging from ultraprecise superluminal gyroscopes to spectral interferometers having enhanced resolving power.</p>\n",

Fast light, however, can be used to increase gyro sensitivity without having to increase size, for spacecraft navigation systems which are constrained by weight and volume. The increased sensitivity also opens up new science possibilities such as detection of subsurface geological features, tests of Lorentz invariance, improving the bandwidth sensitivity product for gravity wave detection, and tests of general relativity. This research subtopic seeks:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Prototype fast light gyroscopes, active or passive, that unambiguously demonstrate a scale factor enhancement of at least 10 with the potential for 1000. The minimum or quantum-noise limited angular random walk (ARW) should also decrease.</li>\n",

      "</ul><p><strong>Slow-Light Enhanced Spectral Interferometers </strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth.</p>\n",

Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity.  </p>\n",
      "<p>For contamination control efforts, analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at &lt;&lt;40 ppb or &lt;&lt;20 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> on a surface and detection of particles &lt;0.2 microns in size are being sought.

      "<li class=\"odd\">Naphthalene (1 pg).  </li>\n",
      "</ul><p>For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment. </p>\n",

      "<p>The three main technology areas of S5.01 are aligned with three objectives of NSCI, the National Strategic Computing Initiative, announced by the White House in July 2015.  The overarching goal of NSCI is to coordinate and accelerate U.S. activities in HEC, including hardware, software, and workforce development, so that the U.S. remains the world leader in HEC technology and application. NSCI charges every agency that is a significant user of HEC to make a significant contribution to this goal. This SBIR subtopic is an important part of NASA's contribution to NSCI.  See <a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"https://www.nitrd.gov/nsci/index.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nitrd.gov/nsci/index.aspx<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a> for more information about NSCI. The three main elements of S5.01 are:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Many NASA science applications demand much faster supercomputers.  This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1 (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Data analytics is becoming a bigger part of the supercomputing workload, as computed and measured data expand dramatically, and the need grows to rapidly utilize and understand that data. This area calls for technologies that support convergence of computing systems optimized for modeling &amp; simulation and those optimized for data analytics (e.g., data assimilation, data compression, image analysis, machine learning, visualization, and data mining). In-situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element. This supports NSCI Objective 2 (Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Presently it is difficult to integrate cyberinfrastructure elements (supercomputing system, data stores, distributed teams, instruments, mobile devices, etc.) into an efficient and productive science environment. This area seeks technologies to make elements of the supercomputing ecosystem much more accessible and composable, while maintaining security. Thus supports NSCI Objective 4 (Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development.).</li>\n",

Also, amplifier and modulator combinations for converting continuous-wave lasers to a pulsed format are encouraged. Amplifier designs must preserve the wavelength stability and spectral purity of the input laser.</li>\n",

General requirements are: large single-element active detection diameter (&gt;200 micrometer), high quantum efficiency (&gt;85%), noise equivalent power of the order of 10-14 W/sqrt(Hz), and bandwidth greater than 10 MHz.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Novel, highly efficient approaches for High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) receivers. New approaches for high-efficiency measurement of HSRL aerosol properties at 1064, 532 and/or 355 nm. New or improved approaches are sought that substantially increase detection efficiency over current state of the art.   Ideally, complete receiver subsystems will be proposed that can be evaluated and/or implemented in instrument concept designs.</li>\n",

Technologies that can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement. The receiver integration time can be continuously adjusted to allow trade-off between the maximum range and measurement rate. The lidar should have multiple beams so that it can measure not only the range but also surface slope and orientation.</li>\n",

The mechanism needs to steer a 1064 nm pulsed laser beam through a set of at least 8 discrete and repeatable angles spanning a range of 10 mrad or greater along one dimension. The scan repetition rate needs to be 8 kHz or higher. Desired specifications include a pointing accuracy of 0.1 mrad or better, a settling time of &lt;15 microseconds to switch between two angles apart, and a usable aperture of 10 mm (can be achieved using a beam expander as long as the outgoing beam meets all requirements).</li>\n",

Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area.

These missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements. Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of un-obscured systems. For the coronagraphic applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect, the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic prescription would need to be in F/# range of F/2 to F/20. In addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable.</p>\n",

Scientific priorities for future planetary science missions are guided by the recommendations of the decadal surveys published by the National Academies. The goal of the decadal surveys is to articulate the priorities of the scientific community, and the surveys are therefore the starting point for NASA’s strategic planning process in science (<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf\">http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf</a>). The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 - 2022, was released in 2011. This report recommended a balanced suite of missions to enable a steady stream of new discoveries and capabilities to address challenges such as sample return missions and outer planet exploration. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future NASA science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics which could potentially benefit from these technology developments include S4.04 Extreme Environments Technology, and S4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology. This subtopic is also directly tied to S3.02 Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions for the development of advanced Power Processing Units and associated components.</p>\n",

Balloons can reach altitudes above 36 kilometers, with suspended masses up to 3600 kilograms, and can stay afloat for several weeks. Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in power storage and satellite communications bitrates as described below: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Power Storage -</em> Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used.  Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost.  Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications.  Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support.</li>\n",

Additive manufacturing technology can also be used to produce integrated heat exchangers for pumped fluid loops in order to increase heat transfer performance while significantly reducing mass, labor and cost.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Science missions are more dependent on optically sensitive instruments and systems, and effects of thermal distortion on the performance of the system are critical.

Its expansion upon freezing creates a concern about rupture of the heat pipe and the concern for reliable startup from an initially frozen state. Water-containing azeotropes, which behave as a single-component working fluid, can offer substantial benefits as alternatives to use of pure water for applications where freeze/thaw and frozen startup concerns exist.

      "<p>Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth.</p>\n",

Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity.  </p>\n",
      "<p>For contamination control efforts, analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at &lt;&lt;40 ppb or &lt;&lt;20 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> on a surface and detection of particles &lt;0.2 microns in size are being sought.

      "</ul><p>For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment. </p>\n",

Particles from Enceladus also form the E-ring around Saturn. The particles in the E-ring are known to contain organics and are thus also an important target for sample collection and analysis. Recent data have indicated a possible plume at Europa that may also be carrying ocean water from that world into space.

NSCI charges every agency that is a significant user of HEC to make a significant contribution to this goal.

      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Many NASA science applications demand much faster supercomputers.  This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1 (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Data analytics is becoming a bigger part of the supercomputing workload, as computed and measured data expand dramatically, and the need grows to rapidly utilize and understand that data. This area calls for technologies that support convergence of computing systems optimized for modeling &amp; simulation and those optimized for data analytics (e.g., data assimilation, data compression, image analysis, machine learning, visualization, and data mining). In-situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element. This supports NSCI Objective 2 (Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.).</li>\n",

Thus supports NSCI Objective 4 (Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development.).</li>\n",

The outcomes of this work could include new tools, integration systems, visualization interfaces, among others. Responsive proposals must include a clear identification of a data product(s), modeling tools, or NASA activities that will be used and a clear end user/stakeholder organization to which the tools, systems, etc. are intended to support for applied research and decision support. Proposals should explain how the proposed capabilities will address an end user need or gap area in decision support capabilities. Proposals should also outline existing capabilities, including software, models, and data that are already implemented at NASA or through related NASA activities and how the proposed activities may leverage, complement, or expand from existing infrastructure. Projects must be mindful of NASA security restrictions in the development of new activities.</p>\n",

Also, amplifier and modulator combinations for converting continuous-wave lasers to a pulsed format are encouraged. Amplifier designs must preserve the wavelength stability and spectral purity of the input laser.</li>\n",

New approaches for high-efficiency measurement of HSRL aerosol properties at 1064, 532 and/or 355 nm. New or improved approaches are sought that substantially increase detection efficiency over current state of the art.   Ideally, complete receiver subsystems will be proposed that can be evaluated and/or implemented in instrument concept designs.</li>\n",

Technologies that can significantly extend the receiver dynamic range of the current space lidar without movable attenuators, providing sufficient link margin for the longest range but not saturating during landing. The output power of the laser transmitters should be continuously adjusted according to the spacecraft altitude. The receiver should have single photon sensitivity to achieve a near-quantum limited performance for long distance measurement.

The mechanism needs to steer a 1064 nm pulsed laser beam through a set of at least 8 discrete and repeatable angles spanning a range of 10 mrad or greater along one dimension. The scan repetition rate needs to be 8 kHz or higher. Desired specifications include a pointing accuracy of 0.1 mrad or better, a settling time of &lt;15 microseconds to switch between two angles apart, and a usable aperture of 10 mm (can be achieved using a beam expander as long as the outgoing beam meets all requirements).</li>\n",

Samples are expected to contain water, minerals, salts, etc. that may complicate measurements or interfere with interpretations. Thus, samples are expected to require separation of components as a preparatory step to analysis. Analytes of interest (e.g., organic molecules including biomolecules, cells, and inorganic solutes and particulates) in samples may also be too dilute and could escape detection unless concentration technologies are applied as a preparatory step. These technologies must be capable of operation under space and planetary conditions, including the extreme pressures, temperatures, radiation levels, stress from launch and impact. Technologies should be of low mass, power, volume; capable of radiation-hardening and sterilization; and require low data rates. Technologies that support minimal biological and analytical contamination of the full technological component and sample stream in order to meet planetary protection requirements and maintain sample integrity for mission-science investigations as well as those that support integration of contamination and/or analyte monitoring are solicited.

Currently, X-Ray space mirrors cost $4 million to $6 million per square meter of optical surface area.

These missions could benefit greatly by the freeform optics as they provide non-spherical optics with better aerodynamic characteristics for spacecraft with lightweight components to meet the mission requirements. Currently, the design and utilization of conformal and freeform shapes are costly due to fabrication and metrology of these parts. Even though various techniques are being investigated to create complex optical surfaces, small-size missions highly desire efficient small packages with lower cost that increase the field of view and expand operational temperature range of un-obscured systems. For the coronagraphic applications, freeform optical components allow coronagraphic nulling without shearing and increase the useful science field of view. In this category, freeform optical prescription for surfaces of 0.5 cm to 6 cm diameters with tolerances of 1 to 2 nm rms are needed. In this respect, the freeform refers to either 2nd order conic prescription with higher order surface polished onto it or without underlying conic prescription with no steps in the surface. The optics with underlying conic prescription would need to be in F/# range of F/2 to F/20. In addition to the freeform fabrication, the metrology of freeform optical components is difficult and challenging due to the large departure from planar or spherical shapes accommodated by conventional interferometric testing. New methods such as multibeam low-coherence optical probe and slope sensitive optical probe are highly desirable.</p>\n",

Scientific priorities for future planetary science missions are guided by the recommendations of the decadal surveys published by the National Academies. The goal of the decadal surveys is to articulate the priorities of the scientific community, and the surveys are therefore the starting point for NASA’s strategic planning process in science (<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf\">http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/04/18/FY2014_NASA_StrategicPlan_508c.pdf</a>). The most recent planetary science decadal survey, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 - 2022, was released in 2011. This report recommended a balanced suite of missions to enable a steady stream of new discoveries and capabilities to address challenges such as sample return missions and outer planet exploration. Under this subtopic, proposals are solicited to develop energy storage and power electronics to enable or enhance the capabilities of future NASA science missions. The unique requirements for the power systems for these missions can vary greatly, with advancements in components needed above the current State of the Art (SOA) for high energy density, high power density, long life, high reliability, low mass/volume, and wide temperature operation. Other subtopics which could potentially benefit from these technology developments include S4.04 Extreme Environments Technology, and S4.01 Planetary Entry, Descent and Landing Technology. This subtopic is also directly tied to S3.02 Propulsion Systems for Robotic Science Missions for the development of advanced Power Processing Units and associated components.</p>\n",

      "<p>NASAs Planetary Science Division is working to implement a balanced portfolio within the available budget and based on the decadal survey that will continue to make exciting scientific discoveries about our solar system. This balanced suite of missions shows the need for low mass/volume power electronics and management systems and components that can operate in extreme environment for future NASA Science Missions. In addition, studying the Sun, the heliosphere, and other planetary environments as an interconnected system is critical for understanding the implications for Earth and humanity as we venture forth through the solar system.

      "</ul><p>Heliophysics also seeks to enable research based on these missions and other sources to understand the connections among the Sun, Earth, and the solar system for science and to assure human safety and security both on Earth and as we explore beyond it. Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems of these future spacecrafts/platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. Radioisotope power systems (RPS), Advanced Modular Power Systems (AMPS) and In-Space Electric Propulsion (ISP) are several programs of interest which would directly benefit from advancements in this technology area. These types of programs, including Mars Sample Return using Hall thrusters and power processing units (PPUs), require advancements in components and systems beyond the state-of-the-art. Of importance are expected improvements in energy density, speed, efficiency, or wide-temperature operation (-125° C to over 450° C) with a number of thermal cycles. Novel approaches to minimizing the weight of advanced PPUs are also of interest. Advancements are sought for power electronic devices, components, packaging and cabling for programs with power ranges of a few watts for minimum missions to up to 20 kilowatts for large missions. In addition to electrical component development, RPS has a need for intelligent, fault-tolerant Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) technologies to efficiently manage the system power for these deep space missions.</p>\n",

The Outer Planet Assessment Group and the 2011 PSD Relevant Technologies Document have specifically called out high energy density storage systems as a need for the Titan/Enceladus Flagship and planetary exploration missions. In addition, high energy-density rechargeable electrochemical battery systems that offer greater than 50,000 charge/discharge cycles (10 year operating life) for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft, 20 year life for geosynchronous (GEO) spacecraft, are desired. Advancements to battery energy storage capabilities that address one or more of the above requirements for the stated missions combined with very high specific energy and energy density (&gt;200 Wh/kg for secondary battery systems), along with radiation tolerance are of interest.</p>\n",

Currently, the Balloon Program is on the verge of introducing an advanced balloon system that will enable 100 day missions at mid-latitudes and thus resemble the performance of a small spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. In support of this development, NASA is seeking innovative technologies in power storage and satellite communications bitrates as described below: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Power Storage -</em> Improved and innovative devices to store electrical energy onboard balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights can experience 12 hours or more of darkness, and excess electrical power generated during the day from solar panels needs to be stored and used.  Improvements are needed over the current state of the art in power density, energy density, overall size, overall mass and/or cost.  Typical parameters for balloon are 28 VDC and 100 to 1000 watts power consumption. Rechargeable batteries are presently used for balloon payload applications.  Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries with energy densities of 60 watt-hours per kilogram are the current state of the art. Higher power storage energy densities, and power generation capabilities of up to 2000 watts are needed for future support.</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Satellite Communications -</em> Improved and innovative downlink bitrates using satellite relay communications from balloon payloads are needed.  Long duration balloon flights currently utilize satellite communication systems to relay science and operations data from the balloon to ground based control centers.  The current maximum downlink bit rate is 150 kilobits per second operating continuously during the balloon flight.  Future requirements are for bit rates of 1 megabit per second or more.  Improvements in bit rate performance, reduction in size and mass of existing systems, or reductions in cost of high bit rate systems are needed. TDRSS and Iridium satellite communications are currently used for balloon payload applications.  A commercial S-band TDRSS transceiver and mechanically steered 18 dBi gain antenna provide 150 kbps continuous downlink.  TDRSS K-band transceivers are available but are currently cost prohibitive.  Open port Iridium service is under development, but the operational cost is prohibitive. </li>\n",

      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Advanced thermal devices capable of maintaining components within their specified temperature ranges are needed for future advanced spacecraft. Some examples are:</li>\n",
      "<ul class=\"even\"><li class=\"even\">Phase change systems with high thermal capacity and minimal structural mass.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">High performance, low cost insulation systems for diverse environments.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">High flux heat acquisition and transport devices.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Thermal coatings with low absorptance, high emittance, and good electrical conductivity.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Radiator heat rejection turndown devices (e.g., mini heat switches, mini louvers).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Miniature pumped fluid loop systems with passive valve for radiator heat rejection turndown, and consumes minimal power.</li>\n",
      "</ul><li class=\"odd\">Current capillary heat transfer devices require tedious processes to insert the porous wick into the evaporator and to seal the wick ends for liquid and vapor separation. Advanced technology such as additive manufacturing is needed to simplify the processes and ensure good sealing at both ends of the wick. Additive manufacturing technology can also be used to produce integrated heat exchangers for pumped fluid loops in order to increase heat transfer performance while significantly reducing mass, labor and cost.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Science missions are more dependent on optically sensitive instruments and systems, and effects of thermal distortion on the performance of the system are critical. Current Structural-Thermal-Optical (STOP) analysis has several codes that do some form of integrated analysis, but none that have the capability to analyze any optical system and do a full end-to-end analysis. An improvement of existing code is needed in order to yield software that can integrate with all commonly used programs at NASA for mechanical, structural, thermal and optical analysis. The software should be user-friendly, and allow full STOP analysis for performance predictions based on mechanical design, and structural/thermal material properties.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Thermoelectric converts (TEC) have advantages of small size, long life, solid state design, and no moving parts or fluid operation, and have been used on many science instruments requiring dedicated/localized cooling to meet their stringent requirements. However, they have historically exhibited poor efficiency and have not been able to provide the cold temperatures needed by certain types of space science instruments.  Research and development in areas of advanced materials, processes, and designs are needed in order to improve its efficiency, and extend its low temperature (&lt;90K) capability for space science application.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Water has been used in two-phase thermal control devices such as heat pipes due to its high heat transport capability. However, water has two main drawbacks that limit its use in many aerospace applications. Its expansion upon freezing creates a concern about rupture of the heat pipe and the concern for reliable startup from an initially frozen state. Water-containing azeotropes, which behave as a single-component working fluid, can offer substantial benefits as alternatives to use of pure water for applications where freeze/thaw and frozen startup concerns exist. High-performance water azeotropes which can lower the freezing point of water below -40°C while providing improved reliability for aerospace thermal control systems are needed.  </li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) offer unprecedented functionality and efficiency in small form factors, but their operation is constrained by the current remote cooling paradigm that relies on conduction and heat spreading across multiple interfaces. An embedded approach, which facilitates in-situ cooling of the chip stack is needed. Such a cooling device must also accommodate high heat fluxes and minimize the thermal resistance between the heat source and sink.</li>\n",

A positive dispersion can be used to slow the propagation of optical pulses to extremely small velocities. Similarly, a negative dispersion can lead to conditions where pulses propagate superluminally. These effects have now moved beyond the stage of intellectual curiosity, and have ushered in studies of a set of exciting applications of interest to NASA, ranging from ultraprecise superluminal gyroscopes to spectral interferometers having enhanced resolving power.</p>\n",

      "<p>In conventional ring laser gyroscopes, sensitivity increases with cavity size. Fast light, however, can be used to increase gyro sensitivity without having to increase size, for spacecraft navigation systems which are constrained by weight and volume. The increased sensitivity also opens up new science possibilities such as detection of subsurface geological features, tests of Lorentz invariance, improving the bandwidth sensitivity product for gravity wave detection, and tests of general relativity. This research subtopic seeks:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Prototype fast light gyroscopes, active or passive, that unambiguously demonstrate a scale factor enhancement of at least 10 with the potential for 1000. The minimum or quantum-noise limited angular random walk (ARW) should also decrease.</li>\n",

      "</ul><p><strong>Slow-Light Enhanced Spectral Interferometers </strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Slow light has the potential to increase the resolving power of spectral interferometers such as Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) for astrophysical applications without increasing their size. Mariner, Voyager, and Cassini all used FTS instruments for applications such as mapping atmospheres and examining ring compositions. The niche for FTS is usually thought to be for large wavelength (IR and beyond), wide-field, moderate spectral resolution instruments. Slow light, however, could help boost FTS spectral resolution making FTS instruments more competitive with grating-based instruments, and opening up application areas not previously thought to be accessible to FTS instruments, such as exoplanet detection. A slow-light FTS could also be hyper-spectral, providing imaging capability. FTS instruments have been employed for remote sensing on NASA Earth Science missions, such as the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiments, and have long been considered for geostationary imaging of atmospheric greenhouse gases. This research subtopic seeks research and development of slow-light-enhanced spectral interferometers that are not restricted by material resonances and can operate at any wavelength. An inherent advantage of FTS systems are their wide bandwidth. It will therefore of importance to develop slow light FTS systems that can maintain a large operating bandwidth.</p>\n",

Survivability in extreme high-temperatures and high-pressures is also required for deep atmospheric probes to planets. Proposals are sought for technologies that are suitable for remote sensing applications at cryogenic temperatures, and in-situ atmospheric and surface explorations in the high-temperature high-pressure environment at the Venusians surface (485°C, 93 atmospheres), or in low-temperature environments such as Titan (-180°C), Europa (-220°C), Ganymede (-200°C), Mars, the Moon, asteroids, comets and other small bodies. Also Europa-Jupiter missions may have a mission life of 10 years and the radiation environment is estimated at 2.9 Mega-rad total ionizing dose (TID) behind 0.1 inch thick aluminum. Proposals are sought for technologies that enable NASA's long duration missions to extreme wide-temperature and cosmic radiation environments. High reliability, ease of maintenance, low volume, low mass, and low out-gassing characteristics are highly desirable.

Planetary Protection is concerned with both forward and backward contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another body. Backward contamination is the transfer of material posing a biological threat back to Earth's biosphere. NASA is seeking innovative technologies or applications of technologies to facilitate meeting portions of forward and backward contamination Planetary Protection requirements as well as analytical technologies that can ensure hardware and instrumentation can meet organic contamination requirements in an effort to preserve sample science integrity.  </p>\n",
      "<p>For contamination control efforts, analytical technologies and techniques for quantifying submicron particle and organic contamination for validating surface cleaning methods are needed. In particular, capabilities for measuring Total Organic Carbon (TOC) at &lt;&lt;40 ppb or &lt;&lt;20 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> on a surface and detection of particles &lt;0.2 microns in size are being sought. In addition, techniques for detection of one or more of the following molecules and detection level are being needed:  </p>\n",

      "</ul><p>For many missions, Planetary Protection requirements are often implemented in part by processing hardware or potentially entire spacecraft with one or more sterilization processes. These processes are often incompatible with particular materials or components on the spacecraft and extensive effort is made to try to mitigate these issues. Innovative new or improved sterilization/re-sterilization processes are being sought for application to spacecraft hardware to increase effectiveness of reducing bio-load on spacecraft or increase process compatibility with hardware (e.g., toxicity to hardware, temperature, duration, etc.). Accepted processes currently include heat processing, gamma/electron beam irradiation, cold plasma, and vapor hydrogen peroxide. Options to improve materials and parts (e.g., sensors, seals, in particular, batteries, valves, and optical coatings) to be compatible with currently accepted processes, in particular heat tolerance, are needed. NASA is seeking novel technologies for preventing recontamination of sterilized components or spacecraft as a whole (e.g., biobarriers). In addition, active in-situ recontamination/decontamination approaches (e.g., in-situ heating of sample containers to drive off volatiles prior to sample collection) and in-situ sterilization approaches (e.g., UV or plasma) for surfaces are desired.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Missions planning sample return from bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are faced with developing technologies for sample return functions to assure containment of material from these bodies. Thus far, concepts have been developed specifically for Mars sample return but no end-to-end concepts have been developed that do not have technical challenges remaining in one or more areas. Options for sample canisters with seal(s) (e.g., brazing, explosive welding, soft) with sealing performed either on surface or in orbit and capability to verify seal(s), potentially by leak detection are needed. In addition, capability is needed for opening seals while maintaining sample integrity upon Earth return. These technologies need to be compatible with processes the materials may encounter over the lifecycle of the mission (e.g., high temperature heating). Containment assurance also requires technologies to break-the-chain of contact with the sampled body. Any native contamination on the returned sample container and/or Earth return vehicle must be either be fully contained, sterilized, or removed prior to return to Earth, therefore, technologies or concepts to mitigate this contamination are desired. Lightweight shielding technologies are also needed for meteoroid protection for the Earth entry vehicle and sample canister with capability to detect damage or breach to meet a 10-6 probability of loss of containment. </p>\n",

      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Many NASA science applications demand much faster supercomputers.  This area seeks technologies to accelerate the development of an efficient and practical exascale computing system (1018 operations per second). Innovative file systems that leverage node memory and a new exascale operating system geared toward NASA applications are two possible technologies for this element. At the same time, this area calls for technology to support co-design (i.e., concurrent design) of NASA applications and exascale supercomputers, enabling application scaling to billion-fold parallelism while dramatically increasing memory access efficiency. This supports NSCI Objective 1 (Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.).</li>\n",

In-situ data analytics that can run in-memory side-by-side with the model run is another possible technology for this element.

      "<p>Currently, creating decision support tools (DST) that effectively utilize remote sensing data requires significant efforts by experts in multiple domains. This creates a barrier to the widespread use of Earth observations by state and local governments, businesses, and the public. This subtopic aims to democratize the creation of Earth science driven decision support tools and to unleash a creative explosion of DST development that significantly increases the return on investment for Earth science missions. </p>\n",
      "<p>Specifically, this subtopic develops core capabilities that can be integrated to build multiple remote sensing driven DSTs customized to the requirements of different users in varied fields. Proven development and commercialization strategies will be used to meet these objectives. The goal of this solicitation is to directly link what is being done at NASA with the end user community to support decision making. The outcomes of this work could include new tools, integration systems, visualization interfaces, among others. Responsive proposals must include a clear identification of a data product(s), modeling tools, or NASA activities that will be used and a clear end user/stakeholder organization to which the tools, systems, etc. are intended to support for applied research and decision support. Proposals should explain how the proposed capabilities will address an end user need or gap area in decision support capabilities. Proposals should also outline existing capabilities, including software, models, and data that are already implemented at NASA or through related NASA activities and how the proposed activities may leverage, complement, or expand from existing infrastructure. Projects must be mindful of NASA security restrictions in the development of new activities.</p>\n",

      "<p>Technologies are sought for excavation and transfer of hydrated and icy Mars soils.  For hydrated soils, the excavated soil can be delivered to a centralized soil processing plant or processed on the excavation rover itself.  The amount of water content in the hydrated Mars soil can vary from as low as between 1.5 and 2% on the surface at almost all locations on Mars to above 10% depending on the location and mineral.  The concentration of water may also increase below a desiccated layer of soil at the surface, so technologies for excavation and transfer need to consider soil properties and water content as a function of depth and minerals and should be applicable to a range of landing sites where icy soils do not exist.  The need to excavate down to at least 0.5 meters should be considered.  The amount of water content in icy Mars soil can vary greatly as a function of depth and latitude.  Based on analysis of Mars orbital data, proposers should assume a minimum of 10% by weight of water/ice up to 90%.  Due to human landing and ascent considerations, Mars water based resources should be constrained between +/1 50 deg. latitude.  Based on the potential high water content by mass in icy soils, it is expected that icy soil excavated will be either processed in-situ or on the excavation rover itself.  Proposers should also assume that up to 0.5 m of soil may exist above icy soils and that excavation down to at least 1 meter is required.  Proposers should note the impact on concept mass, power, and complexity for excavation down to 3 meters.  Proposals should consider water loss due to hardware temperature, material agitation, and duration of soil exposure to the environment before transfer to soil processing systems.  Note requirements for the mobility platform associated with hydrated soil excavation and transfer will be included in the H8 Robotic Systems Topic.</p>\n",
      "<p>Technologies are sought for processing of hydrated and icy Mars soils to extract water.  Soil processing for water extraction needs to consider the range of water content in Mars soils and water extraction rates defined below.  Proposals for soil processing also need to define potential water loss due to valve/enclosure sealing for closed soil reactors or losses due to exposure to the surrounding environment or soil for open soil reactors.  Proposals need to consider what other volatiles and contaminants are released due to soil processing/heating.  Proposed solutions that perform in a non-continuous fashion are acceptable, as long as they achieve the same total production quantities on a daily or weekly basis.  Understanding the change in mass, power, volume, complexity, and contaminant release as a function of water content in the soil, heating temperature, and heating method are important factors in selection.  Power needed for the proposed technology operation should be differentiated between electrical and thermal, and consideration should be given on how the thermal management system and the Mars environment could minimize the need for electrical-to-thermal energy conversion.</p>\n",
      "<p>Based on past and recent human Mars exploration mission studies, to meet ascent propellant production rates with margin, approximately 1.6 kg/hr of water must be collected and cleaned for subsequent processing.  At this time, 3 soil processing units for extraction of water from Mars soils is baselined for human Mars missions.  Multiple excavation and processing units are allowed, but should be justified based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements. Proposers can submit combined excavation and soil processing technologies.  </p>\n",
      "<p>Technologies are sought for the separation, collection, and cleaning of water released from soil processing of hydrated and icy Mars soils.  Separation of contaminants from water can be performed in the vapor phase during release or after collection, but technologies need to be regenerative.  Separate and multiple technologies for collection, separation, and cleanup can be proposed for any one or all of the functions (separation, collection, and cleaning)  All must operate in conjunction with the soil processing reactors for the soil/water production rates, contaminants, and mission durations specified above.  It is encouraged that proposers for soil processing of Mars soils also consider including technologies requested below for water separation, collection, and cleanup since the two technology needs can be highly interconnected.  Multiple units are allowed, but should be justified based on overall mass, power, thermal, and/or operation duration requirements.  Water will need to be clean enough to be fed to a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis unit.</p>\n",
      "<p>Proposals for ISRU hardware for Mars material excavation, transfer, and processing for the extraction of water need to consider physical, mineral, and volatile characteristics and variations for hydrated and icy soils, as well as the types of volatiles and contaminants released during heating.

When acquired and exposed to higher temperatures and vacuum, these resources will change state into the vapor phase and are known as volatiles. Examples of this are polar water ice or hydrogen and helium 3 embedded in the regolith grains by the sun.</p>\n",

      "</ul><p>An ancillary benefit is that the volatiles are of great interest to the science community and provide clues to help understand the solar wind, comets, and the history of the inner solar system.</p>\n",
      "<p>Recent data from NASA's Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) missions indicate that as much as 20% of the material kicked up by the LCROSS impact was volatiles, including water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The instruments also discovered relatively large amounts of light metals such as sodium, mercury and possibly even silver.</p>\n",

      "<p>The entire surface of the Moon is covered with fragmental and unconsolidated crushed rock material known as regolith, which was formed over billions of years of high-energy impacts by meteorites, comets and other solar system debris. Estimates are that this regolith covers the top 8-10 meters of the Moon’s surface. Regolith represents a significant resource due to the bound oxygen that is present in some minerals; metals such as aluminum, iron and magnesium that can be extracted to make parts; and its use as a bulk construction aggregate material for civil engineering structures or radiation shielding. In addition other engineering parameters such as trafficability must be known before effective exploration can take place.</p>\n",
      "<p>Silicate minerals, composed dominantly of silicon and oxygen, are the most abundant constituents, making up over 90% by volume of most lunar rocks. The most common silicate minerals are pyroxene, (Ca,Fe,Mg)2Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>; plagioclase feldspar, (Ca,Na)(Al,Si)408; and olivine, (Mg,Fe)2SiO<sub>4</sub>. Oxide minerals, composed chiefly of metals and oxygen, are next in abundance after silicate minerals. They are particularly concentrated in the mare basalts, and they may make up as much as 20% by volume of these rocks. The most abundant oxide mineral is ilmenite, (Fe,Mg)TiO<sub>3</sub>, a black, opaque mineral that reflects the high TiO<sub>2</sub> contents of many mare basalts. The second most abundant oxide mineral, spinel, has a widely varying composition and actually consists of a complex series of solid solutions. Members of this series include: chromite, FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; ulvöspinel, Fe<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>4</sub>; hercynite, FeAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; and spinel (sensu stricto), MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Another oxide phase, which is only abundant in titanium-rich lunar basalts, is armalcolite, (Fe,Mg)Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.</p>\n",

Vehicle outfitting provides the equipment necessary for the crew to perform mission tasks as well as provide them a comfortable, safe and livable habitable volume. Effective and efficient human-system interfaces and interactions are critical and should be considered as an integral part of this effort and demonstrated. Integrated outfitting is often a distributed hardware set that operates in unison or independently to perform a habitation function. Outfitting includes secondary structure (e.g., floors and walls), crew structures (e.g., crew quarters, radiation storm shelters) as well as the distribution of outfitting items (e.g., crew personal items) and utilities (e.g., avionics, ventilation, lighting) to sustain the crew during a mission. Habitat features and capabilities that allow autonomous monitoring or robotic interaction of items to enable habitat outfitting (e.g., high accuracy localization systems or mounting approaches) prior to crew arrival or after crew departure are also of interest. Concepts that can reuse launch support structure for outfitting are advantageous if it can be done without significant or with no crew interaction. Concepts should be capable of outfitting habitats with diameters of 3-8 meters and lengths of 4-10 meters. Habitat atmospheric pressure may vary from 0-1 atm for launch and 0.5-1 atm during crew usage. The following habitat outfitting specific habitat outfitting areas are requested.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Interior Structures</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Deployable, inflatable, 3D printable from processed launch packaging, reusable secondary structure, and crew structures for outfitting the vehicle habitable volume. Concepts should not be constrained to the ISS rack geometry or attachments. Concepts must be volumetrically and mass efficient, and have a metric less than 25 kg/m<sup>3</sup> for an enclosed volume. Proposed technologies that provide a surface area (e.g., floor) or utility (e.g., plumbing) should define a normalized metric (e.g., kg/ m<sup>2</sup> or kg/m/plumbing run). The selection of non-metallic materials is very important in a spacecraft and will need to meet off-gassing and flammability requirements. Concepts should also have surfaces that either resist the accumulation of dust and dander or are readily cleanable. Structures should include appropriate factors of safety and assumptions should be included in the proposal. Concepts should be capable of sustaining launch loads (which can be in a stowed configuration) of 6g axial and 2g lateral. Crew structures must be capable of withstanding crew kick loads of 125 lbs when fully deployed. Concepts that are also applicable to habitat and life support equipment mounting are desirable.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Autonomous Outfitting Capabilities<br/></strong><br/> Development of features and systems are required that can enable habitat structures, crew equipment, logistics, and trash to be interacted with autonomously with no direct crew involvement. Requested capabilities are rapid identification, localization in 3D space (including pose or orientation), and interaction with items. The intent is to allow robotic interaction with items prior to crew arrival and after crew departure. This may include deployment of interior structures, maintenance of the habitat, or monitoring of the habitat including health and status of items. Systems may also enable or facilitate human-machine interactions by providing greater situational awareness. Development of the robotic elements themselves are excluded from this subtopic. Mechanisms, electro-mechanical, and software applications and algorithms that enable autonomous outfitting and maintenance capability are requested. Dependencies on batteries are highly undesirable. Concepts that provide significant automated vehicle health monitoring should consider submission to the 'Autonomous Systems' topic.</p>\n",

ISS has employed a wide variety of analytical instruments to deal with critical items. These functional needs are required to address identified risks to crew health during Exploration-class missions. The current approach onboard ISS, if any, will serve as the logical starting point to meeting the functional needs. However, the following limitations were found common to all the current approaches on-board ISS for any missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO): reliance on return sample and ground analysis, require too much crew time, constraints on size, mass, and power, lack of portability, and insufficient calibration life. Hence a concerted effort is underway to address these gaps and mature those solutions to ground and flight technology demonstrations. Technologies that show improvements in miniaturization, reliability, life-time, self-calibration, and reduction of expendables are of interest.<strong> </strong></p>\n",

As our exploration missions increase in distance and duration, logistics reduction becomes even more important since they may need to be pre-deployed 2-5 years before a crew arrives. Reducing the initial mass and volume of supplies, or reusing items that have been launched, will be very valuable. Logistics unique to a spacecraft system (i.e., life support and propulsion) are not addressed by this subtopic and are not requested. Three of the largest logistics consumables are the logistical packaging (e.g., cargo bags, foam, retention straps, and cargo support pallets), clothing, and food. Approximately 1,000 cargo bags (0.053 m3 each) may be required for a Mars mission's logistics. Cargo is typically packed in foam, placed in a bag, and strapped to the vehicle or a cargo pallet/structure in the vehicle. Clothing is currently disposed of on the Space Station when it becomes too dirty to wear because there is no way to clean it. Food nutritional content and quality decreases over time and depends on the specific nutrients, food matrix, food packaging, and storage environment. Food may need to be stored up to five years before consumption, and maintaining stable nutrition is a significant challenge. Reductions in food mass, nutrient studies, and nutrient generation are not requested as part of this subtopic. All proposals should consider maintainability as well as dormancy periods without crew.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Vehicle Level Cold/Alternate Atmosphere Food Storage</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Innovative use of materials, insulation, and heat removal systems are requested. Standalone systems as well as innovative approaches integrated into portions of the vehicle structure and thermal loops are acceptable. One method of increasing food nutrient shelf-life is with cold stowage and/or alternate atmospheres (i.e., low oxygen composition). Stored food volumes of 2-8 m<sup>3</sup>, with average packaged food density of 250-500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, may be required at temperature ranges of -80° to +20°C. Oxygen levels &lt;21% and food compartment pressures less than one atmosphere are being studied for their effects. Ability to control the atmosphere and pressure in the cold stowage volume is beneficial but is not required of a submitted technology, nor is the full temperature range listed above required. Systems must be capable of surviving launch loads (6g axial and 2g lateral) when fully loaded and be capable of autonomous operation for up to five years in microgravity. Concepts must be volumetrically efficient, mass efficient, and highly reliable since loss of food quality can result in loss of crew performance. The advantages of proposed concepts compared to the ISS Refrigerator/Freezer Rack (RFR) and terrestrial high efficiency freezers must be described. The ISS RFR, which never flew but achieved temperatures of -22°C and +4°C in freezer and refrigerator modes, had a secondary mass penalty of 1.36 kg for every 1 kg of food due to cabinet, drawers, insulation, cooling system and rack masses. (NASA/TP-2015–218570) The goal is to lower this secondary mass penalty for cold stowage below 0.2 kg per 1 kg of food. For long term storage of food, drawers are not required. At the same time, the refrigeration and insulation systems should be efficient enough to run (at steady state) on less than 0.15 Watts per kg of food frozen at -22°C in a 23°C ambient.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Alternative Launch Packaging of Logistics and Cargo</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Alternatives to the existing ISS use of Cargo Transfer Bags (CTBs), foam, straps, and cargo pallets is required. Cargo densities of 510 kg/m3 (single CTB capability) must be supported during launch acceleration of 6g axial and 2g lateral. Total packaging mass efficiencies of all required materials between the cargo and the vehicle pressure shell structure should be less than 0.3 kg packaging/kg of cargo. Concepts should be capable of scaling between logistics vehicles with diameters of 3-8 meters and lengths of 4-10 meters. Logistics vehicle atmospheric pressure may vary from 0-1 atm for launch and 0.5-1 atm during crew use.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Innovative Crew Clothing Systems to Extend Duration of Wear</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Innovative systems that refresh crew clothing to extend the duration of wear are requested. Crew exercise clothing, for example, is currently discarded into the trash after 2-3 uses because there are no space laundry systems. The goal is to extend the duration of wear by 2-3 times or more for several types of garments. Systems must be capable of sanitizing/refreshing a small set of crew clothing that includes exercise t-shirts, exercise socks, exercise shorts, male and female undergarments, and male and female daily wear, such as crew polo shirts. The system should provide odor control while preserving the appearance, color and brightness, and the physical and mechanical properties of the fabrics, which include cotton, wool and modacrylic. Odor control can be through absorption, adsorption, denaturation, or neutralization of pH and odorous compounds, etc. Innovative use of technologies, such as ultraviolet light, microwaves, vacuum, ozone, steam, CO<sub>2</sub>, charcoal filtration, minimal water, or other technologies will be considered. The crew clothing sanitizing/refreshing system must be capable of operating for a minimum of 3 years in microgravity with minimal consumables, crew time requirement and electrical power. Cleaning/washing agent should be limited to less than 10 grams of consumables per kg of crew clothing for each refresh. No water or extremely low water usage systems are preferred, but if water is used, water usage should be less than 200 grams per kg of clothing washed. No hazardous gases or particles can be released into the crew atmosphere during or after operation. Concepts must be volumetrically efficient, mass efficient, not adversely impact the closed loop life support systems, and be highly reliable. Cleaning/washing systems may be used during outbound transit to Mars, then be dormant for up to 18 months prior to the return trip to Earth. Controlling microbial activity and odor during this dormancy is important to habitat and crew health.</p>\n",

However, this data is irrelevant if humans using the suits aren't effective.  Characterizing human suited performance has continued to be a challenge, partly due to limitations in sensor technology. One concept is to use sensors placed at/on the human body, underneath the pressure garment to obtain knowledge of the human bodies movements.  This data could then be compared against the suit motion.  Various sensors, sensor technologies, and sensor implementations have been attempted over two decades of efforts, but each has had issues.  Previous efforts have used Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR), TouchSense shear sensors, pressure-sensing arrays (Tek scan etc.), piezo-electric sensors, among others but have not met all requirements. Most issues have centered around accuracy when placed on the pliant surface of the skin, and accuracy when placed over curved surfaces of the skin. Accuracy has been sufficient to delineate low, medium or high levels of force but not a reliable quantitative value. This, combined with aberrant readings when the sensor is bent has led to these sensors only providing a rough idea of the interaction between the suit and the skin: while in a controlled environment the sensors are accurate to within 10% or so, the accuracy falls significantly when measuring the skin and being bent or pressed in inconsistent ways; on the order of 50% accuracy or worse. The sensors also are prone to drift (falling out of calibration) quickly during use. Lastly, the sensors, while pliant, are still relatively thick and as such translates to discomfort and loss of tactility. This is typical during all previous testing but most notable when sensors are bent along an axis (or worse, along two axis such as required to follow a complex anatomical contour). As such, the effect on the suit/skin interface that is being measured is changed, which adds an additional complication to interpreting data output from these sensors. Much of the work within JSC has improved the integration, comfort, and calibration of these sensors, but the accuracy performance characteristics when in use have not been sufficient to meet requirements. A new sensor technology is warranted for use in our application.</p>\n",
      "<p>Current critical needs that this technology would enable include the ability to optimize suit design for ergonomics, comfort and fit without the sole reliance on subjective feedback. While subjective feedback is important, developing a method to quantify the amount of force or pressure on a particular anatomical or suit landmark will aid in providing a richer definition of the suit/human interface that can be leveraged to make space suits more comfortable while reducing risk of injury. Taken together, these improvements will enhance EVA performance, reduce overhead and reduce personnel and programmatic risk. This technology implementation would require relatively accurate pressure or force readings in the medium to high range.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the future, alternative space suit architectures such as mechanical counter pressure may be feasible, and a critical ancillary to such an architecture is to verify that necessary physiological pressure requirements are being met to ensure the health and safety of the crew. To this end, the technology should be able to accurately measure mechanical pressure on the human skin in the low pressure (&lt; 10 psi) range.</p>\n",
      "<p>Performance targets vary upon application, but the sensing technology should have the following characteristics:</p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Measures force and/or mechanical pressure.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Accurate to within 10%.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Resistant to aberrant readings when under moderate bending, shear or torsion.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Either sufficiently pliant, or high enough spatial resolution, to follow anatomical curves on the human skin without discomfort or lack of mobility.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\">Thin profile (~mm).</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\">Packaged at high spatial resolution (~cm) or sufficiently small to facilitate a custom packaging/substrate solution with a high spatial resolution.</li>\n",

      "<li class=\"odd\">At this early stage, a simple digital readout capability to evaluate sensor performance.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>For this SBIR opportunity specifically, we are looking for a single sensor technology that targets the above requirements including readout capability.

      "<p>The most attention should be paid to maximizing spatial resolution, accuracy and thinness for this prototype.

A hot structure is a type of multifunctional structure that can reduce or eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system (TPS) to protect the structure. The potential advantages of using a hot structure in place of a cool structure with a separate TPS are: reduced mass, increased mission capability such as reusability, improved aerodynamics, improved structural efficiency, and increased ability to inspect the structure. Hot structures is an enabling technology for reusability between missions or mission phases, such as aerocapture followed by entry, and have been used in many prior NASA programs: Space Shuttle (nosecap and leading edges), HyperX (nose and all-moving control surfaces), X-37 (flaperon and ruddervator control surfaces), and many Department of Defense programs.</p>\n",

They enable crews to live and work safely in deep space, and include integrated life support systems, radiation protection, fire safety, and systems to reduce logistics and the need for resupply missions. Innovative health management technologies are needed in order to increase the safety and mission-effectiveness for future space habitats on other planets, asteroids, or lunar surfaces. For example, off-nominal or failure conditions occurring in safety-critical life support systems may need to be addressed quickly by the habitat crew without extensive technical support from Earth due to communication delays. If the crew in the habitat must manage, plan and operate much of the mission themselves, operations support must be migrated from Earth to the habitat. Enabling monitoring, tracking, and management capabilities on-board the habitat and related EVA platforms for a small crew to use will require significant automation and decision support software.</p>\n",
      "<p>This subtopic seeks to broaden the scope of traditional caution and warning systems, which are typically triggered by out-of-bounds sensor values, by including machine learning and data mining techniques. These methods aim to reveal latent, unknown conditions while still retaining and improving the ability to provide highly accurate alerts for known issues. The performance targets for known faults and failures will be based upon false alarm rate, missed detection rate, and detection time (first time prior to the adverse event that the algorithm indicates an impending fault/failure). Methods should explore the trade space for ISHM data and processing needs in order to provide guidance for future habitat sensor and computational resource requirements.</p>\n",

Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 4 to 6 or higher are sought.</p>\n",
      "<p>Key features of Sustainability Base that make it relevant to deep space habitat technology are its use of a grey water recycling system and a photo-voltaic array. Data logged from other facility management/building automation systems include environmental data (temp, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.) and facility equipment sensors (flowrates, differential pressures, temperatures, etc.). Also, information on power consumption (whole building, plug load, other loads metered at the panel/circuit level) can be made available. These remaining systems, while conventionally \"green,\" have no unique feature that can't be exclusively used for terrestrial purposes. However, the fact that all such systems require less power to support human occupancy can be used as a focal point to serve as a testbed for deep space habitats that will need to operate within finite energy budgets.</p>\n",

In particular, these capabilities are needed to handle faults leading to loss of critical function or unexpected expenditure of consumables. Expanded flight control functionality will be on-board spacecraft to support autonomy with significant automation, autonomy, and decision support software. The increasingly complex interconnectivity of these elements introduces new vulnerabilities within space systems that are sometimes impossible to predict.  In that context, one key property of the respective system is its resilience to unforeseen events.</p>\n",
      "<p>Resilience, as defined by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [1] (NAS), is the ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events.  Within this definition, resilience has two manifestations: engineering and ecological.  Engineering resilience is focused on the ability of a system to absorb and recover from adverse events, while ecological resilience is focused on understanding how close a system is to collapse and reorganization.  The engineering definition brings resilience principles such as robustness, redundancy, and modularity, while the ecological definition supports principles of flexibility, adaptability, and resourcefulness.</p>\n",
      "<p>To enable resilient behavior of a system (such as a vehicle, a habitat, a rover, etc.), \"resilience\" needs to be built-in during the design phase of the system development. To that end, the operational states of a system’s component need to be considered in conjunction with the intended function of the component and its possible failure modes throughout the vehicle's life cycle. Where possible, critical failures are eliminated during the design stage. For failure modes that cannot be eliminated, a mechanism needs to be designed that considers how to have optimal state awareness during operations and to mitigate the fault. Mitigation can be accomplished through fault avoidance, fault masking, or Fault Detection, Assessment, and Recovery (FDIR). FDIR can be realized through hardware or software solutions as well as by intervention of the mission crew or mission control.  The detection / assessment / recovery process will involve identification of:</p>\n",

      "<ul><li class=\"even\"><em>Sensing -</em> measuring new information about a system’s operating environment with focus on anomalous data.  These data can alert system evaluators of overlooked possibilities. This process connects components in the physical domain to the information domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Anticipation -</em> imagining multiple future states without reducing improbability to impossibility; this includes incorporating the uncertainty in the future states and including the impact of such uncertainty on system operation. This process connects components in the information domain to the cognitive domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Adaptation -</em> reacting to changing conditions or uncertain states to restore critical functionality under altered conditions or operating environments. This process connects the cognitive domain to the physical domain.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Learning -</em> observing external conditions and system responses to improve understanding of relationships and possible futures, identifying needs for system improvement where applicable. This process links the physical, information, and cognitive domains together and can incorporate the social or human crew domain depending on the system studied.</li>\n",
      "</ul><p>Since a vehicle is made up of many components, a system-of-system’s approach needs to be considered in a multi-objective optimization context to account for interdependencies and to realize possible mutually beneficial mitigation solutions for resiliency.</p>\n",

Risk metrics tend to assess risks to individual components, ignoring system functionality as the result of interacting components. Resilience measures and metrics also need to account for uncertainty in the planned operation of the system, and focus on integrating statistical methods for uncertainty propagation into resilience-based design. Rather than the static view of systems and networks in risk assessment, resilience adopts a dynamic view. This means resilience metrics must also consider the ability of a system to plan, prepare, and adapt as adverse events occur, rather than focus entirely on threat prevention and mitigation.

Novel artificial intelligence capabilities augmenting crews will be required for them to autonomously manage spacecraft operations and interact with Earth mission control under these conditions, including spacecraft and systems health, crew health, maintenance, consumable management, payload management, training, as well as activities such as food production and recycling.</p>\n",
      "<p>Autonomous agents with cognitive architectures would be able to interface directly with the crew as well as with the onboard systems and mission control, thus reducing the cognitive loads on the crew as well as performing many tasks that would otherwise require scheduling crew time. In addition, this cognitive computing capability is necessary in many circumstances to respond to off-nominal events that overload the crew; particularly when the event limits crew activity, such as high-radiation or loss of atmospheric pressure events.</p>\n",
      "<p>In deep space, crews will be required to manage, plan, and execute the mission more autonomously than is currently done on the International Space Station (ISS); which from Low Earth Orbit has instantaneous ground support. NASA expects to migrate significant portions of current operations functionality from Earth flight control to deep-space spacecraft to be performed autonomously. These functionalities will be performed jointly by the crew and cognitive agents supervised by the crew; so the crew is not overburdened. Cognitive agents that can effectively communicate with the crew could perform tasks that would otherwise require crew time by providing assistance, directly operating spacecraft systems, providing training, performing inspections, and providing crew consulting among other tasks.</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to the complexity of such cognitive agents and the need for them to be continually updated, their software architecture is required to be modular. A requirement for the cognitive software architecture is that modules can dynamically be added, removed, and enhanced. Types of modules would likely include a smart executive, state estimator, planner/scheduler, diagnostics and prognostics, goal manager, etc. Other modules that may be supported include a dialog manager, risk manager, image recognition, instructional drawing, crew task manager, etc. This type of modular cognitive architecture is consistent with that proposed by Prof. Marvin Minsky in \"The Society of Mind\", 1988, and subsequent proposals and realizations of cognitive agents. Recent venues for cognitive architectures include: ICCM (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://acs.ist.psu.edu/iccm2016/<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>) and CogArch 2016 @ ASPLOS (<a data-extlink=\"\" href=\"http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5848<span class=\"ext\"><span class=\"element-invisible\">(link is external)</span></span></a>).</p>\n",
      "<p>Due to NASA's need for fail-safe capabilities, such as continued functionality during high-radiation events, the cognitive architecture will be required to be capable of supporting multiple processes executing on multiple processors, in order to meet the expected computational loads as well as be robust to processor failure. Cognitive architectures capable of being certified for crew support on spacecraft are also required to be open to NASA with interfaces open to NASA partners who develop modules that integrate with other modules on the cognitive agent in contrast to proprietary black-box agents. Note that a cognitive agent suitable to provide crew support on spacecraft may also be suitable for a variety of Earth applications, but the converse is not true; thus requiring this NASA investment.</p>\n",
      "<p>The emphasis of proposed efforts are expected to be on analyzing and demonstrating the feasibility of various configurations, capabilities, and limitations of a cognitive architecture suitable for crew support on deep space missions. The software engineering of a cognitive architecture is to be documented and demonstrated by implementing a prototype goal-directed cognitive agent that interacts with simulated spacecraft systems and humans.</p>\n",
      "<p>For Phase I, a preliminary cognitive architecture, preliminary feasibility study, a cognitive agent prototype that supports a human operating a simulate complex system that illustrates a candidate cognitive agent architecture, and a detailed plan to develop a comprehensive cognitive architecture feasibility study are expected. For Phase II, it is expected that the proposed detailed feasibility study plan is executed. In Phase II it is expected that a comprehensive cognitive architecture will be generated, along with a demonstration of an agent prototype that instantiates the architecture. The agent prototype should interact with a spacecraft simulator and humans executing a plausible HEOMD design reference mission beyond cis-lunar (e.g., Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Mission: <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf\">https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf</a>). Phase II deliverables are also expected to include a comprehensive feasibility study report, and a detailed plan to develop a fully instantiated robust cognitive architecture suitable for proposing to NASA and other organizations interested in funding a flight capability. A Phase II prototype suitable for a compelling flight experiment or simulation interfacing with the ISS or a spacecraft-relevant robotic system is encouraged.</p>\n",

Additionally, NASA is supporting commercial science, engineering, and technology to provide low earth orbit commercial opportunities utilizing the ISS.

The technology can be materials or non-materials (devices). The physical size of the experiments can vary depending on the technology being demonstrated (1 inch by 1 inch up to 7.84 inches by 14 inches). Of special interest are space technologies already developed under the NASA SBIR Program, particularly technologies that would mature in TRL due to successful demonstration in the space environment. The proposal should justify the need for spaceflight exposure and justify that the ISS environment is adequate to gather the data they need. The MISSE-FF commercial partner, Alpha Space Test &amp; Research Alliance, LLC, plans to service MISSE-FF every 6 months. The MISSE-FF data will be made available to the global community of researchers through the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) system.

      "<p>In the future, robotic and human exploration vehicles with increasingly capable instruments producing large quantities of data will be investigating Earth, extraterrestrial moons, planets and asteroids. These vehicles, especially those that visit the surfaces of these myriad destinations, will be tightly constrained in the areas of mass, volume and energy. Our historical method of implementing single function elements such as short and long‐range data and voice radios as well as short‐range radar sensors does not lend itself to mass, volume or energy efficiencies that can support future resource challenged platforms.  </p>\n",
      "<p>One method of enhancing limited resources is to leverage recent advances in the areas of Reconfigurable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technologies as well as RF components, materials and packaging to create advanced multifunction RF platforms. Recent advances in high speed digital electronics, especially where clock speeds exist in the range of several GHz, have blurred the lines between what was traditionally considered “analog” and digital”. Digital signal processing techniques with multi‐GHz clock rates can generate arbitrary user‐defined analog waveforms at RF frequencies as never before. These waveforms, when coupled with advanced RF electronics focused on S‐Band through Ka‐Band frequencies, greatly improve the functionality, performance and utility of space‐based communications devices. This naturally leads to advanced multi‐function RF platforms; platforms that serve more than one user or function and are reconfigurable, on‐demand, by the user for arbitrary applications. The commercial cellphone and wireless industries have been highly successful in developing multifunction RF and wireless platforms that serve a broad range of customers. NASA can leverage these techniques, hardware, algorithms and waveforms developed by industry for use in space applications. However, in order to leverage this increased level of configurability, functionality and performance, NASA needs to further invest in technologies for two key areas: </p>\n",
      "<ul><li class=\"even\">Advanced waveform development in the digital domain. Specifically: the foundation has been laid through prior NASA investments in the area of generating the infrastructure for software‐based algorithms. These investments led to the development and demonstration of the Space Telecommunication Radio System (STRS) architectural standard for software‐defined radios. Now that the architecture has been instantiated, the next logical step in NASA’s investment portfolio is the development of actual application backend platforms and waveforms that meet this architectural standard. Advanced backend platforms generate (for transmission) or process (from reception) the appropriate waveform at a common Intermediate Frequency (IF) for transmission to, or reception from, an appropriate RF front‐end. In addition, the backend processor is reconfigurable, by the user, for a specific application at a given time (radar vs. short range communications link, etc.). </li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><li class=\"even\">The development and demonstration of advanced RF Front‐Ends that cover NASA RF bands of interest; specifically, S‐Band, X‐Band and/or Ka‐Band. These RF front‐ends may support time multiplexed waveforms such as radar or (digitized) half‐duplex voice transmissions as well as frequency duplexed waveforms such as full‐duplex two‐way navigation and data communications. Specifically, these front‐ends are expected to leverage state‐of‐the‐art RF materials (e.g., GaN, SiC, CMOS, etc.), packaging (e.g., MIC, SMT, etc.), device (e.g., MMIC, MEMS, etc.) and component techniques to minimize mass, volume and energy resource usage while supporting multi‐functionality. In implementing these multifunction RF Front‐Ends, we must note that there are three key functions embedded within these front‐ends that require further development:</li>\n",
      "</ul><ul><ul><li class=\"even\"><em>High Efficiency Microwave Power Amplifiers -</em> Compact, lightweight, space qualifiable Ka‐band solid‐state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with integrated electronic power conditioner that can deliver an output power on the order of 10 to 20 Watts (CW) with bandwidth on the order of 1% to 2% and mass less than 1 kg is of interest to NASA. In addition, low‐noise amplifiers (LNAs) with noise figures on the order of a dB or less is of interest to NASA. Since overall efficiency is of paramount importance for low dc power consumption, efficiency enhancement techniques are of interest. Furthermore, SSPAs with good linearity and capable of functioning in tandem with software defined radios (SDRs) for amplifying spectrally efficient digital modulation format signals are also of interest.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"odd\"><em>Electronically Steered Antennas -</em> Electronically steered antennas, especially at Ka‐Band, are of interest. Applications include large, high‐performance electronicallysteered antennas required for a dedicated communications relay spacecraft with multiple simultaneous connections, advanced multifunction antennas to support science missions that utilize a multifunction antenna to both communicate and conduct science, and small, lightweight antennas for communications only that provide moderate gain without the use of mechanical steering. Antennas that are reconfigurable in frequency, polarization, and radiation pattern that reduce the number of antennas needed to meet the communication requirements of NASA missions are desired.</li>\n",
      "<li class=\"even\"><em>Ultrawideband (UWB) Antennas and Electronics -</em> Recent developments in commercial chipsets and antennas that implement UWB modulation techniques are of interest to NASA. Advanced signal processing techniques that can leverage investments made in the commercial communications industry for space applications as well as UWB antennas that function in the standard NASA S/X/Ka‐Band frequency ranges are of interest to NASA. This includes modulation and demodulation techniques and algorithms for UWB signal transmission and reception. </li>\n",

This is true for virtually all propulsive devices of a space vehicle including liquid and solid rocket propulsion, chemical and non-chemical propulsion, boost stage and in-space propulsion and so forth.  It involves a combination of component-level and engine-level testing to demonstrate the propulsion devices were designed to meet the specified requirements for a specified operational envelope and over robust margins and shown to be sufficiently reliable, prior to its first flight. </p>\n",
      "<p>This topic area seeks to develop advanced ground test technology components and system level ground test systems that enhance Chemical and Advanced Propulsion technology development and certification. The goal is to advanced propulsion ground test technologies to enhance environment simulation, minimize test program time, cost and risk and meet existing environmental and safety regulations.  It is focused on near-term products that augment and enhance proven, state-of-the-art propulsion test facilities. This project is especially interested in ground test and launch environment technologies with potential to substantially reduce the costs and improve safety/reliability of NASA's test and launch operations.   </p>\n",

      "<p>NASA is interested in areas of interface technology that lower launch vehicle operations costs and provide evolution paths for in-space exploration.  This includes interfaces between systems normally present within a launch system.  For the purpose of this subtopic a launch system includes a vehicle ready for flight with payload, and includes all related support systems and infrastructure.</p>\n",
      "<p>A substantial portion of pre-launch processing involves the integration of spacecraft assemblies to each other or to the ground/surface systems that supply the commodities, power or data. Each assembly requires a reliable interface that connects it to the adjacent hardware which includes flight critical seals or connectors and other components.</p>\n",
      "<p>The benefits of standardized, simplified interfaces are particularly strong for small launch vehicles.  Due to a lack of common specifications and standards, each launch vehicle system may impose different interface requirements thereby resulting in unique components/subsystems tailored for each vehicle.  This complicates recent efforts to establish a multi-user capability within the existing launch infrastructure.  For the launch provider, unique interface requirements result in higher recurring cost per launch vehicle and reduced ability to incorporate newer subsystems as the vehicle matures.</p>\n",
      "<p>Future activities at exploration destinations in space and on other surfaces will rely on a combination of structures and systems working together with a high degree of reliability.  The impact of these interface-dependent tasks are of particular concern for surface systems where the additional work must be accomplished by crew performing Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) or by purpose-built robotic systems. Areas of interface technology development relevant for surface operations may include (but are not limited to) cryogenics, modular systems, dust tolerance, standardized disconnects, and embedded intelligence.</p>\n",

      "<p>Phase I Deliverables - Research to identify and evaluate candidate technology applications, demonstrate the technical feasibility, and show a path towards a demonstration. Concept methodology should include the path for adaptation of the technology, infusion strategies (including risk trades), and business model.  Identify improvements over the current state of the art for both operations and systems development and the feasibility of the approach in a multi-customer environment. Bench or lab-level demonstrations are desirable.</p>\n",
      "<p>Phase II Deliverables - Emphasis should be placed on developing and demonstrating the technology under simulated operational conditions with analog earth-based systems including dynamic events such as commodity loading, disconnect or engine testing. The proposal shall outline a path showing how the technology could be developed into or applied to mission-worthy systems. The contract should deliver demonstration hardware for functional and environmental testing at the completion of the Phase II contract. The technology concept at the end of Phase II should be at a TRL of 5 or higher.</p>\n",

      "<p>Adaptive user interfaces, also called intelligent user interfaces, can decrease workload in cases of high attentional loads by presenting the information needed in simpler forms or in different formats. For example, to decrease attentional load, the interface may be modified from text to icons, or the interaction may change from written procedures to voice commands. There is evidence that workload can be reduced if some of the visual information is presented in a different modality or format in high attentional demand situations. Adaptive user interfaces can also provide displays that offer improved and optimized navigation tailored for the current state of the user. Interfaces can be augmented with visual and auditory elements that, again, adapt based on the needs of the user. Thus, the adaptability of the interface is increased in a different dimension. The augmented reality (AR) technology holds the promise to improve crew performance to execute complex procedures in a deep-space human spaceflight missions where communication back to the Earth-based mission control is limited and delayed.</p>\n",
      "<p> In Phase I, a proof-of-concept prototype for an adaptive interface system with augmented reality should be developed and tested for a high workload (e.g., fault management or critical time constraints) scenario. The work should include a literature review on the effects of modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and combination of these) and format (e. g., text, icons, graphs) on workload. A model should be developed based on these principles, as well as an adaptive interface framework for a selected system used for spaceflight. Example scenarios and displays will be provided by NASA for this purpose. Model inputs can be simulated or emulated with hardware. The key technology areas are image registration, new software approaches to integrate augmented reality content from multimedia and multiple modalities, fusion of vision, human tracking, and integration of digital data with live sensor data and models.</p>\n",
      "<p> In Phase II, the prototype adaptive interface system with augmented reality should be designed and validated for the selected high workload use case, as well as a procedure-based task. Display components should dynamically change as a function of the cognitive state and the level of expertise of the operator. The cognitive states (stress, fatigue, and workload) do not need to be measured or prototype; they can be simulated with various levels and treated as input parameters to the prototype. The usability of the prototype should be tested, including trigger events and timing of adaptation.</p>\n",
      "<p> The team should include expertise on augmented reality, interface design, task analysis, and workload.</p>\n",

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,"O1.01Coding, Modulation, and Compression", GSFC," GRC, JPL","Power and spectrum efficient solutions are needed for both near Earth and deep space application scenarios. Coding efficiency from 50% to 87% will be combined with digital modulation from 2bits/symbol/Hz up to yield-optimal solutions. In compression, tunable technique from over 10:1 compression ratio to lossless is desired. Proposals are sought in the following specific areas: CompressionSoftware for transcoding of compressed bit streams from CCSDS Image Data Compression recommendation to commercial JPEG2k bit stream;and Demonstration in either PC-based or workstation-based systems with minimal loss of quality during the transcoding process. Coding and Coded ModulationA design for a set of coded modulations operating at bandwidth efficiencies from 0.5 bits/symbol/Hz to 3+ bits/symbol/Hz, in steps of approximately 0.5 bits/symbol/Hz. Each point design shall require a bit signal-to-noise ratio not higher than 1 dB above the unconstrained-input, 2-dimensional capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The preferred input block frame length is 4K to 16K bits.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.02Precision Navigation and Tracking, JPL, GSFC,"This call for proposals is meant to serve NASA's ever-evolving set of missions which require precise tracking of spacecraft position and velocity in order to achieve mission success. The call seeks evolutionary improvements in modularity, sustainability, cost, and performance for current space navigation concepts that support the Vision for Space Exploration, including all development spirals of systems of systems supporting Projects Constellation, Prometheus, robotic servicing, and robotic earth and space science missions. NASA also seeks disruptive navigation concepts that might not match the modularity, sustainability, cost, and/or performance of current technologies and their near-term evolution, but have convincingly demonstrable potential to overtake the evolution of current technologies within the timeframe of the later spirals of Projects Constellation and Prometheus, and earth and space science missions in the 2015-2020 timeframes.While the definition of ""precise"" depends upon the mission context, typical interplanetary scenarios have required Earth-based radiometric ranging accuracies of order 1-2m at 1 AU, doppler to 0.03 mm/sec, and plane-of-sky angles to 2.5 nano-radians. While some legacy applications remain at 2.3 GHz, most current tracking is being done at 8.4 GHz. Forward looking demonstrations are being planned at 32 GHz. These radiometric techniques have been complimented by optical techniques which achieve ~1.5 micro-radian angular accuracy upon target approach. The accuracy of radio-based techniques is typically limited by one's ability to calibrate the path delay through intervening media (troposphere, ionosphere) and by the phase stability of electronics in both the spacecraft and ground systems. For both media and electronics, the stability goal is to achieve Allan standard deviations of 4e-15 at 100 seconds and of 1.5 e-15 at 1e3 to 1e4 seconds while maintaining or improving upon current levels of reliability. Space navigation technology concepts should support launch and return to Earth, including range safety, early orbit operations, in-space assembly, cis-lunar and interplanetary transit, lunar and planetary approach and orbit, ascent and descent from lunar and planetary surfaces, including precision landing, lunar and planetary surface operations, automated rendezvous and docking, and formation flying spacecraft forming synthetic apertures for science imaging and interferometry. NASA considers applicability to multiple operational regimes through modularity and/or missionization of common components a key element in its exploration strategy. Space navigation systems must produce accurate long-term trajectory predictions as well as definitive epoch solutions. Where applicable, proposed concepts should be interoperable with and/or leverage the resources of NASA's space communications architecture. All navigation systems should be compatible, where applicable, to continuous or near-continuous trajectory perturbations generated by onboard spacecraft systems. All concepts must show some significant advantages over current techniques in at least one of the following areas: accuracy, cost, reliability, modularity, sustainability, or for onboard systems, mass, power, and volume. Innovative technologies are sought in the following areas: Highly phase-stable RF ground systems are critical to high accuracy radiometric tracking. Present systems rely upon analog transmission over 0.5 to 10 km distances of a broadband (100-600 MHz) spectrum. Transmission induced phase errors could be greatly reduced by developing highly phase stable digital sampling and time tagging systems that can be placed near (~10m) to the RF feedhorn without measurably degrading the RF signal capture with spurious tones and noise. Phase stability goals are given above. The sampler should Nyquist sample the 100-600 MHz band with at least 8-bit resolution and be capable of digitally transmitting the resulting samples over fiber optic lines; The VLBI parameter estimation software used to build the radiometric reference frames used for precise tracking relies on a Square Root Information Filter that makes use of Householder transformation techniques. These solutions often take several days of CPU on a modern workstation. Block matrix techniques have the potential to optimize the interaction of the CPU and cache memory thereby greatly reducing the CPU time needed for solutions. The goal is a factor of three improvement in total solution time for problems with 7 million data points and 500,000 parameters which include at least 5000 parameters that are active over the entire data set; Microwave radiometry of atmospheric emission lines (22 GHz H20, 60 GHz O2) has been successful in demonstrating 1 mm level calibration of tropospheric path delay. However, the usefulness of this technique has been limited by the large mass and size of the instrument packages. Identifying/developing low mass, low cost implementations of this technique without significantly sacrificing accuracy would greatly enhance precise tracking; Develop low mass, (Less than 1 kg) low cost onboard radio frequency standards for generating highly phase-stable onboard radio signals which achieve Allan standard deviations of 1 x 10-15 at 1000 seconds and drift of less than 10-15/day; Develop innovative tracking technologies using new wavelengths (X-ray, Infra-red, etc.), such as systems using celestial and planetary emissions and reflections (not limited to the visible spectrum) that can produce three-dimensional absolute and relative position and velocity in regions where Earth-based GPS measurements are not available, The technologies can exploit either ground based or on-board techniques; Develop innovative technologies for improving the state of the art in terms of cost and performance in making spacecraft-to-spacecraft measurements, such as omni-directional range and bearing sensors and robotic-vision-based systems; and Develop innovative navigation algorithms and software supporting analysis, design, and mission operations that will reduce operations costs and support multiple systems in simultaneous, tightly-coupled, non-quiescent operations, such as robotic servicing and formation flying.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.03Communiction for Space-Based Range, GSFC," AFRC, KSC, MSFC","Metric tracking of launch vehicles for range safety purposes is currently based on redundant radars, telemetry receivers, and uplink command transmitters at the launch site with additional assets deployed downrange in order to maintain line of sight communications with the vehicle as it passes over the horizon to orbital insertion. The vision of space-based range architecture is to assure public safety, cut the costs of launch operations, decrease response time, and improve geographic and temporal flexibility by reducing or eliminating these assets. In order to achieve this, a number of advancements in tracking and telemetry are required. Some of NASA's needs are: GPS/IMU Metric Tracking and Autonomous Systems Realization of a space-based range requires development of GPS receivers that incorporate: (a) low power consumption, (b) low mass/volume, (c) compliance with range safety standards, (d) flexible tracking loop programmability, (e) programmable output formats, and (f) operability in high G environments. Other highly desirable GPS specific characteristics include open architecture supported by development software and the capability of being incorporated onto circuit boards designed for multiple functions. Tactical grade IMUs are needed which can function on spin stabilized rockets (up to 7 rps) and reliably function during sudden jerk and acceleration associated with launch and engine firings and can be coupled with GPS receivers. Also needed are approaches to processing the outputs of navigation sensors and combining them with rule-based systems for autonomous navigation and termination decision making. Space Based Telemetry Small, lightweight, low cost transceivers capable of establishing satellite communications links for telemetry and control during the launch and assent stages of flight are required to provide unbroken communications throughout the launch phase. These may enable use of the NASA TDRSS; or commercial communications satellites. Techniques for multiplexing narrow bandwidth channels to permit increased bit rates and improved algorithms for ensuring smooth transition of support between communications satellites are also needed. GPS Attitude Determination for Launch Vehicles Investigate using inexpensive arrays of GPS antennas and receivers on small expendable launch vehicles to determine the attitude angles and their rates of change as an alternative to traditional inertial measurement units. The system should be contained entirely on the vehicle and not rely on ground-based processing. The attitude accuracy should be comparable to gyroscope-based systems and should be free of drift and gimble lock. The system must be able to maintain attitude output during periods of high dynamics and erratic flight. The attitude must be determined at a rate of least 10 Hz with minimal processing delay and must be output in a format compatible with vehicle telemetry systems. Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.04Antenna Technology, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC, MSFC","NASA seeks advanced antenna systems for use in spacecraft and planetary surface vehicles used in science, exploration systems, and space operations missions. Future manned missions to the Moon and Mars will have stringent communication requirements. Highly robust communication networks will be established in the vicinity of the planet to support long-term human interplanetary mission. Such networks will consist of a large number of communication links that connect the various network nodes. Some of these nodes must also maintain continuous high data rate communication links between the Moon and the Earth. Great demands will be placed upon these communication systems to assure crew safety, robustness in harsh environments, and high reliability for long-duration manned missions. Areas of interest include lightweight deployable antenna systems, high-gain antenna architectures, multi-frequency and dual polarized antennas, self-orienting systems, reconfigurable antennas, and novel concepts such as antennas that can adapt to failed components without compromising performance and operability (e.g., smart antennas). NASA seeks to develop a lightweight, scanning, phased array antenna system that enables assured communication links for human interplanetary exploration. Large inflatable membrane antennas to significantly reduce stowage volume, provide high deployment reliability, and significantly reduced mass (i.e. High efficiency, miniature antennas with smaller than lambda square aperture size, to provide astronauts and robotics communications for surface-to-surface and surface-to-orbit for lunar, Mars, and planetary exploration missions. Recent antenna research and development has shown that it is possible to design and build aperture antennas with smaller than the minimum effective aperture sizes of dipoles. This new class of antennas can provide higher antenna gains (>2.5 dBi) than a dipole antenna in much smaller aperture sizes ( The architecture for lunar exploration is expected to involve a layered communications and navigation network. This network may include lunar vicinity relay satellites at L1 and L2 Lagrange points as well as lunar polar orbiting satellites. The lunar proximity network must be able to access dedicated assets, such as Malapert Station, and eventually include human assets, such as crewed rovers, as relay nodes. Consequently, there is interest in antenna technologies that enable low-cost but reliable, reconfigurable, and agile antennas at frequencies up to 38 GHz. Another component technology that shows high interest in the area of Earth and planet science is thin-membrane, mountable T/R modules, phase shifters, beam former, control circuitry, etc. for future deployable/inflatable, large-aperture, phased array application. This topic seeks novel smart antenna concepts that address the aforementioned requirements. There is also interest in space-to-surface links at 25.5 GHz and 37 GHz. The size of reflector antennas is limited by the accuracy of the reflector surface that can be achieved and maintained on-orbit. Development of special materials and structural techniques to control their environment, etc., reduces environmentally-induced surface errors and increases the maximum useable reflector size. Distortions caused by thermal gradients are inherently a large-scale phenomenon. The reflector surface is usually sufficiently accurate over substantially large local areas but these areas are not on the same desired parabolic surface. An array of feed elements can be designed to illuminate the reflector with a distorted spherical wave. This distortion can be used to compensate for large-scale surface errors induced by thermal gradients, gravitational and other forces, and manufacturing processes. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: compensating feed system for an antenna reflector surface with large-scale distortions; techniques for the remote measurement of satellite antenna profile errors; determination of orbiting S/C antenna distortion by ground-based measurements; measuring and compensating antenna thermal distortions; reflector measurements and corrections using arrays; reflector distortion measurement and compensation using array feeds. NASA is interested in low-cost phased array antennas for suborbital vehicles such as sounding rockets, balloons, UAV's, and expendable vehicles. The frequencies of interest are S band, Ku band, and Ka band. The arrays are required to be aerodynamic in shape for the sounding rockets, UAVs, and expendable platforms. The balloon vehicles primarily communicate with TDRS and can tolerate a wide range of mechanical dimensions. Finally, antenna pointing techniques and technologies for Ka-band spacecraft antennas that can provide spacecraft knowledge with sub-milliradian precision (e.g., Read less>>"
Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.05Antenna Array Transmission Techniques, JPL, GRC,"NASA is designing arrays of ground-based antennas to serve the telecommunications needs of future space exploration. Medium-size (12m class) antennas have been selected for receiving, and arrays of hundreds of them are expected to be required. Applications include communication with distant spacecraft; radar studies of solar system objects; radio astronomy; and perhaps other scientific uses. A significant challenge is the implementation of an array for transmitting (uplinking), which may or may not use the same antennas that are used for receiving. The uplink frequency will be in the 7.1-8.6 GHz band (X-band) in the near term and may be in the 31.5-33.0 GHz band (Ka Band) in the future; it will likely carry digital modulation at rates from 10 kbps to 30 Mbps. An EIRP of at least 500 GW is required, and some applications contemplate an EIRP as high as 10 TW. It is also desirable to support as many as ten simultaneously-operating deep-space missions from one complex on Earth, and to have at least three geographically separated complexes so communication is possible with a given spacecraft at any time of the day. The major open questions in the uplink array design are:Minimizing the life-cycle cost of an array that produces a given EIRP by selecting the optimum combination of antenna size, transmitter power, and number of antennas. This becomes much more difficult if the option of using the same antenna for both uplink and downlink is considered; Identifying/developing low-cost, highly reliable, easily serviceable components for key systems. This could include highly integrated RF and digital signal processing electronics, including mixed-signal ASICs. It could also include low-cost, high-volume antenna manufacturing techniques. (For the receiving array, another key component is a cryogenic refrigerator for the 15-25K range.) Also, low-cost transmitters (including medium-power (of the order of 100s of Watts) amplifiers are key; Phase calibration techniques are required to ensure coherent addition of the signals from individual antennas at the spacecraft. It is important to understand whether space-based techniques are required or ground-based techniques are adequate. In general, a target spacecraft in deep space cannot be used for calibration because of the long round-trip communication delay; Design of ultra phase-stable electronics to maintain the relative phase among antennas. These will minimize the need for continuous, extensive and/or disruptive calibrations; Understanding the effect of the medium (primarily the Earth's troposphere) on the coherence of the signals at the target spacecraft. Generally, turbulence in the medium tends to disrupt the coherence in a way that is time-dependent and site-dependent. A quantitative understanding of this is needed; and Techniques for integrating a very low-noise, cryogenically-cooled receiver with medium power (1W to 200W) transmitter. If transmitting and receiving are combined on the same antenna, the performance of each should be compromised as little as possible while maintaining low cost and high reliability.Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware demonstration that will, when appropriate, deliver a demonstration unit for testing at the completion of the Phase 2 contract.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.06Reconfigurable/Reprogrammable Communication Systems, GRC," GSFC, JPL, JSC, MSFC","NASA seeks novel approaches in reconfigurable, reprogrammable communication systems to enable the vision of Space, Exploration, Science, and Aeronautical Systems. Exploration of Martian and lunar environments will require advancements in communication systems to manage the demands of the harsh space environment on space electronics, maintain flexibility and adaptability to changing needs and requirements, and provide flexibility and survivability due to increased mission durations. NASA missions can have vastly different transceiver requirements (e.g. 1's to 10's Mbps at UHF and S-band frequency bands up to 10's to 1000's Mbps at X, and Ka-band frequency bands.) and available resources depending on the science objective, operating environment, and spacecraft resources. For example, deep space missions are often power constrained; operating over large distances, and subsequently have lower data transmission rates when compared to near-Earth or near-planetary satellites. These requirements and resource limitations are known prior to launch; therefore, the scalability feature can be used to maximize transceiver efficiency while minimizing resources consumed. Larger platforms, such as vehicles or relay spacecraft, may provide more resources but may also be expected to perform more complex functions or support multiple and simultaneous communication links to a diverse set of assets. This solicitation seeks advancements in reconfigurable transceivers and associated component technologies. The goal of the subtopic is to provide flexible, reconfigurable communications capability while minimizing on-board resources and cost. Topics of interest include the development of software-defined radios or radio subsystems that demonstrate reconfigurability, flexibility, reduced power consumption of digital signal processing systems, increased performance and bandwidth, reduced software qualification cost, and error detection and mitigation technologies. Complex reconfigurable systems will provide multiple channel and multiple and simultaneous waveforms. Areas of interest to develop and/or demonstrate are as follows:Advancements in bandwidth capacity, reduced resource consumption, or adherence to standard and open hardware and software interfaces. Techniques should include fault tolerant, reliable software execution, reprogrammable digital signal processing devices; Reconfigurable software and firmware that provide access control, authentication, and data integrity checks of the reconfiguration process including partial reconfiguration, which allows simultaneous operation and upload of new waveforms or functions; Operator or automated reconfiguration, or waveform load detection failure, and the ability to provide access back to a known, reliable operational state. An automated restore capability ensures the system can revert to a baseline configuration, thereby avoiding permanent communications loss due to an errant reconfiguration process or logic upset; Dynamic or distributed on-board processing architectures to provide reconfigurability and processing capacity. For example, demonstrate technologies to enable a common processing system capacity for communications, science, and health monitoring; Adaptive modulation and waveform recognition techniques are desired to enable transceivers to exchange waveforms with other assets automatically or through ground control; Low overhead, low complexity hardware and software architectures to enable hardware or software component or design reuse (e.g., software portability) to demonstrate cost or time savings. Emphasis is on the application of open standard architectures to facilitate interoperability among different vendors and to minimize the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software components; Software tools or tool chain methodologies that enable both design and software modeling and code reuse, and advancements in optimized code generation for digital signal processing systems; The use of reconfigurable logic devices in software-defined radios is expected to increase in the future to provide reconfigurability and on-orbit flexibility for waveforms and applications. As the densities of these devices continues to increase, and size decreases, the susceptibility of the electronics to single event effects also increases. Novel approaches are sought to mitigate single event effects in reconfigurable logic caused by charged particles, thereby improving reliability. New methods may show advancements in reduced cost, power consumption, or complexity compared to traditional approaches (i.e., voting schemes and constant updates {e.g., scrubbing}). Techniques and implementations to provide a core capability within the software-defined radio in the event of failure or disruption of the primary waveform and/or system hardware. Communication loss should be detected and core capability (e.g., ""gold"" waveform code) is automatically executed to provide access control and restore operation; Innovative solutions to software-defined radio implementations that reduce power consumption and mass. Solutions should enable future hardware scalability among different mission classes (e.g., low-rate, deep space to moderate or high-rate near planetary, or relay spacecraft) and should promote modularity and common, open interfaces; and In component technology, advancements in analog-to-digital converters or digital-to-analog converters to increase sampling and resolution capabilities; novel techniques to increase memory densities; and advancements in processing and reconfigurable logic technology, each reducing power consumption and improving performance in harsh environments.

Space Operations,Topic O1 Space Communications ,O1.07Extravehicular (EVA) Radios, JSC, GRC,"Human exploration of the Martian environment demands radio technology that tolerates extreme conditions. The harsh environment of the Martian atmosphere contains not only increased radiation, which is damaging to semiconductors, but also dust and ionic storms, which are disruptive to communications. Frequency agility will be necessary during periods of disruption due to these storms. Small volume and low mass are always sought for any space mission; they are critical for systems embedded in EVA spacesuits, which seek to enhance the astronaut's mobility on the planet's surface. The focus of this activity is to develop radio methodologies that ensure increased reliability and fault-tolerance in the processor electronics and performance of EVA radios for human interplanetary missions. Exploring unknown worlds with unforeseeable threats is understandably stressful for the most intrepid astronaut. By providing a system that is even less likely to fail and easier to use, this can be mitigated. In a human exploration mission, loss of communications is not merely inconvenient; it can be deadly. The radio systems design must reflect the very special human factors requirements imposed by the mission and the protective spacesuit. While these latter provide a pressurized atmosphere, temperature control, protection from micrometeroids, communications, and a myriad of other functions essential to the survival of an astronaut, the best designs add bulk and inhibit natural movements. EVA radio systems must be designed to be easily operable in any circumstance. This solicitation seeks to develop an EVA radio that notionally consists of limited front-end complexity hardware combined with a signal processing back end while minimizing traditional radio analog system components in order to maintain waveform flexibility and reconfigurability. The communication bands of interest are the space allocations from UHF to Ka; the precise band used will be dictated by bandwidth needs and the specific application. The radio should support multiple bandwidths of data transmission to support telemetry, voice, and video, and should have automatic adaptive techniques to handle changing propagation and interference. The radio should have an upper mass limit of 300g, a peak transmission power of 5W, and a receive mode which consumes no more than 10 mW. Additionally, this radio must be configurable for many applications, with a goal of reducing radio inventory management. Ka-band is the most appropriate for high data rate video links, while UHF bands can be used for low-rate telemetry and voice applications. Operational scenarios will dictate the exact requirements, but it is envisioned that EVA radios will need to transmit both audio and video to surface rovers, landers, and habitats. An EVA-Ka proximity link will be needed to track the rover should it travel outside the astronaut's field of view. Astronauts will need to communicate with each other while performing maintenance or service tasks either on the ground or in orbit, so an EVA-to-EVA video link will be needed. It is possible that the EVA radio will need the capability to relay communications through a satellite to maintain constant contact with landers, habitats, or astronauts that are obscured or whose signals are otherwise blocked. Ideally, one radio type will be suitable for many applications, without extensive configuration efforts, through the use of automatic self-configuration or adaptation to the application environment. It is intended that the dual goals of flexibility and survivability can be met with a modular architecture and operational paradigm. New and innovative solutions are sought that provide provable performance and survivability improvements. The radio should underscore design of both hardware and software for failure tolerance and slow and soft degradation upon component or gate failure. Operation should be maintained following any single point failure in a discrete component or logic gate, even if in diminished capacity. Handling multiple failures with degradation is preferred. Methods that address space hardening of critical components are envisioned. Designs should also consider fallback schemes where the goal is to maintain communications even at the cost of quality, bandwidth, or functionality Phase 1: The Phase 1 proposal should address the technical challenges posed by the design considerations enumerated above. During the Phase 1 effort, the EVA radio requirements definition, the initial design, and the method of testing the EVA radio will be developed. Because testing needs to include both ground testing and space testing, the proposal should address both of these elements as well as the proposed migration path between the two. Deliverables should include a prototype simulation of the design demonstrating the EVA radio's ability to reconfigure between bands/applications and a hardware prototype demonstrating some degree of fault survivability or reconfiguration. Phase 2: During Phase 2, prototype integrated hardware and software comprising the EVA radio will be developed, finalized, and tested based on the designs developed in Phase 1. Design changes will be finalized in this phase as a result of testing according to the guidelines developed in Phase 1. Phase 3: EVA radios suitable for early lunar missions will be fabricated, tested, and demonstrated according to the testing guidelines developed in Phase 1 and the prototypes fabricated in Phase 2. Commercialization: Fire, police, and other civil and law enforcement agencies would benefit from radios that could be reconfigured on-the-fly to interoperate with each other. Currently, police and fire officials must usually be routed through a central hub and precious time is lost in the attempt to communicate between agencies. Major disasters have shown a need for a universal communication system that is adaptable. Read less>>"

Research focuses on (but is not limited to) the following areas:Use of quantum entanglement or innovative breakthroughs in quantum information physics to specifically address curious effects and critical unknowns relevant to revolutionary improvements in communicating data, information, or knowledge between independent entities across space-time. Methods or techniques that demonstrate extremely novel means of effectively packaging, storing, encrypting (e.g., quantum key distribution), and/or transferring information or knowledge in space-to-space or space-to-ground links; Innovative methods of using X-ray or radio pulsar signals for precise navigation or positioning of spacecraft. Small, low mass, reliable detectors, improvements in position accuracy, digital signal processing advances for time of arrival, drift estimation, and position estimation; Development of nano-scale communication devices and systems (e.g., FET arrays, nano-antennas, nano-transceivers, etc.) for nano-spacecraft applications; RF Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices. MEMS devices have low spatial volume, are lightweight, and have low-power consumption, making them attractive to operate as high Q components and perform frequency selectivity (i.e., agile pre-selectors, multi-couplers, and diplexers). Selectivity, or Q, for band pass filters currently comes at an unacceptably high penalty in size and mass. At present, most high rejection diplexers for space-based radios are quite large. To build and design high performance, tightly coupled, low volume space radios, compact selectivity-determining devices are a critical enabler. Most high Q filters above 400MHz, such as inter-digital filters and others involving resonant cavities, are wholly mechanical assemblies which can be ""folded"" in their design and lend themselves to micro machining techniques; and Other areas of investigation to consider lie within the area between MEMS and micro-machined devices, including electromechanically tuned filters, 3D micro-machined RF resonators, filter configurations consisting of cantilevered structures, as well as carbon nano-tube waveguides.

The necessary optical tracking algorithms will be developed and modeled, with an emphasis on a robust automated tracking capability in the presence of smoke, clouds, or haze. The camera locations may be either land or sea based, or mounted on aerial vehicles, or some combination of all three. The initial investigation will determine the maximum downrange tracking distance, the tracking errors as a function of downrange distance, the processing speed, and the means for transmitting analyzed data to the command center. Tracking and Identification of 3D Tumbling Objects Develop techniques to track and construct 3-dimensional views of tumbling objects in the atmosphere or space using digital optical tracking images for a variety of missions. These views will be used to determine the objects' approximate geometric sizes and shapes. The potential application is to help track and identify debris quickly after an accident or flight anomaly. The data will be provided by sequential digital images from one or more tracking cameras, ideally operating autonomously. The goal is to track and identify between 50 to 100 objects with typical cross-sections varying from tens of square meters down to one square meter or less within several minutes after an accident. The initial investigation will determine the minimum size that can be imaged using current technology, the probability of correctly estimating an object's size and shape, the processing speed, and the means for transmitting analyzed data to the command center.

Space Operations,Topic O2 Space Transportaion ,O2.02Space Transportation Test Requirements and Instrumentation, SSC," GRC, MSFC","Ground testing of propulsion systems is a critical requirement to enable NASA's New Vision for Exploration announced by President Bush. Relevant ground testing technologies and capabilities are crucial to the Development, Qualification, and Acceptance process of validating cargo launch vehicles and Human Rated Vehicles including Crew Exploration Vehicles (CEV), CEV Launch Systems, Cargo Launch Systems, and Lunar Surface Access Modules propulsion systems. The ability to quickly and efficiently perform system certification greatly impacts all space programs. While hydrocarbon engines have not been officially selected as the next generation of launch vehicle propulsion systems, it is widely agreed that a return to hydrocarbon propellants is necessary to achieve the heavy lift capability required by these programs. Engine Plume Sensors and Modeling Engine plume in situ remote measurements during ground testing can provide information on the engine health and the engine performance as well as concentrations of environmentally sensitive species without disturbing the engine testing. In particular, since hydrocarbon fueled rocket engine plumes contain carbon soot because of fuel-rich combustion, soot measurements and modeling are very important. Rocket plume sensors must be able to detect gas species, temperature, and velocity for hydrocarbons (kerosene), and hybrid fuels. Innovative sensors are required for measuring flow rate, temperature, pressure, rocket engine plume constituents, and effluent gas detection. Sensors must not physically intrude into the measurement space. High accuracy (0.2%), low-millisecond to sub-millisecond response time is required. Temperature sensors must be able to measure both cryogenic and high temperature fluids under high pressure (up to 15,000 psi) and high flow rate conditions (82 ft/sec). Response time must be on the order of a few milliseconds to sub-milliseconds. Innovative methods in phenomenology, modeling, sensors, and instrumentation for the prediction, characterization, and measurement of rocket engine combustion instability are of interest. Sensor systems should have bandwidth capabilities in excess of 100 kHz. Emphasis is on development of optical-based sensor systems that will be non-intrusive in the test article hardware or exhaust plume. Sensors must support integration with Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM) technologies. Engine Acoustic Energy Prediction and Sensing The high levels of acoustic energy generated by rocket engines can be destructive to both launch vehicles and ground test/launch facilities. Current acoustic energy prediction methods can only provide a rough order of magnitude estimate of the amount of acoustic energy that a rocket engine will generate. Consequently, facilities and vehicles may be unnecessarily over designed to withstand the higher predictions, adding unnecessary weight and complexity. New and innovative acoustic measurement techniques and sensors are necessary to accurately measure and predict the rocket plume acoustic environment. Current methods of predicting far-field and near-field acoustic levels produced by rocket engines rely on empirical models and require numerous physical measurements. New and innovative acoustic prediction methods are required that can accurately predict the acoustic levels a priori or using fewer measurements. New, innovative techniques based on energy density measurements rather than pressure measurements show promise as replacements for the older models. Computational and Modeling Tools and Methods The wide range of pressures, flow rates, and temperatures associated with rocket propulsion systems result in complex dynamics. It is not realistic to physically test each component and the component-to-component interaction in all states before designing a system. Consequently, systems must be tuned after fabrication, requiring extensive testing and often component redesign. Tools and methods are necessary that will allow the use of computational methods to accurately model and predict system performance. Development of tools that integrate simple operator interfaces with detailed design and/or analysis software for modeling and enhancing the flow performance of flow system components such as valves, check valves, pressure regulators, flow meters, cavitating venturis, and propellant run tanks. In addition, new and improved methods to accurately model the transient interaction between cryogenic fluid flow and immersed sensors that predict the dynamic load on the sensors, frequency spectrum, heat transfer, and effect on the flow field are needed. Propulsion System Exhaust Plume Flow Field Definition and Associated Plume Induced Environments (PIE) An accurate definition of a propulsion system exhaust plume flow field and its associated PIE are required to support the design efforts necessary to safely and optimally accomplish many phases of any space flight mission from sea level or simulated altitude testing of a propulsion system to landing on and returning from the Moon or Mars.

Science,Topic S1 Robotic Exploration of the Moon and Mars ,S1.01Detection and Reduction of Biological Contamination on Flight Hardware, JPL, ARC,"As solar system exploration continues, NASA remains committed to the implementation of its planetary protection policy and regulations. A Mars sample return mission is being planned for the next decade. Other missions will seek evidence of life through in situ investigations far from Earth. One of the great challenges, therefore, is to develop or find the technologies or system approaches that will make compliance with planetary protection policy routine and affordable. Planetary protection is directed to 1) the control of terrestrial microbial contamination associated with robotic space vehicles intended to land, orbit, flyby, or otherwise be in the vicinity of extraterrestrial solar system bodies, and 2) the control of contamination of the Earth by extraterrestrial solar system material collected and returned by such missions. The implementation of these requirements will ensure that biological safeguards, to maintain extraterrestrial bodies as biological preserves for scientific investigations, are being followed in NASA's space program. Methods for the detection and reduction of biological contamination are also frequently applicable to non-biological particulate and molecular contamination. To fulfill its commitment, NASA seeks technologies and systems approaches that will support mission compliance with planetary protection requirements. Examples of such technologies include:Techniques for cleaning of organics to the level of nanograms per square centimeter on complex surfaces (nondestructively and without residues) and for validation of cleanliness at this level or better; Nonabrasive cleaning techniques for narrow aperture occluded areas on spacecraft; Techniques for in situ (i.e., at the exploration site) cleaning and sterilization to prevent cross-contamination between planetary surface samples; Nondestructive and highly efficient sampling methods for detection of the remnants of microbial, particles, and molecular contamination on cleaned spacecraft surfaces; Methodology for the quantitative detection of viable microbial cells in the interior of non-metallic space-craft materials; Rapid cleaning validation methods with ultra high sensitivity for the major classes of biomolecules: proteins, amino acids, DNA/RNA, lipids, polysaccharides, etc.; A device or methodology for controlled measurement of microbial reduction at temperatures from 200-300°C to enable generation of microbial lethality curves. Rapid ramp-up and cool-down rates are critical to minimize the microbial killing that occurs during the ramp periods; Device or methodology for direct observation and evaluation of particles and biological contamination on spacecraft parts; Device or methodology for quantitative and homogeneous deposition of particles, microbial cells, and bio-molecules on material surfaces for cleaning, sampling, and contamination transport studies; System design concepts to enable facile and rapid use of cleaning and sterilization technologies during flight hardware assembly; System design concepts to maintain the integrity of cleaned and sterilized complex flight systems and/or subsystems; and System concepts that would facilitate spacecraft sterilization at the system level just before launch or in flight.Research should be conducted to demonstrate technical feasibility during Phase 1 and to show a path toward a Phase 2 hardware and software demonstration.

Science,Topic S3 Astronomical Observatories to Seek Earth-like Extrasolar Planets and Environments ,S3.02High Contrast Astrophysical Imaging, JPL, ARC,"This subtopic addresses the unique problem of imaging and spectroscopic characterization of faint astrophysical objects that are located within the obscuring glare of much brighter stellar sources. Examples include, planetary systems beyond our own and the detailed inner structure of galaxies with very bright nuclei. Contrast ratios of one million to one billion over an angular spatial scale of 0.05-1.5 arcsec are typical of these objects. Achieving a very low background against which to detect a planet requires control of both scattered and diffracted light. The failure to control either amplitude or phase fluctuations in the optical train severely reduces the effectiveness of any starlight cancellation scheme. This innovative research focuses on advances in coronagraphic instruments, interferometric starlight cancellation instruments, and potential occulting technologies that operate at visible and infrared wavelengths. The ultimate application of these instruments is to operate in space as part of a future observatory mission. Much of the scientific instrumentation used in future NASA observatories for the Origins Program theme will be similar in character to instruments used for present day space astrophysical observations. The performance and observing efficiency of these instruments, however, must be greatly enhanced. The instrument components are expected to offer much higher optical throughput, larger fields of view, and better detector performance. The wavelengths of primary interest extend from the visible to the thermal infrared. Measurement techniques include imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, coronography, and polarimetry. There is interest in component development, and innovative instrument design, as well as in the fabrication of subsystem devices to include, but are not limited to, the following areas: Starlight Suppression TechnologiesAdvanced starlight canceling coronagraphic instrument concepts; Advanced aperture apodization and aperture shaping techniques; Pupil plane masks for interferometry; Advanced apodization mask or occulting spot fabrication technology controlling smooth density gradients to 10-4 with spatial resolutions ~1 µm; Metrology for detailed evaluation of compact, deep density apodizing masks, Lyot stops, and other types of graded and binary mask elements. Development of a system to measure spatial optical density, phase inhomogeneity, scattering, spectral dispersion, thermal variations, and to otherwise estimate the accuracy of masks and stops is needed; Interferometric starlight cancellation instruments and techniques to include aperture synthesis and single input beam combination strategies; Fiber optic spatial filter development for visible coronagraph wavelengths; Single mode fiber filtering from visible to 20-µm wavelength; Methods of polarization control and polarization apodization; and Components and methods to insure amplitude uniformity in both coronagraphs and interferometers, specifically materials, processes, and metrology to insure coating uniformity. Wavefront Control TechnologiesDevelopment of small stroke, high precision, deformable mirrors (DM) and associated driving electronics scalable to 104 or more actuators (both to further the state-of-the-art towards flight-like hardware and to explore novel concepts). Multiple DM technologies in various phases of development and processes are encouraged to ultimately improve the state-of-the-art in deformable mirror technology. Process improvements are needed to improve repeatability, yield, and performance precision of current devices; Reliability and qualification of actuators and structures in deformable mirrors to eliminate or mitigate single actuator failures; Multiplexer development for electrical connection to deformable mirrors that has ultra-low power dissipation. The most promising DM technology may be sensitive to temperature, so developing a MUX that has very low thermal hot spots, and very uniform temperature performance will improve the control of the mirror surface; and High precision wavefront error sensing and control techniques to improve and advance coronagraphic imaging performance.

A new generation of large, stratospheric balloons, based on advanced balloon envelope technologies, will be able to deliver payloads of several thousand kilograms to above 99.9% of the Earth's absorbing atmosphere and maintain them there for months of continuous observation. NASA is seeking innovative and cost-effective solutions in support of terrestrial balloons in the following areas:Innovative concepts for reducing the UV degradation of flight components including balloon membranes, load carrying members, and parachute components; Innovative concepts for the measurement of strain in a thin film during flight; Innovative sensor concepts for balloon gas or skin temperature measurements; Innovative concepts for trajectory control and/or station keeping for effectively maneuvering large terrestrial balloons in either the horizontal latitude or vertical altitude plane or both; Innovative low-mass, high-density, and high-efficiency power systems for terrestrial balloons that produce 2 kW or more continuously; Innovative power systems that enable long duration, sunlight independent missions for durations of 30 days or more; Innovative floatation systems for water recovery of payloads; Innovative guided or gliding parachutes systems for use in thin atmospheres; Innovative balloon design concepts for long duration missions that can provide any or all of the following: reduced material strength requirements, increased reliability, enhanced performance, reduced manufacturing time, reduced manufacturing cost, or improved mission flexibility; and Smaller scale, but similarly designed, balloons and airships will also carry scientific payloads on Mars, Venus, Titan, and the outer planets in order to investigate their atmospheres in situ and their surfaces from close proximity. Their envelopes will be subject to extreme environments and must support missions with a range of durations. Proposals are sought in the following areas: Aerobot Surface Sample Acquisition Device NASA is soliciting concepts and prototypes for surface sample acquisition devices that can be used on aerobots to collect icy material from Titan and Mars. Typical sample volumes range from 1 to 2 cubic centimeters, with preference for a solid ice core as well as possible granular material. Collection depths of 0 to 2 cm are desired. Preferred techniques do not require close proximity of the aerobot balloon skin to the ground to reduce the probability of damaging the vehicle during sample acquisition. Examples include tethered collection devices deployed from modest altitudes (10s to 100s of meters) or short duration ""touch and go"" sampling from directional and/or altitude controlled aerobots. Proposed devices can be disposable (single use), but if reusable must avoid cross-contamination between samples. All devices must include solid sample transfer functionality to an analysis chamber on the aerobot itself. Concepts will be preferred that feature low mass (few kilograms or less), small volume (~1 liter) and low electrical power consumption drawn from the aerobot ( Apex Valve for Montgolfiere Balloons Solar-heated Montgolfiere balloons are an attractive platform for the exploration of Mars, particularly the polar regions which experience long periods of solar illumination during summer solstice. These balloons can be altitude controlled through selective venting of the heated gas through a valve located at the apex of the balloon. Proposals are sought for concepts and prototypes for this valve to be used on a solar-heated balloon on Mars. Typical specifications include large flow area (10 m2), low mass (few kilograms), packaged into a small volume for transport to Mars (3) and consume minimal electrical energy ( Aerial Deployment Modeling Tool Planetary aerobots at Mars, Titan, and Venus will likely be aerially deployed and inflated during parachute descent after arrival at the destination. Proposals are sought that would provide computer modeling tools that can simulate this complex process. Of particular importance is the ability to model the balloon shape and material stresses as a function of time, taking into account the aerodynamic forces generated by the parachute and by the uninflated or partially inflated balloon, as well as transient loads during balloon deployment from its storage container. The balloons can be either polymer films or polymer film plus reinforcing fabric laminates. Metal Bellows for High Temperature Venus Balloons Cylindrically-shaped metal bellows are a potential solution to the problem of making balloons that can tolerate the 460°C temperatures near the surface of Venus. Commercial off-the-shelf metal bellows are limited in diameter to approximately 0.4 m.

Missions to study the Earth and Sun, the other solar system planets and objects, and the origins and fate of the universe are proposed to operate from low Earth orbit to L2 or drift-away trajectories depending on their system of study and environmental requirements. Among other areas of study, future planet finder missions will require lightweight optical apertures of tens of square meters with sub-nanometer surface figure errors.

Although the relative value of the improvements may differ among the four energy regions, many of the parameters where improvements are needed are present in all four bands. In particular, all bands need improvements in spatial and spectral resolutions in the ability to cover large areas and in the ability to support the readout of the thousands to millions of resultant spatial resolution elements. Innovative technologies are sought to enhance the scope, efficiency, and resolution of instrument systems at all energies and wavelengths:The next generation of gravitational missions will require greatly improved inertial sensors. Such an inertial sensor must provide a carefully fabricated test mass, which has interactions with external forces (i.e., low magnetic susceptibility, high degree of symmetry, low variation in electrostatic surface potential, etc.) below 10-16 of the Earth's gravity, over time scales from several seconds to several hours. The inertial sensor must also provide a housing for containing the proof mass in a suitable environment (i.e., high vacuum, low magnetic and electrostatic potentials, etc.); Advanced Charged Couple Device (CCD) detectors, including improvements in UV quantum efficiency and read noise, to increase the limiting sensitivity in long exposures and improved radiation tolerance. Electron-bombarded CCD detectors, including improvements in efficiency, resolution, and global and local count rate capability. In the X-ray, we seek to extend the response to lower energies in some CCDs, and to higher, perhaps up to 50 keV, in others; Significant improvements in wide band gap (such as GaN and AlGaN) materials, individual detectors, and arrays for UV applications; Improved microchannel plate detectors, including improvements to the plates themselves (smaller pores, greater lifetimes, alternative fabrication technologies, e.g., silicon), as well as improvements to the associated electronic readout systems (spatial resolution, signal-to-noise capability, and dynamic range), and in sealed tube fabrication yield; Imaging from low-Earth orbit of air fluorescence, UV light generated by giant airshowers by ultra-high energy (E >1019 eV) cosmic rays require the development of high sensitivity and efficiency detection of 300-400 nm UV photons to measure signals at the few photon (single photo-electron) level. A secondary goal minimizes the sensitivity to photons with a wavelength greater than 400 nm. High electronic gain (~106), low noise, fast time response (2 to 10 x 10 mm2.

The entire focal plane detector can be formed from smaller, individual sub-arrays; For advanced X-ray calorimetry improvements in several areas are needed, including: Superconducting electronics for cryogenic X-ray detectors such as SQUID-based amplifiers and their multiplexers for low impedance cryogenic sensors and superconducting single-electron transistors and their multiplexers for high impedance cryogenic sensors. Micromachining techniques that enhance the fabrication, energy resolution, or count rate capability of closely-packed arrays of X-ray calorimeters operating in the energy range from 0.1-10 keV; and Surface micromachining techniques for improving integration of X-ray calorimeters with read-out electronics in large-scale arrays. Improvements in readout electronics, including low-power ASICs and the associated high-density interconnects and component arrays to interface them to detector arrays; Superconducting tunnel junction devices and transition edge sensors for the UV and X-ray regions. For the UV, these offer a promising path to having ""three-dimensional"" arrays (spatial plus energy). Improvements in energy resolution, pixel count, count rate capability, and long wavelength rejection are of particular interest. We seek techniques for fabrication of close-packed arrays, with any requisite thermal isolation, and sensitive (SQUID or single electron transistor), fast, readout schemes and/or multiplexers; Arrays of CZT detectors of thickness 5-10 mm to cover the 10-500 keV range, and hybrid detector systems with a Si CCD over a CZT pixelated detector operating in the 2-150 keV range; For improvements to detector systems for solar and night-time UV and EUV (approx. 20-300nm) observing. the following areas are of interest: large format (4 K x 4 K and larger); high quantum efficiency; small pixel size; large well depth; low read noise; fast readout; low power consumption (including readout); intrinsic energy and/or polarization discrimination (3d or 4d detector); active pixel sensors (back-illumination, UV sensitivity); and high-resolution image intensifiers, UV and EUV sensitive, insensitive to moisture; Space spectroscopic observations in the UV, visible, and IR requiring long observation times would be much more sensitive with high quantum efficiency (QE) and zero read noise. Techniques are sought which improve the QE of photon counters, or eliminate the read noise of solid-state detectors; and X-ray and Gamma-ray imaging with higher sensitivity, dynamic range and angular resolution requires innovations in modulation collimators and detection devices.

Detection of gravitational waves would open a new astrophysical window on the universe with great potential for unexpected discoveries. A number of gravitational wave follow-on missions to LISA are also under study. The disturbance caused by the passage of a gravitational wave is expected to be very small (of order picometers) and will be measured with laser interferometry. The technology areas below deal with technical problems in these measurements. Because the systems will be deployed in space, the technologies to be considered must have credible paths toward space flight qualification. Background information on LISA, along with preliminary technology discussions, can be found in the Proceedings of the 5th International LISA Symposium,, Penn State University, 19-24 JULY 2002, published in the Classical and Quantum Gravity Journal, Vol 20, Number 10, 21 May 2003. Issues of Space Qualification of LISA Laser: the LISA laser must produce >1W CW of 1.06 micron light with fiber coupled output (for example, a combination of a lower-power master oscillator {eg, NPRO} with suitable amplifier). The laser will have the following characteristics:10 year lifetime; Power stability Linewidth This task will involve investigating the issues of space qualification of the system, experimentally studying the relevant problems, and proposing a realistic plan of development of this system. Given the magnitude of the effort to develop a space qualified LISA laser, it is not expected that the outcome of this task will result in a space qualified laser; rather, the outcome should be a sufficient understanding of the important technical issues in space qualification (e.g., diode lifetime, thermal and vibrational robustness, etc.) so that a clear path towards the development of a fully space qualified system can be identified.

Science,Topic S5 Sun - Solar System Connection ,S5.01Low Thrust and Propellantless Propulsion Technologies, MSFC," GRC, GSFC, JPL, JSC, LaRC","Spacecraft propulsion technology innovations are sought for upcoming deep-space science missions. Propulsion system functions for these missions include primary propulsion, maneuvering, planetary injection, and planetary descent and ascent. Innovations are needed to reduce spacecraft propulsion system mass, volume, and/or cost. Applicable propulsion technologies include advanced chemical, solar sails, aerocapture, and emerging technologies. Advanced Chemical Propulsion Innovations in low-thrust chemical propulsion system technologies are being sought for deep-space, scientific, robotic mission applications. Delta Vs for the missions of interest range from 1000 m/sec to 3000 m/sec. Technologies of interest are bipropellant engines with Isp greater than 360 seconds, both pressure-fed and pump-fed, with chamber pressures ranging from 100 to 500 psia. Throttling capability is desired for engines used for planetary ascent, descent, and orbit insertion maneuvers. Passive long-term storage (greater than 5 years) for advanced bipropellant propulsion systems for deep space missions are of interest. Reliable ignition systems are needed for non-hypergolic propellants. Activities in development of lightweight, compact, and low-power propellant management components, such as valves, flow control/regulation, fluid isolation, and lightweight tankage are also solicited. Advanced materials to allow development of systems for use with advanced bipropellants (higher Isp, higher pressure) are also solicited. Solar Sail Propulsion Solar sails have been studied for a variety of missions and have the potential to provide cost-effective, propellantless propulsion that enables longer on-station operation, increased scientific payload mass fraction, and access to previously inaccessible orbits (e.g., non-Keplerian, high solar latitudes, etc.). NASA missions enabled and enhanced by solar sail propulsion include those that can provide: 1) situational awareness for human and robotic exploration in the Earth-Moon system (e. g., Heliostorm, L1 Diamond); 2) comprehensive monitoring of the inner heliosphere (e.g., Solar Sentinels, Solar Polar Imager, Particle Acceleration Solar Observatory); and 3) pathfinder exploration beyond the solar system (Interstellar Probe). The technology required for these missions can further be classified into two categories: 1) near-term (2; and 2) far-term (>15 years) for use in orbits at 25 AU with a propulsive area of greater then 1 x 105 m2. A solar sail propulsion system includes the sail membrane and support structure, the thrust vector control subsystem, the health and monitoring diagnostic subsystem, and the launch stowage structure. Three parameters that are used as sail performance metrics in mission applications are: sail size, sail durability in its orbital environment, and areal density (ratio of sail system mass to propulsive area of the sail). In addition, important programmatic metrics are cost, benefit, and risk. Innovations are sought that will lower the cost and risk associated with sail system development through advancements in: manufacturing, fabrication, and assembly; durable lightweight materials, structures, and mechanisms; comprehensive simulations of maneuvering, navigation, trajectory control, propulsive performance, and operations; and integrated diagnostic health monitoring. Tether Technologies This effort focuses on technologies supporting innovative and advanced concepts for propellantless propulsion based upon space tethers concepts. The categories under Tether Technologies include, but are not limited to: ElectroDynamic (ED) tether propulsion, Momentum eXchange Electrodynamic Reboost (MXER) tethers or its subsystems, Jovian tether mission concepts, Earth orbiting telescope ED tether reboost, and other innovative in space tether technologies. In general, the electrodynamic tether propulsion method exchanges momentum with a planet's rotational angular momentum through electrodynamic interaction with the planetary magnetic field. Momentum exchange tethers or MXER concepts use orbital energy to provide a high thrust to a payload in LEO. Distinctive variations of existing propulsion methods or chief subsystem component improvements are also suitable for submission. Proposals should provide the development plan of specific innovative technologies or techniques supporting the planned research. Identification of the fundamental technology to be developed is also crucial. A clear plan for demonstrating feasibility, noting any test and experiment requirements, is recommended. Key to each idea is an unambiguous knowledge of past research/concepts conducted on related work and specifically how this new proposal differs from, or enhances, the existing tether roadmaps, particularly for robotic mission support. Aeroassist Aeroassist is a general term given to various techniques to maneuver a space vehicle within an atmosphere using aerodynamic forces in lieu of propulsive fuel. Aeroassist systems enable shorter interplanetary cruise times, increased payload mass, and reduced mission costs. Subsets of aeroassist are aerocapture and aerogravity assist. Aerocapture relies on the exchange of momentum with an atmosphere to achieve a decelerating thrust leading to orbit capture. This technique permits spacecraft to be launched from Earth at higher velocities, thus providing a shorter overall trip time. At the destination, the velocity is reduced by aerodynamic drag within the atmosphere. Without aerocapture, a substantial propulsion system would be needed on the spacecraft to perform the same reduction of velocity. Aerogravity assist is an extension of the established technique of gravity assist with a planetary body to achieve increases in interplanetary velocities. Aerogravity assist involves using propulsion in conjunction with aerodynamics through a planetary atmosphere to achieve a greater turning angle during planetary fly-by. In particular, this subtopic seeks technology innovations that are in the following areas: Aerocapture Thermal Protection Systems: development of advanced thermal protection systems and insulators for planetary aerocapture. Low Temperature/High Temperature Adhesives Trade Study: aerocapture inflatable decelerators are currently proposed to be manufactured from thin film materials and/or high temperature fabrics, stowed during transport, and inflated prior to atmospheric entry for aerocapture applications at planetary destinations.Prior to the aerocapture maneuver, the inflatable decelerator will be stowed for many years (up to 10) in an uncontrolled space environment (-130oC) during transport to outer solar system destinations; Before atmospheric entry, the inflatable decelerator will be unstowed and inflated; and During the aerocapture maneuver, up to 24 hours after the inflation process, the inflatable decelerator will experience temperatures to 500oC (or higher).Conduct a thorough study of the adhesives trade space and select and test adhesive candidates that will maintain bond strength during the temperature extremes and long-term space exposure experienced by inflatable decelerators. The product of this study will be a report thoroughly documenting sample preparation, test procedures, and test results of all materials investigated. This report will be disseminated to inflatable decelerator developers.Read less>>"

The resulting products will reduce the design margins and uncertainties in the induced environment definition (i.e., the environment in the presence of a spacecraft) and its effects on spacecraft design and operations. The environments to be considered include planetary-trapped radiation, solar proton events, cosmic rays, the plasma environment at planets and in the solar wind, magnetic fields, EUV/VUV, and the interplanetary meteoroid environment. The investigations selected have the opportunity to be integrated on the Space Environment Testbed (SET) Carrier. The SET Project opportunities for flight will be in orbits other than LEO. Investigations do not need to fly with the SET Carrier if an investigator makes arrangements for other access to space. Examples of investigations and models that would satisfy those requirements are described below. A more detailed description, with examples of investigation needs, can be found at: http://lws-set.gsfc.nasa.gov/Opportunities.htm. Areas for which proposals are sought include:Characterization of the space environment, both natural and induced, in the vicinity of a spacecraft; Definition of the mechanisms for material and materials applications degradation and the performance characterization of materials (such as coatings, optical properties, composites, etc.) in the space environment; Accommodation and/or mitigation of charging/discharging effects on spacecraft and spacecraft components; Methods for performance improvement of radiation tolerance of microelectronics used in space, including reduction of single event upsets and other single particle-induced soft errors, and elimination of single event latch-ups and other single particle-induced destructive conditions; Development of novel methods for increasing crew safety and system performance relative to the effects of the natural space environment; and Development of novel methods of increasing ground-based systems performance and reliability by reducing the effects of the natural space environment on those systems (e.g., space environment-induced soft errors in the power grid).

Examples include global freeze and thaw monitoring, soil moisture mapping, accurate global wind retrieval, and snow inundation mapping, global 3D mapping of rainfall and cloud systems, precise topographic mapping and natural hazard monitoring, global ocean topographic mapping, and glacial ice mapping for climate change studies. For global coverage and the long-term study of Earth's eco-systems, space-based radar is of particular interest to Earth scientists. Radar instruments for Earth science measurements include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), scatterometers, sounders, altimeters, and atmospheric radars. The life-cycle cost of such radar missions has always been driven by the resources-power, mass, size, and data rate-required by the radar instrument, often making radar not cost competitive with other remote sensing instruments. Order-of-magnitude advancement in key sensor components will make the radar instrument more power efficient, much lighter weight, and smaller in stow volume, leading to substantial savings in overall mission life-cycle cost by requiring smaller and less expensive spacecraft buses and launch vehicles.

Some new missions, such as LISA and TPF, require methods of temperature measurement and control to micro-Kelvin levels. Heat flux levels from lasers and other high power devices are increasing with some projected to go as high as 100 W/cm2.

This subtopic seeks proposals that support the development of operational decision support tools that produce information for management or policy decision makers. Proposed applications must use NASA Earth Observations (see http://science.hq.nasa.gov/). Other remote sensing data and geospatial technologies may also be employed in the solution. This subtopic focuses on the systems engineering aspect of application development rather than fundamental research. Offerors are, therefore, expected to have the documented proof-of-concept project in hand. Topics of current interest to the Applied Science Directorate may be found at http://www.asd.ssc.nasa.gov. Innovation in processing techniques, include, but are not limited to, automated feature extraction, data fusion, and parallel and distributed computing which are desired for the purpose of facilitating the use of Earth science data by the nonspecialist. Ease of use, fault tolerance, and statistical rigor and robustness are required for confidence in the product by the nonspecialist end user. Promotion of interoperability is also a goal of the subtopic, so Federal data standards, communication standards, Open Geographic Information Systems (GIS) standards, and industry-standard tools and techniques will be strongly favored over proprietary 'black-box' solutions. Endorsement by the end user of both system requirements and the proposed solution concept is desirable.

The current operations models used for the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, which require large ground teams continuously managing the daily operation of the spacecraft and the activities of the crew, are a major cost driver for these programs. As the human exploration campaign ventures farther into deep space, the communications time delays and longer-duration missions will require greater crew autonomy from Earth-based support. To achieve NASA's exploration goals, technologies are needed that can enable a new paradigm for human space operations. Intelligent Planning and Execution Systems for Crew Autonomy Greater autonomy from Earth-based support implies that crewmembers will need to manage their exploration missions holistically.

Components should be applicable to earth-to-orbit or long-duration in-space transportation systems (both primary propulsion and reaction control systems) for a variety of exploration mission phases, including trans-lunar injection, decent to the lunar surface, ascent to lunar orbit, and return to Earth. System masses will be critical in these far-reaching missions, dictating the use of lightweight components and the use of propellants harvested or manufactured on the surface of the Moon, Mars, or other destinations-an approach known as in situ resource utilization (ISRU). Candidate ISRU propellants include hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, various other hydrocarbons, and compounds derived from these materials. In some scenarios, one propellant may be manufactured in situ while its oxidizer or fuel is brought from Earth. Because the use of ISRU propellants represents a departure from the state-of-the-art and from the existing base of engines and technologies, a new suite of propulsion system and component technologies will be required. These new in-space propulsion systems are expected to encounter conventional challenges such as regulator leakage, valve leakage, valve heating (on pulsing engines), solubility effects (such as combustion instabilities caused by gas bubble evolution in liquid propellants), and propellant acquisition (i.e., extracting gas-free propellant from the tank and delivering it to the engine). In-space chemical propulsion systems that incorporate long-term use of cryogenic propellants such as hydrogen, methane and oxygen present new challenges, including efficient, reliable, and durable propellant cryocooling, storage, acquisition (from tanks), transfer (through feed lines), gauging and flow measurement; however, these particular challenges are addressed by a separate sub-topic, X3.03 Cryo and Thermal Management. Chemical propulsion component technologies that demonstrate improved capabilities using a variety of propellant combinations are of interest, including:Advanced turbopumps with wider throttle range and improved cavitation control, plus specific turbomachinery components such as bearings, turbines, and impellers that demonstrate greater reliability and lifetime; Injectors with low thermal mass and long-duration reliability (e.g. for high duty-cycle attitude control thrusters); Long-life combustion chambers (e.g., based on use of advanced materials); Innovative thruster valve designs that tolerate high thermal loading due to heat soak-back during pulse mode operation; Innovative concepts for fast acting valves to enable use of larger thrusters for small impulses (i.e. spacecraft fine pointing); Highly-reliable long-duration seals; Long-life, high-reliability ignition systems; Lightweight, highly reliable gas compressors for pumping gaseous propellant into pressure vessels either in-flight or on a terrestrial surface; Novel pressurization approaches that minimize dissolution of pressurant gas in storable propellants (e.g., nitrogen tetroxide, hydrazine, and hydrazine derivatives) Novel concepts that increase performance or decrease mass of pressurization systems; Development of advanced materials that exhibit high compatibility with gaseous oxygen; Propulsion components based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology; Advanced nozzle concepts for in-space propulsion systems; Reaction control system thrusters that burn in situ and non-toxic propellants; Innovative thruster designs that minimize or prevent high heat soak-back during pulse mode operation; Highly reliable, lightweight compressors for use in gaseous propellant storage and distribution systems; Advanced lightweight multi-use positive expulsion devices for storable propulsion systems; and Other innovative chemical propulsion system components that improve system safety, affordability, or effectiveness.

High-power (high-thrust) electric propulsion may enable dramatic mass and cost savings for lunar and Mars cargo missions, including Earth escape and near-Earth space maneuvers. At very high power levels, electric propulsion may enable piloted exploration missions as well. Improved performance of propulsion systems that are integrated with associated power and thermal management systems and that exhibit minimal adverse spacecraft-thruster interaction effects are of interest. Innovations are sought that increase system efficiency, increase system and/or component life, increase system and/or component durability, reduce system and/or component mass, reduce system complexity, reduce development issues, or provide other definable benefits.

Exploration Systems,Topic X7 High Energy Space Systems (HESS) ,X7.04Aeroassist Systems, JSC," AFRC, ARC, LaRC","The goal of this subtopic is to develop innovative human-rated aeroassist systems for missions including lunar return to Earth and precursor missions for human Mars exploration. Systems are needed to support the following flight regimes: aerocapture, entry interface to subsonic speeds, and Mach 5 to subsonic speeds. Systems must be capable of controlled flight and be compatible with pinpoint, soft landing systems, which achieve landing accuracies of 10s of meters at touchdown or powered descent initiation. These systems must be compatible with launch vehicles and transit vehicles and capable of safely discarding unneeded and constraining hardware on landing and providing surface access. Technology needs include aeroassist system design, Thermal Protection System (TPS) designs, modeling capabilities, sensor systems, and navigation technologies that support reliable aerocapture or aerobraking of multi-metric-ton-class piloted or cargo spacecraft. In particular, this subtopic seeks innovations in the following areas: Innovative aeroassist system designs. This includes low-mass, rigid aeroassist systems based on robust, high-temperature structures and adhesives, modular or deployable/inflatable aeroshells with large surface area, and inflatable ballutes; TPS designs for human-rated aeroassist vehicles returning to Earth from the Moon and Mars, and for Mars aerocapture and Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL). Innovative TPS concepts are solicited to reduce current TPS mass fractions by 25% to 50% and to reduce TPS costs; Ablative and reusable TPS materials and concepts that significantly enhance performance and reduce mass. This includes development and characterization of single- and multi-use TPS materials, TPS for rigid aeroshells, and flexible TPS materials for deployable aeroshells. Thermo-chemical and mechanical properties data for probabilistic design, spallation characteristics, and accurate simulation tools to predict material behaviors and material compatibility are required. Innovative TPS concepts are solicited to reduce current TPS mass fractions by 25% to 50% and to reduce TPS costs; Aerothermodynamic modeling tools with greater accuracy and less uncertainty: (1) Innovative and accurate computer modeling of fluid structure interactions, including flow stability and surface deflections under dynamic conditions for decelerator deployment and inflation; (2) Modeling and simulation of convection/radiation/ablation coupled three-dimensional flow fields, for both optically thick and thin shock layers and highly ionized flows; (3) Accurate prediction of wake heating including radiative heating components; (4) Accurate prediction of single and multiple rocket plume effects (e.g., reaction control system thrusters) on the vehicle aerodynamics and heating; Innovative sensor systems which are capable of providing real-time or near real-time updates to atmospheric pressure, temperature, density, and winds to support the guidance systems used on aeroassist vehicles; Innovative sensor systems for inflatable aeroassist vehicles capable of providing real time aerosurface temperature, strain, deflection, flight loads and other significant parameters; and Lightweight flexible materials that will reduce the mass and increase the strength and thermal characteristics for applications to deployable aeroshells and supersonic deployed decelerators. Focus should be on aeroassist systems applied to the following mission classes: Earth return of piloted spacecraft from the Moon. Return-to-Earth scenarios for human lunar missions include: (1) short-range direct entry and landing; (2) extended-range entry using a skip out of the atmosphere with subsequent EDL to the Earth's surface; and (3) aerocapture into a low-energy Earth orbit followed by EDL. Inertial arrival speeds of approximately 11 km/s (up to 12 km/s for some abort scenarios) with entry masses of at least 5 metric tons are expected for normal lunar return. Acceptable sustained loads for these piloted missions are limited to about 5 gs perpendicular to the human spine in the ""eye balls in"" direction; and Mars precursor missions for human exploration. These include robotic missions designed to deliver pre-deployed cargo or to conduct technology demonstrations in anticipation of follow-on human Mars missions. Candidate human mission scenarios for Mars include human and cargo aerocapture into a Mars orbit followed by EDL to the Mars surface and return to Earth. Mars aerocapture missions are expected to have arrival speeds of 6 to 8 km/s and aerocapture mass on the order of many 10s of metric tons. Return-to-Earth scenarios for human Mars missions are similar to those for lunar missions, except for higher arrival speeds (11.5 - 12.5 km/s, up to 14 km/s for some off-nominal scenarios).

Exploration Systems,Topic X8 Advanced Space Platforms and Systems ,X8.01Vehicle Health Management Systems, ARC," JSC, MSFC, SSC","In order to meet the automation and autonomy requirements of the Vision for Space Exploration, innovative health management technologies are required throughout the system lifecycle including design, development, test, validation, integration, operation, maintenance, and disposition. Traditional means of supporting vehicle health such as invasive inspections are extremely limited in their utility for exploration missions. Other solutions such as ground-based monitoring of telemetry data become less useful as communication delays or bottlenecks increase. Under these circumstances, autonomous and automated solutions to systems health management provide the best means of increasing crew safety and mission success probability for future space exploration missions. Another significant concern is in mission operations. Operations models that require large numbers of ground controllers and other mission support staff will be cost prohibitive in the future. Future systems must provide appropriate levels of safety and mission success factors while reducing support staff on the ground. In addition, future space missions will have to maintain a healthy balance and seamless transition between crewed and robotic operations. Proposals should be responsive to the overall goals and objectives of the Exploration System-of-Systems as defined in Project Constellation requirements. Proposals may address specific vehicle health management capabilities required for exploration system elements (crewed spacecraft, launch systems, habitats, rovers, etc.). In addition, projects may focus on one or more relevant subsystems such as propulsion, structures, thermal protection systems, power, avionics, life support, and communications. Proposals that involve the use of existing NASA health management test beds (power, propulsion, systems integration, life support, diagnostics, networking, etc.) for technology validation are encouraged. Specific technical areas of interest related to vehicle health management systems include the following:Methods and tools to enable concurrent design of system function and health management systems. These methods and tools should provide a means to optimize health management system design at the functional level to decide on failure detection methods, sensor types and locations, and identify additional functionality to safeguard against failures before costly design decisions have been made; Health monitoring and management technologies to enable situational awareness of system health, safety, and margins. Solutions may include novel approaches to fault detection and isolation, diagnostics, and mitigation of system degradations and failures. Solutions may also include innovative health management system architectures that are robust to single point failures and are scalable, modular, and expandable without costly redesigns; Methods for robust control of critical components, subsystems, and systems and robust execution of critical sequences during flight. Of special interest are robust recovery methods and innovative approaches to functional redundancy for the purpose of enhancing safety, availability, and maintainability; System-of-systems health management concepts to provide robust cooperation of multiple Exploration elements, e.g., spacecraft constellations or rendezvous and docking operations; Prognostic techniques able to anticipate system degradation and enable further improvements in mission success probability, operational effectiveness, human-machine teaming, and automated recovery of function; Real-time data analysis methods for structural sensing, including detection, localization, damage assessment, and automated assessment of thermal protection system integrity; Crew-automation interfaces that are capable of reporting quantitative/qualitative sensor readings, assessing system status, explaining current conditions, predicting likely system behaviors, and proposing corrective actions in a manner that does not exceed the capacity of human understanding, especially in high-risk situations requiring rapid human response. Innovative ways for the health management system to convey a wealth of information quickly and effectively are desired; and End-to-end health management system architectures that are integrated with and validated on spacecraft subsystems on ground-based (or virtual) test beds.

Exploration Systems,Topic X8 Advanced Space Platforms and Systems ,X8.02Intelligent Modular Systems, MSFC," GSFC, JSC","This subtopic will involve development and demonstration of a range of technologies for reconfigurable, intelligent, modular space subsystems, systems, and systems of systems. Technologies should focus on establishing the validity of new approaches to Earth-Moon human and robotic operations, with a view toward longer-term applications for the inner Solar System (e.g., Mars) exploration missions. Many of these future missions, systems, and capabilities imply the need for the development of large and complex systems and infrastructures in space. But, the size-constraints, mass-capability, and cost of launching large monolithic payloads into space limit the development and realization of these capabilities. If a different design approach using intelligent modular systems rather than monolithic payloads is used, these large space systems become more tractable. Also, intelligent modular systems include low system impact of a single launch vehicle loss, since modular systems are launched on multiple vehicles at multiple times. Replacement of modules over the system lifetime is, in many cases, a more reasonable approach to maintaining a system; and, graceful degradation of the system capability can be more readily managed with modular units. Hardware costs of multiple identical units can be reduced through economies of scale, and modular approaches can accommodate cost-phased programs that develop and fly a ""pilot"" system, which can initially prove a capability, and then be added to later as demand for capability increases. Technologies of interest include: Modular Structures (MSFC) Structural technologies of interest include inflatable, erectable, deployable, or easily connected modules to create large space structures. Assembly technology of interest may include approaches for integrating deployable modular units with larger structures such as habitation modules or propellant tanks, and approaches for assembly of erectable modules that form backbones or support trusses. Attachment technologies such as autonomous rendezvous and docking, innovative connectors and joining, bonding techniques, and module positioning and alignment systems are also of interest. Adaptable and Reconfigurable Modular Systems (GSFC) Integrated, reconfigurable modular systems incorporating multiple elements such as solar collection arrays, radiators, power, data, utility lines, science instruments, plug and play avionics, and integrated inspection and verification techniques are solicited, including modular structures using embedded sensors and actuators. Human-Robotic Modular Systems (JSC) Multi-functional robotic hardware and software systems are of interest to aide in surface and in-space operations. Robotic surface operations including exploration, assembly, fabrication, construction and transportation operations are of interest as well as similar systems for in-space operations.

Exploration Systems,Topic X9 Lunar and Planetary Surface Operations ,X9.01In-Situ Resource Utilization & Space Manufacturing, JSC," GRC, KSC, MSFC","The goals of using resources that are available at the site of exploration and pursuing the philosophy of ""living off the land"" instead of bringing it all the way from Earth are to achieve a reduction in launch and delivered mass for exploration missions, a reduction in mission risk and cost, enable new missions not possible without in situ resource utilization (ISRU), and to expanded the human presence in space. Past studies have shown making propellants and other mission critical consumables (life support and power) in situ can significantly reduce mission mass and cost, and also enable new mission concepts (e.g., surface hoppers). Experience with the Mir and International Space Station, and the recent grounding of the Shuttle fleet, have highlighted the need for backup caches or independent life support consumable production capabilities, and a different paradigm for repair of failed hardware from the traditional orbital replacement unit (ORU) spares and replacement approach for future long duration missions. Lastly, for future astronauts to safely stay on the Moon or Mars for extended periods of time, surface construction and utility/infrastructure growth capabilities for items such as radiation protection, power generation, habitation space, and surface mobility will be required or the cost and risk of these missions will be prohibitive. However, before ISRU capabilities are incorporated into mission architectures, Earth and flight demonstrations of critical processes and systems will be required to validate performance goals and increase confidence in mission planners. Proposals for ISRU are requested in four subtopic areas: in situ Resource Extraction and Separation, in situ Resource Processing and Refining, Surface Manufacturing, and Surface Construction. Areas of interest for each of these four subtopic areas are defined below. Acceptable proposals can either address a single subtopic or can include concepts that encompass more then one subtopic into an integrated system. ISRU technologies or processes proposed for this subtopic must be shown to be beneficial compared to bringing everything from Earth. Proposals must also demonstrate an understanding of any past work, competing processes, and the current state-of-the-art with respect to the technology or process being proposed. To distinguish work supported under this subtopic from related work not using in situ resources, successful proposal must show some understanding of the native resource properties and the environmental conditions involved in their use. Proposals that can support future flight demonstrations of ISRU that are scalable to human mission requirements are encouraged, and point of departure mission information is provided below to help provide size and rate parameters for technologies and processes of interest. Proposals that support lunar ISRU applications or both lunar and Mars ISRU applications may be weighted higher then proposals that solely support Mars ISRU applications. In Situ Resource Extraction and Separation In situ Resource Extraction and Separation capabilities include resource characterization, prospecting, excavation, and delivery to resource processing units, and simple extraction and separation of desired resources from the bulk resource (including atmospheres). To be successfully implemented, in situ Resource Extraction and Separation proposals must minimize the mass which must be brought from the Earth, including the mass of the required power system and Earth-supplied processing consumables, and produce 100s of times their own mass of extracted resource in their useful lifetimes. These processes may also be required to operate in extreme temperature and abrasive environments, and in micro-g (asteroids, comets, Mars moons, etc.) or partial-g (e.g., Moon and Mars). In addition, the maintenance, human supervision, crew operation, and crew training required for process operation must be minimal and affordable. Specific areas of interest include:Technologies, processes, and systems for robotic precursor and early human missions to the Moon in the areas of resource characterization, excavation and extraction of lunar resources (especially in the polar regions), and performing initial resource separation and collection of water, regolith volatiles, or feedstock for Surface Manufacturing, Surface Construction, or in situ Resource Processing; Technologies, processes, and systems for robotic precursor missions to Mars in the areas of resource characterization, excavation and extraction of Mars resources, and performing initial resource separation and collection of atmospheric gases, regolith water/volatiles, or feedstock for in situ Resource Processing; and Evaluation of granular physics in low gravity and development of models and its effect on material excavation and handling; and developing dust-insensitive excavation hardware, actuators, and bearings particularly for lunar resource extraction. In Situ Resource Processing and Refining The purpose of this subtopic is to identify and experimentally validate single and multi-step in situ Resource Processing and Refining units that have the potential for achieving the goals for ISRU stated previously. Such processes may include thermal, chemical, and electrical processing of extracted resources into useful products. In situ Processing and Refining includes efficient and economical production of propellants, fuel cell reagents, life support gases and water, manufacturing feedstock (such as silicon, aluminum, iron, and polymers) for use in Surface Manufacturing, and construction feedstock (concrete, wires, trusses, etc.) for use in Surface Construction from resources that have been extracted and separated using processes defined and developed under in situ Resource Excavation and Separation. To be successfully implemented, in situ Resource Processing and Refining proposals must minimize the mass which must be brought from the Earth, including the mass of the required power system and Earth-supplied processing consumables, and produce 100s to 1000s of times their own mass of product in their useful lifetimes. These processes may also be required to operate in extreme temperature and abrasive environments, and micro-g or partial-gravity. In addition, the maintenance, human supervision, crew operation, and crew training required for process operation must be minimal and affordable. Process evaluation metrics include: mass of product made per hour, final mass of product per mass of processor, Watts per mass of product produced per hour, percentage conversion of resources into product in single pass, and mass of Earth consumables used per mass of in situ product made. Specific areas of interest include:Technologies, processes, and systems for robotic precursor and early human missions to the Moon in the areas of processing of lunar resources into oxygen, propellants, and feedstock for in situ manufacturing or surface construction; Technologies, processes, and systems for robotic precursor missions or eventual human missions to Mars, which produce mission critical consumables, such as oxygen, propellants, life support gases, fuel cell reagents, and in situ manufacturing feedstock. Robotic and human missions to Mars that consider initial or evolutionary use of ISRU consumables currently assume the use of liquid oxygen and hydrocarbon fuel (methane, propane, methanol, ethanol, or low freezing point mixtures) propellants for propulsion systems and mobile fuel cell power systems; and Developing and evaluating seals for high temperature multi-temperature and operation cycle regolith processors, water electrolysis and carbon dioxide electrolysis units; developing and evaluating low gas loss regolith inlet and outlet units (seals, augers, hoppers) for regolith processing; and developing and evaluating 0-g water separation, and separation of nitrogen from carbon dioxide are of particular interest for lunar and Mars resource processing. Surface Manufacturing w/In Situ Materials The purpose of the Surface Manufacturing element of the ISRU subtopic is to identify and experimentally validate capabilities that include production of sub-element and replacement components, assembly of complex products, and manufacturing support equipment to ensure parts/products manufactured meet required dimensions and specifications. Surface Manufacturing can use either in situ or Earth-supplied feedstock, however the long-term goal is to exclusively use in situ processed feedstock. Therefore, minimum requirements for process feedstock are advantageous to prevent excessive feedstock processing requirements (i.e., raw aluminum metal vs. specific aluminum alloy characteristics). For in situ manufacturing to be beneficial compared to bringing everything from Earth, some or all of the following attributes are required: ability to create wide variety of shapes and sizes, ability to utilize multiple feedstocks (plastic, metal, and ceramics), produce greater than its own mass of product and the mass of potential Earth supplied spares, operate in partial-g environments, and require a minimum of maintenance, human supervision, crew operation, and crew training. Specific areas of interest include:Additive Manufacturing Techniques; Subtractive Manufacturing Techniques; Formative Manufacturing Techniques; and Part Assembly/Integration. Manufacturing Support Processes Proposals that demonstrate manufacturing flexibility capabilities, such as part size, part complexity, and material feedstock for manufacturing while recognizing the mass, volume, and power limitations of future space habitats and delivery systems are highly encouraged. Surface Construction w/In Situ Materials The purpose of this subtopic is to identify and experimentally validate surface construction techniques that can be applied on the Moon and Mars for future human exploration missions. Early construction capabilities in the form of site preparation and shielding for lander plume debris, meteorites, and solar/galactic radiation can significantly reduce hardware and crew health concerns for missions exceeding several days and returning to the same site of exploration. Also, the ability to construct hardware bunkers, habitats, and power generation, management, and distribution capabilities is essential for mass efficient infrastructure growth on the Moon and Mars. These processes may also be required to operate in extreme temperature and abrasive environments, and micro-g or partial-gravity. Specific areas of interest include:Construction techniques for robotic precursor and early human missions that support site planning and preparation and the use, manipulation, and placement of raw materials and expected feedstock materials from in situ Resource Processing and Refining for lander plume debris, meteorites, and solar/galactic radiation shielding; Construction techniques for robotic precursor and early human missions that support bunker and habitat structure construction using and manipulating raw and expected feedstock; Construction techniques that can be demonstrated on robotic precursor missions that demonstrate dust mitigation concepts for surface mobility around landing pads, habitats, dust-sensitive instruments, and airlocks; and Lunar in situ fabrication techniques that can be demonstrated on robotic precursor missions that enable growth in solar power generation, storage, management, and distribution capabilities using raw materials, expected feedstock. Demonstrations can initially assume use of Earth supplied consumables in small amounts. Point of Departure Mission Information for Proposals For processing concepts that can be used on robotic precursor missions, payload masses (including rovers) are typically below 300 kilograms (kg). Robotic precursor concepts must demonstrate critical functions and must be scalable to human mission needs. Excavation and separation proposals must show supportability to future resource processing needs. Excavation, separation, and processing needs for lunar missions depend on the resource of interest, location, and concentration of the resource and the processing technology considered. Mars sample return missions that incorporate in situ propellant production require atmospheric carbon dioxide collection and possibly atmospheric or regolith water extraction to support the production of 300 kg to 2000 kg of propellant depending on the size of the sample and whether the mission is a Mars orbit rendezvous or direct Earth return mission. Breathing rates for astronauts are approximately 0.07 kg of oxygen (O2)/person/hour in habitats and 0.1 kg O2/person/hour for Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs). Early human lunar mission surface durations may vary from 3 to 45 days and can include from 2 to 6 crewmembers. Lunar human landers require approximately 5000 to 8000 kg of propellant for ascent and approximately 15,000 to 25,000 kg for landing and ascent combined. Mars mission surface durations are 30 to 90 days for opposition class missions and 450 to 600 days for conjunction class missions. Mars human ascent vehicles typically require 20,000 to 30,000 kg of propellant. Fuel cell reagent consumption rates depend on the power required for the application, the reagents, and the fuel cell technology used. EVA suits and small rovers can require 500W to 1 KW of power/hour, unpressurized rovers can require 3 to 6 KW of power/hour and pressurized rovers can require 10 KW/hour and above. Read less>>"

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Prometheus Technologies ,X10.01Long-Life Validation and Flight Qualification of Nuclear Space Systems Hardware Prior to Flight Use, MSFC," GRC, JPL","Nuclear space systems are expected to be an integral part of the national Vision for Space Exploration. Nuclear electric power would allow human and robotic exploration to reach beyond the constraints of solar power systems and is expected to be crucial for long-duration habitation and exploration of the Moon and Mars. Nuclear propulsion systems offer the potential for significantly higher specific impulse and/or significantly higher delta-V than chemical engines, reducing the amount of propellant and associated costs needed to perform a given mission. Nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) systems up to several hundred megawatts and nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) systems from 30 kW to hundreds of kilowatts and more, are being considered for the economical delivery of lunar and Mars cargo, rapid crew transit to Mars, and, in the case of nuclear electric propulsion, robotic exploration of the solar system and beyond. However, the long-duration performance and life testing of these high power nuclear space systems can be very expensive and poses several unique and significant challenges. The intent of this solicitation is to elicit new or significantly improved approaches that accelerate or simplify the long-life validation and flight qualification of high power nuclear space systems hardware. While the testing of nuclear reactors is clearly beyond the scope of this solicitation, proposals are invited for innovative methods that simplify, accelerate, reduce the cost, or otherwise improve upon current techniques to ground test and validate the life and performance of non-reactor high power space nuclear power and propulsion components, subsystems, and systems. Also invited are proposals that address new and innovative approaches to seamlessly integrate high power space nuclear power and propulsion hardware elements into complete systems of systems, with corresponding methods for flight qualification prior to flight use. Sample high power space nuclear power and propulsion areas that could benefit from accelerated or simplified performance and life validation include, but are not limited to: electric power conversion systems for in-space or planetary surface power; electric power management and distribution systems; accelerated testing of pulsed or steady-state high power electric thrusters or thruster arrays under appropriate vacuum and thermal conditions; performance and life testing of component materials and structures under simulated NTP hot hydrogen flows; the simulated operation, shut-down, and restart of NTP system components over simulated mission profiles in relevant vacuum, thermal, and radiation test environments; other space nuclear power and propulsion hardware elements that must operate in extreme environments over extended mission durations; and simplified or accelerated techniques for hardware integration and flight qualification of a complete system of systems prior to flight use. Proposed methods should substantially and demonstrably reduce the time and expense to validate the life and performance of space nuclear power and propulsion technologies compared to state of the art techniques.

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Prometheus Technologies ,X10.02Critical Technologies for In-Space Application of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion, GRC," MSFC, SSC","NASA is interested in the development of critical technologies for first in-space applications of solid core nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) systems for use in a variety of future exploration missions. For short, round trip, human missions to Mars, NTP systems may be enabling. It can potentially also help reduce launch mass or increase payload delivery for cargo and crewed missions to the Moon and other destinations. The first anticipated in-space application of solid core NTP systems could occur in the time frame of 2025 to 2030 and could be based on a high-thrust/high-Isp (~850 - 950s) NTP system that uses a fission reactor with U-235 fuel as its source of thermal energy. During the short primary propulsion maneuvers of a typical conceptual mission, large quantities of thermal power (100s of MWt) would be produced within the NTP system and removed using LH2 propellant that is pumped through the engine's reactor core. The superheated hydrogen gas is then exhausted out the engine's nozzle to generate thrust. Recent NASA studies have shown that small engines (~15-25 klbf), used individually or in clusters, could support a broad range of mission types. Representative ranges of engine performance include: 1) hydrogen exhaust temperatures ~2500-2900 K; 2) propellant flow rates ~7-13 kg/s; 3) chamber pressures ~500 -1500 psi ; and 4) nozzle expansion area ratio ~200:1-500:1.

Anticipated electric power levels range from 30 to 100s of kilowatts for the nearer-term and possibly up to multi-megawatts for the far-term. Fission-based systems are anticipated to enable long duration stays of approximately 45 to 90 days over the lunar night and may have in situ resource utilization applications. Power levels needs are anticipated to be between 30-50 kWe for these early exploration missions. Potential Mars-surface human outpost applications for high-power space nuclear power systems could include habitats, resource processing, propellant production/liquefaction/maintenance, and excavating and mining equipment. These potential Mars surface human mission activities could require power in the 100 kWe range. Also, space nuclear power systems could be needed for robotic outposts as a precursor to human Mars surface exploration with 50-500 day stays. Power levels of about 30-50 kWe may be needed to support these initial robotic outposts and other science applications such as: deep drilling, resource production demonstrations, rovers, weather stations, etc. Potential electric propulsion applications include high power space nuclear power systems for primary electric propulsion, vehicle housekeeping, cryogenic propellant maintenance, orbiting power assets and science payloads. Power levels in the 100-200 kWe range are envisioned for robotic vehicles. Far-term vehicles for human missions may also be needed and could require about 1-2 MWe for high-mass cargo vehicles to the Moon or Mars and the low 10s of MWe for piloted electric propulsion vehicles. Nuclear thermal propulsion systems could also be designed to produce electric power and power levels of about 50 kWe could be needed to meet crew habitat, propellant boil-off, and other spacecraft power requirements. Proposals are sought in the following specific technologies areas:Advanced, high-efficiency, high-temperature high-power conversion >20%, 30-200 kWe for the nearer-term, and up to MWe-unit size for the far-term (with technical issues of scaling to high power unit); Electrical power management, control and distribution in the 1000-5000 V range; Deployment systems/mechanisms and innovative methodologies for surface mobility systems for remote emplacement of power systems and for use of indigenous shielding materials; Material compatibility with local environments; Systems/technologies to mitigate lunar and planetary surface environments including dust accumulation, lunar surface temperature extremes, wind, planetary atmospheres (CO2, corrosive soils, etc.); Power system design considerations for long life (>10 years), autonomous control and operation, including sensor technologies; and Radiation tolerant systems and materials (including lunar, Mars and in-space environments) for robust, long-life operation.In addition to reducing overall system mass, volume and cost, increased safety, and reliability are of extreme importance.

Exploration Systems,Topic X10 Prometheus Technologies ,X10.04Heat Rejection Technologies for Nuclear Systems, GRC," GSFC, JPL, MSFC","NASA is interested in the development of advanced heat rejection subsystems for use with high-power, fission-based power and propulsion systems for a variety of future robotic and manned exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Anticipated electric power levels for these high-power, space nuclear systems could range from 30 to 100s of kilowatts for the nearer-term and possibly up to multi-megawatts (2-20 MWe) for the far-term. Potential applications include in-space transfer vehicles and planetary orbiters, and surface bases with global site capability on the lunar and Mars surface. The heat rejection sub-systems for any of the possible high power space nuclear power plant choices would need to be matched with the thermodynamic cycles of the power plants in a manner that will maximize space nuclear power system performance while keeping heat rejection subsystem and overall power system specific mass (kg/kW) to a minimum. The levels of heat rejection could be from about 100 kilowatts to many megawatts, and the task could be even more challenging by the long life requirements imposed by deep space missions, the extreme radiation environments possibly encountered, and the unique challenges imposed by surface missions including the effect of an atmosphere, elevated sink temperature, and particle contamination. The radiator operating temperature range can vary greatly depending on the mission, but temperatures as low as 400K and in excess of 1000K are possible. Typical heat rejection systems usually include a) a heat transport loop carrying heat to radiator surfaces for rejection to space, and b) a space radiator, which accomplishes the final heat rejection to space by thermal radiation. If the cycle working fluid is different from the radiator heat transport fluid, a ""heat sink"" heat exchanger and a fluid-circulating pump also need to be included in the design. Proposals are sought in the following critical technologies areas:Low areal density heat rejection radiators (2); Innovative heat transfer approaches between heat transport loop and radiating surfaces; Development of light weight, radiation tolerant, thermally stable, high-performance components and pump loop systems including heat pipes and pumps in the low to intermediate temperature ranges (300K to 500K), intermediate temperature ranges (450K to 650K), and intermediate to high temperature ranges (700K to 1000K and higher); Pumped loops that take advantage of the abundance of waste heat and transport some of it to the spacecraft and payload components for thermal management. Waste heat source to spacecraft radiator distances will likely be too large for passive technologies, and pumped loops may offer a possible solution. Since rejection of megawatts of waste heat could require large radiating surfaces, loop heat pipes may provide a lightweight solution to distributing this heat over long distances. Specific areas of interest for this area include: Long term material/working fluid compatibility, lightweight material integration, and working fluid performance for the various temperature ranges; and High temperature, long-life pump technology, single- and two-phase systems, and thermal bus concepts involving multi-evaporators and condensers. High temperature, lightweight heat rejection system materials. Such materials may include those to enable lightweight radiators and heat pipes. Work in this area should address harsh radiation environments, launch/landing loads, and long life issues; Durable low-absorptivity/high-emissivity and variable emissivity coatings for radiating surfaces; Novel and efficient deployment systems/mechanisms for radiators in zero gravity and/or non-zero gravity fields to minimize mass, complexity, and stowed area/volume; Systems and technologies to mitigate adverse effects of planetary surface operating environments, such as cosmic and fission process induced radiation, dust accumulation, wind loading, planetary atmospheric effects due to CO2, and variable sink temperatures; Design considerations for heat rejection subsystems should include long service life (>10 years) and autonomous operation; Development of advanced, high temperature heat pump technologies based upon conventional vapor compression cycles, absorption/adsorption cycles, and advanced thermoelectric and/or thermo-acoustic technologies; Advanced eutectic working fluids capable of extended duration use that would mitigate design issues related to the freezing and subsequent reuse of thermal management coolants; and Alternate cooling technologies for the rejection of waste heat from large capacity planetary or surface nuclear power systems. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, deployable cooling towers and/or optimized radiators.In addition to reducing overall system mass, volume, radiator area, and cost, increased safety and reliability are of prime importance.

Advanced high-power space nuclear power and propulsion systems for robotic and human exploration missions involve a range of specialized materials for the reactor, heat transfer system, energy conversion system, propulsion system, and other nuclear vehicle systems. These materials may include carbon-carbon, super alloys, refractory alloys, structural ceramics, ceramic matrix composites, and other high-temperature space nuclear systems materials. Long-term stability greater than 10 years is critical for long-life space nuclear power system applications. Materials would be subjected to fission process radiation while exposed to in-space (plasma, out-gassing, etc.) and/or planetary operating environments. This subtopic is focused on the development of computational materials science tools to develop and select these specialized space nuclear systems materials. Many considerations go into selection of materials for demanding applications. These include strength, creep resistance, phase stability, oxidation/corrosion resistance, nuclear capture cross-section, and radiation tolerance. In recent years computational materials science has assisted with not only the selection of existing materials with a given set of properties but also with the development of new materials with those properties. These tools include first principles calculations of phase equilibria, computational thermodynamics (the CALPHAD technique), and creep modeling.Proposals are sought for the specific technologies areas:A computational 'toolbox' for material selection with particular emphasis on space nuclear power and propulsion systems requirements; Computational tools to address particular issues in mechanical property degradation in space nuclear power and propulsion systems over long times.

This includes diffusion modeling in alloys; and Computational tools to predict interaction of the radiation environment. This includes effective capture cross-section for complex materials systems and production of secondary energy and potential impact on components.It is anticipated that Phase 1 will focus primarily on the new computational tools for material selection and development with some limited experimental verification. Later phases should involve more extensive verification, to the point where these tools could be readily utilized for the design of space nuclear systems. Read less>>"
Exploration Systems,Topic X11 Human Systems Research and Technology ,X11.01Radiation Health, JSC," ARC, LaRC, MSFC","The goal of the NASA Space Radiation Research Program is to assure that we can safely live and work in the space radiation environment, anywhere, any time. Space radiation is distinct from terrestrial forms of radiation, being comprised of high-energy protons and heavy ions and their secondaries produced in shielding and tissue. The Radiation Program Element uses the NASA Research Announcement as a primary means of soliciting research to reduce the uncertainties in risk projections; however, there are specific areas where the SBIR technologies can potentially contribute to NASA's overall goal: Ground-Based Heavy Ion Accelerator Research Support Equipment NASA utilizes facilities at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to conduct fundamental radiobiology and shielding experiments. However, the facilities at BNL were not developed with NASA's high number of investigators in mind, thus there are areas where technology developments can improve efficiency and throughput. Technologies of specific interest include, but are not limited to, the following:Advanced animal support equipment, sample holders, live imaging of samples on the beam line during heavy ion irradiation, or specimen transport systems that allow remote transport into and out of the target areas, and precise positioning of specimens in the beam line with minimal human interaction in the target areas; Environmental control for cell studies while in the beam line and automated fixation capabilities to perfuse small cell and tissue samples directly after exposure to the ion beam; Controlled beam line access that provides safe, but rapid and reliable human access to the beam target areas and lockout during specimen exposure; and Advanced detector systems to provide rapid assessments of elemental fluence spectra and neutron fluence spectra following heavy ion irradiation of biological or shielding samples. High Throughput Genomic Analysis Techniques Following low-dose irradiation of cells by protons and heavy ions, damage is localized to only a very few cells. The ability to separate cells with or without genetic changes in an automated manner is of interest. Current technologies are inefficient in identifying small-scale genetic changes (less than several thousand base-pairs (Mbp)) under these conditions. Technologies of interest are:Complementary technologies to the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method used to score large scale (>1 Mbp) genetic changes to chromosomes following low dose irradiation in order to rapidly score small-scale genetic changes ( Imaging techniques to rapidly identify with high accuracy undamaged cells from a cell population irradiated at low doses. Radiation Shielding and Fabrication The NASA Space Radiation Research Program uses the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) as the primary means of soliciting research to conceive and radiation-test new radiation shielding materials concepts. The materials concepts include new and innovative lightweight radiation shielding materials to shield humans in crew exploration vehicles, large space structures such as space stations, orbiters, landers, rovers, habitats, and spacesuits. The materials emphasis is on non-parasitic radiation shielding materials, or multifunctional materials, where one of the functions is the radiation shielding, but also serves as structural and other functional components of flight and/or habitat systems. The specific areas in which SBIR-developed technologies can contribute to NASA's overall mission requirements for advanced radiation shielding materials technologies are:Characterization of the physical, chemical and relevant functional properties and the validation and qualification of such multi-functional radiation shielding materials; New and innovative manufacturing techniques for producing quality-controlled advanced radiation shielding products and structural components, including innovative scale-up methods for producing quality-controlled viable quantities of advanced radiation shielding materials; New and innovative processing methods for producing quality-controlled advanced radiation shielding materials of all forms - resins, fibers, fabrics, composites and fiber-reinforced composite materials; New and innovative fabrication techniques for fabricating advanced radiation shielding materials into useful products and structural components; and New and innovative commercialization strategies to introduce advanced radiation shielding materials technologies into the marketplace to enable availability of the technologies for use by NASA and the space exploration community. Reliable Radiation Dosimeters for Manned and Unmanned Spaceflight Current environment dosimeters have exceeded their designed lifetimes and should be replaced. These include small, active dosimeters to monitor individual astronauts' exposure, Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPC), Charged Particle Directional Spectrometer (CPDS) capable of internal and external deployment, and externally deployed electron and neutron detectors. New software needs to be fault tolerant and updated to current operating systems; new hardware and software must be fully documented (schematics, etc.). Areas of interest are:Advanced spaceflight detector systems to provide reliable environment data for a specific spectrum of energies, including: real time dosimetry providing dose and particle types and energies and cumulative dosimeters for characterizing space environments for use onboard spacecraft and planetary surfaces as well as alarm systems for Solar Particle Events; and Microdosimetry for operational and research applications, including implantable dosimeters for biological studies, that translate particle counts into biologically relevant dose or damage.

Exploration Systems,Topic X11 Human Systems Research and Technology ,X11.02Human Health Countermeasures, JSC," ARC, GRC, MSFC","In order for humans to live and function safely and efficiently in space or in the hypogravity of the Moon (1/6g) or Mars (3/8g), a good understanding of the effects of micro- and hypogravity and other factors associated with the space environment on human physiology and human responses to the space and extra planetary environments is required. A variety of countermeasures must be developed to oppose the deleterious changes that occur in space and upon subsequent exposure to other gravitational fields. The ability to monitor the effectiveness of countermeasures and alterations in human physiology during space exploration missions, particularly when several countermeasures are used concurrently, is equally important. This subtopic seeks innovative technologies in several very specific key areas. Since launch costs relate directly to mass and volume, instruments and sensors must be small and lightweight with an emphasis on multi-functional capabilities. Low power consumption is a major factor, as are design enhancements to improve the operation, design reliability, and maintainability of these instruments in the environment of space and on planetary surfaces. As the efficient use of time is extremely important, innovative instrumentation setup, ease of usage, improved astronaut (patient) comfort, noninvasive sensors, and easy-to-read information displays are also very important considerations. Extended shelf life and ambient storage conditions of consumables are also key necessities. Ability to operate in 0g, 1/6g, and 3/8g becomes more important as we march towards human Moon and Mars missions. Exercise and Related Hardware Development of an immersive visual display system is required to be interfaced with treadmill exercise devices. This system may not be head-mounted but could be free standing and provide at least a 180° field of view. This visual display would allow visual flow patterns to be displayed to a non-encumbered subject during in-flight or on-surface treadmill exercise. In addition, miniaturized exercise hardware (treadmill or resistance exercise); physiological monitoring devices; and metabolic gas (carbon dioxide and oxygen) analysis systems for use with exercise and miniaturized interactive feedback and entertainment systems. A tool or toolkit should simulate and visualize the exercise device design and performance. A comprehensive, scaled 3D/virtual human model interface would be valuable to show biomechanical and kinetic effects of the exercise device. Relative physiological data from anthropometry to stress/fatigue to trauma/insult onset should be targeted. If in-flight/on-orbit micro gravitational and planetary surface gravitational forces can be simulated, this could help produce germane simulations with which to implement new designs and products. A time-delay algorithm would be advantageous in helping provide for latency-moderated haptics (force-feedback) and long-distance teleoperative control. This will allow remote teleoperation with force-feedback despite the high latencies involved. Noninvasive Pharmacotherapy and Monitoring Development of innovative technologies resulting in noninvasive methods for diagnosis, treatment, and therapeutic drug monitoring is needed to facilitate effective pharmacotherapy of humans in space. Many questions remain about the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in micro- and hypo-gravity environments, which may interfere with their activity by sensitizing or desensitizing the crewmember or interfering in other ways with the desired physiological effect. Micro-encapsulation of drugs, radio contrast agents, crystals, and development of novel drug delivery systems wherein immiscible liquid interactions, electrostatic coating methods, and drug release kinetics from microcapsules or liposomes can be altered under microgravity. Devices for continual monitoring of physiology during pharmacotherapy would also be advantageous to ensure that on-orbit expression of therapies relates to on-Earth histories. Device for Providing Increased Neuromuscular Activation during Spaceflight Astronauts returning from spaceflight exhibit post-flight postural and gait instabilities that are a result of neural adaptation to microgravity. A small, lightweight countermeasure device is required to stimulate somatosensory receptors on the plantar surface of the feet during in-flight exercise with the goal of increasing neuromuscular activation and enhancing sensorimotor integration. This system would integrate with in-flight exercise hardware and coupled with visual stimulation systems would allow a more complete sense of immersion to enhance in-flight postural and locomotor training. Device for Measuring Body Fluid Shift A body impedance device to measure fluid shifts in four segments of the body associated with a short-radius centrifuge. The device should measure the following parameters, namely, resistance, change in resistance and rate of change of resistance and reactance. The device should withstand g forces (5g) produced by centrifugation and meet safety standards such as subject isolation. MEMS-Based Human Blood Cell Analyzer Development of a small, automated and micro- and hypo-gravity capable instrument that will analyze micro liter quantity of human whole blood and provide a complete blood cell count (RBC, WBC, platelet, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, WBC differential, and calculated RBC indices) that correlates with traditional ground-based impedance or light-scattering technologies is needed. Likely devices based on MEMS will employ a biocompatible combination of micro fluidics, micromechanics, micro-optics, microelectronics, and data telemetry capabilities in an integrated handheld package with a user-friendly operator interface. Cell/Tissue Analog Studies Cell/Tissue analog studies in ground-based, microgravity-analog bioreactors allow us to understand the ill-effects of microgravity and radiation on human tissues-especially, bone, muscle, and cardiac and immune response. Technologies that allow automated biosampling, lyophilization of mammalian cells, miniaturized protein microarray analyzer, tools derived from Bionanotechnology relevant to the understanding are of interest.

Exploration Systems,Topic X11 Human Systems Research and Technology ,X11.03Autonomous Medical Care, JSC," ARC, GRC","Exploration missions require a healthy, well-performing crew supported by a robust infrastructure for the monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. Since return time to Earth and communications delays during such missions will greatly reduce the effectiveness of Earth-involvement, the crew must be capable of performing the majority of medical activities independently. Therefore, this system of autonomous medical care must provide the capability for patient care as well as measure and assess fitness levels for duty during a mission with little or no real-time support from Earth. The objective of this subtopic is to sponsor applied research leading to the development of such an infrastructure with the associated medical devices and procedures that will mitigate crew health, safety, and performance risks during future flight missions to the Moon and Mars. Medical diagnostic, treatment, and monitoring devices are critical for providing health care and medical intervention during missions, particularly extended-duration spaceflight to the Moon and Mars. Of particular interest are devices with minimized mass, volume, consumables, and power consumption that are capable of multiple functions in both micro-g and sub-g environments. Design enhancements that improve the operation, reliability, flexibility, and maintainability of medical devices in the space environment are also sought. Additional considerations include innovative approaches to human-device interactivity and interface, automation of device functions, improved ease of use, and astronaut comfort. Device for Body Chemistry Assessment Development of an integrated, adaptable laboratory analysis system/sensor system for in-flight assessment of body fluids (including blood) and solids is desired. This system would be used to obtain quantitative measurement of dissolved gases, calcium ions, and other electrolytes, proteins, lipids, hormones, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and clinical drug levels with minimal or no consumables usage or specimen preparation skill. Likely candidates will be based on MEMS technology and will employ a biocompatible combination of micro fluidics, micromechanics, micro-optics, microelectronics, and data telemetry capabilities in an integrated handheld package with a user-friendly operator interface. Voice- and Gesture-Actuated Interactive Procedures Astronauts working in space or on the lunar or Martian surface will require a hands-free, interactive, step-by-step environment for performing flight medical procedures. This system should have the capability to utilize links, prepare textual or graphical indication of progress through a procedure, return to previous steps, page forward/page backward, and automatically annotate verbal input relative to subject response during procedure or treatment. An inventory capability must exist for obtaining and stowing required items (including medications) as well as a mechanism to assess the resulting consumables status after a procedure has been completed. Ground-monitoring capability is also required, at least in the early stages. Closed Loop Medical Respirator A closed loop flight and human certified medical respirator with real-time remote monitoring and remote control capability is required. This respirator must incorporate a function to limit the amount of O2 leaking into the space vehicle or surface habitat. Current O2 limits range from ~20/21% at sea level with maximum levels of 30% in a 10.2 psi environment. (This upper limit mitigates flammability concerns and is dictated by ambient pressure.) The system should incorporate real-time remote monitoring and control capabilities. Medical Grade Water Generation Methods and technologies for in-flight creation of medical grade water from any available water source are required. Because some pharmacological preparations appear to degrade in the space environment, it is highly desirable, from both a consumables perspective as well as from the standpoint of mass, to fly desiccated pharmacological substrates whenever possible and to reconstitute them only when needed. For this reason, medical grade water is required along with a low-g (e.g., 0 g, 1/3 g, and 1/6 g) system to deliver generated water to the substrate and mix as necessary. The general requirements of low mass, user-friendly interface, reliability, and automation are critical to this system. There should be a mechanism included to verify that the water produced meets standard requirements for the medical grade designator. Diagnostic Imaging Capability During long duration flights, it will be important to have medical imaging capability available to assist in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring during and after medical events. This capability is likely to be an ultrasonic, low power, portable device that provides for diagnostic assistance via data processing algorithms. These algorithms would be expected to provide guidance for the crewmember administering the exam as well as identifying probable diagnoses options and possible treatments for each. The system should be flexible enough to provide fracture analysis, bone density levels, and body cavity status. In-Flight Suction Long duration missions must have the capability to provide medical suction for patients in the event of injury or serious illness. This system must be capable of providing suction for a variety of body orientations in multiple reduced gravity environments. It should be a stand-alone system that does not require oversight by another crewmember. In the event of malfunction, it should provide an audio alert, a display of the malfunction type, plus a safing algorithm. The contents of the suction system must be easily disposed of safely and without release of contents into the environment. Biomedical Signal Processing Assessment of an ill or injured crewmember may sometimes be accomplished in large part by the status of the biomedical signal, or EKG. This will have to be a ""smart"" system, which analyzes sensor placement, sensor health, signal monitoring, signal normalcy, and signal analysis. It is required that the biomedical signal be capable of monitoring cardiac health and physiological state. The processor must be fail-safe and must annunciate an audible alarm when a malfunction occurs. A display should provide a readout of the anomaly type and the system must safe itself when malfunctions occur. (NOTE: There may be a subset of malfunctions {e.g., loose lead} that will not require a shut-off or self-safing function.) The system must be volumetrically small with minimal mass. Intelligent Software Modules Software modules with the capability to review medical data in a SQL compliant database, assign or suggest appropriate SNOMED CT codes, and store the suggested codes in electronic format with discrete elements is highly desirable to avoid having to train hierarchical nomenclature to crewmembers. The hierarchical relationships between SNOMED codes should be maintained and stored in the output. Read less>>"

Exploration Systems,Topic X12 Life Support and Habitation ,X12.03Contingency Response Technologies, GRC," JSC, MSFC","Decades of experience in manned space flight have demonstrated that during any mission, unexpected events will occur. If the crew is adequately equipped to address such contingencies during exploration missions, the chances of successfully completing that mission can be greatly increased. The objective of this subtopic is to develop technologies in the areas of fire prevention, detection, and suppression (FPDS) and in situ fabrication and repair (ISFAR) that will support the crew in the event of a fire or if a critical component breaks during a mission, respectively. These technologies may be in the form of devices, models, and/or instruments for use in microgravity and/or for commercial applications on Earth. The top-level requirements for a viable technology include the reduction of system hardware weight and volume and increased hardware reliability, durability, and operating lifetime. Research conducted during the Phase 1 contract should focus on demonstrating the technical feasibility of the FPDS or ISFAR protocol/system and show a path toward a Phase 2-specific deliverable. The contractor will, when appropriate, deliver a demonstration unit of the instrumentation for NASA testing before the completion of the Phase 2 contract. Fire Prevention, Detection, and Suppression The objective of the Fire Prevention, Detection, and Suppression (FPDS) subtopic is to develop technologies that, when incorporated into the design philosophy and functional design of exploration vehicles and habitats, will quantitatively reduce the likelihood of a fire and reduce the impact to the mission should a fire occur. The element is composed of four major theme areas including: fire prevention and material flammability, fire signatures and detection, fire suppression and response, and analysis of fire scenarios. Innovations are sought in the following theme areas:Quantifying the effects of microgravity, 1/6-g (lunar) and 1/3-g (Martian) on the ignitability of materials and the subsequent flame spread, particularly related to determining relevant low-gravity behavior from normal gravity tests; Improving the performance of spacecraft fire safety systems through the development of advanced fire detection and suppression systems and strategies as well as predicting the effects of smoke and precursor generation and transport; and Developing techniques for creating and analyzing the effectiveness of fire resistant materials and coatings, including fire prevention techniques, for spacecraft structures, radiation shielding materials, paneling, fabrics (cotton, paper, synthetics), foams, etc. In Situ Fabrication and Repair In Situ Fabrication and Repair develops technologies for life support system maintenance and integrated habitat radiation shielding fabrication with a focus on contingency response and maximization of in situ resource utilization to reduce launch mass and volume. The manufacture or repair of components during a mission is essential to human exploration and development of space. Fabrication and repair beyond low Earth orbit is required to reduce resource requirements, spare parts inventory, and to enhance mission security.

There is a need for new control algorithms, analyses, design methodologies, strategies, and techniques to provide this capability; Ontologies for integrated operations - human exploration missions involve hundreds of systems developed by dozens of organizations. To develop software that can integrate across these systems and integrate with operations requires the use of common terminology across multiple disciplines. A common ontology must be developed to enable the integration of control of advanced life support systems; and Development and integration of autonomous system and inter-system control with crew and ground operations - there is a need for tools, architectures, and technologies that can support the integration of operations between crew, ground operators, ground applications, and on-board applications.
